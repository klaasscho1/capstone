 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT  \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION    In general terms, this application for determination of native title concerns an area of \napproximately 13,600 square km, taking in land and waters situated between the towns of Wiluna in the north and \nLeonora in the south. The west of the claim area extends over Booylgoo Range and part of Montague Range, and \nthe east of the claim area extends over Mount Keith and Mount Sir Samuel. The title given to the claim \u2013 Tjiwarl \u2013 is \nthe name of a spring located in the eastern part of the claim area.  The application is brought on behalf of a group of \nWestern Desert people, who claim through 11 identified apical ancestors.  The connection issues which arise in this \ncase concern whether the claim area was Western Desert country at sovereignty and, if so, whether the ancestors \nof the claim group members acquired rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area in accordance \nwith Western Desert traditional laws and customs.  I have concluded that there should be a determination of native \ntitle in favour of the applicant, subject to my findings on extinguishment and s 47B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) \n(NT Act).  I note at the outset that the applicant is required to prove their case on all issues on the balance of \nprobabilities. That includes on connection issues. A proceeding such as this illustrates the importance of recalling \nthe difference between a court deciding, in an exercise of judicial power, that on the balance of probabilities certain \nevents in the past did or did not occur, or certain circumstances did or did not exist, and a decision attended by \nsome more absolute form of certainty which purports to declare absolutely that history ran its course in a particular \nway.  It is also convenient to note at the start of these reasons that the evidence in this proceeding is, to say the \nleast, considerable. I do not refer to all of it in my reasons. There is a need, indeed a requirement, in my opinion, to \nstrike a balance between the length and complexity of the evidence and submissions in a claim such as this and the \nneed for the Court\u2019s reasons to remain accessible and understandable. Over the last decade, several High Court \njudges have discussed the functions of judicial reasons, which include giving effect to the \u201copen court principle\u201d by \nallowing public scrutiny of judicial decision-making (see Wainohu v New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 \nat [58] (French CJ and Kiefel J)), promoting sound and reasonable judicial decision-making through scrutiny and \naccountability, and giving effect to the court\u2019s institutional responsibility to the public: AK v Western Australia [2008] \nHCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [89] (Heydon J). Pursuing those objectives in reasons for the determination of native title \ncan be challenging. These reasons represent my findings of fact and law based on all the evidence, and I have \nidentified in these reasons the key submissions and evidence which have been material to the conclusions I have \nreached. Where I have rejected particular evidence, I say so expressly.\n\nTERMINOLOGY USED IN THESE REASONS    The parties both used the term \u201cWestern Desert Cultural Bloc\u201d to \ndescribe an area and groups of people who observed traditional laws and customs associated with the Western \nDesert region. The term seems to be traced to the work of Professor Ronald Berndt and what has become known \nas the \u201cBerndt line\u201d, on which considerable argument turned in this proceeding. It is a term I prefer not to use. I will \nrefer to relevant groups as Western Desert people or non-Western Desert people, otherwise by reference to their \ntraditional group names, where those exist. I will refer to relevant areas as Western Desert or non-Western Desert \ncountry.  These reasons deal with two related proceedings: WAD 228 of 2011 and WAD 302 of 2015, which I will \nrefer to as \u201cTjiwarl #1\u201d and \u201cTjiwarl #2\u201d respectively. Tjiwarl #1 was commenced by the filing of a native title \ndetermination application on 17 June 2011. Tjiwarl #2 was commenced by the filing of a native title determination \napplication on 22 June 2015. I set out the procedural background to Tjiwarl #1, which is the principal application, at \n[39] below, and I address Tjiwarl #2 at [45] below. For the reasons I set out at [45]-[47] below, Tjiwarl #2 is an \namplification of Tjiwarl #1, by reference to the application of s 47B of the NT Act. I have elected to use the singular \nword \u201cproceeding\u201d in these reasons when referring to Tjiwarl #1 and Tjiwarl #2.  When I use the term \u201capplicant\u201d in \nthese reasons, I refer to the persons who are authorised to be, jointly, the \u201capplicant\u201d for the purposes of s 61(2) of \nthe NT Act (unless the context indicates that another meaning is intended). Therefore, I use the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d for \nthe applicant. When I use the terms \u201cclaim group\u201d or \u201cclaim group members\u201d, I refer to the members of the native \ntitle claim group who authorised the making of the native title determination applications for the purposes of s 61(1) \nof the NT Act. I also use \u201cclaimant witnesses\u201d to refer to those persons in the native title claim group who gave \nevidence in this proceeding. When I use the term \u201capical ancestors\u201d, I refer to the persons specified in the native \ntitle determination application in Tjiwarl #1 whose \u201cbirth, or long association with the area covered by the \napplication\u201d forms the basis of the claim to country of the claim group members, who are the descendants of those \nancestors.  There was a concession by the State in this case about the perpetuation, substantively unchanged, of \nthe circumstances of Aboriginal people living in the claim area from the date of sovereignty in Western Australia \n(1829) until approximately 1912. A concession of that kind has occurred in other cases and enables the Court to \ntreat the later date as the relevant one for the purposes of ascertaining the nature and extent of rights and interests \n\n\n\nin land held by Aboriginal people in occupation of the claim area at that time. See, for example, the observations of \nDowsett J in Western Australia v Willis [2015] FCAFC 186; 239 FCR 175 (Pilki) at [2]:In the present case, \nsovereignty was claimed in 1829. However, as in many other such cases, there was little or no contact between \nindigenous and non-indigenous persons for many years thereafter. Hence it can be inferred that there was little \nchange in the relevant indigenous society until more intense contact occurred. This case has proceeded on the \nbasis that such contact occurred in the early 1900s.  Although, therefore, the Court proceeds by way of inference in \nrelation to the factual circumstances obtaining in 1829 and those obtaining around (in this case) 1912, I shall \nnevertheless use the term \u201csovereignty\u201d as encompassing that inference and meaning around 1912 in this case.  \nThroughout the on country hearing, the applicant\u2019s counsel indicated that the witnesses preferred to be addressed \nby their first names, and that form of address was adopted. However, in these reasons, I return to a more formal \nstyle of referring to people by their surnames.  Save as to some issues on extinguishment, the only active \nrespondent was the State of Western Australia. The remaining respondents adopted the State\u2019s position and \nsubmissions on connection and took no active part in that aspect of the proceeding. Several did make separate \nsubmissions on extinguishment issues. I will refer to \u201cthe State\u201d when I am dealing with connection issues. When I \nam dealing with extinguishment issues, and where necessary, I refer to the other respondents by name.\n\nA note on spellings and names    Throughout these reasons I use \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d as spelt by the applicant in their \nsubmissions. Daisy Bates, the woman whose records from the early twentieth century feature so heavily in this \nclaim, spelled the term \u201cNgaiuwonga\u201d. There are various other spellings, but I have elected to use the one chosen \nby the applicant.  Some of the ethnographic and anthropological material uses names for people and languages \nthat are similar, but not the same, as those used by claimant witnesses. For example, the anthropologist Ken \nLiberman, who worked in the area in the 1970s, used the term \u201cTjupany\u201d because that is what he understood his \ninformants to use, whereas the claimant witnesses in this proceeding used \u201cTjupan\u201d.  Where appropriate, I have \nattempted to retain the name, or label, as used by the witness or source. All these labels are, as Dr Clendon (the \nanthropological linguist called by the applicant in this proceeding) observed, ephemeral: that is their nature.\n\nTranscript misspellings    Although the transcript of the on country evidence is highly accurate in terms of the use \nand spelling of the large number of group and language names used in this proceeding, the same cannot be said of \nthe transcript of the expert evidence, nor of submissions. This has made the transcript difficult to follow and use. \nWhere it is reasonably obvious what the misspelled word should be (for example, Dupon (incorrect) for Tjupan \n(correct)) I have not made any specific reference to the misspelling. Where the misspelling is less obvious (for \nexample, Gulara (incorrect) for Kurrawa (correct)), I have made a specific reference to the misspelling, so that the \nway I have interpreted the transcript is clear.\nTHE MAIN ISSUES IN THIS PROCEEDING  \n\nConnection    The connection issues in this case are particular, and can be approached by considering four sets of \npropositions.  First, the claim group members are Western Desert people \u2013 the State accepts this. Their traditional \nlaws and customs are Western Desert traditional laws and customs \u2013 the State accepts this as well. Further, it is \ncommon ground that, at sovereignty, Western Desert people comprised a \u201csociety\u201d \u2013 as that term was used in \nMembers of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58; 214 CLR 422 \u2013 which had certain \nshared customary, legal, linguistic and cultural features. It is also common ground that Western Desert society has \ncontinued to exist, and Western Desert people continue to be united by their shared observance of traditional laws \nand customs in relation to, amongst other things, land and waters. Within that broad society exist subgroups with \nintramurally recognised rights and interests over particular areas of land and waters. That intramural recognition \ndoes not affect the observance by the broader group of Western Desert people (or \u201csociety\u201d) of substantively the \nsame traditional laws and customs. One of the critical aspects of Western Desert traditional laws and customs for \nthe purposes of this proceeding is that individuals, families, or groups may move from one part of Western Desert \ncountry to another and may potentially obtain rights and interests in relation to the country to which they move.  \nSecond, there were Aboriginal people in occupation of the claim area at sovereignty. They, or their descendants, \nremained in occupation when non-Aboriginal people took up a regular presence in the claim area, which appears to \nhave been from the early 1890s. The laws and customs of those Aboriginal people remained essentially the same \nfrom 1829 to the 1890s. The State extends a concession about this status quo further forward in time, to \napproximately 1912. The State contends these people (which the State calls the \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d) were not Western \n\n\n\nDesert people. The applicant (who, with reservations, adopted the term \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d as well) contends they were \nWestern Desert people, and that the ancestors of the claim group members moved into, and acquired rights and \ninterests in, the claim area in accordance with Western Desert traditional laws and customs. It was, the applicant \ncontends, a movement of Western Desert people within geographical areas governed by, and in accordance with, \ntheir traditional laws and customs.  In their statement of issues, facts and contentions, filed prior to the \ncommencement of the hearing, the applicant said:Nevertheless, the influx of non-Aboriginal people into the Claimed \nArea in the late 19thcentury and early 20th century:\n\n (a) materially affected the access by the Aboriginal occupants of the Claimed Area to traditional water and food \nsources;\n\n (b) resulted in the spread of diseases to the Aboriginal occupants of the Claimed Area; and\n\n (c) resulted in conflict between non-Aboriginal people and the Aboriginal occupants of the Claimed Area, and/or \nbetween Aboriginal people in occupation of the Claimed Area and other Aboriginal people.\n\n The matters referred to in [the paragraph above] contributed to a situation where, by the early 20th century, those \nAboriginal people who were in occupation of the Claimed Area at sovereignty, and the biological descendents of the \nAboriginal people in occupation of the Claimed Area at sovereignty, died or moved away from the Claimed Area.  It \nshould be noted here that, in final submissions, the applicant was less absolute in submitting that all the original \nAboriginal occupants of the claim area had either died out or left by or shortly after 1912. The applicant adopted a \nmore nuanced position in final submissions which, as I develop below, is a position I accept.  Third, the applicant \naccepts that if the claim area was not part of the \u201cWestern Desert cultural bloc\u201d (or, as I prefer to express it, was \nnot part of Western Desert country) at sovereignty, then the claim group cannot have a connection to the claim \narea now by or through traditional laws and customs, because the claim group members are Western Desert \npeople and their laws and customs are Western Desert laws and customs.  Fourth, it is common ground that most \u2013 \nand the State submits all \u2013 of the apical ancestors of the claim group members were born outside the claim area, \ngenerally to the east. It is this feature of the evidence which gives rise to what the State describes as the \u201cmigration\u201d \nissue in this proceeding. Nevertheless, there is a complicated factual matrix concerning where the claim group \nmembers\u2019 apical ancestors were born and lived, and what (if any) relationships they had with the Aboriginal people \noccupying the claim area at times between the late 1800s and approximately 1912. The State contends that, even if \nthe Court rejects its submission that the claim area was occupied by non-Western Desert people at sovereignty, the \napplicant has not proven that, when the ancestors of the claim group migrated to the claim area, they acquired \nrights to the land in the claim area in accordance with Western Desert traditional laws and customs.  In my opinion, \nfrom these four sets of propositions, two lines of inquiry emerge. These are the lines of inquiry that I consider arise \non the evidence and submissions; they may not dovetail exactly with the sequence of the parties\u2019 submissions, but \nI am satisfied they reflect the substance of those submissions.  The two lines of inquiry are:(1) Who were the people \noccupying the claim area at sovereignty (that is, up until approximately 1912) and what happened to them after \napproximately 1912?\n\n (2) When did the claim group members\u2019 ancestors move into the claim area, what was their relationship before that \ntime to the claim area and to the Aboriginal people who held rights and interests in the claim area when the claim \ngroup members\u2019 ancestors came to occupy and use the land?  The connection evidence and arguments should be \nassessed with a view to answering these two lines of enquiry. If these questions are answered favourably to the \napplicant, then the third question will be whether the applicant has proven the other matters required by s 223(1) of \nthe NT Act, namely the content of the traditional laws and customs observed by the claim group members, whether \nby those laws and customs the claim group members have a connection with the claim area, and whether that \nnormative system has continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty.\nConclusions on the two broad inquiries and other connection issues  \n\nSummary of my conclusions on who the people occupying the claim area at sovereignty were and what happened \nto them  I have found that the claim area was occupied at sovereignty by Western Desert people. I have found it is \n\n\n\nmore likely than not that the land and waters of the claim area are, and always have been, Western Desert \ncountry. It is more likely than not that the people Daisy Bates called the \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d were Western Desert \npeople. In my opinion, it is impossible to say with any confidence that \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d is an accurate label to apply to \nthe people who had rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area at sovereignty.  I have found it is \nunlikely that, as the State contends, none of the original inhabitants were in the claim area in the early twentieth \ncentury. I have concluded that some of the original inhabitants of the claim area were still occupying the claim area \nwhen the claim group members\u2019 ancestors came into the country on a more permanent basis, and the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors had, or established, relationships with those people.\n\nSummary of my conclusions about when the claim group members\u2019 ancestors moved into the claim area, and what \ntheir relationship was to the claim area and the Aboriginal people who previously occupied the claim area  The \nevidence in this proceeding suggests that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors entered the claim area at various \ntimes, and had varying degrees of connection and contact with the Aboriginal people who occupied the claim area \nbefore sovereignty. I have concluded that at least some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors knew and \ninteracted with the Aboriginal people who were in occupation of the claim area at sovereignty, and were themselves \nin and around the claim area at or before that time. It is more likely than not that some of the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors had, and were exercising, rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area before Daisy Bates \nundertook her work to the north of the claim area. I have found that the original occupants of the claim area \nrecognised the claim group members\u2019 ancestors as Western Desert people entitled to acquire and exercise rights \nand interests in the country of the claim area in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs, and shared \nwith them knowledge of the Tjukurrpa for the claim area.\n\nSummary of my conclusions on the remainder of the s 223(1) connection issues  I have concluded that the \ntraditional laws and customs of the claim group which relate to the acquisition, transmission and exercise of rights \nand interests in land and waters have been continuously recognised and observed by the claim group and their \nancestors in substantially the same form since sovereignty. I have found that there have been some adaptations of \nthe traditional laws and customs of the claim group, but that these adaptations are within existing legal principles \nand do not reflect a lack of continuity with the normative system which existed at sovereignty.  I have concluded \nthat the claim group members have established the existence at sovereignty and the continuous acknowledgment \nand observance of the following rights and interests in the claim area, in accordance with traditional Western Desert \nlaws and customs:(a) the right to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the claim area, to the exclusion of all others;\n\n (b) the right to access, remain in, and use the claim area for any purpose;\n\n (c) the right to access and take resources for any purpose, including commercial purposes;\n\n (d) the right to engage in spiritual and cultural activities in the claim area;\n\n (e) the right to maintain and protect places and objects of significance; and\n\n (f) the right to receive a portion of any traditional resources (not including minerals or petroleum) taken from land or \nwaters by Aboriginal people who are also governed by Western Desert law.  I have found that the applicant has not \nestablished the existence at sovereignty and the continuous acknowledgment and observance of:(a) The right to \nmake decisions about the use and enjoyment of the land and waters in the claim area by other Western Desert \npeople; and\n\n (b) A separate right to \u201cprotect resources and the habitat of living resources\u201d in the claim area.\nConclusions on extinguishment    The parties agreed there had been partial extinguishment of native title over the \nwhole of the claim area. Accordingly, subject to the Court\u2019s findings on s 47B of the NT Act, the parties agreed that \nthe right of exclusive possession had been extinguished. The remainder of the extinguishment issues concern the \nparcels of land in the claim area where non-exclusive native title rights may still survive. Most of the tenure and \nextinguishment issues were agreed between the parties before trial.  Four main issues remain in dispute regarding \n\n\n\nextinguishment. They are:(a) Whether the renewals on 1 July 2015 of the pastoral leases that fall wholly or partially \nwithin the claim area are valid future acts; \n\n (b) Whether two miscellaneous licences (L53/161 and L53/177) were validly granted; \n\n (c) Whether seven specified miscellaneous licences are valid future acts; and\n\n (d) Whether s 47B of the NT Act applies to disregard extinguishment in specified areas of the claim area.  \nDetermining the first three questions requires answering, among other things, the question whether compliance with \napplicable procedural requirements in Pt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act is a precondition to a future act having force and \neffect against native title.  On the first three matters, I have reached the following conclusions:(a) Non-compliance \nwith the procedural provisions deprives a future act of validity in the sense of having full force and effect against \nnative title interests. I have not adopted the obiter statements of the Full Court in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland \n[2001] FCA 414; 108 FCR 453;\n\n (b) The renewals of the pastoral leases on 1 July 2015 were valid future acts and each of the leases will be given \nthe full force and effect against the applicant\u2019s native title;\n\n (c) The grants of the miscellaneous licences L53/161 and L53/177 were invalid and have no force or effect in \nrelation to the applicant\u2019s native title;\n\n (d) In regard to the other seven specified miscellaneous licences, two are agreed to have been withdrawn and \nshould not be listed on any determination as \u201cother interests\u201d. In relation to L36/129, this is now \u201cdead\u201d, but in any \nevent I concluded that it satisfies either s 24IB(a) or (b) of the NT Act and, accordingly, the grant had full force and \neffect in respect of the applicant\u2019s native title. I have concluded that the grants of the licences L36/144, L36/148 and \nL36/152 were invalid because the procedural requirements under either s 24MD(6B) or 24MD(6A) of the NT Act \napplied to these licences and were not complied with. Accordingly, I have concluded that these three licences are \ninvalid future acts. Finally, in relation to L53/109, I have concluded, as the State appeared to accept, that it was \ngranted without reference to Pt 2 Div 3 and, as such, is an invalid future act. Each of the licences I have found to be \ninvalid future acts has no force or effect in relation to the applicant\u2019s native title.  The parties divided the parts of the \nclaim area to which claims under s 47B attach into eight groups, some of which include more than one parcel of \nUnallocated Crown Land (UCL): UCL 239, UCL 245 and UCL 246; UCL 14 and UCL 15; UCL 247; UCL 11; UCL 4, \nUCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10; UCL 8; UCL 240; and Road 13. I have found that s 47B(2) is not applicable to Road 13. \nIn relation to the seven other areas, I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration licences which cover \nthese areas render inapplicable the terms of s 47B. However, I have concluded that the applicant has only proved \noccupation of two UCL parcels: UCL 245 and UCL 246. In relation to these two UCL parcels, s 47B of the NT Act \napplies to disregard extinguishment. I have allowed the parties a further opportunity for submissions on the \napplication of s 47B(2) to UCL 11.\nTHE APPLICATIONS  \n\nTjiwarl #1    Tjiwarl #1 is the principal application for a determination of native title over the claim area. I deal with \nTjiwarl #2 at [45] below.  The authorisation of the claim was referred to a meeting of the wati (initiated men) in \naccordance with traditional decision-making processes after the wider community could not reach consensus on \ncertain issues (the claim name and the persons comprising the applicant). The meeting of the wati was held in \nSeptember 2010. After the outcomes of that meeting were conveyed to the community, the authorisation meeting \n(for the purposes of s 251B of the NT Act) was held on 29 March 2011. The applicant filed the native title \ndetermination application on 17 June 2011. The claim was accepted for registration by the Native Title Registrar on \n13 January 2012. There is no dispute that the Tjiwarl #1 claim was properly authorised within the meaning of s 61 of \nthe NT Act.  At a case management hearing on 12 April 2012, orders were made by McKerracher J referring the \napplication to mediation either by the National Native Title Tribunal or a Registrar of the Federal Court and requiring \nthe parties to inform the Court of their preferred mediator by 20 June 2012. As the parties did not comply with that \n\n\n\norder, Barker J made a further order (administratively) on 29 June 2012, listing a case management hearing on a \ndate to be fixed.  At the next case management hearing on 2 August 2012, Barker J vacated the mediation orders \nof 12 April 2012 and referred the application to a case management hearing before a Registrar to give the parties \nthe opportunity to agree or otherwise recommend to the Court the processes by which the connection issues might \nbe resolved by negotiation between the parties. A case management hearing was convened by Registrar Gilich on \n17 September 2012 and an order was made requiring the applicant to file a statement of issues, facts and \ncontentions, which the applicant filed on 20 November 2012. The State and several other respondents filed \nseparate responses to the applicant\u2019s statement of issues, facts and contentions.  A further case management \nhearing was held on 21 June 2013 to discuss the outstanding connection issues and to agree on a process to \naddress those issues. At the hearing, the parties agreed that the outstanding connection issues could be addressed \nby the applicant and the State settling a series of questions that could then be the basis of an expert \nanthropological report by Dr Sackett. An order was made requiring the applicant and the State to settle such \nquestions, which they did. Dr Sackett\u2019s report was filed on 31 March 2014. I observe here that the questions asked \nat this stage did not, ultimately, cover anywhere near all of the matters on which Dr Sackett\u2019s expert opinion was \nrelevant. As Dr Sackett himself said, although the report comprehensively addressed all the questions asked of him, \nit was \u201cnot the normal native title [report] that would be provided to the court.\u201d  Further case management hearings \nwere held on 11 April 2014 and 16 April 2014, at which the State advised the Court that it required until the end of \nOctober 2014 to complete both a legal and linguistic review of Dr Sackett\u2019s report. Case management hearings \nwere also held on 1 August 2014 and 5 September 2014 to resolve outstanding issues and further prepare the \nmatter for trial. On 5 September 2014, orders were made provisionally listing the application for trial and setting \ndeadlines for the filing of outstanding documents. An experts\u2019 conference was held on 24 and 25 June 2015 so that \nthe two principal experts who had prepared reports for the Court in this matter could confer and prepare a joint \nstatement.\n\nTjiwarl #2    The Tjiwarl #2 claim was filed on 22 July 2015. The claim group is the same in both applications, \nalthough the persons comprising the applicant are different in each proceeding. In these reasons, when I use the \nsingular word \u201capplicant\u201d, I refer to the applicant in both Tjiwarl #1 and Tjiwarl #2 as constituted.  The claim area in \nTjiwarl #2 covers the UCL parcels in the Tjiwarl #1 claim area that the applicant claims s 47B of the NT Act applies \nto. These areas were not identified in the Tjiwarl #1 application, where the applicant stated, under a heading \naddressing the applicability of s 47B, among other provisions:No information at present, however should any or all \nof sections 61A(4), 47, 47A and 47B apply then the applicants will seek to ignore extinguishment in those areas.  \nAccordingly, the Tjiwarl #2 application did specifically identify the areas to which the applicant says s 47B applies.  \nOn 27 July 2015, I made orders that Tjiwarl #1 and Tjiwarl #2 be heard together.  The State initially submitted that \nthe filing of the Tjiwarl #2 application was an abuse of process. The following exchange occurred during opening \nsubmissions:MR RANSON: They\u2019re not opposed, your Honour. If it assists, we maintain the view that there is a \ndifficulty with the Tjiwarl 2 application, and we suspect, ultimately, we will maintain our submission that it\u2019s an abuse \nof process, but for present purposes we\u2019re content that the evidence that might be relevant to it can be taken in \nthese two weeks - they can be heard together - and - - -\n\n HER HONOUR: And you will develop the grounds on which you say it can be dismissed which may or may not \ninclude - - -\n\n MR RANSON: Yes. Your Honour might recall we had foreshadowed an interlocutory application seeking to deal \nwith that before the hearing. We\u2019re now content, on the basis of the amendment, that all of it can be folded into the \nhearing and dealt with at the same time.  The State\u2019s argument was that, in making the Tjiwarl #2 application at a \nlater date, the applicant\u2019s intention was to require the Court to consider two relevant dates when determining (for \nthe purposes of s 47B(1)(c)) whether the claim group members had occupied the areas said to be subject to s 47B. \nAside from the passage I have extracted, the argument was not developed in the State\u2019s final oral submissions \n(although it was mentioned once more in opening) and was not addressed in the State\u2019s written submissions. Given \nthe findings I have made on the occupation issues for s 47B, it is not necessary to determine the State\u2019s argument, \n\n\n\nif indeed it remained a live submission at the end of the trial. The occupation I have found proven existed in 2011, \nas well as in 2015.\n\nTHE CLAIM GROUP MEMBERS AND THE CLAIM AREA    There have been a number of previous applications for \ndetermination of native title that have covered some or all of the claim area. Some of the claim group members \nwere actively involved in those applications. I refer to those previous applications where necessary. The State did \nnot submit any of the previous applications precluded a determination of native title in this proceeding.\nThe basis for membership of the claim group    By final submissions, there was some dispute between the applicant \nand the State concerning the basis on which the applicant proposed to ask the Court to make any determination of \nnative title. The dispute centred on the description of the claim group.  Despite the considerable number of pages \noccupied in final submissions on this issue, in oral submissions at the final hearing counsel for the applicant \nsubmitted that the applicant\u2019s case is and has remained as set out in [63] of their statement of issues, facts and \ncontentions dated 20 November 2012. That paragraph states:The persons who hold the native title rights and \ninterests in relation to the Claimed Area are those persons:\n\n (a) who, in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of Western Desert society, have a connection to the \nClaimed Area through:(i) their own birth, or long association with the Claimed Area; or\n\n (ii) the birth, or long association with the Claimed Area, of their ancestors by which they claim country; and(b) in \nrespect of whom that claim is recognised according to Western Desert traditional laws and customs.  It is also said \nby the applicant that the reason the claim group members hold rights and interests in the claim area as a group is \nthat they \u201ccollectively have rights and responsibilities in relation to the tjukurrpa of the Claimed Area\u201d.  Counsel for \nthe applicant then emphasised that the claim group members were set out in [64] of the applicant\u2019s statement of \nissues, facts and contentions. This states:The group of persons who satisfy those criteria at present are:\n\n (a) In respect of paragraph 63(a)(i) \u2013 Lenny Ashwin; and\n\n (b) In respect of paragraph 63(a)(ii), the descendants of:(i) Alfie Ashwin;\n\n (ii) Piman/Charlie Beaman;\n\n (iii) Tjampula/Jumbo Harris;\n\n (iv) Nampu/Scotty Lewis;\n\n (v) Nimpurru/Spider Narrier;\n\n (vi) Tjulyitjutu/Rosie Jones;\n\n (vii) Kathleen Bingham;\n\n (viii) Kurril/Scotty/Ted/Packhorse Rennie Tullock;\n\n (ix) Pukungka/Dolly Walker;\n\n (x) Manyila/Trilby; and \n\n (xi) Dempsey James.  I deal with the situation concerning Lenny Ashwin at [63] to [64] below.  It is true that in their \ninitial final written submissions, the applicant referred to other pathways such as conception, high ritual knowledge \nconcerning the area, or responsibility for sites within the area. These pathways are referred to in other parts of the \napplicant\u2019s statement of issues, facts and contentions (such as [15(a)]) as part of the laws and customs of Western \n\n\n\nDesert people, and the State admits that to be the case.  The variations are, I consider, explained by the applicant\u2019s \nfinal submissions at [36(b)], which in turn refers to the applicant\u2019s statement of issues, facts and contentions. At [46] \nof that document, the applicant contends that the \u201cpresently acknowledged\u201d laws and customs governing the claim \narea emphasise parental and grandparental connection and long association with the claim area as pathways to \nobtaining rights and interests in land and waters in the claim area, rather than some of the other pathways which \nmay in any given circumstances be available under Western Desert laws and customs, for example conception on \ncountry. The applicant contends this is an adaptation of traditional laws and customs. The State contests this.  \nTaking those submissions into account, together with what was said in final submissions and the confirmation that \nthe applicant\u2019s claim is as set out in [63] of the statement of issues, facts and contentions, I proceed on the basis \nthat the applicant contends membership of the claim group is to be determined by reference to the smaller set of \npathways set out in [63], while recognising that there are a larger set of pathways available under traditional \nWestern Desert laws and customs.  I do not consider, contrary to the State\u2019s submissions, that there has been any \nattempt by the applicant to elevate the claimant evidence about the various Tjukurrpa to some kind of independent \npathway to acquiring rights and interests in the claim area. The Tjukurrpa is the principal manifestation of the claim \ngroup members\u2019 rights and interests in the claim area; and a principal manifestation of their contended connection \nto the area. That is how I have understood the applicant to use the Tjukurrpa.  There has been a further issue \nraised by the applicant, concerning the terms of the description of native title holders in any determination of native \ntitle. In summary, the applicant contends for a description which embraces people not yet born who might acquire \nrights through pathways other than descent. The State contests the appropriateness of any such terms in any \ndetermination. The State proposes, and I understand the applicant to accept, that any such issues can await the \nCourt\u2019s decision on the contested matters, and then be dealt with by agreement, or further submissions and \ndetermination if need be.  In this case, aside from the matters I refer to later in these reasons in terms of how the \nclaim group members\u2019 ancestors came to be in the claim area, there were no particular disputes between the \nparties, nor disputes arising with any other group of people, about who comprised the claim group. Those who claim \nrights in the claim area identify with one or more of the apical ancestors.  However, I should here mention Lenny \nAshwin, who was one of Dr Sackett\u2019s older informants and who was specified as one of the people who satisfies the \ncriteria necessary to hold rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area. Lenny Ashwin\u2019s mother \n(Pikuyu, her non-Aboriginal name being Doris) was the sister of Alfie Ashwin, one of the apical ancestors in the \nclaim group. Dr Sackett notes in his report that Lenny Ashwin gave at least two differing accounts of where he was \nborn, one of which was that he was born in the claim area.  In final submissions the applicant accepted that, \nbecause Lenny Ashwin is now deceased and there are no people who seek to claim rights through him, he should \nnot be included in any determination. The applicant also seemed to accept that the evidence about Lenny Ashwin \nhaving been born in the claim area (which was said by the applicant to be the source of his rights to country) was \nequivocal.\nThe composition of the claim group    The claim group includes, in no particular order, the following persons who \neach gave evidence in support of the application: Jennifer Narrier, Keith Narrier, Richard Narrier, Kado Muir, Allan \nAshwin, Henry Ashwin, Victor Ashwin, Edwin Beaman, Leroy Beaman, Shirley Wonyabong, June Tullock, Allan \nJames, Brett Lewis, Luxie Hogarth, Geraldine Hogarth, Douglas Bingham and Dallas Harris. My understanding is \nthat each family group within the claim group had one or more family members who gave evidence.  Ms Narrier, Mr \nKeith Narrier, and Mr Richard Narrier are siblings and are descendants of two apical ancestors: Dolly Walker \n(Pukungka) and Spider Narrier (Nimpurru). Mr Muir is the half-brother of Ms Narrier, Mr Keith Narrier and Mr \nRichard Narrier, sharing the same mother. He is a descendant of Dolly Walker (Pukungka).  Mr Allan Ashwin, his \nyounger brother Mr Henry Ashwin, and Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s son Mr Victor Ashwin are all descendants of Alfie Ashwin. \nMr Edwin Beaman and his son Mr Leroy Beaman are descendants of Charlie Beaman (Piman).  Ms Wonyabong is \na descendent of Trilby (Manyila). Ms Tullock is a descendant of Scotty (Ted) Tullock. Mr Allan James is a \ndescendant of Dempsey James. Mr Brett Lewis is a descendant (by adoption) of Scotty Lewis (Nampu). Ms \nGeraldine Hogarth is a descendant of Rosie Jones (Tjulyitjutu). Mr Bingham is a descendant of Kathleen Bingham. \nMs Harris is a descendant of Jumbo Harris (Tjampula).  The applicant\u2019s submission, which I accept, is that the claim \ngroup members constitute a group capable of recognition under the NT Act because they are all persons who, \nunder Western Desert laws and customs, have rights and responsibilities for the Tjukurrpa of the claim area. The \nevidence clearly establishes that they recognise each other as members of the group, with rights and interests \nunder traditional laws and customs in all of the claim area, but with differing rights and responsibilities for particular \n\n\n\nparts of the claim area. The division of responsibility is in accordance with the pathways mentioned above: namely, \nbirth or long association of the claim group member or their ancestors.\n\nA claim for group native title    The applicant identifies the nature of the native title rights claimed as group rights. \nThey submit:A finding of group native title within the broader Western Desert cultural bloc society was made in De \nRose v South Australia. The Full Court in De Rose v South Australia (No.2) (2005) 145 FCR 290 at [44] said:\u201c ... the \nappellants claim to be Nguraritja for the claim area and, by virtue of that status, they have common rights and \nresponsibilities under the laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc in relation to the claim area (although not \nnecessarily in relation to precisely the same sites or tracks). Moreover, the appellants claim on behalf of all people \nwho are Nguraritja for the claim area. The composition of that class will vary from time to time depending upon who \ncan satisfy the rules identified by the primary judge for identifying Nguraritja ... On the appellants\u2019 case, native title \nrights and interests over the claim area will not cease on the death of the last survivor among them.\u201dThis is \nconsistent with what has been said in a line of cases concerning the nature of a native title claim group under the \nNTA. In Brown v State of South Australia [2009] FCA 206 at [19] Besanko J said that a native title claim group \nunder the NTA is a group consisting of all the persons who, according to their traditional laws and customs, have \nthe common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed. At [20] his Honour noted \nhowever that: \u201cit may be that a sub-group of a community sharing traditional laws and customs alone possesses \nrights and interests in a particular area and that sub-group may itself constitute a native title claim group\u201d.\n\n The facts and findings in De Rose on this issue were also discussed by Lindgren J in Harrington Smith v Western \nAustralia (No. 9) [2007] FCA 31; 238 ALR 1 at [503] ff. In that case his Honour distinguished De Rose on the facts. \nAt [930] he concluded that there were people outside the various claim groups who had rights and interests within \nor partly within the various overlapping claim areas, and people within the claim groups who had rights and interests \nat least partly outside the claim area of their claim group. His Honour said: \u201cThe level and form of aggregation has \nbeen adventitious, resulting from political affiliations at the times when the respective groups were composed. In the \noverlap areas, individuals might just as well have been in a different group. Pre-sovereignty laws and customs have \nnot dictated the existence of the groups or their composition\u201d. See also [1154]-[1159].\n\n This claim is clearly distinguishable from Harrington-Smith. It is brought on a similar basis to that in De Rose i.e. on \nbehalf of a group that exists in accordance with traditional law and custom, being all the persons who together have \nrights and responsibilities in relation to the tjukurrpa of the Claimed Area in accordance with the mechanisms \nreferred to in Applicants SIFC [15(a)]. See Applicants SIFC [15(b), (c)], [31], [32], [36]-[38], [42]-[47], [63]. Those \nmechanisms include, as a necessary condition, recognition. Thus if it is correct to say that group rights do not arise \ndirectly from the laws and customs of the society but are mediated through the group (cf paragraph 127), then that \nis satisfied in this case because those members of the native title holding group from time to time are those whose \nclaim to have rights in the Claimed Area through one or more of the possible mechanisms (or pathways) must be \nrecognised by the group as having such rights. That is the case with the claim group referred to in Applicants SIFC \n[64].\n\n As with De Rose, the claimants do not claim to be a linguistic or dialect group. Also as with De Rose, the Claimed \nArea principally comprises pastoral stations which fall within a larger area in which the claimants have rights and \ninterests (see Harrington-Smith (No.9) at [512]). The Applicants do not understand those matters raise any issue in \nthese proceedings.  The State did not cavil with these propositions and their application to the current proceeding.  \nI accept the applicant\u2019s submissions, and proceed on the basis the group has been sufficiently identified.\n\nThe claim area boundaries    The northern, eastern and southern boundaries are by reference to pastoral lease \nboundaries and are therefore arbitrary. The western boundary is by reference to two sets of ranges (Montague \nRange and Booylgoo Range), thus by geographical features, and is explained in the evidence by the claimant \nwitnesses by reference to the outer limits of the country for which they can speak.  Mr Keith Narrier addressed the \nartificiality of the boundary from the claim group members\u2019 perspective, and by particular reference to the \nBarwidgee area, outside the north-east claim boundary. His evidence is emblematic of why some flexibility needs to \n\n\n\nbe applied to the evidence (lay and ethnographic) about \u201careas\u201d and \u201cboundaries\u201d, because lines on maps in the \nway the NT Act compels them to be drawn do not reflect traditional understandings, in accordance with Aboriginal \nlaws and customs, of boundaries and, it would appear, particularly not for Western Desert people. Mr Narrier \nexplained:My father\u2019s country is all that there now; that Tjiwarl claim. But he was born in Barwidgee. Both sides are \nspecial to him, they didn\u2019t have boundaries like this here today; they just travel around up and down like that. I don\u2019t \nknow why they have the boundary like this; that\u2019s Tjiwarl country they just put it like that. The old people didn\u2019t \nhave this boundary, nup. They still would have went past that boundary, it didn\u2019t make any difference to them, It\u2019s \nthe same today, we don\u2019t have boundaries like this [claim boundary].  Mr Allan Ashwin gave similar evidence, in \nunequivocal language:We don\u2019t have boundaries, that\u2019s bullshit. Country is country; you go from one waterhole to \nthe next. Like when people used to go before any stations was there, people would go from water to waterhole, \nwhere there is permanent water like a spring.\n\n When it\u2019s a good season they go to all the little rockholes from one claypan to the next. There was no boundaries, \nthey know that they go one side there might be a family group over there; they might make a fire and that other \nfamily would make a fire and they would see the smoke and go over. There\u2019s a water hole over there they might go \nand meet, they know that\u2019s their country and this is our country, like that.\n\nSovereignty: dates    It is not in dispute in this proceeding that the date of sovereignty, in relation to Western \nAustralia, is taken to be a reference to 2 May 1829, being the date on which the British government formally took \npossession of what was then called the Swan River Colony: see Western Australia v Commonwealth [1995] HCA \n47; 183 CLR 373 (Native Title Act Case) at 424.  The parties, and in particular the State, also accept that there \nwere no Europeans in the claim area, or regions around it, until the late 1800s. The State accepts that the group of \nAboriginal people who were in occupation of the claim area in the late 1800s were the same group of people (or \ntheir descendants) as those who were in occupation at sovereignty in 1829.  As I have already noted, the State also \naccepts that the same group of Aboriginal people remained in occupation of the claim area into the early 1900s, \nuntil around 1912. In final submissions, counsel for the State accepted the proposition that, whichever Aboriginal \npeople were occupying the claim area in around 1912 (at the time Daisy Bates conducted her research, including \nspeaking to some informants who told her about the situation in areas covered by the claim area), were likely to \nhave been the same people who occupied the claim area at sovereignty. The State\u2019s thesis is that those original \noccupants left or died out and the claim group members\u2019 ancestors moved in from about the 1920s onwards (but \nmostly between the 1930s and the 1950s) introducing their own Tjukurrpa to the country, and that is what was \npassed on thereafter.\nHistory of non-Aboriginal presence in the claim area  \nEarly contact with non-Aboriginal people  There is no historical record of non-Aboriginal people being present in the \nclaim area before the second half of the nineteenth century. Non-Aboriginal people moved occasionally through the \nclaim area in the second half of the nineteenth century.  In 1869, John Forrest\u2019s party passed through the claim \narea, naming Depot Springs, Mount Leonora and other geographic features, as well as commenting on encounters \nwith Aboriginal residents. In 1892, the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition crossed part of the claim area.  From \n1892, David Carnegie prospected in and around Coolgardie and, in 1895, moved to the Lawlers and Lake Darlot \nareas. He later described the mining camps already established there. Carnegie also wrote of the involvement of \nAboriginal people in prospecting expeditions:A good many prospectors, depending on their black-boys almost \nentirely, wander from one range of hills to another, dodge here and there for water, keep no count or reckoning, and \nonly return by the help of their guide when the \u201ctucker-bags\u201d are empty ...\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  In 1896, Lawrence Wells passed through the Lake Way area with the Calvert exploration \nparty. May Vivienne travelled through the claim area from 1899 and later wrote and published a book about her \nexperiences. H.G.B. Mason, a surveyor, travelled through the Sandstone region and the western part of the claim \narea in 1900.  As well as Daisy Bates, the anthropologists Norman Tindale, Jud Epling and J Birdsell all spent time \nin the claim area on expeditions during the 1920s and 1930s.\nEarly mineral discoveries  The early 1890s, when gold was discovered in the area, was the beginning of a more \nconsistent non-Aboriginal presence in the claim area.  By 1892, approximately 3,000 prospectors were arriving in \n\n\n\nWestern Australia each month, most of them streaming out to the Eastern Goldfields and Murchison Goldfields. \nGold was discovered in or near the claim area:(a) at Leinster in 1892;\n\n (b) at Lawlers in 1894;\n\n (c) at Leonora in 1894;\n\n (d) at Sir Samuel in 1895;\n\n (e) near Wiluna (at Lake Way) in 1896;\n\n (f) at Kathleen Valley in 1897;\n\n (g) at Sandstone in the early 1900s; and\n\n (h) at Vivien in the early 1900s.\nNon-Aboriginal settlements  As a result of the discovery of gold, more permanent settlements arose across the \nclaim area from the mid-1890s. The claim area overlapped the East Murchison Goldfield, which was proclaimed in \nMay 1895.  Within 12 months, there had been 200 gold-mining leases taken up and Lawler\u2019s Patch (Lawlers) had \nbeen chosen as the centre of the district. By 1896, gold was also being sought at reefing centres including Lake \nDarlot, Lake Way and Mount Sir Samuel.  From 1895, railway lines were extended from Cue to Mullewa to shorten \nthe distance for carting goods, water and mail, which came across from the Murchison Goldfields district to the west \n(rather than from the Kalgoorlie area).  Town sites were gazetted at:(a) Lawlers in 1896;\n\n (b) Sir Samuel in 1897;\n\n (c) Leonora in 1898;\n\n (d) Wiluna in 1898;\n\n (e) Kathleen (formerly Kathleen Valley) in 1900;\n\n (f) Vivien in 1906;\n\n (g) Sandstone in 1906; and\n\n (h) Leinster in 1981 (although workings developed in the area in 1899-1900 and significant production of gold \noccurred between 1900 and 1906).  By 1900, the population of the East Murchison Goldfield was 1,209. A railway \nlink from Leonora to Kalgoorlie opened in 1902. A weekly mail service operated from Mount Magnet to the East \nMurchison Goldfield by 1903. Western Australia\u2019s gold production peaked in 1902 and was in decline until 1930, \nwhen production began to increase again.\n\nPastoral activity in the area  Pastoral interest in the claim area grew after the initial peak of gold production had \npassed (that is, from around the start of the twentieth century).  By 1903, the East Murchison area was described as \na \u201cpromising pastoral district\u201d, with The West Australian reporting: \u201cNearly the whole of the country around Lake \nDarlot and Sir Samuel has been taken up in leases, and stocking operations are in progress\u201d.  By 1928, pastoral \noperations were well established in the Goldfields from Sir Samuel to Wiluna, including: Lake Violet, Yakabindie, \nVandal, Munroe, Mount Grey, Banjewarn, Bandya, Depot Springs, Mount Keith, Albion Downs, Lake Way, and \nAbercrombie Well.\nAboriginal employment in the pastoral industry  Aboriginal people were employed on pastoral leases in the claim \narea throughout the twentieth century. In 1909, Keyser reported that Aboriginal people were working on a station \nnear Lake Darlot. Aboriginal people \u201calso gave a hand at various times\u201d on Yeelirrie Station in the 1920s.\n\n\n\nGovernment authorities  Government authorities such as the Protector of Aborigines operated in the claim area \nfrom the early twentieth century. C.A. Bailey inspected the claim area in 1896-1897 in order to provide a report for \nthe Aborigines Protection Board.  Travelling inspectors visited the claim area throughout the early twentieth century \non behalf of the Protector of Aborigines, reporting on the conditions of Aboriginal residents.  In the early twentieth \ncentury, rationing for Aboriginal residents was provided at various locations in and around the claim area, including \nLawlers and Wiluna.\nOther authorities  Aboriginal people also encountered other authorities in the claim area over time. Aboriginal \npeople were utilised as trackers or assistants by the Western Australia Police throughout the late nineteenth and \nearly twentieth centuries. A tracker was requested for Lawlers Police Station in 1926.  In 1955, the Wiluna Mission \nwas established by the Western Conference of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. The mission also operated a \nkindergarten and a primary school and sought to arrange station employment for a number of older children in the \nwider adjoining area.  Several hundred Aboriginal families attended the mission in the years of operation, through to \n1975. The Wiluna mission became the Nganganawili Village in 1983.\n\nTHE COURSE OF THE TRIAL    The trial was divided into two parts: an on country hearing dealing with \nconnection issues and a further hearing in Perth dealing with expert evidence and extinguishment issues. Final \nsubmissions were also taken in Perth.\n\nConnection hearing in July 2015    The connection hearing was held at a number of locations throughout the claim \narea. When not travelling, the Court convened in Leinster. The Court convened exclusively at Leinster on the final \ntwo days of the hearing and also on the fifth day of the hearing.\nDay one: 27 July 2015\nHenry\u2019s Well/Ngarlpurti  After the parties\u2019 opening submissions, the Court travelled to the site of Ngarlpurti, also \nknown as Henry\u2019s Well. Ngarlpurti is associated with the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa and also with the Dragonfly \nMan Tjukurrpa. A chain fence cordons off two small rock holes which form part of these Tjukurrpa. The remains of a \nconcrete water tank and a windmill also lay at this site. Ms Wonyabong and Mr Muir gave some of their evidence at \nNgarlpurti.\n\nTownsend Well/Tjumpurka (view only)  The Court attended Tjumpurka for a view of the site only. The site, which \nwas under water at the time of the on country hearing, is also associated with the Two Carpet Snakes and \nDragonfly Man Tjukurrpa. No evidence was given at this site.\nLake Miranda/Yulkapa  In the afternoon of the first day of the hearing, the Court attended Yulkapa, a red sand hill \nlocated inland from the banks of Lake Miranda. Yulkapa is also associated with the Two Carpet Snakes and \nDragonfly Man Tjukurrpa. Ms Wonyabong, Mr Muir and Mr Leroy Beaman gave evidence at Yulkapa.\nDay two: 28 July 2015\n\nYakabindie Claypan/Yakamuntu  On the second day of the hearing, the Court attended Yakamuntu, a large claypan \nlocated on Yakabindie Station. Yakamuntu, which was underwater at the time of the on country hearing, forms part \nof the Two Carpet Snakes and Dragonfly Man Tjukurrpa. Both Ms Wonyabong and Mr Muir gave evidence at this \nsite.\nJones Creek/Ngurlu Wiriwiri  After attending the Yakabindie claypan, the Court drove to Ngurlu Wiriwiri, also known \nas Jones Creek. Ms Tullock gave evidence at this site, including that her father was born at Jones Creek, although \nshe was unable to recognise the crossing the Court attended.\nMail Change Well/Tjilpur  The Court then attended Tjilpur, which is also known as Mail Change Well. This site is \nalso associated with the Two Carpet Snakes and Dragonfly Man Tjukurrpa. Mr Muir was the only witness to give \nevidence at this site.\nLogan Spring/Tjiwarl/Tjiwarl Rock and Tjiwarl Soak  On the afternoon of the second day the Court attended Tjiwarl, \nalso known as Logan Spring. Tjiwarl, which means \u201cshining\u201d, is the site from which the claim area takes its name. A \nlarge gum tree stands at the base of a natural spring. A rock at the base of the spring is carved with the date \n\u201c1920\u201d. A large rock face is located adjacent to Tjiwarl. Tjiwarl is also associated with the Two Carpet Snakes and \nDragonfly Man Tjukurrpa. Ms Wonyabong, Mr Muir and Mr James gave evidence at Tjiwarl.\nDay three: 29 July 2015\nPalm Sping/Pii  On the third day of the hearing, the Court travelled to Pii (also known as Palm Spring), a natural \nspring surrounded by palm trees. The area is also associated with the Two Carpet Snakes and Dragonfly Man \n\n\n\nTjukurrpa. The Court was welcomed by Mr Muir and several other male claim group members to the area. \nStrangers to the area were invited to cleanse themselves with water from the natural spring. Ms Wonyabong and Mr \nMuir gave evidence at this site, including on the relationship of this site to the Two Carpet Snakes and Dragonfly \nMan Tjukurrpa.\nYakabindie Homestead  On the afternoon of the third day of the hearing, the Court convened in the grounds of the \nYakabindie Homestead. Ms Wonyabong and Ms Tullock completed their evidence at the Yakabindie Homestead. \nYakabindie Station and the Yakabindie Homestead are important areas for many of the individuals who gave \nevidence at the hearing.\nDay four: 30 July 2015\nPulyku Quarry  The Court commenced the fourth day of the hearing at the Pulyku Quarry. The Pulyku Quarry is \ncovered by shale rock and quartz. Mr Lewis gave evidence at the Pulyku Quarry. A mound above the quarry \nprovided a vantage point.\nThe Lady  The Court later attended a site known as The Lady. The site is named after a rock formation that \nresembles the profile of a female face. The Court convened at the top of a large rocky outcrop. Mr Lewis gave both \nnon-restricted and male gender restricted evidence at The Lady.\nBooylgoo Range/Pulyku  The final stop on the fourth day of the hearing was at Booylgoo Range, also known as \nTerracotta or Pulyku. The low mountain range is associated with the wild potato Tjukurrpa. Ms Narrier, whose totem \nis the wild potato, gave evidence at the site. Ms Narrier demonstrated how a wild potato can be found and showed \nthe Court that vines entangled in trees and shrubbery indicate the presence of wild potatoes in the earth below.\nDay five: 31 July 2015  The fifth day of the hearing was held at the Leinster Tavern.\nDay six: 2 August 2015\nMount Townsend and Mount Marion  On the sixth day of the hearing, the Court convened at a location close to both \nMount Townsend and Mount Marion on the Sandstone-Wiluna Road. On the way to the location, the Court stopped \nat a rock hole on Yeelirrie Station Homestead. The area is associated with a Tjukurrpa story restricted to initiated \nmen. Mr Allan Ashwin and Mr Victor Ashwin gave unrestricted evidence before the luncheon adjournment. \nFollowing their evidence, a kangaroo was slaughtered and prepared in the traditional way by an initiated male \nmember of the claim group. Mr Allan Ashwin and Mr Bradley Wongawol showed the Court the traditional method of \nbutchering and cooking the animal. Following the demonstration, the Court travelled further along the Sandstone-\nWiluna Road where Mr Allan Ashwin, Mr Victor Ashwin and Mr Keith Narrier gave male gender restricted group \nevidence. Mr Richard Narrier and Mr Henry Ashwin were also present, as was Dr Sackett. Following the restricted \nevidence, the Court shared in eating the kangaroo that had been prepared and cooked in the traditional way, along \nwith damper cooked by claim group members.\nDay seven: 3 August 2015\nLeinster Soak/Warkarra and hearing venue  The seventh day of the hearing commenced at Leinster Soak, also \nknown as Warkarra. Members of the claim group welcomed the Court to the area through song. A hole was then \ndug out of the earth. Shortly after the hole was dug out, water rose up from underneath the ground, filling the hole \nwith water. The Court then walked to the top of a rocky outcrop to view the surrounding area.  The Court then \nconvened back at the hearing venue, where Ms Luxie Hogarth, Ms Geraldine Hogarth and Ms Harris gave \nevidence.\nDay eight: 4 August 2015 and day nine: 5 August 2015  The eighth and ninth days were held at the hearing venue \nat the Leinster Tavern.\nFurther tranches of the proceeding held in Perth  \nExpert and extinguishment evidence: 27-29 October 2015  There was a further tranche of the proceeding held in \nPerth over three days in October 2015, during which Dr Clendon gave expert linguistic evidence, the parties \ndiscussed and, in the case of the first respondent, led evidence in relation to extinguishment issues, and the two \nprincipal experts who prepared reports for the Court in this matter (Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton) participated in a \nconcurrent expert evidence session.\nFinal submissions: 8-10 December 2015  Final submissions were heard in Perth from 8-10 December 2015.\nCLAIMANT WITNESSES  \n\nMy approach to the claimant evidence    There is no suggestion that any claimant witness in this proceeding was \ndoing anything but their best to give accurate and reliable evidence.  As the applicant\u2019s submissions point out, there \nwas no real challenge in cross-examination to the credibility of the claimant evidence. There were, however, points \n\n\n\nof detail which were challenged as to accuracy; where those are significant, I examine them elsewhere in these \nreasons.  Some witnesses may have been more forthcoming than others. Some might be said to have more direct \nsources. Some might be said to have given more of a contemporary flavour to their evidence: this factor might \nmean that some witnesses\u2019 evidence has more relevance to historical issues of connection, and other witnesses\u2019 \nevidence has more weight in relation to continuity. Overall, I found the claimant witnesses to be persuasive. I say \nmore about each witness below. However, there are some propositions fundamental to my approach to what the \nclaimant witnesses have said in this proceeding which I should make clear.  In the absence of any challenges to \ncredibility, I have taken what the claimant witnesses have said about their family history and their connection to \ncountry as their true understanding. That is in the context of a culture where identification with country, rights to \ncountry and entitlement to speak for and protect country are paramount. I do not accept that the claim group \nmembers and their ancestors have somehow invaded or usurped the claim area and purport to speak for it without \ngenuine belief that they, and their ancestors, have authority to do so. Acceptance of the State\u2019s case involves \naccepting that the grandparent generation of the claim group were purporting to do something they were not \nentitled to do: that is, to speak for country with which they had no traditional connection through laws and customs. \nIt seems to me it also involves accepting that they knew they had no such authority. There is no basis to find that is \nwhat they were doing.  In a different context under cross-examination, Dr Clendon made a similar point in relation to \nBates\u2019 informants:I mean, what you\u2019re saying is certainly possible, but if people are coming out reporting to Daisy \nBates that they are from a particular place and they speak a particular language, it\u2019s likely that they were from that \nplace and they did speak that \u2013 that language.  An approach of this kind was taken by Selway J in Gumana v \nNorthern Territory of Australia [2005] FCA 50; 141 FCR 457, where his Honour said, in the context of the issue of \nexclusive possession raised for decision in that case (at [208]):But on the ultimate question was [sic] whether there \nwas a right of exclusive possession, there was no dispute that the clans had a right of exclusive possession to their \ncountry which right was subject to various rights in others \u2014 all witnesses were relevantly in agreement as to that \nfact. Undoubtedly it is possible for a court to reject all of the evidence before it on the basis that none of it is \ncreditable. But in this case there has not been any submission that the witnesses were not telling the truth. If the \npersons who know the relevant Aboriginal tradition give evidence to the Court that it consists of a right to exclude, \nthen save for issues of credit or misunderstanding I can think of no reason why I should not accept their evidence.  \nIn this section, I set out my impressions of each claimant witness, the witness\u2019s family connections, and a brief \nsummary of the witness\u2019s evidence.  The findings I make about family connections are based on the claimant \nevidence and the genealogies that were prepared by Dr Sackett and tendered by the applicant. The State did not \nobject to the accuracy of those genealogies. In some circumstances, I also rely on Dr Sackett\u2019s reports, and his \nopinions about various family connections. One purpose of considering the family history and connections of the \nclaimant witnesses is to inform the Court\u2019s findings concerning which, if any, Aboriginal people occupied the claim \narea at approximately 1912. It will be recalled that the agreed position in the parties\u2019 submissions is that the \nAboriginal people who occupied the claim area at approximately 1912 can be taken to be the same people, or \ndescendants of the same people, who occupied the claim area in 1829, at sovereignty, and in the 1890s, when non-\nIndigenous people first made contact with Aboriginal people in this part of Western Australia.  The issue of which, if \nany, Aboriginal people occupied the claim area in approximately 1912 is critical to the determination of a number of \nthe factual issues in this case. It assists in the determination of the State\u2019s \u201cmigration\u201d thesis. It assists in \ndetermining whether the Ngaiawonga were a separate people and whether (as the State contends in a reasonably \nabsolute way) they died out or moved away from the claim area soon after 1912. It assists in determining how long \nthe traditional laws and customs about which the claimant witnesses gave evidence have connected the claim \ngroup members and their ancestors to the country in the claim area.  It also assists in evaluating the weight that \nshould be given to historical ethnographic material, such as that prepared by Daisy Bates, and to other \nethnographic and anthropological material. Finally, it assists in determining the appropriate context for the \nconsideration of the anthropological opinions expressed in this proceeding.  The artificiality of the claim boundaries, \nas I have noted above, should be borne in mind. When claimant witnesses describe ancestral connection to \ncountry, it would be unreasonable to expect them to do so by reference to European boundaries.  A good example \nof the claimant witnesses affirming the artificiality of the claim boundaries is the following evidence of Mr Keith \nNarrier (in speaking about his father\u2019s birth at Barwidgee):The old people didn\u2019t have this boundary, nup. They still \nwould have went past that boundary, it didn\u2019t make any difference to them[.]  The preponderance of evidence about \nwhere ancestors and family members were born is also important. In his first report, Dr Sackett said (at [48]):... the \nnamed apicals and/or their ancestors were said to have been born either on the claim area itself or in areas to the \n\n\n\nnortheast, east or southeast of it. None of the named apicals or their ancestors were recorded as having been born \nin, or having associations with, lands to the west of the claim area.  This is consistent with much of the claimant \nevidence, some of which I have reproduced elsewhere. A further example is the evidence of Mr Richard Narrier \nabout people from the claim area and the Darlot/Weebo area all being \u201cone mob\u201d, and recounting how his \ngrandfather used to walk between Mungkali (also spelled \u201cMangkali\u201d), Barwidgee, Weebo, Darlot and the claim \narea. These are long distances.  In a similar way, when Mr Allan Ashwin spoke about meetings between people \nfrom the claim area and people to the east at law grounds, he indicated that this kind of interaction had been going \non for a long time, observing that he was in his sixties and \u201cit was well before [him] that they were going to those \nplaces\u201d. The State\u2019s approach would require me to find Mr Ashwin\u2019s evidence was wholly mistaken, and I do not \nconsider it is.  The State does not dispute that the claim group members and their ancestors are Western Desert \npeople. I consider this fact is not insignificant in assessing what conclusions can be drawn from the claimant \nwitnesses\u2019 accounts of these movements from the north and the east into the claim area. It is consistent with the \nhypothesis that the claim area is Western Desert country. It seems inherently unlikely that Western Desert people \nwould feel entitled to move into non-Western Desert country in times when Aboriginal people were still living \nlargely traditional lives. This might well explain why there is no substantive evidence of the movement of people \nfrom the west into the claim area: that is, because that would have involved movement of Aboriginal people \nbelonging to one society into the country of a different society.  Finally, I note the terms of a submission made by \nthe State in relation to the apical ancestor Jumbo Harris, whom I discuss below. The State\u2019s submission is:The \nevidence of Jumbo\u2019s association with the Claimed Area is of occasional travel through it en route from Leonora to \nWiluna. The evidence is that he never resided in the Claimed Area. The evidence is clear that Jumbo was primarily \nassociated with the Thurraguddy area.\n\n (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)  In my opinion, a focus on \u201cresidence\u201d \u2013 putting to one side how easily or \nuneasily that sits with evidence about traditional Aboriginal ways of life in these areas \u2013 distracts from the approach \nrequired by the NT Act. The Act requires assessment of whether a person or group holds rights or interests in \naccordance with traditional laws and customs over the subject land. It does not ask whether a person \u201cresided\u201d on \nthe land.  The distances covered by people, at least until the early twentieth century, are also relevant to assessing \nwhether the claim area was Western Desert country, and more particularly how and why the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors moved into it. Ms Harris gave some helpful and reliable evidence on this issue:My dad and his brothers \nwere born in different places. Uncle Les was born in Darlot, Uncle Dan was born in Laverton, near Mia Mia \nsomewhere. Uncle Arnold was born out in the bush, between Thurragaddy and Mulga Queen. They were born in \nsuch different places because my grandparents, Jumbo and Bella, travelled around a lot for law business, and \nmoving with the seasons, for hunting and gathering food. Mulga Queen would be half way for the law business for \nold peoples. So if they were coming from other side of Tjukarli, they would walk, camp at Mulga Queen and do their \nlaw practice. Then people would walk on to Wiluna. In those days it would take 3 to 6 months. There was no horse \nand cart, they had to walk the distance. My mum and my old aunties told me about that.  These are very long \ndistances. The distance between Tjukarli and Mulga Queen is approximately 385 km as the crow flies. The distance \nbetween Mulga Queen and Wiluna is approximately 190 km as the crow flies.\n\nShirley Wonyabong    Ms Wonyabong was a somewhat shy and softly spoken witness, but her evidence was very \nclear, including in cross-examination. She was clear about what she did and did not know and what she could and \ncould not speak about. She sometimes appeared to know much more than she was willing to say.  As she gave \nevidence over a series of days and site visits, her confidence and comfort with the process appeared to increase, \nwhich resulted in her volunteering a little more by way of evidence. She knew her country and its Tjukurrpa well, \nbut did not necessarily have a deep knowledge of other customs. For example, she did not follow the \u2018skin system\u2019.  \nI accept her evidence that her knowledge was based on what she had learned from, and been told by, her family. \nAlthough it is clear she also learned some information from station owners, in my opinion the connections to her \ncountry were forged when she was very young and included receiving knowledge about her country from family \nmembers who were consciously passing that knowledge to her. For example, her witness statement included the \nfollowing passages:My dad told me that Yeelirrie and Albion Downs was my country, our country. I get my \ncountry through my mother Trilby, and through my father, but more from my mother. My connection to the country \n\n\n\naround Wiluna is through my father. Only some of your family tree got to be from the country. You can claim both \nsides of your family.\n\n ...\n\n My father used to talk to me about the Wangkalara hill near Albion Downs and he talked to me about Palm Springs. \nHe learned about it because he was a man, and all the old mens knew. The old men know the dreamtime stories. \nThey never told me where they learned the stories; they just told me that they knew it from a long time.  In oral \nevidence, she also indicated that traditional knowledge about a \u201csmall soak\u201d had been given to her by \u201cAunt \nAngeline and my father\u201d and that \u201c[a] lot of old people\u201d, including her aunt Doris Fahey, had told her that her cousin \nScotty Tullock had been born at Jones Creek, in the claim area.\n\nFamily connections  Ms Wonyabong said her father, Micky Wonyabong, was born \u201csomewhere north of Granite \nPeak station\u201d, on the Canning Stock Route north of Wiluna. Her source for that information was family research \npapers. That location is a fair way north, and a little east, of the claim area. According to Dr Sackett, Micky \nWonyabong was born in 1898 and died in 1973. Dr Sackett also noted that he came from the area of the Birriliburu \nnative title consent determination (see Patch on behalf of the Birriliburu People v Western Australia [2008] FCA 944 \n(Birriliburu); see also BP (Deceased) on behalf of the Birriliburu People v Western Australia [2016] FCA 671), which \non the evidence is a determination over an area to the north-east of the Wiluna determination (see WF (Deceased) \non behalf of the Wiluna People v Western Australia [2013] FCA 755 (Wiluna)). Ms Wonyabong\u2019s mother, whose \nname was Trilby or Manyila, was born in a shearing shed on Barwidgee station. That appears to be just outside the \nnorth-eastern part of the claim boundary, but as the northern and eastern boundaries of the claim area are artificial \nboundaries I do not consider that Trilby being born there is material to the issues in this proceeding. The position \nwould be no different if she had been born a few kilometres south-west inside the artificial boundary of the claim \narea.  Earlier ethnographers referred to by Dr Sackett described Trilby as a Tjupan woman from around Wongawol. \nRelying on these sources, Dr Brunton in his supplementary report expresses a view that Trilby was born in \nWongawol. However, I prefer Ms Wonyabong\u2019s own evidence about where her mother was from: namely, that she \nwas born on Barwidgee station. It is unclear where the \u201cTjupan\u201d label came from, or who first attached it. Ms \nWonyabong did recount that her mother\u2019s parents came into Barwidgee from Wongawol, and she relates this to \nviolence against Aboriginal people by a pastoralist named Tommy Mellon that occurred around Wongawol. While \nMs Wonyabong could not give an approximate date on which her grandparents moved from Wongawol, other \nevidence (including the oral evidence of Mr James and an opinion of Dr Sackett) indicates that the violence to which \nshe referred took place in the early 1930s.  Ms Wonyabong claims through her mother\u2019s side. She herself was born \nin either Wiluna or Meekatharra, but she explained that, unlike when a person is born on country, being born in a \ntown \u201cdoesn\u2019t make that place your country\u201d and instead \u201c[your] place is where [your] mother and father are from\u201d. \nHer evidence was that, at the time she was born, her parents were living on Yeelirrie station in the claim area, \nwhere she was conceived. Hence she could \u201ctalk for Yeelirrie\u201d, as well as other places in the claim area. Her \ncousin, Harvey Scadden, was born on Barwidgee station, and his mother (Ms Wonyabong\u2019s mother\u2019s sister) lived in \nYeelirrie and Yakabindie in the 1940s.  Ms Wonyabong gave evidence that her parents met at Yakabindie in about \n1942 and travelled together to Yeelirrie in 1942 or 1943. Ms Wonyabong was born in 1949. She has one sister, \nLizzie, who is about the same age as her. If Trilby was in her mid-twenties or so when she had her two daughters, \nthat would mean Trilby was born in the early to mid-1920s. Recalling that Ms Wonyabong\u2019s father was born, \naccording to Sackett, in 1898, this might mean her mother was considerably younger than her father. However, Ms \nWonyabong\u2019s evidence was also that, at some stage prior to meeting her father, her mother lived with a non-\nIndigenous man on Banya station, closer to Darlot and near Mulga Queen. Her mother was looking after Harvey \nScadden at that time. This might indicate that her mother was born earlier, perhaps in the first decade of the \ntwentieth century, and was somewhat older when she gave birth to Ms Wonyabong and Lizzie. The evidence is \ninconclusive on this matter.  If Ms Wonyabong\u2019s mother was born on Barwidgee station, this seems to me to be \nclose enough to the claim area (on the evidence, about 9 km as the crow flies) that it is appropriate to describe her \nmother as \u201cfrom around\u201d the claim area, recalling that birth on country is one of the pathways to rights and interests \nin country (and bearing in mind the State does not dispute that Ms Wonyabong\u2019s family are Western Desert \npeople). Ms Wonyabong\u2019s evidence was that she could speak for certain areas in the north-east of the claim area. \n\n\n\nHer mother may have been born in the area only 8-10 years after Bates was interviewing those who identified to her \nas \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d.\n\nKado Muir    Mr Muir was a confident and articulate witness. Like Ms Wonyabong, he gave evidence at several \ndifferent sites and took the Court walking around several sites, including Tjiwarl (also known as Logan Spring). At \nPii (also known as Palm Spring) he and several other younger men conducted a ritual which he said was necessary \nto \u201cgreet\u201d the water snake that lived in the spring, and to avoid the visitors being harmed. When asked about this \nritual and why it needed to be performed at this site, while no rituals had been required at Tjiwarl, I found his \nexplanations lacked depth.  At times, I found it difficult to determine whether Mr Muir\u2019s knowledge had been gained \nthrough his own studies and reading or through the handing down of knowledge in traditional ways. That is not to \ndiminish the breadth of his knowledge and his genuine desire to be as well-informed as he can about his culture \nand about the country to which he has a connection. Nor is it to doubt the sincerity of the connection he feels to the \nclaim area.  What I found difficult to ascertain, however, was whether Mr Muir\u2019s knowledge was gained in traditional \nways and can properly be described as knowledge of laws and customs which have been continuously practiced in \nthe claim area since sovereignty. My impression was that he possessed a hybrid of knowledge: part gained in \ntraditional ways and part gained by other means. That may explain, for example, why his account of the skin system \ndiffered from others. It may also explain why aspects of what he said about the Tjukurrpa differed from other \naccounts. I do not mean this as a criticism of Mr Muir, and certainly I do not question his genuine commitment to \nhis people and his community. However my uncertainty about the sources of his knowledge has led me to place \nless weight on some of his evidence.\n\nKeith Narrier    Mr Keith Narrier was obviously uncomfortable about the process of revealing to a woman matters \nwhich are usually kept only between wati. To begin with, he simply listened, but as the evidence continued he \nbegan to interject more \u2013 sometimes to supplement or explain what was being said, sometimes to correct. On one \noccasion he interjected to stop Mr Victor Ashwin, clearly being of the view that Mr Ashwin had gone far enough in \nwhat he said. This was, it seems to me, a living application of traditional law: the enforcing of limits set by traditional \nlaw to ensure that normative rules about who can possess certain knowledge are preserved, even in the face of the \ncompeting imperative to prove connection to country.  Mr Narrier was the oldest wati to give evidence. Although I \ncannot reveal in these reasons the content of what he said during the restricted session, it was clear to me from \nwhat he said that his knowledge about the connection of the generation before his with the country in the claim \narea was direct and reliable. It was also clear that, not only had he been taught the laws and customs he described, \nhe lived by them and saw the world through them.  In his open evidence, Mr Narrier was also not especially \nforthcoming. However, I formed a positive impression of him during the restricted session and I am prepared to give \nweight to his written statement, especially given his recognised seniority within the claim group.\n\nJennifer Narrier    Ms Narrier gave some brief evidence at Booylgoo Range about the Tjukurrpa associated with that \nsite and about the bush potatoes found there, the bush potato being Ms Narrier\u2019s totem. She also gave evidence \nabout how the bush potato became her granddaughter\u2019s totem as well.  Ms Narrier gave evidence that Booylgoo \nRange was her Dreaming. She stated that the story for that country comes from the Tjukurrpa and was told to her \nby her mother. I extract some of her evidence about the connection between the Tjukurrpa and the landscape of \nthis country below at [706].  She was clearly a knowledgeable person and well-respected by others in her \ncommunity. Her answers in cross-examination about what would happen to Aboriginal people from other areas who \ncame to Booylgoo Range were telling: she laughed and was clearly puzzled by the question, not understanding \nhow it could be asked. She replied that they would not come to this place without someone like her, as if the \nquestion was ridiculous. It was a telling example of the gulf between the way Aboriginal laws and customs work and \nthe way non-Aboriginal people view the land and entry onto it.  Her evidence on country was given confidently and \nwith authority. The contrast when she came to give the remainder of her evidence in Leinster the next day was, in \nmy opinion, a paradigm example of why it is so important in native title proceedings to allow Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander people to give evidence on country rather than in a courtroom setting. Despite having her \ngranddaughter seated next to her, it was apparent Ms Narrier felt very uncomfortable speaking in a more formal \nsetting, with a considerable number of lawyers seated around her and a formal assembly of people in a public \ngallery. Although the same number of people (and indeed, for the most part, the very same people) had been in \nattendance when she gave her evidence on country, her demeanour was quite different. She spoke so softly it was \n\n\n\ndifficult to hear, her answers were short, and she had lost the expansiveness she exhibited the day before. There \nwere many questions she was clearly unwilling to answer at all and sometimes she did little more than shake her \nhead. Counsel for the State presented her with several written documents which seemed to confuse her, such was \nher state of nervousness. I mean no criticism of the State\u2019s counsel but use this as an example of Ms Narrier\u2019s very \ndifferent demeanour in unfamiliar and challenging surroundings.  While Ms Narrier had clearly gone through her \nwritten statement with great care, it was also apparent that, even for her as a senior woman, there was a \ntremendous gulf between what she was prepared to say in writing \u2013 which would be shown to the Court and to \nother lawyers but otherwise not publicly broadcast \u2013 and what she was prepared to say orally, for all to hear. Again, \nthis indicates the difficulties in asking Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in particular those whose \nadherence to traditional customs is apparent, to behave in ways which are culturally foreign to them.  Having seen \nher the day before, I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence in her written statement, although if she had only \ngiven evidence in the courtroom setting one could see how a judge might, quite wrongly, find her a less than \nimpressive witness and be prepared to discount the weight of her evidence. That would have been, in my opinion, a \ngrievous misreading of its importance, entirely due to the foreign setting in which she was required to speak.\n\nRichard Narrier    Mr Richard Narrier remained relatively quiet during the restricted evidence session and he was \nnot forthcoming during his open session evidence either. I was not able to form much of an impression of him. I am \nsatisfied his witness statement is reliable, but little was added through his oral evidence.\n\nFamily connections: Kado Muir, Keith Narrier, Jennifer Narrier and Richard Narrier  I place these claimant witnesses \ntogether because they share the same mother: Dolly Walker, also known as Pukungka, who is a named apical \nancestor. The father of Mr Keith, Mr Richard and Ms Jennifer Narrier (with their other full siblings, Roslyn and \nGraham, who did not give evidence) was Frank Narrier and his father was Spider Narrier, also known as Nimpirru. \nSpider Narrier is a named apical ancestor. Mr Muir\u2019s father is a non-Indigenous man (although Mr Muir gave \nevidence that his father had been initiated and taught traditional knowledge) and so his claim is through his mother.  \nMr Keith Narrier is the eldest of all his siblings. He gave evidence that his father, Frank Narrier, was from around \nWiluna and was born at Barwidgee. I take that to mean the area of Barwidgee station, rather than the dot on the \nmap representing the homestead. Frank Narrier was one of Mr Liberman\u2019s informants for his Yeelirrie Uranium \nProject report, written in the 1970s, and Mr Liberman records Frank Narrier\u2019s place of birth as Barwidgee and his \napproximate age \u2013 in 1976 \u2013 as 45 years. Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s grandfather, Spider Narrier, came from around \nWongawol, although Mr Narrier\u2019s evidence was that he had \u201cbeen around this [Tjiwarl claim] area a lot\u201d.  Mr Richard \nNarrier\u2019s evidence about his grandfather, Spider Narrier (whom he never met), was that he was from \u201caround \nMungkali\u201d, quite a long way north-east of the claim area, but that he used to \u201cwalk around Mungkali, Barwidgee, \nWeebo and Darlot and all this country [in the claim area] too\u201d. Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s description of Spider Narrier\u2019s \nmovements was slightly different and included his father and grandfather doing \u201ca lot [of] jobs\u201d around Yeelirrie, \nthen going to Sandstone, back to Albion Downs and back to Barwidgee. His father and grandfather are buried at \nBarwidgee and he characterised the area around Barwidgee as his father and grandfather\u2019s country. It is therefore \nclear that, in Mr Narrier\u2019s mind, Barwidgee is, in addition to the claim area, part of his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s \ncountry. Contrary to the State\u2019s submissions, I do not understand his evidence to be drawing some kind of \ndemarcation between the area around Barwidgee and the claim area. I have no evidence regarding why the area \naround Barwidgee was not included in this claim, but I am not prepared to infer it was because the claimant group \nmembers disavow it as part of their ancestors\u2019 country.  Dolly Walker was born at Skull Creek. The exact location \nof Skull Creek is not revealed by the evidence, although, from the claimant evidence, it appears to be near the town \nof Laverton. Laverton is, as the crow flies and based on the scales on the maps in evidence, about 180 km south-\neast of the southern end of the claim boundary.  Mr Keith Narrier was born in August 1951. He did not know when \neither of his parents were born, nor did he give evidence about how old either of them were when he was born, but \nhis date of birth would place his grandparents as the generation who were occupying, or who moved into, the claim \narea in the first or second decade of the twentieth century.  Mr Keith Narrier claims through both his father and his \nmother, although, as the State correctly submits, his evidence was that his mother\u2019s claim was through her husband \nrather than in her own right. However, he also seemed to consider his mother\u2019s country to be south-east of the \nclaim area, around Leonora and Laverton. This is somewhat contrary to the evidence of Mr Muir, who claims \nthrough Dolly Walker and whose evidence is that she had rights and interests in the claim area in accordance with \ntraditional laws and customs. Further, as the State submits, while Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s evidence was that a woman \n\n\n\ncould obtain rights to country through marriage if the marriage lasted \u201ca long time\u201d, Mr Allan Ashwin indicated in his \nevidence that his wife \u201ccan\u2019t claim this country\u201d because she is not from the claim area.  Ms Narrier was not able \nto add much to the picture about her parents and paternal grandparents. She was born in 1957 and so is younger \nthan Mr Keith and Mr Richard Narrier (Mr Richard Narrier having been born in 1954). She deferred in her evidence \nto Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s knowledge about her grandparents. Her evidence was that her parents \u201cmust have been from \nthis way, from the desert round Wongawol and Carnegie\u201d, although she recalled that her mother was born in Skull \nCreek around Laverton. Ms Narrier places her mother\u2019s country as around Albion Downs and Mount Keith, which \nare in the north-east corner of the claim area. She also stated that Yakabindie and Yeelirrie were part of her \nmother\u2019s ngurra (home), but the basis on which she did so was unclear. Her evidence was that this was the area \nher mother \u201cfelt ... was mostly her country\u201d.  Ms Narrier said her mother\u2019s mother had a nickname of \u201cHairpin\u201d and \nher mother\u2019s father was called Pinika, but that is all she knows of them. Like Mr Keith Narrier, she claims through \nboth her father and her mother. Consistently with the evidence of Mr Muir, it is Dolly Walker who Ms Narrier says \ntaught her the most about her country. Her evidence is that Dolly Walker learned those places from her own \nmother, although she was not able to give any more detailed evidence about her maternal grandmother.  Mr Muir \ndid give a little more evidence about his maternal grandmother. His evidence was that she had moved into the \nDarlot area from the Mangkali area in the 1940s. He explained this by saying she was a \u201cgiveaway [wife]\u201d to one of \nthe Darlot elders. Mr Muir gave evidence that his grandmother had lived in Yeelirrie, Darlot, Weebo, Albion Downs, \nYakabindie, Agnew, Leinster and \u201ceventually\u201d in an area towards Meekatharra. She was born in the early 1900s, \u201cif \nnot before then\u201d, and died as an old woman in the 1960s.\nLeroy Beaman    Mr Leroy Beaman was born in 1989. He gave evidence on two occasions. On the second \noccasion, he seemed more comfortable, giving his evidence with a degree of maturity beyond his years. \nNevertheless, there were times he appeared uncertain. For example, when asked about skin systems he seemed \nsomewhat unsure of the rules governing whether a person would take the same skin as one of their parents, or a \ndifferent skin. When asked about his daughter\u2019s skin, the following exchange occurred:MR RANSON: ... And you\u2019ve \ngot a daughter, I think, who\u2019s got a skin, as well? And which one is she? What skin has she got?\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: She got milangka.\n\n MR RANSON: Panaka [sic]. And how does she get that - - -\n\n MR WRIGHT: I think \u2013 sorry. Your Honour, I heard the witness differently.\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Mm?\n\n MR WRIGHT: Sorry. Which one is she?\n\n HER HONOUR: Just say your answer again - - -\n\n MR RANSON: Sorry, your Honour.\n\n HER HONOUR: - - - that was given.\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Oh, my daughter\u2019s purungu.\n\n MR RANSON: Oh, purungu. Okay.\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: I think.\n\n MR RANSON: I \u2013 the reason I thought you said panaka \u2013 and I \u2013 is in paragraph 99 of your statement, where you \nsay:My daughter is a panaka.LEROY BEAMAN: Yes, I missed \u2013 that was a mistake, spelling.\n\n MR RANSON: So that\u2019s a mistake?\n\n\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Yes.\n\n MR RANSON: She\u2019s purungu, as well?\n\n MR RANSON: Yes.\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Okay.\n\n MR RANSON: So she gets the same one - - -\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Yes.\n\n MR RANSON: - - - from you. And does that \u2013 that idea of skins: does a person figure out what their skin is by \nlooking at their father or by looking at their mother?\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Their father.\n\n MR RANSON: Father. It comes down the father\u2019s side? That\u2019s why \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s passing down through you?\n\n LEROY BEAMAN: Mm.  There were also some differences between the content of Mr Beaman\u2019s evidence and that \nof older people such as Ms Narrier and Ms Wonyabong. For example, there appeared to be more fluidity in how he \nunderstood children could choose, and move between, the countries of their parents, or countries into which they \nhad moved as children or young people, in order to claim connection to that country. Whether this could be \nexplained by some adaptation in laws and customs was unclear.\n\nEdwin Beaman    As I have described above, Mr Edwin Beaman is the father of Mr Leroy Beaman and claims \nthrough his father, Roy Beaman, who was born in Wiluna and worked on stations in the claim area, especially \nYakabindie. Mr Edwin Beaman\u2019s evidence was that Roy Beaman was a wati and that he \u201cwalk[ed] on\u201d to \nYakabindie station to get a job when he was about 15 or 16 years old. Mr Beaman said his father identified as \nTjupan and denied that his father identified as Koara.  Mr Beaman was clear in his evidence about what he could \nand could not speak about. For example, he gave clear evidence that Mr Brett Lewis could speak for the area \naround Depot Springs, but he could not.\n\nFamily connections: Leroy and Edwin Beaman  Mr Leroy Beaman is the son of Mr Edwin Beaman and, accordingly, \nI discuss their family connections together in this section. Both Mr Leroy Beaman and Mr Edwin Beaman claim \nthrough Charlie Beaman, also known as Piman or Piiman, their great-grandfather and grandfather respectively. Dr \nSackett records Piman\u2019s year of birth as about 1900. It seems from the evidence that Mr Leroy Beaman and Mr \nEdwin Beaman might also claim through Ada Beaman, their great-grandmother and grandmother respectively, \nalthough I note she is not named as an apical ancestor. Nevertheless, I discuss their evidence about her below \nbecause, in my opinion, it is relevant to some of the questions in this proceeding about who occupied the claim area \nin the early twentieth century.  Mr Leroy Beaman\u2019s grandfather, and Mr Edwin Beaman\u2019s father, was Roy Beaman. \nRoy Beaman was Charlie Beaman\u2019s son. Roy Beaman was also one of Mr Liberman\u2019s informants. Mr Liberman \nrecords Roy Beaman as being approximately 45 years old in 1976, which would mean he was born in or around \n1931. That appears consistent with Mr Edwin Beaman\u2019s evidence that he (Mr Edwin Beaman) was born in 1967. Mr \nEdwin Beaman\u2019s evidence was that his father was born \u201cthere in Wiluna\u201d, although he doesn\u2019t know whether it was \non the Aboriginal reserve, or in the township. Mr Leroy Beaman\u2019s evidence was that Mr Roy Beaman was the first \nperson, at age 15, to go and work for non-Indigenous people on Yakabindie station. Interestingly, Mr Liberman \nrecords Roy Beaman as being born at Leonora: that is, to the south of the claim area rather than to the north of it. \nThis is not the only time where there appears to be interchangeability between areas to the north and to the south \nof the claim area, with the concept of \u201cWiluna\u201d possibly being a rather flexible one. Either way, whether he was born \nto the north or to the south, Roy Beaman was born close to the claim area.  Mr Leroy Beaman\u2019s grandmother and \n\n\n\nMr Edwin Beaman\u2019s mother, Ms Joyce Bond, was born in Mulga Queen and her parents were from around the \nWarburton Ranges. Mr Edwin Beaman said of his parents:At Warburton [Ranges] they have the same law as here \n[Tjiwarl claim area]. That\u2019s why my parents could understand each other. My mum spoke Ngyaanyatjarra language \nand my father spoke Tjupan but they could understand each other.  Mr Leroy Beaman described his great-\ngrandmother Ada Beaman as being from \u201cin-between Yakabindie and Mt Keith\u201d. Both these places are in the east \nof the claim area. Assuming his great-grandmother was more or less the same age as his great-grandfather, this \nwould place her in the claim area prior to the dates at which Daisy Bates was gathering information north of the \nclaim area. These dates are consistent with the evidence of Mr Leroy Beaman and Mr Edwin Beaman that Ada \nBeaman bought a house in Wiluna (the first Aboriginal person to do so) in the 1950s, which would place her in her \nearly 50s at this stage. I do not accept, as the State suggests, that this evidence may show Charlie and Ada \nBeaman did not stay very long in the claim area, and went instead to Wiluna. Whether both Charlie and Ada \nBeaman went to Wiluna, how long they stayed there and, indeed, whether Ada Beaman lived in the house are not \nthe subjects of any evidence.  I do not understand the State to have challenged Mr Leroy Beaman\u2019s evidence about \nwhere his great-grandmother was from. This evidence, together with what else is known about Ada and Charlie \nBeaman, would suggest they were indeed in the claim area at about the time Daisy Bates was gathering \ninformation.\n\nJune Tullock    Ms Tullock gave some brief evidence at Jones Creek about 12 km directly north of Yakabindie \nstation in the mid-eastern portion of the claim area. Ms Tullock said Jones Creek was the birthplace of her father, \nan acknowledged law man. However, she did not recognise the crossing where the Court sat to hear this evidence. \nShe was adamant the crossing was not concreted in the past when she had visited, but, more than this, her \nevidence was that she did not recognise the trees and surrounding country. In other words, she had in her \nmemory a different crossing to the one which she had been asked to identify as the birthplace of her father.  \nNevertheless, both on this occasion and subsequently, and despite questions from the State and various \ndocuments being shown to her that might contradict what she said, she adhered firmly, and in my opinion \ngenuinely, to her evidence that her father had told her he was born at Jones Creek and that other relatives had \nconfirmed this to her, including her father\u2019s aunt.  Ms Tullock gave the balance of her evidence at Yakabindie. On \nthis occasion, her evidence was clear. Like Ms Wonyabong, she was prepared to be quite firm about what she did \nand did not know and what she could and could not speak about. Her explanation for why the claim area was her \nngurra was that it was the birthplace of her father, but also that she grew up there, had been taught about the area, \nand knew the traditional stories. Her claim was thus more complex than simply descent.\n\nFamily connections  Ms Tullock was born in 1946 at Wiluna. Her mother came from Brookton and the Moore River \nmission, was \u201csent\u201d to Meekatharra, and then went to Wiluna with Ms Tullock\u2019s father. Ms Tullock\u2019s father was Ted \nTullock, also known as Scotty Tullock or Kirril. Scotty Tullock was the eldest of three boys and his mother was \ncalled Biddy Foley or Nyuringka. According to Ms Tullock, Biddy Foley was a \u201cfull blood Aboriginal woman\u201d. Doris \nFoley was one of her sisters. Trilby (or Manyila) was another sister.  Ms Tullock\u2019s evidence was that she could claim \nthe Tjiwarl area through her father and her paternal grandmother. Her grandmother died before Ms Tullock was \nborn and Ms Tullock frankly admitted she \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a clue\u201d when her father was born.  Dr Sackett records that \nScotty Tullock believed his father was John Anaeus Tolloch, a non-Indigenous man who perished south of Wiluna \nin January 1897. As Scotty Tullock died in approximately 2005, that would have made him very old indeed, but Dr \nSackett also records that other locals have disputed Scotty Tullock\u2019s view of his age and that one man, Tony Green, \nstated that Scotty Tullock began shaving in approximately 1931 or 1932. On the evidence, I consider it more likely \nthat Scotty Tullock was born in approximately 1915, as stated by Dr Sackett, and not in the late nineteenth century. \nThis is consistent with Ms Tullock\u2019s family history, to the effect that Scotty Tullock had three children before Ms \nTullock was born, all of whom were stolen. He had those children with another Aboriginal woman. Ms Tullock is the \nsecond eldest of Scotty Tullock\u2019s second family. It would seem her father must have been well into his thirties by \nthe time Ms Tullock was born. That would place his date of birth at around 1915.  Dr Sackett states that Scotty \nTullock\u2019s mother was Biddy Foley (or Nyuringka), who was said to have been born at Waru, a place to the north-\neast of Lake Carnegie, on the Carnegie pastoral lease. Based on the scale of the maps in evidence, Lake Carnegie \nis about 200 km from the north-eastern edge of the claim boundary. Ms Tullock\u2019s evidence was that she had never \nheard that her paternal grandmother was born out there and she repeated that her father was born in the claim area \nand so her grandmother was in the claim area at the time he was born. That is, around 1915.  Dr Sackett records \n\n\n\nclaims by Scotty Tullock that he was Tjupan man, having been through primary initiation rites in Wiluna and then \nalso further initiation rites on Barwidgee station.  There was some debate at trial about whether Scotty Tullock was \nin fact born at Jones Creek. The issue has significance because the State\u2019s case is that none of the apical \nancestors were born in the claim area, and were certainly not in the claim area around 1912 when Daisy Bates was \nconducting research to the north of the claim area.  Ms Tullock was adamant that her father was born at Jones \nCreek. Her father told her this, and he in turn was told this by his aunt, Doris Foley, who Ms Tullock described in the \nfollowing way in her evidence:Because she [Doris Foley] used to tell him off and growl about him when he used to \u2013 \nwhen he went up north. She said you wasn\u2019t ... She said you never born wherever, you know they say? He was \nborn in Jones Creek ... And she was a very close family and she had a lot to do with us growing up.  Ms Tullock \nalso gave some evidence about her great-grandmother, Biddy Foley\u2019s mother, being poisoned with flour at a place \nshe called \u201cPoison Creek\u201d, which on further questioning Ms Tullock clearly considered to be located within the claim \narea near Yakabindie, although she said she had never looked at it on a map. In other words, she was placing \nScotty Tullock\u2019s own grandmother in the claim area, at least towards the end of her life. This must have been well \nbefore 1915.  When shown, in cross-examination, birth certificates of herself and her brother which had an entry to \nthe effect that Scotty Tullock was born in Kalgoorlie or Leonora, Ms Tullock denied these were accurate.  The birth \ncertificates were neither proved nor tendered. I do not accept they are a reliable record of where an Aboriginal man, \nsuch as Scotty Tullock, was in fact born. There is any number of explanations, other than accuracy, for why towns \nsuch as Leonora and Kalgoorlie might have been nominated, whether by an official, by Mr Tullock, or by someone \nelse, and I note there is no evidence Mr Tullock nominated either of those towns as his birthplace. There is no other \nevidence about Mr Tullock living in these towns.  Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion is that Scotty Tullock was born at Jones \nCreek. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Scotty Tullock was born in the region of Jones Creek, in \napproximately 1915. I am also satisfied his grandmother was in the claim area at this time, as well as (obviously) his \nmother.  Ms Tullock also gave some evidence about \u201cKoyl\u201d being an uncle of Scotty Tullock. \u201cKoyl\u201d is one of the \nnames given to Jinguru, one of Bates\u2019 informants. Ms Tullock did not know what had happened to him, but gave the \nfollowing evidence:My dad spoke of him and as a \u2013 he was his uncle. He only just saw him on and off you know \nthrough the years because that old bloke sort of moved around a lot. ... And he was always in trouble, so they \ncalled him when he was passing through like they did in the early days. ... But I think he belonged around here to \nthese people.  I consider this to be a good example of one of the claimant witnesses speaking reliably from her \nmemory, unaffected by the circumstances of this claim. Ms Tullock\u2019s recollection of Jinguru being seen as a \ntroublemaker is consistent with Bates\u2019 account of him being imprisoned on Rottnest Island. Despite the \nconsiderable amount of evidence about Jinguru in this proceeding, Ms Tullock did not embellish or expand her \naccount. I am satisfied she spoke from her genuine recollection of her oral family history and I found her account \nreliable and persuasive.\n\nAllan James    Mr James gave some brief evidence at Tjiwarl, known also by its European name of Logan Spring. \nHe claims that country through his father, Dempsey James. On the second occasion he gave evidence, at \nLeinster, he gave a firm account of his knowledge coming from what his father had told him. He was quite clear \nregarding how he understood rights to country arise.\nFamily connections  Mr James was born in 1968 at Kalgoorlie hospital. His father was Dempsey James, who was \nborn in about 1922, although Mr James thinks it could have been before that. Dr Sackett\u2019s first report places \nDempsey James\u2019 year of birth as 1924.  Dempsey James was born \u201cunder a tree\u201d near Wongawol. His father was \nnon-Indigenous. Mr James\u2019 evidence is that his father ran away from Wongawol and came into the claim area when \nhe was about eight or nine years old, staying with a \u201cmob\u201d at Albion Downs. This would have been in the early \n1930s. He gave some evidence about who the \u201cmob\u201d at Albion Downs might have been. He says (at [17] and [30] of \nhis witness statement):Dad told me that there was a mob that lived near the old homestead at Albion that he knew \nand he stayed with them for a while, before he got a job there as a station hand. Those old people stayed at the old \nhomestead until the last of them, an old man nicknamed old Wati, passed away. I never saw that old Wati but my \nsisters have memories of old Wati visiting Albion and our place for weekly stores.\n\n ...\n\n\n\n Most of the people that I have memories with are people from this claim. The only memory that I have is that there \nwas a mob at Albion already when he came across. The language wasn\u2019t that \u201cthat mob were here before us\u201d it was \njust \u201cthat old mob that were here\u201d. I never heard any names for those old people.  Mr James also gave evidence \nabout his understanding and living memory of the history of Aboriginal occupation of and connection with the claim \narea. At [39]-[40] of his witness statement, he says:From my living memory the people that were living in this area \nhad always been there; there was always a connection to this country. I don\u2019t have any other memories that there \nwas any animosity or clash between different groups as regards to ownership ...\n\n My dad never spoke of anyone who came before him for this country but he did say that there were families \naround there at the same time that he moved across to Albion that he knew from Wiluna way.  And, at [63] of his \nwitness statement, he discusses his understanding of the migration of people from east of Wiluna into the claim \narea in the early 1900s:What the timeframe of that migration was, I\u2019m not sure, but my understanding is that there \nwas a lot of law business happening over in this claim area anyway, so the migration wasn\u2019t such a noticeable \nthing, because they were often going to that area.  Dempsey James\u2019 mother was Fanny James or Tjilu, also called \nTjilunga Tjilu, who was said to have been a Tjupan woman born in about 1905 at a hotel located about 30 km from \nAgnew or Lawlers and, according to Dr Sackett\u2019s first report, inside the claim area. Dr Sackett records Tjilu\u2019s mother \nas a woman called Biddy (not Biddy Foley, Scotty Tullock\u2019s mother), who was said to have been from Wongawol. \nThere is no evidence about where Biddy lived or travelled.\n\nBrett Lewis    Mr Lewis was an impressive witness. His adopted father was a senior law man named Scotty Lewis or \nNgumbu. Although Mr Lewis was adopted, this did not prevent his father from sharing a significant amount of \nknowledge with him. However, as Mr Lewis candidly recognised, there were limits on the knowledge his father \ncould pass on to him because Mr Lewis had not been through the law. Mr Lewis gave open evidence and then \nsome evidence with a limited number of women present.  My impression was that Mr Lewis knew his country very \nwell, that he knew the stories associated with it, and that he had been taught those stories by his father, who, as a \nlawman for the area, had authority to speak for the places Mr Lewis discussed in his evidence. Even though Mr \nLewis himself declined to characterise his role as speaking for the country, he accepted that he had been chosen \nto give evidence about certain parts of the country because he knew them best.  On his second tranche of \nevidence at Leinster, Mr Lewis remained a most impressive witness. He was very clear about what he could and \ncould not say about Koara country: he could speak about country that was his father\u2019s country and identified as \nKoara, because his father shared knowledge with him about those areas; but he otherwise could not draw \nboundaries in respect of country which other people spoke for. In the course of cross-examination about the \nboundaries of Koara country, the following exchange occurred:MR RANSON: Well, you \u2013 you tell me. Where do \nyou think that Koara country runs to today in this claim area?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: I\u2019m just taking it off my father\u2019s side. The \u2013 you know, where he was custodian and looked after \nand called it his \u2013 his area. So I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not Koara claim or it\u2019s not Tjiwarl country or whatever. So I\u2019m just \ntalking on behalf of what he told me in that area where we went yesterday. So ... I\u2019m not saying, \u201cWell, no, that\u2019s \nKoara; no, this is part of Tjiwarl\u201d, or this or that. No, I\u2019m not saying that. ... I\u2019m just talking on behalf of the area that \nmy father showed me and was custodian of.\n\n MR RANSON: Yes. Yes. I know that\u2019s the area - - -\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR RANSON: - - - you\u2019re talking for - - -\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Mm.\n\n MR RANSON: - - - in this claim.\n\n\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR RANSON: But if \u2013 let\u2019s pretend there were no Native Title claims at all,\n\n anywhere ... and I met you here and said ... \u201cWhere is Koara country?\u201d.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: I would - - -\n\n MR RANSON: Where would it go?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: I\u2019d say, well, that\u2019s the country I can take you to and talk to and show you, Booylgoo, Depot, \nbecause that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told from my father. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s his ngurra, that\u2019s his tjukurrpa, that\u2019s his parna. \nSo that\u2019s \u2013 you know, that\u2019s his country.\n\n MR RANSON: Okay.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: But not only his country, and there\u2019s other families too. So \u2013 but I\u2019m just here telling you that\u2019s \nwhat he told me. That\u2019s his run. He \u2013 he looked after that area.\n\n ...\n\n MR RANSON: So \u2013 so, in your mind, that \u2013 that idea of Koara country ... is mixed up with where your father\u2019s \ncountry \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean mixed up in the sense that it\u2019s wrong, but it \u2013 your idea of where Koara country is is \nconnected to where your father\u2019s country was.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR RANSON: Okay.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: You know, it\u2019s connected to the \u2013 to this Tjiwarl area and ... other overlap claims that was put on \nthere in the past. \n\n ...\n\n MR RANSON: It may be a very specific question. So if we went to Mount Keith, where the mine is? ... Is that still in \nKoara country in your mind, or is that north?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Oh, I \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s in Koara country or it\u2019s not in Koara country or that it\u2019s in \u2013 in the \u2013 \nsomebody else\u2019s country. But I \u2013 I go off of the people who speak for that country.\n\n MR RANSON: Okay.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Who \u2013 who\u2019ve got knowledge and can tell, you know, stories and the tjukurr [an abbreviation of \nTjukurrpa] about that country. So I\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s Koara country. No, that\u2019s not Koara \ncountry\u201d, because I \u2013 I\u2019m not about that.  In my opinion, some of the cross-examination of Mr Lewis revealed \nconfusion on the part of the State about the approach claim group members took to speaking about their rights to \n\n\n\ncountry. Mr Lewis\u2019 evidence made clear the distinction between being a member of a group entitled to an area of \ncountry and being a person who could speak publicly and authoritatively about particular parts of that country.\n\nFamily connections  Mr Lewis was born in 1965 in Leonora hospital. His adopted father, Scotty Lewis, was born \naround 1917 or 1919 in Lancefield, just outside Laverton. Mr Lewis described his father\u2019s birth in his evidence: his \nfather\u2019s parents were on a ceremony trip and his grandmother, who was heavily pregnant, gave birth to his father \nwhile on that trip. She then stayed in Lancefield while his grandfather continued on to Burtville for the ceremony. \nBurtville was, Mr Lewis stated, a \u201cbig ceremony ground\u201d in those times; that is, in the early twentieth century.  \nBurtville was also a goldfields township about 30 km south-east of Laverton. I find Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence about \nBurtville to be an example of a place being identified by its European township name, but I consider no significance \nshould be attached to the use of that name: what is significant is the general region indicated by Mr Lewis\u2019s \nevidence. The \u201cLancefield\u201d to which Mr Lewis referred was Lancefield gold mine, located about 8 km north of \nLaverton. Again, I take this evidence as indicating the general region in which these events occurred, rather than \nthe reference to the Lancefield gold mine meaning any more than this.  Mr Lewis\u2019s adoptive mother was originally \nfrom just outside the Warburton Ranges, much further to the east. He described in his evidence how she came to \nbe at Mount Margaret Mission, rather closer to the claim area:My mother\u2019s name was Mary Forward. My mother\u2019s \nWongai name was Liddiwarra, which means long neck. She comes from Blackstone, Jameson, Wingellina; out \nbeside the Warburton Ranges. She was part of the Simms family. She came over when she was about ten years \nold. She came over traveling for ceremony. She came down towards Tjuntjuntjarra, Neale Junction way, for \nceremony, and then she come back to Burtville to the big ceremony ground there. When she got to Burtville, for the \nceremony, nearby Laverton was a bit of a town. The missionaries were running around and catching kids for Mount \nMargaret Mission. She got caught, and stayed there in the mission for a few weeks before she run away, and came \nthrough towards Lancefield, Nambi and Leonora with the mob. She never went back to her home country to live.  \nMr Lewis\u2019s evidence was that he was never told the names of his grandparents because people did not like to say \nthe names of those who had died. This evidence, which I accept, is an example referred to by Dr Sackett as part of \nthe explanation why there is little positive identification of those Aboriginal people who may have been occupying \nthe claim area and its surrounds at sovereignty or first contact. But given Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence about his father\u2019s \ndate of birth, it is clear that his grandparents were adults in the early twentieth century, around the time of Daisy \nBates\u2019 work.  As Dr Sackett noted, one important aspect of Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence was the way he described how his \nfather acquired knowledge of country and sites. Mr Lewis recounted being shown sites by his father that \u201che had \nbeen shown by the old people\u201d. Who these old people were is contentious. On some occasions these references \nwere, as Dr Sackett pointed out, likely to be references to the claim group members\u2019 ancestors. However, given Mr \nLewis\u2019s father\u2019s age, this can only be a reference to Aboriginal people who held traditional knowledge about the \nTjukurrpa and sites of the claim area in the late 1920s or early 1930s. There is nothing in the State\u2019s working \nhypotheses (or those of Dr Brunton) about who those people might be. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s thesis is \nclear: there were at least some people in the claim area, or who knew about the claim area, who recognised the \nentitlement of people like Mr Lewis\u2019s father to learn the Tjukurrpa and learn about the sites in the claim area.  Scotty \nLewis told Mr (Brett) Lewis about Scotty Lewis\u2019s uncles and aunties at Darlot and Weebo \u201ccoming through here\u201d. \nTaking into account Mr Lewis\u2019s other evidence in his witness statement at [35] (where he described his father telling \nhim about the \u201cold people\u201d who came from Weebo and \u201c[t]hrough Agnew and Yakabindie station to North End, and \nthrough to the Barwidgee area\u201d \u2013 all places in the eastern part of the claim area or close to it), and the evidence he \ngave when at the site of \u2018The Lady\u2019, in my opinion this was a reference to the movement of Western Desert people \nfrom around Darlot into the claim area, and areas close to it.  One story told by Mr Lewis, about his father having a \njob as a tracker for the Leonora police, placed his father in and around Leonora when he was approximately 20 or \n25 years old: that is, in the late 1930s or early 1940s. Mr Lewis described his father being given a pushbike with \ncane wheels, and how his father would ride it up and down the Leonora road, taking the law stick to Agnew (which \nis on the southern boundary of the claim area) and across to Darlot and to Dada, which are both to the east of the \nclaim area. Where Scotty Lewis was before this is unclear on the evidence.  However it is clear from the remainder \nof Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence regarding how he learned the Tjukurrpa and about the sites and lands of the claim area, that \nhis father was intimately familiar with all parts of the claim area, and in particular with the western parts. I am \nprepared to find that, at least from some point in the 1930s, Scotty Lewis was recognised as one of the men who \nhad knowledge of the Tjukurrpa and sites of the claim area. How and when he acquired that knowledge is less \nclear.\n\n\n\nVictor Ashwin    Mr Victor Ashwin is the son of Mr Allan Ashwin. Both father and son gave evidence on country out \nnear Mount Townsend and Mount Marion in a restricted men\u2019s session, as well as in Leinster. The evidence in the \nrestricted session was given partly individually and partly by the group, in the sense of one man adding, \nsupplementing or correcting what another had said.  Mr Victor Ashwin had been chosen by the group of senior men \npresent in the restricted session to give the principal evidence in that session. All men present were wati. He was \nthe youngest of the four witnesses. He clearly took his role very seriously, and was careful and deliberate in what \nhe had to say. I accept he has been chosen as one of the wati who is to carry on the law and knowledge for this \nclaim area. That said, his age nevertheless has an effect on the weight I place on historical aspects of his evidence. \nThe fact-finding in this case is complex, and there are parts which focus on trying to piece together what happened \nat earlier points in history, both in and outside the claim area. Then there are other parts which focus on \nunderstanding what are the traditional laws and customs said to connect the claim group members with the land \nand waters in the claim area, and to have always done so. On the latter topic, I give substantial weight to Mr Victor \nAshwin\u2019s evidence. On the former topic, I give less weight because he is, as far as I can see, one generation further \nremoved from events than his father, Mr Allan Ashwin. I place more weight on Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence in those \ncircumstances. I emphasise that approach is not intended to challenge or diminish Mr Victor Ashwin\u2019s standing \nwithin his community, but rather to recognise that, being a younger man, his knowledge and experience of some \nhistorical matters is further removed than that of his father\u2019s generation.\n\nAllan Ashwin    Mr Allan Ashwin was an impressive witness. He spoke with great authority and I had the strong \nimpression that he spoke from direct knowledge and experience, in particular from long and close association with \nold people from the claim area, including his own ancestors.  The fact that he is one generation closer to those old \npeople than his son, Mr Victor Ashwin, gave me some cause to rely more heavily on his evidence. That is not to \ndetract from Mr Victor Ashwin\u2019s evidence; rather, it is to acknowledge that closer connections by way of being of a \ndifferent generation can enhance the reliability and persuasiveness of descriptions of historical events.  Mr Allan \nAshwin was not only a witness of great depth of knowledge, but was also quick to correct what was said by others if \nhe saw it as inaccurate or incomplete. In this sense, I find he was intent on ensuring the most accurate evidence \nwas given by the claimant witnesses.\n\nHenry Ashwin    Mr Henry Ashwin is the younger brother of Mr Allan Ashwin and the uncle of Mr Victor Ashwin.  Mr \nHenry Ashwin was not comfortable in the restricted session. It appeared to me that he did not really approve of it \noccurring with a female judge, although he did seem to acknowledge the necessity for it. He was the person who \ninterjected the most to warn Mr Victor Ashwin when he thought Mr Ashwin was saying too much. He left about \nhalfway through the restricted session.  I drew no adverse inference from his departure: rather, it seemed to me he \nsimply felt he was unable to stay any longer in circumstances where he was clearly concerned that what was \noccurring was not in accordance with his traditional laws and customs.  Mr Henry Ashwin\u2019s discomfort at sharing \nhis knowledge outside his own community continued when he gave open evidence in Leinster. I have no difficulty \nrelying on his witness statement because I consider him to be a genuine and honest witness. However, little was \nadded through his oral evidence.\n\nFamily connections: Victor, Allan and Henry Ashwin  Mr Allan Ashwin was born in approximately 1951. He was born \nin Weld Springs in what he described as \u201cWindidda country\u201d. Windidda pastoral station is approximately 165 km \nnorth-east of the claim area. Mr Ashwin is a native title holder under the Wiluna determination. His father\u2019s name \nwas Alfie Ashwin or Wamultjukurr, although Mr Victor Ashwin also gave evidence that Alfred Ashwin\u2019s Martu name \nwas Yalpie, and this name was sometimes used in the evidence instead. Alfie Ashwin\u2019s sister was Doris Foley. Mr \nAllan Ashwin\u2019s evidence was that his father was born \u201caround Barwidgee\u201d. Again, I do not take that to indicate only \nthe location of the homestead of Barwidgee station, but rather to encompass other parts of the station itself. He was \na lawman for parts of the claim area (Yeelirrie, Albion Downs and Yakabindie). Neither Mr Allan Ashwin nor Mr \nVictor Ashwin gave evidence about Alfie Ashwin\u2019s date of birth, but Dr Sackett records that he was born near \nBarwidgee in approximately 1920.  Alfie Ashwin\u2019s father was Tom Wanal or Jinapika, who is buried at Six Mile \nCreek near Wiluna. He died when Mr Allan Ashwin was going to school, perhaps in the late 1950s or early 1960s. \nThis means, given the approximate date of birth of Alfie Ashwin (1920), that Tom Wanal may have been born \naround the turn of the century, or earlier.  Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s paternal grandmother was Telfa Ashwin. Mr Ashwin \ndescribed her country as \u201caround Windidda and Yelma and Wongawol, Lorna Glen around Carnegie and all that \n\n\n\narea\u201d.  Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s mother was Rosy Wongawol or Tjipinka. She was Martu. His maternal grandfather was \nfrom Carnegie country, near Wongawol, and her name was Nimangka or Tjinapika. His maternal grandmother was \na Martu woman named Lilly Wongawol or Munta. According to Mr Henry Ashwin (Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s brother), Rosy \nWongawol was from the Birriliburu determination area (near Glen Ayle pastoral station), not Tjiwarl.  There was no \nsense from the evidence of Mr Allan, Mr Henry or Mr Victor Ashwin that their ancestors had consciously moved into \ncountry they were not familiar with, or with which they had no connection. Rather their evidence suggested (as did \nthat of some of the other witnesses) that their ancestors moved around country to which they considered they had \nrights, interests and connections \u2013 evidenced from their passing on of knowledge to the claim group members\u2019 \nparents and to the claim group members themselves. Indeed, Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence was that there were \nalready connections between the old people in the claim area (which I understood to be a reference to those \nAboriginal people who were in and around the claim area prior to the start of the twentieth century) and families \nsuch as his own, through law business.  The State submits that there is no direct evidence of when Alfie Ashwin \nmight have first come into the claim area, but that the Court should find it was during his children\u2019s childhood in the \n1950s because he migrated to work at Yeelirrie and Albion Downs. I doubt that is the case if he was born in \nBarwidgee, immediately adjacent to the claim area, but I accept there is simply an absence of evidence on this \npoint.\n\nLuxie Hogarth    Ms Luxie Hogarth was an elderly witness whose memory was fading a little, but her evidence was \nnonetheless clear in terms of her own family and life history. She did not add substantively to the contents of her \nwitness statement. She did confirm, in reasonably firm terms, the status and role of Waiya, who seems to be the \noldest ancestor of the claim group, and of the Hogarth family in particular. She also gave some evidence about \nhaving met Rosie Jones, or Tjalajuti, who was Waiya\u2019s daughter and the ancestor of Ms Hogarth\u2019s husband, \nWimmie Redmond.  However, Ms Hogarth made it clear that the claim area is not her ngurra and that what she \nknows comes from a long and obviously close and loving marriage to her husband. That does not necessarily \ndiminish the weight to be attached to that knowledge, but simply places her evidence in a slightly different category.\n\nGeraldine Hogarth    Ms Geraldine Hogarth spoke eloquently and in detail about her country and her people\u2019s \ncustoms and laws as she understood them. She clearly felt very strongly about past injustices and the need to \nspeak out now to claim country. In that sense she was one of the more forthright witnesses in the proceeding.  I \nwas impressed by her evidence in the sense that it was given genuinely and from her heart. I accept what she says \nis what she has learned, especially from her \u201cuncle-dad\u201d. It was clarified in cross-examination that her participation \nin the Wongatha claim (see Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v Western Australia (No 9) [2007] \nFCA 31; 238 ALR 1 (Wongatha)) stemmed from a claim to that country through her mother, and can be put to one \nside.\n\nFamily connections: Luxie and Geraldine Hogarth  As Ms Luxie Hogarth is the mother of Ms Geraldine Hogarth, I \nhave grouped them together for the purpose of discussing their family connections.  Ms Luxie Hogarth was born in \n1941 at Moore River at Mogumba Mission, which is on the coast of Western Australia north of Perth, although her \nmother was from Darlot and was only visiting her sister at Moore River when Ms Hogarth was born.  Ms Luxie \nHogarth was the oldest witness in the proceeding. Her mother\u2019s name was Kugila, or Daisy Cordella, and her father \nwas a Bunuba man from the Kimberleys named Peter Hogarth. Kugila was from Darlot and Ms Hogarth\u2019s evidence \nwas that \u201c[h]er mother, and her grandmother, and her grandfather, they were always there, living in the Darlot area\u201d. \nI have made findings at [340] to [352] above about what comprises the Darlot area.  Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s husband \nwas Wimmie Redmond, who is now deceased. Ms Luxie Hogarth claims through Mr Redmond as his wife and Ms \nGeraldine Hogarth claims through Mr Redmond as his daughter. Mr Redmond\u2019s grandmother was Rosie Jones, or \nTjalajuti. There was more evidence about Rosie Jones than there was about her children (that is, Mr Redmond\u2019s \nparents). This is consistent with some of the observations made by Dr Sackett (with Dr Brunton making a similar \nstatement) to the effect that, under Western Desert laws and customs, a person can take the country of a \ngrandparent. This issue came up in the expert evidence in the context of a dispute about the inferences that could \nbe drawn from the Bates material, which did not itself show examples of connections to country through \ngrandparents. Dr Brunton concluded the absence of examples in Daisy Bates\u2019 material of people taking rights in \ncountry through grandparents meant the taking of rights in country by the Ngaiawonga was not in accordance \nwith Western Desert law. Dr Sackett disagreed, saying:Western Desert people are able to take the country of a \n\n\n\ngrandparent, but they need not do so. That there is no evidence in the Bates materials of it happening does not \nmean that it did not happen. In any event, as Dr Brunton points out, there are cases in the Bates materials were \n[sic] it is wholly unclear how or why a person was Ngaiuwonga. It is possible that some of these cases were \ninstances of people taking the country/identity of a grandparent.  This is an example where Dr Brunton too readily \nsought to draw absolute conclusions from the absence of information in the Bates records. I prefer the opinion of Dr \nSackett. In relation to Wimmie Redmond, I consider the emphasis on him acquiring knowledge and rights from his \ngrandparents is consistent with Western Desert laws and customs being practised over the claim area early in the \ntwentieth century.  Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence records earlier anthropologists being told by Rosie Jones\u2019s great \ngrandson:Nyinyitjim/ James Calyun (SSN 6/129), said of her, \u201cShe\u2019s from that area there, in the [claim] map.\u201d His \nview in this regard was supported by other family members at a meeting in Leonora on 1 March 2011, where it was \nheld that Tjulyitjutu/Rosie was born in Tjiwarl country.  What Ms Luxie Hogarth knew about Rosie Jones/Tjalajuti \nwas that she lived around Albion Downs, Yeelirrie and Wiluna. This was also Ms Geraldine Hogarth\u2019s evidence, \nalthough she added Agnew-Lawlers and Sir Samuel to the list. Rosie Jones was married to Andy Fisher, who was \ntherefore Wimmie Redmond\u2019s paternal grandfather, who seems to have been from Wongawol. Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s \nevidence is that, later, Andy Fisher was with another wife called Dulcie Fisher who was an aunt to, amongst others, \nMs Shirley and Ms Lizzie Wonyabong. I note this as an illustration of the connections between the families in the \nclaim group.  Ms Hogarth\u2019s evidence was that Andy Fisher and Rosie Jones showed her husband the country in \nthe Tjiwarl claim area and told him all the Tjukurrpa for the area.  Rosie Jones\u2019s father was Waiya. Waiya was \ntherefore Wimmie Redmond\u2019s great-grandfather. If Ms Hogarth\u2019s husband, Wimmie Redmond, was her age, then \nhis grandmother, Rosie Jones, would have been born in the nineteenth century. Ms Hogarth met Rosie Jones when \nMs Hogarth was about 18, which would be around 1959 or 1960. Ms Hogarth said that Rosie Jones was then older \nthan Ms Hogarth was at the time of her evidence; namely 75. If Rosie Jones/Tjalajuti was about 75 in 1960, that \nwould mean she was born in about 1885.  That would place Waiya\u2019s date of birth well back in the nineteenth \ncentury. However, Ms Geraldine Hogarth\u2019s evidence was that Waiya was buried on Albion Downs, but that he was \nstill alive in the late 1950s. Dr Sackett\u2019s report also records that he was buried on Albion Downs, although it would \nappear his informant for this was Ms Geraldine Hogarth herself. Therefore, even if he was an old man in the 1950s, \nthat would mean he may have been born around 1870. This might mean Ms Hogarth\u2019s estimate about Rosie \nJones\u2019s age when she met her in 1960 is not quite accurate because it does not leave enough of an age gap \nbetween father (Waiya) and daughter (Rosie Jones). Further, Rosie Jones being born in the nineteenth century \ndoes not fit quite so well with the age of Wimmie Redmond, even allowing for him to have been born (as the eldest \nson, it must be recalled) quite a few years before Ms Hogarth in 1941.  On balance, these discrepancies are small. \nOn any view, the evidence of Ms Luxie and Ms Geraldine Hogarth would have Waiya born in the last quarter of the \nnineteenth century and his daughter born around or before the turn of the century.  Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s evidence \nabout Waiya was:I never saw old Waiya, but I heard from my husband, who told me the story about his parents and \ngrandparents, roaming around that middle country \u2013 round Albion Downs and that spring called Pii \u2013 and then back \nto Wiluna, and all around that area. Pii, that spring, it belonged to that old man Waiya, and he looked after that area \nright until he passed away. He was buried there too. Waiya, his last name was Hill. My husband said that he was \nhis great-great-grandfather. My husband told me all the story for Waiya.\n\n ...\n\n My husband was telling me about the tjukurrpa, and I got to listen to him, learn what he told me. But I can\u2019t talk for \nthat country, because that\u2019s his parents\u2019 country. My husband told me that his great, great grandfather \u2013 old Mr \nHill \u2013 he was looking after that spring Pii at Albion Downs, and then he got old and passed away there. And that \nsnake must still be there. Mr Hill was looking after that tjukurr because he belonged there, he was from there. He \nmust have been taught to look after it. If he hadn\u2019t looked after it, the water would go dry and it would be nothing, \nhe\u2019d know no stories for that area.  The account of a connection between Waiya and the site known as Pii, and the \nTjukurrpa there, is important. Given the age of Waiya, it is probable in my opinion that this responsibility existed \nearly in the twentieth century, or perhaps in the late nineteenth century.  Ms Geraldine Hogarth was born in 1959 in \nLeonora. Her early years were spent on Yeelirrie station. She was brought up by her \u201cuncle\u201d father, Wimmie \nRedmond, not by her biological father. She identified Wimmie Redmond as coming from Wiluna and said his \ncountry included Lorna Glen (which is in the Wiluna determination area), Wongawol, Albion Downs, Yeelirrie, \n\n\n\nAgnew and Sir Samuel. The last four places named are inside the claim area. Her evidence was that, although she \ndoes not know when Wimmie Redmond was born, he was a \u201cbit older than my mum\u201d. As I have noted, Ms Luxie \nHogarth was born in 1941, so it is a reasonable inference that Wimmie Redmond might have been born in the mid-\n1930s.  Ms Geraldine Hogarth gave evidence about longstanding connections and relationships between Western \nDesert people to the east of the claim area and people in the claim area. She described having been told by the old \npeople about a \u201croad\u201d from Darlot to Mount Sir Samuel and about women coming from Darlot to Depot Springs to \nperform a ceremony in relation to the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa. Consistently with this, she also explained that the \n\u201cmob\u201d from Darlot and Wongawol were the same people as those from Albion Downs and Yeelirrie because \u201cwe \nfollow the same law\u201d.  In his first report, Dr Sackett records that Rosie Jones was born in around 1910 and died in \n1979. That places her, and her father Waiya, in the claim area a little later than the Hogarths\u2019 evidence. However, \neven on this hypothesis, both Rosie Jones and Waiya would have been in the claim area by the time of Bates\u2019 \nreports in 1912. There is no suggestion they identified themselves, or that anyone else identified them, as \n\u201cNgaiawonga\u201d. The State accepts the Hogarths are Western Desert people. It follows that it must accept their \nancestors were also Western Desert people.\n\nDallas Harris    Ms Harris\u2019s evidence was clearly given and measured, in the sense that she was forthright about \naccepting the limits of her knowledge and in disclosing the fact that she had spent a considerable amount of time \naway from the country in the claim area. Nevertheless, she has returned to the area and it is clear she feels a \nstrong connection to it. She claims through her father\u2019s family and gave some helpful evidence about their activities \nin the claim area.\n\nFamily connections  Ms Harris claims through her paternal grandfather, Tarrukati, also known as Tjampula. Ms \nHarris\u2019s evidence was that he was also called \u201cJumbo Harris\u201d because non-Indigenous people could not say his \nAboriginal name. Ms Harris was born in 1969 in Leonora hospital. She has two older brothers.  Her mother was \nEileen Harris (n233;e Jones), who was born in Wiluna and grew up in the Wiluna determination area. Ms Harris is \nalso a native title holder on the Wiluna determination.  Her maternal grandmother was Kitty Hill (or Yungkutjuru) and \nshe came from Carnegie station, which is in the Wiluna determination area to the east of the Tjiwarl claim area.  Ms \nHarris\u2019s father was James Harris, and her evidence was that he was born in a creek bed \u201calong on the Agnew to \nLeonora road, in Lawlers country\u201d. Agnew is a town sitting just outside the claim boundary to the south, and \nLeonora is further south and a little east, with the township of Lawlers in between them. Ms Harris said her father \ngrew up at Mount Margaret mission, which is further east towards Laverton.  Ms Harris\u2019s evidence was that her \nfather\u2019s parents travelled around a lot on law business and with the seasons, moving from east of Mulga Queen, \nthen back through Mulga Queen and onto Wiluna, every three to six months. Dr Sackett\u2019s research confirmed that \nthe family did appear to move around through those areas.  Ms Harris\u2019s paternal grandfather had the same name \n(Tarrukati) as a creek near Carnegie, and she learned that the area around the creek was her grandfather\u2019s \ncountry. Her paternal grandmother was from Mount Margaret Mission. Ms Harris\u2019s evidence was that Jumbo Harris \ncame from an area called Thurraguddy Creek (or Tarrukati), between Windidda and Mungkali, close to Carnegie. Dr \nSackett describes this area in the following terms in his Tjiwarl Registration Report (Attachment 2 to his first report \nin this proceeding):Tarrukati is a site (in the vicinity of places mapped as Thurraguddy Creek, Thurraguddy Bore \nand Thurraguddy Trucking Yards) on Wongawol Pastoral Lease, on the Wiluna claim area.  As the crow flies that is \nabout 160 to 170 km from the north-eastern boundary of the claim area. According to Ms Harris, that is where she \nwas told Jumbo Harris \u201ccame from and grew up ... hunted ... and practiced his culture\u201d. As Dr Sackett points out in \nhis first report, this area was on the Wongawol pastoral lease and was the area where, in the early 1930s, there \nwas considerable violence and antagonism towards Aboriginal people.  Ms Harris\u2019s evidence was that her \ngrandfather Jumbo\u2019s \u201cboundary\u201d would have been from Thurraguddy Creek, down to Leonora, around Kaluwiri \n(which is the centre of the claim area) and up to Wiluna. She identified in her evidence the old people who told her \nabout this.  Ms Harris\u2019s evidence was that, after her grandfather married her grandmother, they moved towards the \ngoldfields area and \u201ccame in from the bush\u201d to Leonora. She was told by her aunties that they were \u201cthe first old \npeople at the old reserve in Leonora\u201d.  Ms Harris does not put any dates around these events in her evidence. Dr \nSackett estimates in his first report that Jumbo Harris was born in about 1890. He also notes that Norman Tindale \nshowed Jumbo Harris and Telpha (or Telfa) Ashwin as siblings, but the Harris family dispute this.  On the evidence, \nand accepting Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence about Jumbo Harris\u2019s date of birth, it seems that Jumbo Harris was moving in \nand around the claim area with his parents at or around the turn of the century.\n\n\n\nDouglas Bingham    Mr Bingham claims through his mother, Kathleen Bingham, whom he thinks was born in about \nthe 1920s. Her father, Mr Bingham\u2019s grandfather, was (he said) \u201cone of the big law men\u201d for the Tjiwarl area, \nalthough in oral evidence he said he was from the Laverton area, which is some way south-east of the claim area. \nIn his witness statement, Mr Bingham identified his grandfather as Mickey Warren, but in oral evidence he stated \nthat he called both Mickey and Tommy Warren (who were brothers) \u201cgrandfather\u201d and that both were law men.  \nDuring cross-examination, Mr Bingham said that Ruby Shay was a sister to Jumbo Harris, but it was difficult to tell \nwhether he was sure about that or just agreeing with the question put to him. That relationship is suggested by Dr \nSackett but not confirmed.  Mr Bingham seemed a little reluctant to be giving evidence, which might be explained \nby the fact that, at the time, his brother Irwin was in hospital and Mr Bingham said Irwin would be the one to do the \ntalking in this trial, if he could.  Mr Bingham gave evidence about having seen people using spears and spear \nthrowers to give tribal punishment at funerals and gatherings, including recently, although he admitted that, if the \npolice saw that, people would get into trouble. He was clear that he could not \u201cget into that\u201d because it was a tribal \nthing.  He is a wati, and gave some restricted evidence.\n\nFamily connections  Mr Bingham was born in 1962 in Meekatharra but grew up with his maternal grandmother at \nCunyu station, which is about 80 km north of Wiluna. His father was from Fitzroy Crossing in the Kimberleys, but Mr \nBingham said he does not think he could claim in that area because he does not know it. His evidence was that his \nmother was from around Leonora and \u201cfrom that Tjiwarl area\u201d. Dr Sackett\u2019s report records Mr Bingham informing Dr \nSackett that his mother was born in the Kathleen Valley in the claim area, and that is where she took her European \nname from. It appears this had been said before to Dr Sackett in preparation of his Tjiwarl Registration Report, \nwhere (at [41]) Dr Sackett records Mr Bingham as explaining his rights and interests in the claim area by saying \n\u201cWell my mother bin born here\u201d.  He is the youngest of 10 siblings, with four sisters and five brothers, so his parents \nmay have been born in approximately 1920, or perhaps earlier. Dr Sackett in his report puts Kathleen Bingham\u2019s \ndate of birth as circa 1924.  Mr Bingham\u2019s evidence is that both his maternal grandparents were from the claim \narea. His maternal grandfather was Mickey Warren, who was \u201cfrom around this Tjiwarl area\u201d and \u201cone of the big law \nmen around there\u201d. His maternal grandmother, Ruby Shay, was also from the claim area \u2013 she died in Wiluna but \nMr Bingham does not know where she was born. Dr Sackett records Kathleen Bingham\u2019s father as having been \nborn in approximately 1900 and her mother, Ruby Shay, as having been born in approximately 1910, although he \nalso names Tommy Warren rather than Mickey Warren as Kathleen Bingham\u2019s father. Dr Sackett also records \ninformation from Mr Bingham that Ruby Shay might have been born in the country covered by the Weebo pastoral \nlease, to the near east of the claim area, and that Ruby\u2019s mother was born in the Darlot area. Mickey Warren was \none of Mr Liberman\u2019s informants and Mr Liberman recorded Mickey Warren as being approximately 75 years old in \n1976, which places his date of birth at around 1901.\n\nTimmy Patterson    Mr Patterson was not called to give evidence in the proceeding, but his witness statement was \ntendered as an exhibit. I am prepared to accept the evidence set out in his witness statement.  Mr Patterson\u2019s \nevidence is that he is a member of the Gingirana native title claim group and a native title holder under the \nBirriliburu determination, the Martu determination (see Peterson v Western Australia[2013] FCA 518) and the \nWiluna determination. He was born in or around 1950 and his parents were both Kiyajarra, although later in life his \nmother married a Putijarra man who raised Mr Patterson as his son. He is a senior wati and elder, but his evidence \nis that the Tjiwarl claim area is not his country and he cannot speak for it.\nEXPERT EVIDENCE  \nDr Mark Clendon    Dr Clendon is an anthropological linguist. He was called by the applicant. At the time of giving \nhis evidence and preparing his reports, Dr Clendon was a lecturer and independent researcher associated with the \nUniversity of Adelaide. Dr Clendon has worked extensively with Western Australian languages and has prepared a \nnumber of reports for native title claims. Dr Clendon prepared two reports for use in the proceeding.\nDr Clendon\u2019s first report dated 29 May 2015  Dr Clendon\u2019s first report was prepared in the proceeding after \nreceiving a brief from Central Desert Native Title Services (CDNTS), the solicitors for the applicant. In his first \nreport, Dr Clendon draws conclusions about the Aboriginal languages spoken in the Tjiwarl claim area by reference \nto Jinguru\u2019s wordlist and the \u201cLawlers word list\u201d referred to by Daisy Bates. The three languages he identifies are \n(using his spelling) the Western Desert, Wajarri, and Badimaya languages. Dr Clendon\u2019s report refers to Dr \nSackett\u2019s first report of January 2014 and Dr Brunton\u2019s first report of March 2015.\n\n\n\nDr Clendon\u2019s supplementary report dated 4 August 2015  Dr Clendon\u2019s supplementary report dated 4 August 2015 \nwas prepared to address the opinions expressed in his earlier report at paragraphs [5], [7]-[10], [13], [15]-[19], [21]-\n[25], [32], [41] and [43] by reference to two important Badimaya language resources that came into Dr Clendon\u2019s \npossession after preparing his first report.\nDr Lee Sackett    Dr Lee Sackett prepared three expert anthropological reports in the proceeding at the request of \nthe applicant. I have set out Dr Sackett\u2019s qualifications and experience at [484].  It was Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence that \nhe commenced research into the claim area in 2000 or 2001 for what was then known as the Sir Samuel native title \nclaim. The Sir Samuel claim was discontinued and a number of other claims, including the Tjiwarl claim, were \nmade.\nDr Sackett\u2019s first report dated January 2014  Dr Sackett\u2019s first report was filed in the proceeding on 31 March 2014 \nand is dated January 2014. This report was filed in accordance with orders made by Barker J on 21 June 2013 and \norders made by Registrar Daniel on 18 October 2013. Dr Sackett undertook the research contained in his first \nreport for the purpose of the claim passing through the registration test with the Native Title Tribunal. Dr Sackett\u2019s \nfirst report amplifies his Tjiwarl Registration Report and also addresses specific questions the solicitors for the State \nasked to be addressed in the report, and which CDNTS included in their brief for the report dated 20 September \n2013. Dr Sackett\u2019s report provides an analysis of the claim area and an analysis and opinion on the origins of the \nclaim group.\nDr Sackett\u2019s further expert report dated May 2015  Dr Sackett\u2019s further expert report was filed in the proceeding on \n29 May 2015. This report was filed pursuant to orders made by Barker J on 5 September 2014, as varied by me on \n1 May 2015 and later on 20 May 2015. The purpose of Dr Sackett\u2019s further expert report was to respond to the \nexpert anthropological report by Dr Brunton filed by the State on 6 March 2015 and to address any revised opinions \nthat may have arisen in response to Dr Brunton\u2019s report.\nDr Sackett\u2019s supplementary expert report dated August 2015  Dr Sackett\u2019s supplementary report was filed on 3 \nSeptember 2015. This report included Dr Sackett\u2019s opinions after hearing the evidence of the claimant witnesses at \nthe connection hearing and responded to a series of questions put to him by the applicant following the connection \nhearing. The report also covers any additional evidence in reply to the evidence contained in Dr Clendon\u2019s linguistic \nreports of 29 May 2015 and 4 August 2015 and Dr Brunton\u2019s first report, and new and altered opinions arising from \nthe conference of experts.\nDr Ron Brunton    Dr Ron Brunton was called by the State. Dr Brunton has been involved in the discipline of \nanthropology for fifty years. Dr Brunton obtained his PhD in anthropology from La Trobe University and has lectured \nat Macquarie University, La Trobe University and the University of Papua New Guinea. Over the last twenty five \nyears, Dr Brunton has focused on a number of issues related to Australian Aboriginal people including native title, \ncultural heritage, social welfare and reconciliation. Dr Brunton has been retained by the State to provide \nanthropological reports for a number of native title claims in Western Australia and has also provided \nanthropological reports for respondent parties to native title claims in South Australia and Queensland. Dr Brunton \nprepared two reports for this proceeding.\nDr Brunton\u2019s first report dated March 2015  Dr Brunton\u2019s first expert anthropological report dated March 2015 \nresponds to a number of questions posed by the State and provides detailed comments on Dr Sackett\u2019s first report. \nIn summary, the specific questions Dr Brunton was asked to address in the expert report included his opinions on \nthe identity of the people and groups of people who held native title rights in the claim area at sovereignty, whether \nthe pre-sovereignty community maintained its identity and has continued to acknowledge and observe traditional \nlaws and customs without significant interruption from sovereignty to the present day and whether any persons \nhave rights in the claim area.\nDr Brunton\u2019s supplementary report dated October 2015  Dr Brunton\u2019s second report was filed in the proceeding on \n2 October 2015 and was limited to providing any new or altered expert opinions having regard to the Aboriginal \nwitnesses at the connection hearing, any additional expert opinions arising out of the expert conference, and any \nadditional evidence in reply to Dr Sackett or Dr Clendon.\nJoint report filed by the expert witnesses and the conference of experts    On 5 September 2014, Barker J ordered \nthat any experts whose reports have been filed in this proceeding must attend an experts\u2019 conference before a \nRegistrar of the Court to confer and prepare a joint statement addressing a list of issues to be agreed upon and \nprepared by the parties. On 23 October 2015, the applicant and the State filed a joint list of questions to be asked of \nboth Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton, focusing on anthropological issues about which the experts\u2019 opinions differed.  The \njoint questions asked of Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton covered a range of issues, separated broadly into four \n\n\n\ncategories: the nature and characteristics of the society of people occupying the claim area at sovereignty; the \nrights and interests in land that the occupants of the claim area possessed at sovereignty; the nature of the society \nof the claim area at present; and the claim group members\u2019 connection to the claim area.  The experts\u2019 conference \nwas held on Wednesday 24 and 25 June 2015 in Perth. The joint report was finalised and filed on 2 July 2015.  Dr \nSackett and Dr Brunton also participated in a concurrent evidence session on 28 and 29 October 2015. The parties \nagreed upon and filed a joint list of questions to be resolved at the concurrent evidence session. The hearing on 28 \nOctober commenced with counsel for the applicant and counsel for the State leading evidence in chief from their \nrespective experts. The concurrent evidence session followed, where the Court led the experts through the \nquestions that had been settled by the applicant and the State and the experts responded to each of these \nquestions in turn. Some of the concurrent evidence was given in a male gender restricted session. Both of the \nexperts were then cross-examined and re-examined.\n\nEvaluation of the expert witnesses    All three expert witnesses were diligent and cooperative in their approach to \nthe evidence in this matter. None expressed opinions that were unreasonable or obviously without foundation. I \nhave set out elsewhere in detail my reasons for accepting Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence, but in summary I found his \nexpertise impressive, and his opinions measured and appropriately qualified, but nevertheless firm in their ultimate \nconclusions.  As between Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton, I generally prefer the evidence of Dr Sackett. This is \nespecially so when dealing with the claimant evidence \u2013 not only because Dr Sackett had access to the claimant \nwitnesses and Dr Brunton did not, but also because of Dr Sackett\u2019s much longer and deeper familiarity with \nWestern Desert people and their customs and laws, in and around the claim area. I also preferred the evidence of \nDr Sackett in other aspects of the case. I found Dr Brunton\u2019s approach too document-based, and too literal. He \ntended to treat sources he worked with as having some absolute authority, without in my opinion making \nappropriate allowance for the time and context in which they were produced or recognising that they are only part of \nthe picture. He tended to analyse the sources with a degree of precision that was greater than they could properly \nbear. He was also too ready to draw inferences from what was not in the material, which again stemmed, in my \nopinion, from his tendency to see these sources as absolutely authoritative. This is no reflection on his qualifications \nand experience, which I accept are of a high standard. Nor is it a reflection on his approach during the trial, which \nwas always cooperative. Rather, it is his perspective and method with which I have some difficulty.\n\nAPPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES    It is fair to say there was no real dispute between the parties \u2013 at least on \nconnection issues \u2013 about the applicable legal principles, although there were differences in emphasis. It is also fair \nto say that the State\u2019s submissions tended to dissect and divide the components of s 223 in a way which I would \nprefer not to adopt entirely. For example, in [162] of its submissions, the State presents a summary of the \n\u201celements\u201d of proof of native title, and contends there are five steps. I do not read the authorities as requiring a five \nstep process in the order set out by the State.  The legislative scheme of the NT Act was recently reviewed and \nexplained by a Full Court of this Court in CG (Deceased) on behalf of the Badimia People v Western Australia \n[2016] FCAFC 67; 240 FCR 466 at [6]- [38]. At [7]-[8] the Full Court said:The main objects of the Native Title Act (s \n3) include providing for the recognition and protection of native title and establishing a \u201cmechanism for determining \nclaims to native title\u201d. The first of these objects, in particular, is intended to reflect the statement of intention in the \nPreamble to the Act that the people of Australia intend:\n\n (a) to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Act, announced at the \ntime of introduction of this Act into the Parliament, or agreed on by the Parliament from time to time, for securing the \nadequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and \n\n (b) to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the \nAustralian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them \nto aspire.\n\n The overview of the Native Title Act, set out in s 4, explains that the Act \u201crecognises and protects native title\u201d (s \n4(1)) and, essentially, \u201ccovers two topics\u201d (s 4(2)), being:\n\n (a) acts affecting native title (see subsections (3) to (6)); \n\n\n\n (b) determining whether native title exists and compensation for acts affecting native title (see subsection (7)).  It is \nas well to set out the terms of ss 225 and 223. Section 225 provides:A determination of native title is a \ndetermination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area) of land or \nwaters and, if it does exist, a determination of: \n\n (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; \nand \n\n (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and \n\n (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and \n\n (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this \nAct); and \n\n (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural \nlease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease--whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, \nuse and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.  Section 223 \nrelevantly provides:Common law rights and interests\n\n (1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights \nand interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where:(a) the rights and \ninterests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the \nAboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and\n\n (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land \nor waters; and\n\n (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.Hunting, gathering and fishing covered\n\n (2) Without limiting subsection (1), rights and interests in that subsection includes hunting, gathering, or fishing, \nrights and interests.  I have discussed the applicable principles in Dempsey on behalf of the Bularnu, Waluwarra \nand Wangkayujuru People v Queensland (No 2) [2014] FCA 528; 317 ALR 432 at [121]- [131] and [135]-[137] and I \nadopt those passages, and need not repeat them.  By way of further elaboration, there are two passages from \nJagot J\u2019s reasons for judgment in Wyman on behalf of the Bidjara People v Queensland (No 2) [2013] FCA 1229, \nwhich I would respectfully adopt. Her Honour\u2019s decision was upheld by the Full Court (Wyman v Queensland [2015] \nFCAFC 108; 235 FCR 464), including on her Honour\u2019s analysis of the applicable legal principles. At [450], Jagot J \nstated:As explained in Yorta Yorta, native title, being rights or interests in relation to land or waters, \u201csurvived the \nCrown\u2019s acquisition of sovereignty and radical title\u201d but such rights and interests \u201cowed their origin to a normative \nsystem other than the legal system of the new sovereign power\u201d, the normative system being \u201cthe traditional laws \nacknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous peoples concerned\u201d (at [37]). Accordingly, \u201cit \nis clear that the laws or customs in which those rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having \na normative content and deriving, therefore, from a body of norms or normative system \u2013 the body of norms or \nnormative system that existed before sovereignty\u201d (at [38]).  In this proceeding, the normative system upon which \nthe applicant relies is the system of traditional laws and customs followed by Western Desert people.  And at [454]-\n[455] her Honour stated:As to laws and customs, in Yorta Yorta at [42] it was said that:... because the subject of \nconsideration is rights or interests, the rules which together constitute the traditional laws acknowledged and \ntraditional customs observed, and under which the rights or interests are said to be possessed, must be rules \nhaving normative content. Without that quality, there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or \n\n\n\ninterests in relation to land or waters.In this regard, \u201cnormative content\u201d means established behavioural norms in \naccordance with the recognised and acknowledged demands for conformity of a society (Akiba v Queensland \n(2010) 204 FCR 1; [2010] FCA 643 (Akiba) at [171]-[173]). The \u201cbody of persons united in and by its \nacknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs\u201d is thus said to be a society for this purpose (Yorta \nYorta at [49]), albeit recognising that the word \u201csociety\u201d does not appear in s 223 which focuses on \u201ccommunal, \ngroup or individual rights and interests\u201d (see Akiba at [162]-[165]). For the purposes of the NTA if a society ceases \nto be a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs, then \nthe adoption of former traditional laws and customs by a new society will not make those laws and customs \ntraditional, at least not for the purposes of the NTA (Yorta Yorta at [53]).  In the present case, it is said by the \napplicant that both the Aboriginal people who occupied land and waters in and around the claim area at and before \nsovereignty, and the claim group members and their ancestors, were united in and by their acknowledgment and \nobservance of a body of laws and customs found amongst Western Desert people.  At [180]-[181], the Full Court in \nWyman made the following points about continuity:Ultimately, what the plurality said in Yorta Yorta at [89], having \nobserved that acknowledgement and observance of traditional laws and customs must have continued \n\u201csubstantially uninterrupted since sovereignty\u201d, is important in this regard. Their Honours noted that this qualification \nmust be made to recognise that European settlement has had \u201cthe most profound effects\u201d on Aboriginal societies \nand that it is \u201cinevitable that the structures and practices of those societies, and their members, will have undergone \ngreat change since European settlement\u201d. The plurality then added:Nonetheless, because what must be identified \nis possession of rights and interests under traditional laws and customs, it is necessary to demonstrate that the \nnormative system out of which the claimed rights and interests arise is the normative system of the society which \ncame under a new sovereign order when the British Crown asserted sovereignty, not a normative system rooted in \nsome other, different, society.This last quoted dicta emphasises at least three things. First, as the State submits, \nthat change to laws and customs caused by European settlement cannot simply be ignored. Secondly, that it is \nalmost inevitable that change will have occurred. Thirdly, nonetheless, if it can be shown that there is still a \n\u201cnormative system\u201d, out of which rights and interests arise, which is rooted in the sovereignty system, then those \nrights and interests may be recognised under the NTA.\n\n Depending upon the evidence that is led in any case, claimants may establish that they continue to have a \nnormative society rooted in the classical, sovereignty society out of which rights and interests contended for \ncontinue to be possessed, even where a range of rules and practices under laws and customs have ceased to be \nfollowed.  The applicant contends that there is sufficient continuity of observance of traditional laws and customs to \nsatisfy the threshold, principally because of the continued recognition and adherence to the Tjukurrpa, but also to \nother traditional laws and customs. They contend (and the State does not dispute) that there can be some change \nor adaptation of traditional laws and customs, so long as the normative system which existed at sovereignty can still \nbe discerned, and remains the source of the rights and interests in land and waters: see Bodney v Bennell [2008] \nFCAFC 63; 167 FCR 84 at [74].  The extracts above make it clear there is no need for biological descent to be \nestablished. The applicant is correct so to submit. What is critical is proof, on the balance of probabilities, of an \nenduring normative system of traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests in land or waters arise \nfor the group who makes the claim (and it is the observance of this normative system which unites the claim group \nmembers as a group). The content of that normative system (with allowances as described in Bodney) in each \ngiven case will determine how people acquire rights and interests in land or waters, and how they are united as a \ngroup (or not, as the case may be). This may, or may not, involve biological descent.  The State submits (at [139] \nof its submissions) that there must be a \u201csufficient\u201d continuing acknowledgement of relevant traditional laws and \ncustoms, namely enough acknowledgement to still produce and sustain rights in a society which has vitality enough \nfor a normative system. It referred to De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110; 145 FCR 290 at [58], \n[63] and Jango v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 318; 152 FCR 150 at [352], [358], [364], [366], [378], [395]. It is \nuncontroversial that there must be continuing acknowledgement and observation of traditional laws and customs \nconnected to the possession of rights and interests in land or waters (see, for example, De Rose (No 2) at [60]). \nHowever, introducing language such as \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201cvitality enough\u201d might tend to put a gloss on the description \nin Yorta Yorta at [47]:Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being \npossessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, \nrequires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and \n\n\n\ncustoms) is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system \nhas not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have \nceased to exist. And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not \nreconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within \nthe definition of native title.  In my opinion, this passage does not suggest \u201cvitality\u201d is an independent requirement. \nRather, it suggests (as the meaning of vitality implies) that the system of traditional laws and customs is a living \nsystem amongst the members of the claim group, or society.  Relying on Bodney at [178] and [186], the State also \nmade the following submission:Bodney confirms that it is necessary to demonstrate connection to all parts of an \napplication area. Connection to a broad region or places simply in the vicinity of the area claimed is insufficient. \nFurther, a substantial absence of any real acknowledgement and observance of traditional law and custom by \npersons associated with a particular area would be fatal for native title over that area, even if it could be shown that \nother claimants, associated with other areas, continued to acknowledge and observe traditional laws and customs.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  The passages at [178] and [186] of Bodney do not use the term \u201call parts\u201d and I consider the \nState\u2019s submission is put too absolutely.  At [178] and [179] of Bodney, the Full Court said:It is not uncommon for \nthe traditional laws and customs of a community to connect that community to a claim area by connecting groups \nwithin the community both to each other (often in complex ways) and, respectively and immediately, to their own \nparticular portions of the claim area (in the latter case by granting rights to, and imposing responsibilities on, each \nsuch group in respect of its portion). In such cases, it is entirely appropriate that the connection inquiry consider not \nmerely evidence of the general connection of the claimant community to the claim area, but also the evidence of the \nparticular connection of the particular groups and their members to their respective portions of the claim area: see \nNeowarra [2003] FCA 1402 at [353]- [356]. The latter evidence, we would suggest, will ordinarily be necessary in \nsome degree if the claimants\u2019 assertion of connection is to be sufficiently manifest over the claim area as a whole \u2014 \nthe more so, in communal claims, if rights and interests are held differentially across the community \u2014 though there \ncan be cases where, because of long-standing occupancy of the claim area, the s 223(1)(b) inquiry (as distinct from \nthat under s 223(1)(a)) will not loom large: cf Griff\u0131ths v Northern Territory (2006) 165 FCR 300 at [561]-[562].\n\n What, in our view, is indispensable where a matter put in issue in a proceeding is whether connection has been \nmaintained to a particular part of a claim area, are the needs:(i) to examine the traditional laws and customs for s \n223(1)(b) purposes as they relate to that area; and\n\n (ii) to demonstrate that connection to that area has, in reality, been substantially maintained since the time of \nsovereignty.(Emphasis in original.)  At [186], the Full Court said:What we wish presently to emphasise is that if \nthose persons whom the laws and customs connect to a particular part of the claim area have not continued to \nobserve without substantial interruption the laws and customs in relation to their country, they cannot succeed in a \nclaim for native title rights and interests even if it be shown \u2014 which it has not been \u2014 that other Noongar peoples \nhave continued to acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs of the Noongar: cf De Rose FC (No \n2) 145 FCR 290 at [57]-[58]. As the Full Court noted in Alyawarr FC 145 FCR 442 at [92], continuity of observance \nof laws that connect is itself \u201ca manifestation of connection\u201d. A substantial absence of any real acknowledgment of \ntraditional law and observance of traditional custom, as these related to the Perth Metropolitan Area, would \noccasion a substantial failure to maintain connection with that area which could not later be revived for \ncontemporary recognition: Mabo (No 2) 175 CLR at 60.  These observations were made, as the extracts \ndemonstrate, in relation to a claim over the Perth metropolitan region, and their Honours\u2019 observations must be \nunderstood in that context. There is no issue of the kind raised in Bodney in the present proceeding.  If the point the \nState is attempting to make, relevantly for this proceeding, is that to secure a determination in the terms sought the \napplicant must establish the continued observance of traditional laws and customs in relation to the whole of the \nclaim area by members of the claim group (rather than other people), and not just the eastern portion, then I accept \nthat is the case.  I deal with the claim in De Rose and the first Full Court decision (De Rose v South Australia [2003] \nFCAFC 286; 133 FCR 325) again in the section of these reasons dealing with the more permanent movement of \nthe claim group members\u2019 ancestors into the claim area. However, the following observations from that decision at \n[218]-[219] are also apposite:We should add that the \u201cusurpation\u201d thesis perhaps carries with it overtones of a \n\n\n\nEurocentric notion of \u201coccupation\u201d. The joint judgment in Ward (HC) at [14], pointed to a difficulty of expressing a \nrelationship between a community or group of Aboriginal people and the land in terms of rights and interests \nbecause the \u201cspiritual or religious is translated into the legal\u201d. Their Honours also suggested (at [14]) that the:... \ndifficulties are not reduced by the inevitable tendency to think of rights and interests in relation to the land only in \nterms familiar to the common lawyer.Similarly, there is a danger that a term such as \u201coccupation\u201d of land, as applied \nto Aboriginal people of the Western Desert Bloc, may create a false reference point. Such language, which is not \nfound in s 223 of the NTA, tends to convey an impression that the holders of native title must have enjoyed physical \npossession of defined tracts of land in ways not dissimilar from the European settlers who arrived in the twentieth \ncentury. It may be appropriate to apply the language of \u201coccupation\u201d to a freeholder or leaseholder, or even to the \nsettled existence of the Meriam people whose claims were upheld in Mabo. But as the evidence in the present case \nmakes clear, the Western Desert peoples were comparatively few in number and led a lifestyle that required \nadaptation to the extraordinarily harsh conditions of the land. The relationship between them and the sites or tracks \nof spiritual significance to them is not readily captured by the familiar language of Anglo-Australian property law.  \nThe approach to the analysis of native title claims must be sufficiently flexible and adaptive so as to cover the range \nand variety of traditional laws and customs, and living and environmental conditions, in which these claims arise. \nThe manner in which people \u201coccupy\u201d the arid lands of inland Australia is, literally, a world apart from the manner in \nwhich people \u201coccupy\u201d the verdant land and waters of the Torres Strait. The law\u2019s approach must not be so \ninflexible as to favour one kind of traditional life, laws and customs, over another. That would be to frustrate both the \nobjects and purpose of the NT Act and to cast aside the High Court\u2019s decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] \nHCA 23; 175 CLR 1.  Further, the fact that the characterisation of the claims to native title shifts in emphasis, \nespecially where there are unique or unusual issues, may be expected: De Rose [2003] FCAFC 286; 133 FCR 325 \nat [229].  The applicant also made submissions about the civil standard of proof and the drawing of inferences. \nThey referred to the judgment of Bennett J in AB (deceased) on behalf of the Ngarla people v Western Australia \n(No 4) [2012] FCA 1268; 300 ALR 193 at [724] and the authorities there referred to, especially Selway J\u2019s judgment \nin Gumana at [201] where his Honour said:This does not mean that mere assertion is sufficient to establish the \ncontinuity of the tradition back to the date of settlement: contrast Yorta. However, in my view where there is a clear \nclaim of the continuous existence of a custom or tradition that has existed at least since settlement supported by \ncreditable evidence from persons who have observed that custom or tradition and evidence of a general reputation \nthat the custom or tradition had \u201calways\u201d been observed then, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, there is \nan inference that the tradition or custom has existed at least since the date of settlement. That was not the case in \nYorta. It is the case here.  It is worthwhile setting out a little more of Selway J\u2019s judgment in Gumana which, with \nrespect, is persuasive. At [194]-[196], his Honour said:Ultimately the evidence of the existence of the relevant \nAboriginal tradition and custom as at 1788, and of the rights held by the particular clans in 1788 and thereafter \npursuant to that tradition and custom, is based upon evidence derived from what the Yolngu claimants currently do \nand from what they have observed their parents and elders do and from what they were told by their parents and \nelders. Mr Gumana, who was perhaps the eldest of the Yolngu witnesses who gave evidence, described it this \nway:MR KEELY: Where does \u2013 so as I understand the answer given through the interpreter, \u201crom\u201d is your word for \nlaw. And where does that law come from?\n\n GAWIRRIN GUMANA: Rom is come from land, and also from the sea. That\u2019s what we call rom.\n\n MR KEELY: And is that something that you know about?\n\n GAWIRRIN GUMANA: Yes, because my father told me \u2013 or not only my father, but people, old people \u2013 about \nland and sea and the water.\n\n MR KEELY: So, your father and other old people told you about land and sea and water? \n\n GAWIRRIN GUMANA: Yes.As already discussed, there is nothing peculiar or unique about this sort of evidence. It \nis oral evidence of a custom. It is evidence of fact, not opinion. To the extent that it consists of what Mr Gumana \nwas told by his father and by other old people it constitutes a recognised exception to the rule against hearsay. \n\n\n\n However, there is still a problem with it. On its face the evidence of what Mr Gumana and the other Yolngu \nwitnesses were told by their fathers and other elders is not able, by itself, to establish what the facts actually were \nas at 1788. On its face all that it may be able to establish is that the witnesses and the relevant elders believed that \nthere was a long standing custom that predated them.\n\n (Emphasis added.)  His Honour then described (at [198]) the common law\u2019s solution to this problem: namely to \ninfer from proof of a current custom that the custom had continued from time immemorial. His Honour held:The \ninference was a strong one: see Jessell MR in Hammerton v Honey (1876) 24 WR 603 at 604:It is impossible to \nprove the actual usage in all time by living testimony. The usual course taken is this: Persons of middle or old age \nare called, who state that, in their time, usually at least half a century, the usage has always prevailed. That is \nconsidered, in the absence of countervailing evidence, to show that usage has prevailed from all time.  A similar \napproach has been taken in Canada. Re Kitchooalik and Tucktoo (1972) 28 DLR (3d) 483 was a customary \nadoption case rather than a native title case, but the principle applied was the same. At 488, the Court said:It is said \nthat the Court of these Territories cannot recognize or give effect to custom adoptions by the Eskimo. While the \nIndian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-6, recognizes such adoptions by Indians there is no corresponding legislation for \nEskimos. From this, it is argued that Parliament did not intend to extend recognition of this practice to these people. \nCustom has always been recognized by the common law and while at an earlier date proof of the existence of a \ncustom from time immemorial was required, Tindal, C.J., in Bastard v. Smith [1837] EngR 942; (1837), 2 M. & Rob. \n129 at p. 136[1837] EngR 942; , 174 E.R. 238, points out that such evidence is no longer possible or necessary and \nthat evidence extending \u201c... as far back as living memory goes, of a continuous, peaceable, and uninterrupted user \nof the custom\u201d is all that is now required. Such proof was offered and accepted in this case.  The work of inferential \nreasoning in relation to claimant evidence was also the subject of earlier observations by the Full Court in De Rose \n[2003] FCAFC 286; 133 FCR 325 at [259], and I respectfully adopt that approach:In Yorta Yorta (HC), the joint \njudgment endorsed (at [59]) an observation by the trial Judge in that case that:... the difficulties inherent in proving \nfacts in relation to a time when for the most part the only record of events is oral tradition passed down from one \ngeneration to another, cannot be overstated.For obvious reasons, the Aboriginal witnesses could not give direct \nevidence of the way in which pre-sovereignty population shifts were viewed by the traditional laws and customs of \nthe Western Desert Bloc. The primary Judge was therefore forced to rely on inferences from necessarily incomplete \nevidence. Bearing that in mind, in our view, the evidence was sufficient to support the inference he drew, namely \nthat population shifts to and from the claim area that occurred in the twentieth century were consistent with and \nrecognised by the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc, in the sense that, under those laws and \ncustoms, the newcomers could acquire the status of Nguraritja in relation to sites or tracks on or near the claim \narea.  There is no difficulty in a Court preferring, as more reliable and persuasive, the evidence of Aboriginal \nwitnesses over the evidence of anthropologists or anthropological sources. In De Rose at [264]-[265], the Full Court \nsaid:As the primary Judge made clear at several points in the judgment, it was because of the testimony of the \nAboriginal witnesses that he was prepared to find that the four-fold test for determining Nguraritja was \nacknowledged by the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc. He plainly regarded that evidence \nas more cogent and persuasive than the writings of Professor Berndt on this particular issue.\n\n His Honour took this view notwithstanding that he was by no means uncritical of the evidence of Aboriginal \nwitnesses. As we have noted, he rejected the evidence of certain witnesses on important issues. His Honour\u2019s \nacceptance of their evidence as to the ways of becoming Nguraritja plainly took account of his assessment of their \nreliability and understanding of the questions. His Honour must also have taken into account the fact that they were \nrecounting elements of an oral tradition.  Contrary to the State\u2019s submissions (at [83]), I do not accept that where \nthe claim group members gave evidence about their own beliefs and practices, and their own understanding, in \n2015, of the traditional laws and customs which give rise to their connection to the claim area, the principles set out \nabove can have little or no application because the claim group members\u2019 ancestors moved into the area from \nelsewhere. That contention assumes the applicant has failed in their case and the State has succeeded on its \nmigration thesis.  Rather, the claim group members all gave evidence of what they understood the position had \n\n\n\n\u201calways been\u201d in the claim area, in terms of the laws and customs which existed in accordance with Western Desert \ntraditions, and governed the connection of people to the land and waters in the claim area. They spoke of what was \nwithin their own living memories, and within the knowledge (and living memories) of their parents, grandparents and \nother family members. Whether their ancestors were habitually resident within the boundary of the claim area or not \ndoes not, in my opinion, affect the ability to draw inferences of the kind explained by Selway J in Gumana. The \nclaimant evidence was about traditional laws and customs that applied in the claim area, and which united a \nparticular group of Aboriginal people because they all observed it, and recognised they were bound to live their lives \naccording to it.  The Supreme Court of Canada has recognised and emphasised the important and unique role of \nevidence given by Indigenous people from an oral tradition. In Mitchell v MNR [2001] 1 SCR 911, drawing on the \nearlier decisions of the Court in R v Van der Peet [1996] 2 SCR 507 and Delgamuukw v British Columbia [1997] 3 \nSCR 1010, McLachlin CJ said (at [37]-[39], Gonthier, Iacobucci, Arbour and LeBel JJ agreeing):Nonetheless, the \npresent case requires us to clarify the general principles laid down in Van der Peet and Delgamuukw regarding the \nassessment of evidence in aboriginal right claims. The requirement that courts interpret and weigh the evidence \nwith a consciousness of the special nature of aboriginal claims is critical to the meaningful protection of s. 35(1) \nrights. As Lamer C.J. observed in Delgamuukw, the admission of oral histories represents a hollow recognition of \nthe aboriginal perspective where this evidence is then systematically and consistently undervalued or deprived of all \nindependent weight (para. 98). Thus, it is imperative that the laws of evidence operate to ensure that the aboriginal \nperspective is \u201cgiven due weight by the courts\u201d (para. 84).\n\n Again, however, it must be emphasized that a consciousness of the special nature of aboriginal claims does not \nnegate the operation of general evidentiary principles. While evidence adduced in support of aboriginal claims must \nnot be undervalued, neither should it be interpreted or weighed in a manner that fundamentally contravenes the \nprinciples of evidence law, which, as they relate to the valuing of evidence, are often synonymous with the \u201cgeneral \nprinciples of common sense\u201d (Sopinka and Lederman, supra, at p. 524). As Lamer C.J. emphasized in \nDelgamuukw, supra, at para. 82:[A]boriginal rights are truly sui generis, and demand a unique approach to the \ntreatment of evidence which accords due weight to the perspective of aboriginal peoples. However, that \naccommodation must be done in a manner which does not strain \u201cthe Canadian legal and constitutional structure\u201d \n[Van der Peet at para. 49]. Both the principles laid down in Van der Peet \u2013 first, that trial courts must approach the \nrules of evidence in light of the evidentiary difficulties inherent in adjudicating aboriginal claims, and second, that \ntrial courts must interpret that evidence in the same spirit \u2013 must be understood against this background. [Emphasis \nadded.]There is a boundary that must not be crossed between a sensitive application and a complete \nabandonment of the rules of evidence. As Binnie J. observed in the context of treaty rights, \u201c[g]enerous rules of \ninterpretation should not be confused with a vague sense of after-the-fact largesse\u201d (R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. \n456, at para. 14). In particular, the Van der Peet approach does not operate to amplify the cogency of evidence \nadduced in support of an aboriginal claim. Evidence advanced in support of aboriginal claims, like the evidence \noffered in any case, can run the gamut of cogency from the highly compelling to the highly dubious. Claims must \nstill be established on the basis of persuasive evidence demonstrating their validity on the balance of probabilities. \nPlacing \u201cdue weight\u201d on the aboriginal perspective, or ensuring its supporting evidence an \u201cequal footing\u201d with more \nfamiliar forms of evidence, means precisely what these phrases suggest: equal and due treatment. While the \nevidence presented by aboriginal claimants should not be undervalued \u201csimply because that evidence does not \nconform precisely with the evidentiary standards that would be applied in, for example, a private law torts case\u201d \n(Van der Peet, supra, at para. 68), neither should it be artificially strained to carry more weight than it can \nreasonably support. If this is an obvious proposition, it must nonetheless be stated.  Ultimately the Court concluded \nthere was insufficient evidence to support the claim of an Aboriginal right of the kind that would allow the \nrespondent to cross the border with the United States carrying goods purchased in the United States without having \nto pay duty. The Court\u2019s conclusion is illustrative of the approach it had earlier set out:As discussed in the previous \nsection, claims must be proven on the basis of cogent evidence establishing their validity on the balance of \nprobabilities. Sparse, doubtful and equivocal evidence cannot serve as the foundation for a successful claim. With \nrespect, this is exactly what has occurred in the present case. The contradiction between McKeown J.\u2019s statement \nthat little direct evidence supports a cross-river trading right and his conclusion that such a right exists suggests the \napplication of a very relaxed standard of proof (or, perhaps more accurately, an unreasonably generous weighing of \ntenuous evidence). The Van der Peet approach, while mandating the equal and due treatment of evidence \n\n\n\nsupporting aboriginal claims, does not bolster or enhance the cogency of this evidence. The relevant evidence in \nthis case \u2013 a single knife, treaties that make no reference to pre-existing trade, and the mere fact of Mohawk \ninvolvement in the fur trade \u2013 can only support the conclusion reached by the trial judge if strained beyond the \nweight they can reasonably hold. Such a result is not contemplated by Van der Peet or s. 35(1). While appellate \ncourts grant considerable deference to findings of fact made by trial judges, I am satisfied that the findings in the \npresent case represent a \u201cclear and palpable error\u201d warranting the substitution of a different result (Delgamuukw, \nsupra, at paras. 78-80). I conclude that the claimant has not established an ancestral practice of transporting goods \nacross the St. Lawrence River for the purposes of trade.  Giving due weight to Indigenous evidence from an oral \ntradition will inevitably involve drawing inferences about how and over what period of time the traditional laws and \ncustoms spoken of have given rise to rights and interests in land or waters. The Court\u2019s approach must be \nsufficiently flexible to accommodate this, while bearing in mind the limits articulated by the Canadian Supreme \nCourt in Mitchell, and being astute to ensure there is sufficient evidence for the discharge of the legal burden of \nproof.  It will be obvious that, therefore, I do not entirely accept the State\u2019s related submission on this issue: namely \nthat the position at sovereignty must be proved through expert or historical ethnographic (and therefore, inevitably \nEuropean) evidence. Such evidence is to be considered along with the evidence of Aboriginal witnesses but it has \nno more necessary intrinsic probative value, and may suffer from weaknesses affecting its probative value, such as \nlack of understanding and the inability to test its provenance and reliability. For example, and as I set out later in \nthese reasons, the work of Daisy Bates has some of these weaknesses.\nFINDINGS ON CONNECTION ISSUES  \nA note on places referred to frequently in the evidence    There are several places, or areas, the geographical \nlocation and extent of which should be clarified. This can be done with more certainty for some than others.\n\nYander \u2013 as referred to by Daisy Bates\u2019 informants  \u201cYander\u201d was not a term used frequently by the claimant \nwitnesses but it was one of the principal geographical terms recorded by Daisy Bates as identifying where her \nNgaiawonga informants were said to have connections.  In answer to a question asked of him by the solicitors for \nthe applicant for his first expert report, Dr Sackett summarises how the location of Yander arises. The question asks \nabout the laws and customs of what the parties have now called the Ngaiawonga in relation to rights and interests \nin land. Dr Sackett provides the following summary answer:Unfortunately, we do not have statements by the \noriginal occupants of the claim area as to their laws and customs regarding acquiring rights and interests in land. \nWhat we do have, though, is (1) a summarizing statement by Bates on the subject and (2) information contained in \na few Ngaiuwonga Pedigrees, specifically those she linked to an area named Yander. These, as it happens, are \nsomewhat contradictory. At the same time, taken as a whole, they offer at least glimpses into the situation at about \nthe time of settlement. (While, as will be seen, Yander lies to the north of the claim area, the Pedigrees show \npeople from the wider Ngaiuwonga area.)  Dr Sackett describes the way Daisy Bates set out, in summary, how \npeople acquired rights and interests in land and waters:Regarding the law and custom of the claim area, and the \nregion more generally, Bates stated that:[e]very pool, spring or lake in every tribe is associated with the family or \ngroup occupying the vicinity, or with some individual member of that family, whose birth occurred beside the pool, \netc. Such pool belongs to the family of the person born there as long as the family exists.Elsewhere, Bates \nelaborated on this, averring that \u201c[i]t appears from the association of certain individuals with certain pools, that these \nhave been the camping grounds of a local family or group, consisting of fathers and sons only.\u201d I take this to mean \nthat as Bates saw it, any given tribe (and for her the Ngaiuwonga constituted a tribe) was divided into, or made up \nof, local patri-groups; these in turn were associated with, or held, the local component places and countries that \nmade up the total tribal area.\n\n At the same time Bates wrote of families or patri-groups, she spoke of Ngaiuwonga \u201ctribelets\u201d, ie of intermediate \nsubdivisions of the Ngaiuwonga people \u2013 of some type of grouping above the family or patri-group level, but below \nthe tribal level. As Bates related it, these, at least at times, took their name from a named place in the area of the \nsubdivision.\n\n Yander possibly was one of these latter. It certainly is a name that figures regularly in Bates\u2019 Ngaiuwonga \ngenealogies. That is, she labelled some Pedigrees relating to Ngaiawonga people as \u201cYander\u201d Pedigrees, and \nassociated some of the people named in such Pedigrees with an area called Yander. Concerning this later point, \nshe, for example, stated that \u201cJinguru [one of her primary informants] is from Yander.\u201d\n\n\n\n This said, it needs to be noted that there is ambiguity in the location of Yander, and inconsistency in the rendering \nof the term Yander. At times Bates said Yander was Lake Way; other times she said it was a place some 60 \nkilometres west of Wiluna township. On these latter occasions, Lake Way was said to be Wilurna or Wilurira. Bates \nalso seemingly rendered Yander as: Yarnder, Yarnderi, Yanderguna and Yander bubba.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  As Dr Sackett subsequently concluded, Daisy Bates\u2019 records did sometimes link specific \nindividuals with named places, but said nothing about the nature or source of their associations with those places, \nnor indeed whether they had associations with other places. The area Bates variously called \u201cYander\u201d or some like \nformulation was one such place.  Commenting on these opinions, Dr Brunton\u2019s view was that Yander was likely to \nbe near Lake Way, although a little to the south-west. He based this on a map Daisy Bates obtained at Rottnest \nIsland which has \u201cCork Tree\u201d written under the word \u201cYarnder\u201d. Dr Brunton identified a bore called \u201cCork Tree Well\u201d \non the Geoscience Australia database, and obtained its coordinates, which would place this bore inside the north-\neastern boundary of the claim area, about 5 km in from the boundary. In response, Dr Sackett noted that, \nelsewhere in her records, Ms Bates showed Cork Tree not as Yander but as Yalgojibi. Dr Brunton nevertheless \nmaintained that Yander could be near Cork Tree.  It does seem that the place Ms Bates identified with some of her \ninformants as \u201cYander\u201d (and its variations in her records) lies somewhere either just in, or just out, of the north-\neastern boundary of the claim area, bearing in mind that Lake Way pastoral station is shown on the maps in \nevidence as only about 5 km from the claim boundary.  There is no evidence why a place which seemed to play \nsuch a significant part in Bates\u2019 geographical records apparently has no identifiable parallel on maps created by \nEuropeans, while most other places identified by Aboriginal informants could be aligned with a geographical \nfeature, a mining or pastoral location, or a settlement.  On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied on the basis of \nDr Sackett\u2019s evidence, considered with that of Dr Brunton, that the \u201cYander\u201d and similarly spelt places recorded by \nBates (as identified by Dr Sackett) was at or very close to the north-eastern boundary of the claim area.  It is not \npossible to make any findings, in my opinion, about the size of this place Yander, nor to be certain whether it was \nan area, or a site.\n\nLake Way \u2013 as referred to by Daisy Bates\u2019 informants  On the evidence before me, \u201cLake Way\u201d can mean one of \nthree things. First, it can be a reference to the pastoral station called Lake Way Station, which is marked on the \nmaps in evidence as being about 5 km outside the north-eastern boundary of the claim area. I infer this is the \nlocation of the station homestead.  Second, it can be a reference to the lake itself, which is some way further north \nof the claim boundary. The lake is very large (it appears to cover about 460 square km), and is generally a dry salt \npan, save for exceptional floods. There is, and has been for some time, mining activity in the lake.  Third, according \nto some evidence given by Dr Sackett in his supplementary report, there was, at least during the gold rush time, a \ntownship called Lake Way. Dr Sackett records an early European prospector \u2013 Lawrence Wells \u2013 noting in April \n1892:At several of my [gold] discoveries of that year (notably Mount Sir Samuel, Lake Darlot, and Lake Way) there \nare now townships and goldfields (Wells 1902:5)  The evidence before the Court does not suggest a township still \nexists at Lake Way.  When the references are taken in context, it seems more likely to me that the claimant \nwitnesses, when they spoke of Lake Way, were using the term reasonably interchangeably as between the pastoral \nstation and the lake itself, simply to indicate a vicinity. It seems unlikely they were referring to a township \nestablished during (and perhaps only during) the late nineteenth century gold rush in the area. Where evidence was \ngiven about working on Lake Way, it was generally clear it was the pastoral station the witness was referring to.\n\nDarlot  Lake Darlot is another large salt pan lake to the east of the claim area. Running north to south and taking in \nLake Darlot are a number of places referred to in the evidence: Barwidgee, Mount Grey, Yandal and, to the south of \nLake Darlot, Weebo.  The use of \u201cDarlot\u201d as a name for locating people and places was familiar to Dr Sackett from \nhis earlier anthropological work on claims in this region.  Dr Sackett recounts how Lake Darlot was another place \nwhere Lawrence Wells discovered gold in about 1892. Other records to which Dr Sackett refers place the discovery \nof gold in the Darlot area (which, in this context must refer to Lake Darlot) at about 1894. Dr Sackett then refers to a \nhistorical account of the Darlot area by Lyn Hatch (Darlot: The Centennial Publication 1894-1991 (Plutonic, 1994)), \nwhere the author describes the establishment, around 1901 onwards, of pastoral stations in the area, following \nupon the discovery of gold, and the eventual amalgamation of three leases to become three large pastoral stations: \n\n\n\nWeebo Station, Banjawarn Station and Melrose Station.  As Dr Sackett observes, the claimant witnesses tended to \nuse the term \u201cDarlot\u201d in several different ways. Sometimes there were references just to Lake Darlot itself. For \nexample, Mr James\u2019 evidence was that there were groups of Western Desert people at Lake Darlot (the \u201cBirriliburu \nmob\u201d was one he referred to). He thought they called themselves \u201cKoara\u201d, and he recognised they had similar \ntraditions or customs to his own mob, however he then said: \u201cbut they are about a different part of the country\u201d.  \nOther witnesses referred to Darlot in terms of a larger region or area. For example, Ms Geraldine Hogarth\u2019s \nevidence was that all her grandchildren could \u201csay that the Darlot area is their country, because my mother\u2019s \ngrandmother was born there\u201d. This reflects the evidence Ms Hogarth\u2019s mother, Ms Luxie Hogarth, gave. Ms Luxie \nHogarth\u2019s evidence was:My mother was from Darlot. Her name was Kugila and her whitefella name was Daisy \nCordella to start with. Then my mother married my father, and she became Daisy Hogarth. Her mother, and her \ngrandmother, and her grandfather, they were always there, living in the Darlot area. My mother taught me how to \nlive in the country, and she showed me a lot of things, on the Darlot side.  In oral evidence, Ms Geraldine Hogarth \nsaid:MR WRIGHT: And I just wanted to just clarify one thing about your grandmother on your mum\u2019s side, your \nmother\u2019s mother, what\u2019s your understanding as to where she\u2019s from?\n\n GERALDINE HOGARTH: From Darlot, Lake Darlot, at that place, yes. \n\n MR WRIGHT: So, the actual lake? \n\n GERALDINE HOGARTH: Oh, no around that area Darlot when we talk about Darlot, yes.  When Ms Luxie Hogarth \nwas asked during her evidence in chief to explain what Darlot means and whether it refers to a particular place or a \nlarge area, she answered:It\u2019s just a big area where all my \u2013 my grandmother and grandfather and they all lived \nthere, and to the great, great grandfather and all \u2013 and my \u2013 that\u2019s where my mother stay and us family lived there \nin that area.  There is no more precise indication from Ms Geraldine or Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s evidence regarding what \nregion they had in mind when they gave this evidence. Given their evidence was frequently an account of what they \nhad been told in oral tradition, it seems likely that little more specificity was given when the information was passed \non. Of course, those who were the first generation conveying this information would have had a more specific idea \nof the geographical boundaries of the region they identified as \u201cDarlot\u201d, because they would have been speaking \nabout their country, the country in which they had rights and interests. That was likely internal knowledge, so to \nspeak, embedded in the person passing on the information. But as the information is handed down, unless more \ninquiries are made or questions asked, the later generations may not have the same internal knowledge of the \nparticular geographical region the speaker had in mind. That is why the Court is particularly assisted by a person \nwith the knowledge, experience and expertise of Dr Sackett, acquired over a long period of working with Aboriginal \npeople in the wider region that includes the claim area and the areas to which the witnesses refer. He is better \nplaced than the Court to try and fit pieces of the jigsaw together: it is then up to the Court whether it accepts his \nevidence, and how that evidence fits with the matters the applicant has the burden to prove.  Two witnesses did \nattempt to describe in a geographical sense the area they, at least, meant when they used the term \u201cDarlot\u201d.  Mr \nMuir\u2019s evidence was that he meant \u201cDarlot, Weebo, Wardadda, Darda, Yandal; mostly the country to the east of \nthe Tjiwarl claim\u201d. In the next part of his evidence, he contrasts this description with other areas:That\u2019s where most \nof the people lived in my grandmother\u2019s time when my mum was a little girl, in Darlot. They moved around following \nceremonies even my mum was a little girl, walking from Mulga Queen through Croft, north of Darlot, using a yiwarra \n[a traditional track] that goes through Henry\u2019s Well and Townsend Well. That\u2019s really the walking journey that people \ntook into this claim. That\u2019s the yiwarra, the pathways. Following the dragonfly, the Tjiinkuna dreaming.  I note from \nthe maps in evidence that Croft does not appear on them.  Mr Lewis also gave evidence that when people say \n\u201cDarlot\u201d they are talking about the area running north to south between Yandal and Weebo with Lake Darlot in the \nmiddle. I take this evidence to mean that is what Mr Lewis understands by the region he calls Darlot, and further \nwhat he understands when other people within the claim group, and perhaps outside it (the latter being less clear), \nuse that regional description.  There is a reasonable level of consistency between the evidence of Mr Muir and Mr \nLewis, and between that evidence and Dr Sackett\u2019s understanding of how the term is used. For the purposes of my \nfindings in this proceeding, I take references to Darlot to be references to the area east of the claim area between \napproximately the stations of Yandal in the north and Weebo in the south, with Lake Darlot in between them.\n\n\n\nWongawol  Just as with the references to Darlot, it became apparent during the on country evidence that the name \n\u201cWongawol\u201d was used to refer to possibly different places, or a region which is not defined or easily discernible on \nany of the maps in evidence.  On one of the maps in evidence (Map 3 of the applicant\u2019s bundle), Wongawol is \nshown as a pastoral station approximately 150 km as the crow flies from Barwidgee, which means it is \napproximately 155 km outside the north-eastern edge of the claim boundary.  Dr Sackett\u2019s view is that the claimant \nwitnesses use \u201cWongawol\u201d in at least two ways. First, as a reference to the pastoral station. This is clear from the \nway Mr Allan Ashwin used the name in parts of his evidence, where it is one of several pastoral stations being \nreferred to:I was born at Weld Spring, Banja on Prenti Downs, which used to be part of Windidda country. I grew \nup around Wiluna and Albion Downs. I still went back to the places I was born when my old man was working \naround Windidda and Wongawol. I used to go out there as a kid and more or less grew up at Windidda and Wiluna.\n\n ...\n\n After Yeelirrie I went to work on Windidda. But I\u2019ve worked all over this area. Yakabindie, Albion Downs, Mt Keith, \nLake Mason, Lake Way and Matuwa, Jundee, Glen Ayle, Carnegie, Wongawol. I\u2019ve mainly lived and worked in this \narea my whole life. I spent some time in Meekatharra district and Leonora district and worked up at Yandeyarra, \naround Kalgoorlie for Main Roads patching roads, I used to do the road from Withcimulda to Kalgoorlie.  Another \nexample is his evidence about his grandmother Telpha Ashwin:My grandmothers [Telpha Ashwin] country was \nfrom around Windidda and Yelma and Wongawol, Lorna Glen around Carnegie and all that area. When she was \nliving with old Arthur Ashwin, he the one who started Lorna Glen and Yelma Stations and started Dada over \ntowards Darlot. He started them properties up.  Ms Harris\u2019s evidence about her mother\u2019s country was:My mother \nwas born in Wiluna, and grew up in Carnegie, Windidda, Wongawol, all around that station area [in the Wiluna \ndetermination area].  In the case of both Darlot and Wongawol, although he set out how earlier ethnographers and \nanthropologists had recorded peoples\u2019 self-identification with these areas by reference to a variety of labels, which \nwere sometimes related to language or dialect and sometimes not, Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion is that the use of station \nnames by people had no real relevance to the analysis of the movement of people from the Darlot or Wongawol \nareas into the claim area. I accept that evidence. Rather, pastoral stations are an obvious contemporary reference \npoint.  All that need be found in relation to Wongawol is that in a particular context it may refer to the pastoral \nstation, and in another context it refers to a larger region, no doubt including all or part of the pastoral station, but \nwhich was considered by the ancestors of those witnesses who spoke about the region as their country under \ntraditional laws and customs. There is no dispute that, whatever the outer limits of this region, it is a considerable \ndistance to the east of the claim area.\nWiluna  I have put a reference to Wiluna here because of some of the evidence given by the claimant witnesses in \nparticular, which I consider should be noted. While there is no lack of clarity about where the Wiluna township is \n(having been established in approximately 1898), nor about the area covered by the Wiluna native title \ndetermination (which was in evidence in Map 13 of the applicant\u2019s maps), what is striking is the way in which some \nof the claimant witnesses would speak about Wiluna and Lawlers in combination, as if they considered them to be \nthe same area. As can be seen on the map attached to these reasons, Lawlers is south of the claim area, and \nWiluna is north of the claim area. It seems to me this may be a little like the \u201cDarlot\u201d references in the evidence, \nwhere station names are used to refer to what is actually quite a large area, rather than a specific location on a \nmap, which is where the European mind naturally goes.  For example, Ms Geraldine Hogarth, when speaking of her \npaternal grandmother Alice Redmond Curtin (whose Wongai name was Koyungati), said she came \u201cfrom this \nWiluna area, and she was born in Lawlers\u201d.  Similarly, Mr Lewis gave the following evidence:Before this boundary, \nwe had a Koara claim. It\u2019s just a name change. Before then they had the Sir Samuel claim. It\u2019s just changing \nnames. Before native title claims come along, people would talk about their ngurra by using the pastoral station \nnames. That was how you described your area. If you said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Depot\u201d you would mean you were \ngoing back to \u201cDepot, Booylgoo and Kaluwiri\u201d.  I take references to \u201cWiluna\u201d in the evidence to be references to a \nregion, rather than express references to where the township is located (and shown on a map). In context, as the \nevidence to which I have referred demonstrates, it may include quite a large region that takes in all or part of the \nclaim area.\n\n\n\nReferences to where people \u201clived\u201d  There is no historical town or Aboriginal community located in the claim area. \nLeinster was established for those working in, or servicing those working in, the mines in the region.  The townships \nwhich grew up as a result of Europeans entering the area prospecting for gold, and establishing pastoral stations, \nwere mostly outside the claim area, although some surround it.  Aside from working on the pastoral stations and \nthereby remaining within the areas they identify as their country, the claim group members and their ancestors \nwere compelled to locate themselves in or near the townships created by Europeans if they wished to access \nregular supplies of food, services, work, housing and the like.  Therefore, where the evidence is that a person was \nborn in towns such as Lawlers, Leonora, or Wiluna, or \u201clived\u201d in one or more of those places, contrary to the thrust \nof the State\u2019s submissions, I do not consider this as evidence capable of demonstrating lack of connection with the \nclaim area. It might not be positive evidence of connection, but nor is it evidence against it. People \u201clived\u201d where \nthey could, and if they remained close, in Western Desert terms, to the area they identify as their country, the fact \nthey could not, or did not, find a place to \u201clive\u201d inside a boundary that did not exist at the time they were making \nthese choices is of little relevance to the matters of which the Court needs to be satisfied.\nPreliminary matters  \n\nUse of geographical locations close to the claim area  As I have already noted, the parties accept the boundaries \nfor this claim area are arbitrary as to the north, the south and the east. The western boundary, it is accepted, runs \nalong geographical features. This fact assumes some importance in the way evidence about people who occupied \nareas just outside the claim area should be treated, especially historical evidence.  The undisputed evidence is that, \nlike its surrounds, the claim area would have been sparsely populated by people living a traditional life. To sustain \nlife, large areas of country were required. Geographical features assume importance for practicalities such as \nfinding shelter, food and water, as well as for ceremonial and spiritual reasons. There is a tendency however, since \nEuropean contact, to identify regions by reference to European towns or pastoral stations: even Aboriginal \nwitnesses tended to do this, although in my opinion their evidence was inevitably more nuanced and talked about \nan \u201carea\u201d near a town or \u201caround\u201d a pastoral station. This indicated, it seems to me, a consciousness that \nEuropeans, including people such as anthropologists, lawyers and judges, will identify with town names and \npastoral station names, so descriptions were put in this way. They are, in my opinion, no more than rough \napproximations of larger areas the Aboriginal witnesses are generally referring to. Much more authentic and reliable \nin descriptive terms are references to geographical features which figure in traditional laws and customs, or have \npractical significance, such as waterholes, shelter or paths and routes between significant places.  Unless there is \nclear evidence to consider otherwise, in my opinion where evidence refers to places relatively close in geographical \nterms to the claim boundaries, there is no reason to consider that evidence is irrelevant as not touching on \nconnection with country inside the claim area. Its relevance must be assessed by factors wider than the line drawn \non a map for the purposes of this claim under the NT Act. Those lines are ultimately the lines on which the Court\u2019s \norders and determination may be based, but it is mistaken to see those lines as reflecting anything precise about \nthe country to which the claim group members and their ancestors may be connected by traditional laws and \ncustoms. An example is the place identified on the maps in evidence as Lake Way (rather than the lake itself), \nwhich is approximately 5 km from the north-eastern part of the claim boundary. When this place is spoken of in the \nevidence, it is usually difficult to discern whether the speaker is referring to the area of the lake, to the European \nnamed pastoral station, or both (or neither). But this area is so close to the claim area that it is counter intuitive to \nsuppose that people living a traditional life and who were connected by traditional laws and customs to the Lake \nWay area did not also have connections to country inside the claim boundary. Unless, for example, a previous \nnative title determination had made it clear that there was a different landholding group immediately adjacent to a \nclaim boundary which, in my opinion, is the kind of \u201cclear evidence\u201d one would need to make a different assumption.\n\nThe content of Western Desert Laws and Customs and the \u201cWestern Desert Cultural Bloc\u201d  Although there was no \ndispute between the parties that the claim group members are Western Desert people, and no dispute that the \nareas from which their ancestors came were Western Desert areas, it is necessary to make some findings on the \nfeatures of Western Desert traditional laws and customs because the Court is asked to determine, amongst other \nthings, whether it was these laws and customs which governed peoples\u2019 relationships with the land in the claim \narea at sovereignty.  These matters can be set out with some certainty because they were the subject of \nadmissions by the State in its response to the applicant\u2019s statement of issues, facts and contentions. I also set out \nbelow some relevant evidence from Dr Sackett on this issue.  As an introductory matter, I consider it useful to \n\n\n\nreflect on the population size of the groups to be discussed. In a paper published in 1959, Professor Berndt gives \nhis own estimates of the historic and current (as in 1959) population size of Western Desert people: see Berndt R, \n\u201cThe concept of \u2018the tribe\u2019 in the Western Desert of Australia\u201d (1959) 30 Oceania 81. First, it is necessary to bear in \nmind the area to which Professor Berndt referred to as the Western Desert covered more than 647,000 square km \n(Professor Berndt\u2019s estimate in square miles was 250,000). In this context Professor Berndt estimated that in 1959 \nthe maximum population for the region covering Jigalong, Wiluna, Leonora, Laverton, Mulga Queen, Mount \nMargaret, Cosmo Newberry, the Warburtons, the Blackstone range and Winggalina, the Rawlinsons and up to Lake \nMcDonald might be 2,000 to 2,200 people. He estimated no more than 3,200 Aboriginal people would be living in \nthe entire Western Desert. The estimate he gave of the pre-European contact population was approximately 10,000 \nfor the same region and 18,000 for the Western Desert as a whole.  In this part of his paper, Professor Berndt gives \nsome examples of 1957 and 1959 population sizes in some of the places to which he refers. He estimates (for \nexample) that in 1957 there were 46 Aboriginal people in Leonora, 243 people in Laverton and 48 in Wiluna. I make \nthis point to illustrate that in the critical years with which this proceeding deals \u2013 the first and second decades of the \ntwentieth century \u2013 the original inhabitants of the claim area, and land around the claim area, were likely to have \nbeen few in number. So when claimant witnesses in this case speak about the \u201cold people\u201d in and around the claim \narea and how their own ancestors may have mixed with them, it need not be thought there were very large \nnumbers of such people. Numerical strength is not the issue, nor a criterion for connection.  In terms of language, \nthere is one Western Desert language with a large number of varieties or dialects associated with different people \nand different areas. As Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence shows, labels given by Western Desert speakers to themselves by \nreference to language are ephemeral and it is difficult to draw any links between dialect and rights to country, \nespecially since many Western Desert people were multilingual in Western Desert dialects, and in other Aboriginal \nlanguages. Just as with their language, groups of Western Desert people did not identify themselves with a single \nIndigenous name.  The source of laws and customs for Western Desert people is the Tjukurrpa. It governs all \naspects of their lives, including rights to land, social rules and spiritual practices.  One of the key features of \nWestern Desert society which differs from other Aboriginal societies is the way that individuals and groups gain \nassociation with, and rights and interests in, particular areas of land. It is not simply by descent, whether biological \nor adoptive. It is broader than that \u2013 hence the expression used frequently by Dr Sackett in his evidence of \u201cmultiple \npathways\u201d to rights and interests in land and waters. A person may acquire rights and interests by conception or \nbirth on country, growing up or initiation on the country, or the acquisition of knowledge through long residence. \nRights and interests may also be acquired in ways more familiar in other Aboriginal societies: namely, descent from \na person who has the requisite connection. A landholding group for a particular area is determined through a \nshared association amongst the group members with sites associated with the Tjukurrpa in particular parts of the \nland and waters.  Since there are multiple pathways, landholding groups tend to be more open and fluid, and \nindividuals may have access to a number of different parts of country through different pathways. None of the \npathways is exclusive of another. Nor are these groups formed along patrilineal or patrilocal lines. The rights and \ninterests of different groups in particular areas are recognised by other groups.  There are rules about strangers or \nvisitors entering country \u2013 access can be refused and conditions can be imposed, including that the visitor or \nstranger has to be accompanied by a person recognised as having authority in respect of the area. Access to and \ndisclosure of knowledge about sites and rituals associated with sites can be restricted on the basis of gender, age \nand ritual knowledge. Sanctions can be imposed for non-adherence to these kinds of rules. Spiritual features of the \nlandscape have to be respected and cared for, including by the observance of rituals and practices specific to \ncertain sites or features. There needs to be particular and appropriate transmission of knowledge relating to those \nfeatures, which also means restrictions on which members of the group have, and can use, that knowledge. In \ncontrast to some of the laws and customs about how people gain rights and interests in country, none of the rules I \nhave set out in this paragraph were suggested to be unique to Western Desert society, but were said to be features \nof that society.  In his first report, Dr Sackett traced the development of the concept of a Western Desert society, \nwhich he described in the following terms:In discussing the places of origin of the apicals and their ancestors I \nmentioned the Western Desert. The idea of the Western Desert as a culture area has its roots in the work of AP \nElkin.\n\n Based on research undertaken in 1930, AP Elkin concluded that peoples in and from the southwest of the Northern \nTerritory, the western half of South Australia and the southeastern portion of Western Australia \u201care characterized \n\n\n\nby a number of common features in their social organization and beliefs, which not only serve to link them together, \nbut also to mark them off from [the peoples in the southeast of the Northern Territory, southwestern Queensland, \nand eastern half of South Australia].\u201d\n\n Specifically, Elkin said:(a) people in the area had neither patrilineal nor matrilineal moieties (and that the presence \nof alternate generation levels and sections should not be construed as suggesting they did).\n\n (b) \u201c[a]ll the tribes of [this area] have practically the same kinship system, and, indeed, use much the same terms\u201d.\n\n (c) there were birth totems, wherein not only did a person\u2019s totem depend \u201con his place of birth and the totem \nassociated with that place\u201d, \u201cthis totemism is ceremonial; the totemite ... [if] a fully initiated male, is taught the myths \nand ceremonies which enshrine the story of the culture-hero or heroes associated with the totem\u201d.\n\n (d) a common mythological \u201ctheme ... is associated with the totemism of the area and enshrines the exploits of the \ntotemic heroes of the time long past. The one term, djugur ... denotes a person\u2019s totem and the myth of his \nparticular totemic hero\u201d.\n\n (e) another totem was \u201cthe species associated with a person\u2019s conception\u201d.\n\n (f) conception was thought to occur when \u201cspirit-children enter women in the guise of food\u201d.\n\n (g) \u201c[t]he pattern of cicatrization on the backs of all fully initiated men of all tribes in this area is the same\u201d.It also \nshould be noted, although Elkin himself did not do so, that the people he worked with, and the peoples of the \nWestern Desert more generally, spoke dialects of the same unnamed Western Desert Language, meaning the area \non the whole had certain common social, cultural and linguistic features.\n\n Ron Berndt developed and extended on Elkin\u2019s work, saying that Elkin\u2019s \u201ccommon features\u201d extended across a \nmuch greater area of land than even Elkin had considered. As Berndt presented it, that area, which he said \nconstituted the Western Desert Cultural bloc, was made up of two parts. One part extended:eastward from \nKalgoorlie, Laverton and Leonora as far as Oodnadatta; and south from the central mountainous core (including the \nEverard, Musgrave, Man, Tomkinson, Petermann, Warburton and Rawlinson Ranges) to the Trans-continental \nRailway Line, including Lake Phillipson, Ooldea, Cundeelee and so on. This part has been called the Great Victoria \nDesert.The other part ran:from the Rawlinsons north-west past Lakes Gregory, Nabberu and Carnegie to Wiluna, \nand to Jigalong ... and [was] bounded on the north (beyond the Canning Stock Route) by the southern and eastern \nKimberleys.(Citations omitted.)  To reiterate the particular nature of Western Desert society, I adopt the following \ndescription by Dr Sackett:Unlike patrilineal landholding groups, Western Desert landholding groups are neither fixed \nnor predictable; they, as Myers observed, \u201care not a given.\u201d Rather, Western Desert landholding groups, \ntraditionally at least, were emergent bodies. That is, rather than it being the case that the landowners of a country \nwere constituted as a group through their shared defined descent from prior land holders, they were landowners of \nthe country through their shared associations with and to the land itself.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  As the applicant sets out in their final written submissions, there was agreement between Dr \nSackett and Dr Brunton on two key matters pertinent to this issue. First, and in broad terms, the matters to which I \nhave referred above, including the \u201cmultiple pathways\u201d to rights to country, which, as Dr Sackett expressed in his \nevidence (with Dr Brunton agreeing), means there is the \u201cpossibility of taking father\u2019s country, mother\u2019s country, \ngrandparent\u2019s country, growing up in the country, learning about it and making claims to it on the basis of one\u2019s \nknowledge of the country, and particularly, birth [on] country\u201d.  Second, country associated with Western Desert \npeople is not represented by a clear line which can be drawn on a map, with Western Desert society on one side \n\n\n\nand another kind of Aboriginal society on the other. Instead, the characteristics of Western Desert society \u201cfade\u201d (or \nperhaps become less apparent as a point of difference) until the point is reached that, overall, the Aboriginal society \nwould be characterised as a non-Western Desert society. The relevant example accepted by both Dr Sackett and \nDr Brunton in the regions around the claim area are the communities to the west of the claim area, around Cue and \nMeekatharra, which both experts agree are comprised of non-Western Desert people.  The argument is then about \nthe applicant, representing a landholding group which occupies country in between lands now clearly recognised \n(at least anthropologically) as lands of Western Desert people (such as the Warburton Ranges) and lands clearly \nrecognised (at least anthropologically) not to be so (such as Cue and Meekatharra). I should add here that, as the \nevidence in this case discloses, the claimant witnesses themselves also see clear distinctions between their own \nlaws and customs and those of the people to the west of them.\n\nMy conclusions  It is clear, as both Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett accept, the concept of a Western Desert society \n(even if one leaves out the \u201ccultural bloc\u201d part of the label) is an anthropological concept. More recently, it can also \nbe said to be a native title concept, as Dr Sackett also noted in his first report. Dr Brunton said in his evidence, and I \nagree, it is not an emic reality. Its function is to enable a classification of groups of Aboriginal people by non-\nAboriginal people, whether for the purpose of study (as by the early anthropologists) or for the purpose, in more \ncontemporary times, of ascertaining a landholding group for the purposes of the NT Act.  To that extent, care must \nbe taken in the way the concept is used. It is partly for that reason that I prefer not to use the phrase \u201cWestern \nDesert Cultural Bloc\u201d which is an expression coined by Professor Berndt. The Court is not engaged in any \nanthropological study or existential classification of Aboriginal people: rather, the Court is engaged in determining \nwhether the applicant has proven the matters required for a determination of native title. Central to that task is proof \nof matters in s 223 of the NT Act, which do not include any necessary determination of who might be correct on \nwhere a line can or should be drawn about the extent of the rights and interests in land of other groups who may \nidentify as Western Desert people.  Rather, the utility of the classification process in which anthropologists and \nCourts have engaged is to see whether there is a single set of laws and customs which unite a particular group of \npeople in their connection to particular areas of land and waters, and to decide whether those laws and customs are \ntraditional ones. In that sense, the anthropological analysis about the traditional laws and customs of Western \nDesert people is important. But it is not a classification of where the traditional laws and customs of Western Desert \npeople begin or end as an independent exercise.  It is also for this reason that I would, with respect, take a different \napproach from the one taken by Lindgren J in Wongatha.\n\nThe place for inferences in contested issues about laws and customs in the claim area at sovereignty  This was the \nsubject of detailed submissions by both the applicant and the State. The role and application of the approach set \nout by Selway J in Gumana was contested. In any native title case, there will be an important role for inferential \nreasoning, because of the passage of time between the circumstances at or before sovereignty, and the \ncircumstances prevailing at the time the Court must determine whether the requirements of s 223 of the NT Act are \nsatisfied.  A case such as the present poses additional challenges in the use of inferential reasoning. That is so for \ntwo reasons. First, the additional questions posed by the movement of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors (or at \nleast some of them) into the claim area in the early twentieth century requires more steps in inferential reasoning \nthan might usually be the case. Second, the paucity and nature of any broadly contemporaneous evidence \nconcerning the situation in 1912 also means the applicant must rely on inference, and on expert evidence, to a \ngreater extent than may be the case in some other claims.  Relying on Sackville J\u2019s judgment in Jango at [460]-\n[464], the State submits that the applicant needs to adduce \u201canthropological evidence to establish the link between \ncurrent laws and customs (or those observed in the recent past) and the laws and customs acknowledged and \nobserved by the claimants\u2019 predecessors at the time of sovereignty\u201d. The claimant evidence alone cannot, the State \nsubmits, establish that the laws and customs to which they depose are \u201ctraditional\u201d, in the sense of existing at the \ntime of sovereignty. The State repeated this contention at several points in its submissions. In my opinion, the State \nseeks to elevate Sackville J\u2019s observations in Jango to some kind of legal requirement, which they are not. There is \nno legal requirement that ethnographic or anthropological evidence must directly establish the existence, nature \nand content of laws and customs observed by the Aboriginal people who occupied a claim area at sovereignty. \nInferential reasoning may operate on anthropological and ethnographic evidence and opinion, just as it may on the \nevidence of claimant witnesses.  In Jango at [441], Sackville J said:In Yorta Yorta (HC), as I have noted, the joint \njudgment pointed out that laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum, but derive from all forces that go to make \n\n\n\nsociety. In that case, the content of the laws and customs was known, but there was no society which continued to \nacknowledge and observe them. Here it is the content of the laws and customs that is in issue.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  In the present case, unlike Yorta Yorta, the issue is not whether there is a present society \nwhich continues to acknowledge laws and customs. The State ultimately conceded continued acknowledgement by \nthe claim group of Western Desert laws and customs. Nor, unlike Jango, is the content of those laws and customs \nin real dispute \u2013 save for perhaps the question whether the traditional rights and interests identified by the applicant \ninclude a right to take resources. The issue in the present case is the identity (or characterisation) of the people \nwho, at sovereignty, recognised and practiced what the State accepts were traditional laws and customs giving rise \nto rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area. The question is: whose traditions? Traditions of the \nWestern Desert people, or not?  The State also relied on remarks by Lindgren J in Wongatha (at [345]), to the \neffect that:... the permissible drawing of inferences requires careful consideration of the practice or activity, the \nfrequency or rarity of its occurrence as observed, the circumstances of earlier times in so far as they are known and \nthe general probabilities.  So far as it goes, there is little to object to in these remarks: they represent an orthodox \napproach to inferential reasoning. However, the application of this approach will be very much dependent on the \nevidence adduced, and the arguments put, in any given case.  The State also relied on observations of Barker J in \nCG (Deceased) on behalf of the Badimia People v Western Australia [2015] FCA 204 at [116], to the effect that a \nCourt must carefully weigh earlier ethnographic data, to determine whether the claim group members\u2019 \nunderstanding of the pre-sovereignty position had been affected by post-sovereignty events. While those \nobservations may have been pertinent to the issues raised before his Honour, the present situation is different. It is \nnot the State\u2019s case that \u201cpost-sovereignty events\u201d affected the claim group members\u2019 understanding of the pre-\nsovereignty position. The State did not identify any such events, and did not submit the claim group members \nlaboured under any misunderstanding of the pre-sovereignty position. The State\u2019s case was that the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors had \u201cimposed\u201d Western Desert laws and customs on the claim area. The State did not really \ndispute that the laws and customs to which the claim group members deposed were traditional. Rather, it said they \nwere not \u201ctraditional\u201d to this claim area: it contends they were imported. That is quite different from the \ncircumstances in Badimia to which Barker J\u2019s remarks were directed.  The emphasis on historical European \nevidence in the State\u2019s submissions continued with somewhat in terrorem submissions, said to be based in part on \nthe Full Court\u2019s decision in Bodney. The State submits it would be a \u201cserious error\u201d for the Court to:... simply draw \ninferences from contemporary Aboriginal evidence about the nature and identity of traditional laws and customs and \ntraditional \u201csociety\u201d in the Claimed Area at sovereignty. Moreover, if the Applicant is unable to identify the system \nfor allocating rights and interests in land at sovereignty, then the Applicant cannot succeed.  The phrase \u201cserious \nerror\u201d was taken from the Full Court\u2019s decision in Bodney, but in my opinion (and contrary to the State\u2019s \nsubmissions) the Full Court was describing another kind of difficulty when it used that phrase.  The \u201cserious error\u201d to \nwhich the Full Court in Bodney was referring was not a failure to take anthropological evidence into account at all, \nnor a failure to take it into account in assessing what the normative system of laws and customs was at sovereignty. \nRather, as the passages at [84]-[95] make clear, the Full Court identified error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to have \nregard to anthropological evidence from the period after settlement and up to the time of determination (for \nexample, evidence from the 1970s \u2013 put forward in that case by Dr Brunton \u2013 that the Noongar people had \u201clost\u201d \ntheir customs and traditions). As the heading to this part of the Full Court\u2019s reasons makes clear, the error the Full \nCourt was describing related to the way the trial judge dealt with evidence regarding the continuity of traditional \nlaws and customs.  This is quite a different issue from the one raised in this proceeding, which concerns \u2013 as I have \nnoted \u2013 the characterisation of the laws and customs which governed rights and interests in the claim area at \nsovereignty. In any event, there is no sense in which any evidence \u2013 ethnographic or anthropological \u2013 is being \n\u201cignored\u201d. The real question is what records such as those created by Daisy Bates are capable of proving, and what \nare they not capable of proving. The State\u2019s reliance on Bodney is in my opinion misplaced.\n\nOnus of proof  The State submits that onus will be important in this case, in particular because there is doubt \nconcerning the identification of the Aboriginal occupants of the claim area at, and before, sovereignty.  The State \nsubmits that, to discharge its onus, the applicant will need to confront the presence of another explanation based on \nhistorical records (essentially, the position put by Dr Brunton), which especially by reference to the work of Daisy \nBates, lays a factual foundation for a conclusion that non-Western Desert people inhabited the claim area. In that \n\n\n\nsense, the State submits the applicant cannot discharge its onus.  The applicant must prove their case on the \nbalance of probabilities. They need not exclude or resolve all doubts, disconformities and possibilities. They must \npersuade the Court that the thesis for which they contend is more likely than not. To the extent that, at some points, \nthe State\u2019s submissions appeared to suggest a higher onus, they must be rejected.  There are a number of ways to \napproach the parties\u2019 competing theses in this case, and to fit them into a framework of onus of proof. In my \nopinion, a matter which is critical to bear in mind, and which the State\u2019s submissions tend to overlook or diminish, is \nthat the Court must evaluate all the evidence before it in terms of its reliability, persuasiveness and probative value. \nNo category of evidence starts with any presumptions of reliability, accuracy or superiority. That includes the \nmaterials of Daisy Bates.\n\nThe work of Richard Kingsford  Mr Richard Kingsford is one of the anthropologists whose work is referred to by both \nDr Sackett and Dr Brunton. The purpose of Mr Kingsford\u2019s Masters thesis was to consider the laws and customs of \nthe Yamatji groups of the Murchison region. It is common ground that the Wadjari and Badimia groups were not \nWestern Desert people and were located further west of the claim area and of Daisy Bates\u2019 Ngaiawonga. In his \nthesis, Mr Kingsford expressed the view that Wadjari and Badimia are \u201cdistinct languages ... associated with a \ndistinct territory and a distinct people, and enduring over time\u201d. Mr Kingsford noted that the Wadjari and Badimia \nlanguage units conform to the characteristics of a tribe. Mr Kingsford observed the Yamatji view of \u201cwanmala\u201d, \nbeing the country to the east of Meekatharra, as acting to reinforce ethnocentrism, or Yamatji solidarity against the \nwanmala.  In terms of the local organisation and laws regarding rights in land applicable to Wadjari and Badimia, Mr \nKingsford reported that a person may be affiliated to the \u201cestate\u201d of his or her father, mother and mother\u2019s brother, \nand/or birth. However, he went on to say that the weight of evidence tends to favour patrilineal descent and a \nperson should preferably be born near a site associated with his or her father or mother. He contrasted the position \nof the Western Desert people. He said that the Western Desert people accepted that childbirth may not be possible \nin a desirable location as a result of the large distances sometimes covered by people in the search for food. Mr \nKingsford also said that, in contrast, Western Desert people are generally more mobile and place greater emphasis \non long mythic tracks. Mr Kingsford described the local organisation of the Yamatji and some Western Desert \ngroups as similar or comparable, despite considering that there was a closer parallel to the Aranda region which \nadjoins the east of the Western Desert.  Overall, the applicant submits that two conclusions can be drawn from the \nwork of Mr Kingsford:(a) Firstly, what can be said with confidence is that linguistically and culturally Wadjari and \nBadimia country, to the west of Meekatharra, is distinct from the Western Desert. That is, there is a line beyond \nwhich the country and people are clearly not part of the Western Desert cultural bloc, and that line is to the west of \nthe Claimed Area. \n\n (b) Secondly, in terms of their laws and customs, even the Murchison Yamatji groups such as Wadjari and Badimia \nare likely to have observed somewhat similar laws and customs in relation to rights in land, to those of the Western \nDesert cultural bloc ... The differences are matters of degree, and may be explicable in terms of the differing \nenvironments.  The State submits that it is somewhat surprising that the applicant argues that weight should be \ngiven to Mr Kingsford\u2019s work given that neither Dr Sackett nor Dr Brunton placed any reliance upon Mr Kingsford\u2019s \nwork. The State submits that Dr Sackett was not asked about this issue, nor did he express a view about the \ncogency or reliability of Mr Kingsford\u2019s opinions. In his oral evidence, Dr Brunton suggested that Mr Kingsford had \nrelied on two or three informants in his work and, although his thesis was comprehensive, it contained \n\u201cinconsistencies that were difficult to reconcile\u201d, there were \u201cmany things missing\u201d and there were \u201cproblems with his \naccounts\u201d.  The State referred to the decision of Badimia, where Barker J observed that the applicant\u2019s expert \nanthropologist said that Mr Kingsford\u2019s maps were not intended to be geographically accurate or to represent tribal \nboundaries. Further, the State pointed to Barker J\u2019s observation that Mr Kingsford\u2019s work may have depended too \nmuch on the views of persons in the 1980s and their life experiences on pastoral stations.  Ultimately, the State \nsubmits that the conclusions sought to be drawn by the applicant from Mr Kingsford\u2019s work are not supported by \nthe material itself. There is nothing in Mr Kingsford\u2019s work, the State submits, which indicates there is a line west of \nthe claim area which separates the Western Desert from other groups. Further, the State submits that Mr \nKingsford\u2019s account of descent-based \u201cestate groups\u201d does not correspond with Western Desert notions of \u201cmultiple \npathways\u201d for rights in land.  The State\u2019s submissions have force. The proposition I accept from the applicant\u2019s first \nsuggested conclusion (at [407] above) is that, linguistically and culturally, Wadjari and Badimia country \u2013 to the \n\n\n\nwest of Meekatharra \u2013 is distinct from the Western Desert. So much was essentially common ground between the \nparties and the experts.  Otherwise I do not place any weight on Mr Kingsford\u2019s work. In particular, the concept of a \n\u201cline\u201d being drawn to the west of the claim area based on Mr Kingsford\u2019s work is no more persuasive to me than the \n\u201cline\u201d identified by Professor Berndt.\n\nOther historical anthropological material  As the parties\u2019 submissions demonstrated, Aboriginal people in and \naround the claim area have been the subject of inquiry and study from the early twentieth century. After Daisy \nBates, Norman Tindale worked in and around the area in the 1940s and then Professor Berndt worked in the area \nin the late 1950s and early 1960s. With Mr Tindale was another anthropologist called Jud Epling. He did some field \nwork in the early 1950s which has some bearing on one of the (many) labels Aboriginal people in the region of the \nclaim area have given themselves: Tjupan. Mr Tindale again considered the location and composition of Aboriginal \npeople in the area in the early 1970s. I refer to the work of Mr Tindale, Mr Epling, and Professor Berndt as \nnecessary in making my findings.  Dr Brunton referred to the work of Professor Robert Tonkinson. I accept the \napplicant\u2019s submissions (and Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion) that the work done by Professor Tonkinson is not of any \nrelevance to the issues to be decided in this case.\n\nThe importance of Ken Liberman\u2019s work in the 1970s  It is necessary to spend some time on Mr Liberman\u2019s work \nbecause of the various uses to which the parties put it in their final submissions. I take a different view of his work to \nthe view I take of Mr Kingsford\u2019s work. As I understand it, Mr Liberman was awarded his PhD after he completed his \nwork in the claim area. Accordingly, I have not used the title \u201cDr\u201d when referring to Mr Liberman. In not doing so, I \nintend no disrespect to Mr Liberman.  The work of Mr Liberman which is in evidence before me (aside from the \nopinions of Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton based on, or reporting on, Mr Liberman\u2019s work) is an extract from a report Mr \nLiberman prepared in 1976, and revised in 1978 entitled \u201cA Survey for Aboriginal Sites: Yeelirrie Uranium Project\u201d. \nThe entire report is not in evidence before me, because it essentially contains two parts: an ethnographic part and \nan archaeological part. The parties agreed the archaeological part is not relevant to the issues to be determined by \nthe Court and it was not tendered. What is in evidence is, as I understand it, a complete copy of the ethnographic \npart of Mr Liberman\u2019s report, although the gender restricted part of his report was tendered separately and is \nsubject to the same confidentiality orders as the other gender restricted evidence in this proceeding.  Yeelirrie is the \nname of a pastoral station approximately in the middle of the claim area, but slightly towards the northern half of the \nclaim area. It is an area about which Ms Wonyabong, Mr Allan Ashwin, Mr Henry Ashwin, Mr Victor Ashwin, Ms \nNarrier, Mr Richard Narrier, Mr Keith Narrier, Mr Muir and Ms Geraldine Hogarth gave evidence in particular.  In the \nintroduction to the report, B J Wright, the Registrar of Aboriginal Sites for the Western Australia Museum describes \nthe report as part of an environmental impact study of the Yeelirrie Uranium Project, which was at that stage a \nproject being investigated by the Western Mining Corporation. The report was undertaken under the auspices of the \nWestern Australian Museum. In the introduction Mr Wright (who undertook the archaeological part of the report, \nalong with Mr Liberman and a number of other people) describes the research done by Mr Liberman (for the \nethnographic part of the report) as having been done in:... the Cue, Meekatharra, Wiluna and Leonora area during \nthe period from September to November, 1976. An attempt was made to locate and consult Aborigines \u2013(a) who \nwere born in the Yeelirrie area;\n\n (b) who had lived a traditional life in the Yeelirrie area;\n\n (c) who have worked on Yeelirrie during the lifetime of people in the foregoing categories;\n\n (d) who have lived on nearby pastoral properties or towns, and who may know traditions concerning the Yeelirrie \narea.  The report noted it was not possible to locate any Aboriginal people in group (a), but people in the remaining \ncategories were found and participated in the investigation.  It can immediately be seen that one of the critical \ndistinctions between Mr Liberman\u2019s work and that of other earlier anthropologists is that it was expressly focussed \nonly on a region inside the claim area and, indeed, right in the middle of the claim area.  The report commences \nwith the observation that when Yeelirrie was established as a pastoral station in 1924 \u201cthere appears to have been \nno group of Aboriginal people occupying the area\u201d. Mr Liberman suggests this is consistent with accounts \nreproduced further on in the report, to the effect that many Aboriginal people moved \u201caway from their traditional \n\n\n\nterritories towards centres such as Cue, Meekatharra, Wiluna and Leonora soon after the establishment of those \ntowns towards the end of the last century\u201d. The State\u2019s submissions seek to have the Court place some weight on \nthese factual observations and I return to them below.  Broadly, Mr Liberman identified two groups of people as \nhaving connections to the claim area \u2013 and, therefore, to the sites he was instructed to investigate for the purposes \nof the report. He found there was a dialect group he called the Tjupany (Tjupan) to the north of Yeelirrie and \nanother, which he called Kuwarra (Koara), to the south. Dr Sackett notes in his Tjiwarl Registration Report that one \nof Mr Liberman\u2019s informants told him that Tjupany was the \u201coldest name around. Other names have come later\u201d. I \ndeal with my conclusions on the evidence about these dialect/identity labels, such as Tjupan, Kuwarra or Koara, \nNgalia and the like at [449]-[461] of these reasons.  In his report, Mr Liberman refers to his informants in a de-\nidentified fashion. However, there is a confidential annexure to the report which identifies his 38 informants. Several \nof those people were relatives and/or ancestors of the claim group members, including: Diamond White and Frank \nNarrier (the sons of Spider Narrier), Jimmy Hennessey (the husband of Spider Narrier\u2019s daughter, Mavis \nWhite/Narrier), Ken and Adeline Hennessey (the son and daughter of Jimmy Hennessey and Mavis White/Narrier), \nMicky Warren (who Mr Douglas Bingham identified as his grandfather) and Roy and Croydon Beaman (the sons of \nCharlie Beaman (Piman)).  As Dr Brunton recounts, there were only four informants whom Mr Liberman considered \nhad lived a \u201ctraditional life\u201d \u2013 by which, as Dr Brunton observed (and Dr Sackett agreed) he seemed to mean a life \nbased heavily on hunting and foraging rather than depending on European rations or employment with Europeans. \nThose four people are described by Dr Brunton in his report:These four were all women, around eighty years of \nage, who had lived in the vicinity of Yeelirrie either as small children, or in one case, as a young woman. And all \nhad a Western Desert language speaking background:  Reila King who was born around 1898 at Hillview Station, \nwhich is around 50 km south east of Meekatharra, the daughter of Jack Merrick, who was probably a white man, \nand an unknown Kuwarra speaking mother;\n  \n  Dolly Ward, born in the 1890s at Lake Violet, around 50 km east of Wiluna, the daughter of a Nanga speaking \nwoman, and a European father, who had lived at Yeelirrie as a young woman;\n  \n  Annie Leak, born in the 1890s near Glen-Ayle, which is around 250 km north east of Wiluna, whose mother spoke \nTjupany, and whose father spoke an unknown dialect;\n  \n\n  Nellie Graham, born in the 1890s at Kulele Creek, a little north east of Wongawol, whose mother and father spoke \nPurtitjarra.(Citations omitted.)  One of the difficulties with Mr Liberman\u2019s report, in common with some of the earlier \nethnographic material, is pointed out by Dr Sackett in his supplementary report:We do not know whether the \naccounts presented by Liberman were edited or the wholly complete versions, at least as far as his informants were \nconcerned, of the stories he recorded. We cannot know if he might have asked questions to elicit further details \nfrom informants. It is clear that some of the versions he related were the product of more than one voice, ie he \nassociated them with more than a single informant. As for the claimant statements, we know each tells his or her \nown version of the Tjila myth-story. But again, we cannot know whether more time or questions might have led to a \nmore detailed version of events.  In his supplementary report, Dr Sackett spends some time analysing the different \nversions of the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa, including those recorded by Mr Liberman, both for the Yeelirrie report \nand then later in 1980 (in a published journal article).  Dr Sackett draws two critical propositions from Mr Liberman\u2019s \nwork. The first is an opinion, which Dr Sackett shares, that the existence of different versions is not problematic for \nthe authenticity (if that be the correct word) nor the provenance of a Tjukurrpa. Dr Sackett states:No two tellings of \nthe Tjila Kutjara [the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa] story are the same. A comparison of the versions recorded by \nLiberman and those put forth by claimants indicates that this is not a recent phenomenon. In fact, as Liberman saw \nit:such discrepancies [between versions] must be considered a natural phenomenon characteristic of widely spread \ncommunities carrying on the same Dreaming. There is no question of which one is the correct version...(Citation \nomitted.)  The second proposition concerns what can be said about the continuity of traditional laws and customs in \nthe claim area. Dr Sackett states:By my reading, Bates did not report any rendering of the Two Snakes story. \nRather, it appears first to have been recorded in the area of the claim in the mid-1970s by Liberman. However, \nLiberman saw the story as having an earlier history, writing:it is clear that the major Dreaming track in the region is \nthat of the two Carpet Snakes. This track comes from Ngaanyatjarra and Martutjarra territories (both Western \nDesert areas) and enters the Kuwarra [ie Koara] region. As recently as thirty years ago Ngaayatjarra and \n\n\n\nMartutjarra people participated in ceremonies with Kuwarra people at sites associated with the Carpet Snake \nDreaming (ngalpiri and tjampua)...That is, by Liberman\u2019s reckoning, ceremonies relating to the Tjila Kutjara were \nlast performed on the Tjiwarl Claim area in the mid-1940s.\n\n However, there is no reason to suppose the Dreaming and its associated rites were new to the area in the mid-\n1940s. That is, that Bates did not mention the Tjila Kutjara does not mean the Dreaming necessarily was any less \nimportant to people in the early years of the last century (and to people before them) than it was to Liberman\u2019s \ninformants in the mid-1970s or is to Tjiwarl Claimants today.\n\n Liberman did not discuss or relate how his informants came to have and hold their knowledge of the Tjila Kutjara.  \nDr Sackett goes on in this section of his supplementary report to express his opinion, which I have accepted \nelsewhere, that notwithstanding Daisy Bates\u2019 failure to record any such Tjukurrpa in the area (bearing in mind Ms \nBates did not in fact work in the claim area) and that the first European recording of it was by Mr Liberman, when \none considers the claimant evidence, it is apparent that the oral tradition of the Tjukurrpa extended back to \nsovereignty and earlier.  In this sense, Mr Liberman\u2019s work in the late 1970s is consistent with the opinions of Dr \nSackett, whose evidence I have generally accepted in this proceeding. However, there is a further aspect of Mr \nLiberman\u2019s report which is important in this proceeding.  Mr Liberman also concluded that the claim area was \nWestern Desert country, and that its original inhabitants were Western Desert people. Although Dr Sackett agreed \nwith Mr Liberman\u2019s conclusion, he did not agree with his reasoning, or the basis for that reasoning, and this is a \nmatter which should be set out. Nor did he agree with some of Mr Liberman\u2019s findings, such as that Tjupan people \nwere some of the original inhabitants of the claim area. Dr Sackett\u2019s view is that, although Tjupan people are \u201cvery \nmuch\u201d Western Desert people, they also came down into the claim area at some time. Clearly, Dr Brunton \ndisagreed with the conclusion that the original inhabitants were Western Desert people.  The basis for Mr \nLiberman\u2019s conclusion that the people in the claim area had always been Western Desert people was largely \nlinguistic. That is, the dialects spoken by the two sets of speakers Mr Liberman identified in the claim area \u2013 the \nTjupan or Tjupany to the north of Yeelirrie and the Kurrawa or Koara to the south \u2013 had much in common with \nWestern Desert dialects, and much less in common with Badimia and Wadjari to the west. Mr Liberman also relied \non the fact that the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa was essentially consistent across the claim area and came from \nthe land east of the claim area.  In his report, Mr Liberman said:Speaking in Ngaanyatjarra, a dialect from the \nWarburton Ranges, I was capable of communicating in the Aboriginal dialect with both Kuwarra and Tjupany \npeople, whereas it was not possible for me to communicate with the Patimaya and Watjari people further west.\n\n ...\n\n Finally, it is clear that the major Dreaming track in the region is that of the two Carpet Snakes. This track comes \nfrom Ngaanyatjarra and Martutjarra territories (both Western Desert areas) and enters the Kuwarra region. As \nrecently as thirty years ago Ngaayatjarra [sic] and Martutjarra people participated in ceremonies with Kuwarra \npeople at sites associated with the Carpet Snake Dreaming (ngalpiri and tjampua) and several Martutjarra men \nwere instrumental in getting another site in the Kuwarra region west of Berndt\u2019s line, Weebo, declared a \u201cprotected \narea\u201d under the Aboriginal Heritage Act (1972). \n\n Given this evidence, the western limit of the Western Desert cultural bloc must be extended westward to include \nthe Kuwarra and Tjupany people. This would incorporate the Yeelirrie location as part of the Western Desert \nAboriginal area.  Although Dr Sackett\u2019s ultimate opinion was broadly consistent with the conclusion in Mr \nLiberman\u2019s final paragraph, both Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton disagreed with Mr Liberman\u2019s analysis. They did not \naccept the location Mr Liberman had given to speakers of the Tjupan and Koara dialects, nor did they consider \nlanguage as important a marker as Mr Liberman did. For example, Dr Sackett confirmed that in his opinion the \nTjupan were more in the eastern and north-eastern regions of the claim area, rather than right in the middle of it as \nMr Liberman proposed. However, as I have noted, Mr Liberman\u2019s overall conclusion was that he was dealing with \nWestern Desert people, with rights and interests in land arising from traditional Western Desert laws and customs. \n\n\n\nThat was Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion as well and, as I explain in these reasons, they are opinions with which I agree.  Dr \nSackett was also cross-examined and then re-examined on observations he made about Mr Liberman\u2019s analysis in \na report Dr Sackett prepared for the Wiluna determination.  The relevant observation was made in the Wiluna report \nby Dr Sackett while he was discussing Mr Liberman\u2019s analysis of the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa as indicating \nthe Yeelirrie area was Western Desert country. Dr Sackett\u2019s comment in brackets at this stage of his report was \nthe following:(I\u2019m not sure that a shared Dreaming and shared ritual participation can safely be read as indicating \nshared culture.)  Dr Sackett, in re-examination, explained what he meant in the following way:... that Dreamings, \nbecause they go in and out of the desert or across cultural or social boundaries, they needn\u2019t be the \u2013 the people \nthat share that Dreaming needn\u2019t be of the same culture.  What he had also said earlier in cross-examination, is that \nthe doubt he expressed here was about Dreamings leaving the Western Desert. I infer what Dr Sackett meant by \nthis clarification is that where a Dreaming travelled through the Western Desert and then left it, just because the \nDreaming came out of the Western Desert and was known to people outside the Western Desert did not make \nthose people Western Desert people. That, it seems to me, must be a correct proposition.  Notwithstanding this, \nwhat Mr Liberman\u2019s informants told him, especially about the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa, was seen by Dr \nSackett as significant. This extract from his cross-examination explains why:Yes. Liberman\u2019s informants were what \nhe said were Dupan [Tjupan] people, effectively, in relation to that issue?---Some were, not all of them.\n\n Yes?---He described some of them as Dupan [Tjupan], yes.\n\n Those Dupan [Tjupan] people, on your view, are not \u2013 be careful, bearing in mind my conversation with your \nHonour earlier \u2013 that your view about the Dupan [Tjupan] is they\u2019re not locals in the sense that they weren\u2019t there at \nsovereignty, in the claim area?---No. But they learned from people that were, in my view.\n\n Yes. There\u2019s no direct evidence that they learned. That\u2019s your assumption?---But it\u2019s an assumption based on the \nstories that people tell, how their old people learned from older people. And these stories hook up with other stories \nin some way, shape or form. \n\n Yes?---It\u2019s not like the Jilla Kogara [Tjila Kutjara] are there and only there. It\u2019s an extensive dreaming with the \nsame features as it moves through the countryside. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  Thus, Mr Liberman\u2019s work is of some real significance. It was recorded and completed well \nbefore the native title regime was introduced. As both the applicant submits and Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence supports, the \naccounts given by Mr Liberman\u2019s informants about the Tjila Kutjara are broadly consistent with the accounts given \nby the claimant witnesses. Further, Mr Liberman\u2019s informants (mostly aged between 50 and 80 years in the 1970s) \nwere speaking from what they had been told by their elders, which would place their elders in the claim area before \nDaisy Bates was working there in 1912.  As Dr Sackett observed, the assumption (based on the way oral history \ngenerally operates in Aboriginal societies) is that the old people who spoke to Mr Liberman had been told the Tjila \nKutjara by their old people. There is no suggestion \u2013 and I do not accept \u2013 that they had invented it. It is more likely \nthey were telling it for the area around Yeelirrie because others, who were authorised to do so, had told them.  At \nanother point in his report, this is precisely the point Mr Liberman makes about what one of his informants told him \nabout Mr Micky Wonyabong. Mr Wonyabong is Ms Shirley Wonyabong\u2019s father, and Mr Liberman\u2019s informant was \ndescribing what Mr Wonyabong knew about sites, and laws and customs in the Yeelirrie area. This is what Mr \nLiberman records:Mick Wonyabong worked on Yeelirrie Station for a period of ten years, from 1942 to 1952. He \nwas a Puntitjara man who was born near Wongawol Station. He told Informant PP that he had heard the traditions \nabout the sites at Yeelirrie from \u201cthe old people\u201d from the area.  Mr Liberman observes at the start of his report (and \nrepeats throughout it) that there were, at the time of his research, no Aboriginal people alive from the original \ndescent groups in the area. The State submits I should take those remarks from Mr Liberman at face value as they \nsupport its thesis that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors simply migrated into the area and imposed Western \nDesert laws and customs on the area.  I find the position to be more nuanced. First, it must be recalled that Mr \nLiberman was dealing only with the country on Yeelirrie station. I see no basis for extending his remarks about \n\n\n\nthere being no original Aboriginal inhabitants to the whole claim area. There is no suggestion he was sufficiently \ninformed to make any more widely applicable assertion. In relation to Yeelirrie, what Mr Liberman recorded is that \nMicky Wonyabong was told, between 1942 and 1952, about sites around Yeelirrie by the \u201cold people\u201d. While those \n\u201cold people\u201d may well not have survived into the 1970s when Mr Liberman was conducting his research, what Mr \nWonyabong had related to Mr Liberman\u2019s informant was the passing on of knowledge, not the imposition of it.  \nSecond, it seems to me that even allowing for the state of affairs he believed existed on Yeelirrie (that is, that there \nwere no \u201coriginal\u201d inhabitants left), Mr Liberman nevertheless remained of the opinion that the land at Yeelirrie was \nWestern Desert country, and the way he reconciled what he was being told in the 1970s with what could be seen \nas traditional laws and customs for the area was through what he described as the \u201cDesert Praxis\u201d. In his report, he \ndescribed the Desert Praxis in the following terms:The relationships with the Dreaming tracks discussed do not \nrepresent a reality which is past. Contemporary Aborigines in the areas concerned continue to have an active \nrelationship with the tracks. Any active relationship implies also that the relationship is not stagnant; and I would \npropose that this relationship is best viewed as a praxis held by Aboriginal people. That is to say; Aborigines have \nthe capacity for continued interpretation of the landscape according to the structural properties of the networks of \ntracks and Dreaming activities we have been discussing. Any human interpretive order will not long survive as a \npassive schema. In realising its interpretation, such a conceptual world-view becomes projected onto wordly \nphenomena, transforming the world, and reflexively, itself in the process. Such an active, dialectical relationship is \ncharacteristic of any live conceptual system. \n\n As we are dealing with a praxis which is still a live, emerging reality, it must be acknowledged that the locations of \nspecific tracks may be shifted according to the discovery of new \u201cevidence\u201d. Therefore, it is not surprising to find \ninstances, such as occurred at Warburton only months ago, where a new deposit of smooth, large white stones was \nevaluated as evidence of where the Kangaroos passed during the Dreaming. This resulted in a shift of the \nperceived location of the track of several hundred metres.  This being the way Mr Liberman saw the practice of laws \nand customs for Western Desert people, he then went on to describe what he appeared to have considered actually \nhappened:This discussion of Desert praxis is relevant to our study at hand, in that many traditional Aborigines, \nassociated with the Carpet Snake Dreaming track and Dingo Dreaming track in regions to the east of the study area \nwere aware that these world-creative powers entered the territory we are now examining. They may not have \nknown each particular site, but they may have some spiritual affiliation with the track as a whole just the same. As \nthey migrated westward, their adoption of the Dreaming sites of those people who were originally located in the \nwestern regions is to be understood as a natural consequence of the Desert Aborigines\u2019 spiritual praxis. Their \nconcern for sites to which they may not be related genealogically must be acknowledged as valid.  Described in this \nway, there is no \u201cimposition\u201d of laws and customs, but rather the continuation of existing practices in new areas \nwhere traditional spiritual affiliation with Dreaming tracks already existed.  Therefore, I do not accept the State\u2019s \nsubmissions (and Dr Brunton\u2019s opinion) that Mr Liberman was describing a \u201creplacement\u201d of the rituals of the \noriginal inhabitants with the rituals of people from further east. Rather, he was describing how members of the same \nsociety as those who occupied the area originally could move into the area, and continue to observe the Tjukurrpa \nof the area into which they moved.\n\nReferences in the evidence to Tjupan, Koara and Ngalia  I have put these self-identifying labels used by witnesses \nin this proceeding together under one heading, although the evidence (and the opinions of Dr Sackett and Dr \nBrunton) leads me to different conclusions about each of them. As I have noted elsewhere in these reasons, the \nlabels or names used by Aboriginal people to identify themselves, and to identify themselves with a group, are fluid. \nOn some occasions, sufficient links can be drawn between multiple sources referring to the use of specific names \nor labels so that it can be said with some confidence that people who use a name or label have a connection with \nparticular country. Sometimes that is not the case. The examples of Tjupan and Ngalia reflect, in my opinion, each \nof those possibilities.  In his Tjiwarl Registration Report, Dr Sackett notes that several of the older claim group \nmembers, who are now deceased, had identified as Tjupan and had identified the language they spoke as Tjupan. \nIn this proceeding, several witnesses also identified the language they spoke as Tjupan, including Ms Wonyabong, \nMr Richard Narrier, Mr Allan Ashwin, Mr James and Ms Tullock. Ms Tullock also used Tjupan to describe a group of \npeople, when she spoke of \u201cthe Tjupan and the Wongai mob\u201d. Mr Leroy Beaman also used the identifier Tjupan to \n\n\n\ndescribe his group membership:I say I\u2019m a Wongai, but really my blood flows Tjupan. I\u2019m Wongai through my dad\u2019s \nmother and Tjupan through my dad\u2019s dad. I\u2019m more of a Tjupan person.\n\n My father Edwin Beaman is a Wongai through his mother or Tjupan man, through his father.  Dr Sackett notes that \na colleague of Mr Tindale\u2019s, Mr Jud Epling, was the first anthropologist to mention Tjupan. This occurred in 1953, \nafter some fieldwork, which resulted in Mr Epling recommending that Mr Tindale change an entry on his 1940 map \nfrom \u201cPini\u201d to \u201cTjubun\u201d in relation to identifying the group occupying country in the eastern part of what is now the \nTjiwarl claim area. Dr Sackett records that Mr Tindale did not agree, and did not change the entry, but in his 1974 \nversion of the map, he did add \u201cTjubun\u201d as an alternative entry. It is clear that Tjubun is another spelling of Tjupan.  \nWhen Professor Berndt was working in the area from the late 1950s through to the 1980s, Dr Sackett records that \nProfessor Berndt saw the people he described as \u201cDjuban\u201d (again, another spelling for Tjupan) as different people, \noccupying different country, from the people whom he described as \u201cBiniridjara\u201d (which he equated with Mr \nTindale\u2019s \u201cPini\u201d or \u201cBirni\u201d). Professor Berndt located the Djuban people east of Wiluna and north of Mulga Queen \n(which, depending on how far north of Mulga Queen, would take the area close to Wongawol). He located the \nBiniridjara people north-west of Lake Carnegie, which would appear to place their country north of Wongawol and \nup towards the Canning Stock Route.  As I have noted in the section of these reasons where I deal with the work of \nMr Liberman in the 1970s, as well as identifying them as Western Desert people, Mr Liberman located those he \nidentified as \u201cTjupany\u201d in country around Yeelirrie station. In his work, Mr Liberman appeared to hold the view that \nthe Tjupan or Tjupany (around Yeelirrie) and the Kuwarra or Koara (further south), were the original occupants of \nthe area. However, neither Dr Sackett nor Dr Brunton agreed with this view, and during their concurrent evidence in \nthis proceeding both expressed the opinion that Tjupan or Tjupany (and, Kurrawa or Koara, it would appear) \npeoples had moved into the claim area from further east. I note here that the transcript of the expert evidence \nrecords Kurrawa as \u201cGulara\u201d and this is one of the many misspellings which make it rather difficult to follow the \nevidence in the transcript.  Notwithstanding this qualification imposed by Dr Sackett on some of Mr Liberman\u2019s \nconclusions, Dr Sackett did agree with Mr Liberman\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cclose similarities\u201d in language between \npeople who identified as Tjupan or Tjupany (and Kuwarra or Koara \u2013 see below) supported a conclusion that these \npeople were Western Desert people. This lead Dr Sackett to reach the following overall conclusions:In my view, two \nthings emerge from this. First, the reports of researchers from earliest to more recent appear to track a shift in \nname: from \u2018Pi\u2019ni to Tjupan. At the same time, they appear to track a shift in the area of the \u2018Pi\u2019ni/Tjupan to the west.\n\n Whatever the case in this regard, in my view the evidence is solid that the Tjupan were/are part of the Western \nDesert/Western Desert society. As best can be determined, Tjupan origins were/are in lands to the northeast/east \nof the Tjiwarl claim area. In other words, those lands are comfortably east of the western extents of the Western \nDesert/Western Desert society. It is not surprising, then, that Liberman found his Tjupany to be culturally and \nlinguistically Western Desert.\n\n That is, in my opinion, Tjupan was/is merely one of the Western Desert Language\u2019s many dialects. Its speakers \noriginally occupied Tjupan lands, and shared a language and culture with their Western Desert neighbours.  The \nviews of Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett on Mr Liberman\u2019s work and the identification by some claimant witnesses in this \nproceeding as Tjupan are consistent with the basic thesis underlying the applicant\u2019s contentions in this proceeding: \nnamely, that there was a movement of Western Desert people into the claim area from areas to the east, including \nthe areas that Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett appear to agree were the areas the Tjupan and Kuwarra had previously \noccupied. The experts\u2019 positions remain as they otherwise were in this proceeding: namely, that Dr Brunton is of the \nview that notwithstanding the more recent presence of Western Desert people in the claim area (including those \nwho identify as Tjupan and did so to Mr Liberman in the 1970s), at sovereignty the people who occupied the claim \narea were not Western Desert people and did not have connections with the country of the claim area according \nto Western Desert laws and customs. Dr Sackett remains of the view the original occupants did have such \nconnections.  In my opinion, the evidence from the claimant witnesses about their and their ancestors\u2019 identification \nas Tjupan, and the use of Tjupan as a way of speaking, together with the opinions of Mr Liberman and Dr Sackett, \nconfirm the view I have formed that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors were, as Western Desert people, moving \n\n\n\nwithin Western Desert country when they moved into the claim area. It also confirms my view they were doing so in \naccordance with the traditional laws and customs of Western Desert people, including in accordance with the \nrecognition of such of the older Western Desert occupants of the claim area as remained when the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors came into the country.  I take the same approach, and reach the same conclusions, to the \nevidence relating to claimant witnesses, and evidence about their ancestors, identifying as Koara or Kuwarra. The \napical ancestors who were identified in this way include Mr Charlie Beaman and Mr Scotty Lewis. The claimant \nwitnesses who identified in this way include Mr Bingham, Mr Lewis and Ms Geraldine Hogarth. There were some \nclaimant witnesses who appeared to see the label \u201cTjupan\u201d as now a label identifying language rather than anything \nelse. This was Mr Leroy Beaman\u2019s evidence:I speak a few languages. I speak my mother\u2019s language, Yamatji-\nWajarri, and I speak my grandmother\u2019s language, Ngaanyatjarra. That\u2019s because she grew me up and around her \nwe were talking her language.\n\n I understand the Tjupan language around here, it\u2019s similar to Ngaanyatjarra. Things are the same. The Tjupan \nlanguage is the language for this claim. Auntie Maxine speaks Tjupan and a few other families from that area speak \nit too. Like the Narriers, they speak that. I speak a little bit of it, but not too much, it\u2019s a bit of a tricky language \nbecause they got their own language there. Ngalia and Tjupan, they got the same tongue. They different names for \nit but they the same, all one, but they just different group names.\n\n My mum\u2019s language is different again, a long way different.  As for the label \u201cNgalia\u201d, the witness who used that as \na way of identifying himself in this proceeding was Mr Muir. Dr Sackett did not have the same kind of opinion about \nthe use of this label. He notes in his Tjiwarl Registration Report that this label or way of identifying was used by Mr \nMuir\u2019s mother Ms Dolly Walker, who is one of the apical ancestors in this claim, but who had also been a claim \ngroup member on a native title application called Ngalia, which overlapped almost entirely with the Birriliburu \napplication. Indeed, on the evidence before me, there were several claims which were either dismissed or \ndiscontinued which used the word \u201cNgalia\u201d in the title of the claim.  Dr Sackett was of the view that although some \nreferences to Ngalia could be found in ethnographic literature (such as that by Mr Tindale), it was \u201cquestionable\u201d \nwhether the Ngalia reported in such research (or their descendants) would have had any traditional rights and \ninterests in lands in the Birriliburu claim area or in the Tjiwarl claim area. Dr Sackett noted the evidence given by Ms \nWalker\u2019s older brother in the Wongatha proceeding, which also suggested he did not identify as Ngalia, nor \nassociate this label with his ancestors. Dr Sackett states:Patjata/Paddy made a couple of remarks apropos of the \nidea of Ngalia identity. Asked what \u201ctribe\u201d his mother was a member of, he said \u201cMantjintjarra Ngalia\u201d. Asked what \nlanguage his mother spoke, Patjata/Paddy answered \u201cMantjintjarra\u201d. Asked if he knew of \u201cany other tribal name\u201d \nshe called herself, he replied \u201cNo\u201d. Then, asked how many languages he spoke, Paddy said \u201cMardu Ngalia\u201d.\n\n (References omitted.)  Dr Sackett concludes that Ngalia is a label which has emerged in the Walker-Muir family as \na self-identifier, but without any support as a group identifier on any wider basis. I accept Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion on \nthis, although, as he goes on to note, the label is not really the central issue. To the extent it is important to confirm \nwhich identifiers are common to members of the claim group, while I accept that Tjupan and Koara are common to \nsome family groups within the claim group and are consistent with the ethnographic and anthropological evidence \nbefore me, Ngalia does not fall into this category. That said, it seems to me that the final point made by Dr Sackett \non this issue is the more important one:In my view, what is crucial here is not what, if anything, Ngalia might be, but \nthe fact that the few Walker-Muir family members who self-identify as Ngalia associate the name with country that \nis clearly in the Western Desert/Western Desert society. That is, they are, however they self-identify, part of the \nWestern Desert society.  That proposition is not really contested by the State. What is contested is the connection \nwhich is then drawn to association with the claim area by reason of traditional Western Desert laws and customs, at \nsovereignty, and thereafter.\n\nThe use of Daisy Bates\u2019 material and the \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d    This became a critical question in the assessment of the \ncompeting contentions on connection, and the weight to be given to large parts of the evidence on connection.  In \nsummary, I accept the applicant\u2019s submission that caution should be exercised in the treatment of Ms Bates\u2019 \n\n\n\nmaterial, including her material about the people she called the Ngaiawonga. In particular, I accept the applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions that positive conclusions should not be drawn from the absence of information in Ms Bates\u2019 material, \nand that the reliability and weight to be given to her material (and the experts\u2019 use of her material) should be \napproached on a case by case basis.  That said, it is correct that Ms Bates was an eyewitness to certain events she \nrecorded, although she did not venture into the claim area itself. As an eye witness, her notes do provide \ncontemporary accounts (at least as at 1910 or 1920) of what those she spoke to said to her. There is no basis to \nbelieve she did anything other than try and faithfully record what she was told, indeed both Dr Sackett and Dr \nBrunton accept she was careful and methodical. The real issue is the reliability, breadth and representativeness of \nher source material, and the fact we cannot know the accuracy of its relationship to the people who were occupying \nthe claim area at sovereignty. Nor can we know what questions Ms Bates asked, how knowledgeable her \ninformants were, and how much of what she was told she actually recorded, how much she correctly understood, \nwhat the level of interpreting was like, if there was interpreting, and so forth.  In those circumstances, I accept that \nMs Bates\u2019 notes have some probative value where they reflect what she recorded she was told. In that sense, her \nword lists have an acceptable level of probative value. That is not because I accept they should be treated as \ncomplete or exhaustive, but because we can be reasonably confident she was careful and methodical in writing \ndown what she was told, without any determination being made about whether what she was told was all, a large or \na small part of people\u2019s language range. To that extent, I accept her word lists are a sufficiently reliable source for \nDr Clendon\u2019s opinions, at least in terms of what they positively record. It is, as I explain elsewhere, not possible to \ndraw inferences from what they do not record.  I turn now to explain in more detail why I have reached those \nconclusions.\n\nDaisy Bates\u2019 experience and travels in Western Australia  In his report, Dr Brunton sets out in some detail the \nbackground of Ms Bates, and I base my findings on his material, supplemented where necessary by what is \ncontained in Dr Sackett\u2019s report. I have also consulted the full version of the anthropologist Dr Isobel White\u2019s book \non Ms Bates\u2019 work entitled The Native Title Tribes of Western Australia (National Library of Australia, 1985), a \nsubstantial extract of which was in evidence before me. Both experts agreed Dr White\u2019s edited work of Ms Bates\u2019 \njournals is the authoritative source for a description of Ms Bates\u2019 work. Dr Brunton described Dr White as \u201can \naccomplished anthropologist and specialist on Aboriginal culture who became intimately familiar with Ms Bates\u2019 \nvoluminous manuscripts in the process of editing them for publication\u201d. I see no difficulty in circumstances where \nboth experts agree about the qualifications and quality of Dr White\u2019s work in my referring to the entire book. In \nparticular, I have drawn on the \u201cIntroduction\u201d in Dr White\u2019s book for what I set out below about Ms Bates\u2019 \nbackground and attitudes. I have been unable to locate any similar details about Ms Bates in previous native title \ndecisions.  Ms Bates was born in October 1859 in County Tipperary, Ireland. She was born Daisy Mary O\u2019Dwyer, \nand was orphaned by the time she was in her teens. She studied French and German, having as White observes a \n\u201cfacility for learning languages\u201d which would be useful in her work in Western Australia. She obtained a free \npassage to Australia and arrived in Townsville in January 1883, aged 24. Dr White observes that \u201cwe have no \nrecord of how she spent the rest of 1883\u201d, but in early 1884 she began working as a governess on various pastoral \nstations in Queensland, and then on a property south of Sydney. It appears that she married in Charters Towers in \nQueensland in March 1884, but this marriage was kept secret (and her then husband turned out to be the infamous \n\u201cBreaker Morant\u201d). Dr White explains how strong the evidence is, nevertheless, that the marriage occurred. Despite \nthis marriage, she got married again in February 1885, in Nowra New South Wales, to John Bates, the son of a \ndrover. A year later she gave birth to a son. She parted company with Mr Bates soon after and travelled alone with \nher child to various parts of Australia. In 1894, when the child was around seven, Ms Bates left him in the care of \nthe Bates family and went to England to pursue a career in journalism. She returned to Australia in 1899, and Dr \nWhite records that she arrived in Perth with the intention of investigating allegations (made in, amongst other \nplaces, The Times in London) that the settlers were ill-treating Aboriginal people. She reunited with her husband at \nthis stage and the two journeyed north from Perth searching for a property. It is unclear whether her son went with \nthem. She also befriended people such as Bishop Matthew Gibney, the Catholic Bishop of Western Australia, and \nspent time at places such as the Beagle Bay Trappist Mission on the western side of the Dampier Peninsula, in the \nfar north of Western Australia. She spent time droving with her husband until they finally parted company and she \nreturned to Perth and to her work as a journalist.  It was in this capacity, in May 1904, that Ms Bates wrote a piece \nfor The Times rejecting criticism that Aboriginal people on pastoral stations in Western Australia were worse off \nthan American \u201cnegro slaves\u201d. Dr White reports that Ms Bates had previously disagreed with Bishop Gibney\u2019s \n\n\n\ncriticism of the chaining of Aboriginal prisoners. Ms Bates claimed they \u201cpreferred\u201d to be chained by the neck as this \nleft their hands free. She wrote, and Dr White states that Ms Bates apparently believed, \u201c[n]o State in the \nCommonwealth is doing more for its aboriginal population than this State\u201d. I note these matters because May 1904 \nwas when Ms Bates commenced her work for the Western Australian government that was to form the material \nrelied on by the parties, and especially by the respondents, in this proceeding.  Dr White records that, in May 1904, \nMs Bates became an employee of the Western Australian government in the Department of the Registrar General. \nHer task was to collect and write a compilation of the languages of the Aboriginal people of the State. What it was in \nher background and experience that was thought to qualify her for such a task remains a mystery. Once she had \nbegun this work, Dr White reports that Ms Bates read whatever books she could find on anthropology, and collated \nthe work of previous investigators, looking also at the main publications about Aboriginal people which existed in \nother States. In her book, Dr White reports on Ms Bates\u2019 investigations on this project between 1904 and 1910 in \nthe following way.  After a year in Perth working in a government office, Ms Bates set up a tent with some Aboriginal \npeople on an Aboriginal \u201creserve\u201d about 10 km from the centre of Perth. She then visited various \u201creserves\u201d in the \nsouth-west of Western Australia, in particular a \u201creserve\u201d north of Albany. In 1907 and 1908 she travelled to \nEsperance and, Dr White states, \u201cas far north as the Goldfields, everywhere meeting Aborigines and collecting \ninformation from them\u201d. In 1909 and 1910, she was back in an office in Perth sorting and writing up her material, \nwriting journal papers, newspaper articles and giving speeches. In 1910, she was given permission to go on an \nexpedition with Professor Radcliffe-Brown. Dr White describes the difficulties of Ms Bates\u2019 working relationship with \nProfessor Radcliffe-Brown, and describes how Professor Radcliffe-Brown \u201cabandoned\u201d Ms Bates at Sandstone, a \ntown not far to the west of the southern part of the claim area. The rest of the expedition then proceeded to the \n\u201clock hospital\u201d at Bernier Island. This \u201clock hospital\u201d was a place to which Aboriginal men with venereal disease \nwere forcibly removed and imprisoned.  Ms Bates\u2019 main involvement with Aboriginal people in Western Australia \nappears to have started in May 1904, when she was commissioned by the Western Australian government to \nprepare a publication on the Aboriginal languages of the State. Dr Brunton described, by reference to other \nsecondary sources, that Ms Bates\u2019 brief was later expanded to cover social and cultural information as well. Ms \nBates was not trained in anthropology or any other related discipline.  Ms Bates did join the expedition at Bernier \nIsland, although Dr White records that Ms Bates \u201cstayed mostly at the adjoining island, Dorr233;, where there was a \nsimilar institution for women\u201d. From these islands, Dr White records Ms Bates as moving to work in the Peak Hill \narea, which was a Goldfields area in the Murchison region, about 120 km north of Meekatharra. It seems that after \nthis time in Peak Hill, Ms Bates spent time writing up the information she had collected, and when Professor \nRadcliffe-Brown returned to England in 1912, Dr White reports that he took \u201csome or all of the manuscript of the \nbook with him\u201d. As Dr White describes in some detail, the Western Australian government then refused to publish it \nbecause of the expense and the manuscript remained unpublished until Dr White took the project up in the 1980s. \nDr White reports that Ms Bates subsequently lived on Rottnest Island for a time, interviewing Aboriginal prisoners \nthere, as well as spending time in the south of Western Australia at Eucla.  Ms Bates ended her days at Ooldea in \nSouth Australia. In another text (White I, \u201cDaisy Bates \u2013 Legend and Reality\u201d in Marcus J (ed), First in their Field: \nWomen and Australian Anthropology (Melbourne University Press, 1993)), Dr White describes Ms Bates\u2019 time at \nOoldea, and some of the attitudes towards Aboriginal people that Bates expressed during that period, including in \npublished newspaper articles:She always regarded miscegenation as unspeakably horrible and believed, as did \nmany of her contemporaries, that \u2018half-castes\u2019 shared the bad traits of both races and the good traits of neither. She \nwas not afraid to say so, providing a reason for the dislike and disdain she inspired in those Aborigines who were \nforming political organisations in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n ...\n\n Though she learnt some of the languages spoken at Ooldea and wrote down long vocabularies, her other findings \nlack the quality of her work among the Western Australian Aborigines, and do not, in my opinion, enhance her \nreputation. She became more and more deluded in certain respects. Examples are her absolute conviction that the \nAborigines of the Western Desert habitually killed their fellows in order to eat them and that a pregnant woman \nlooked forward to the end of her pregnancy so that she could eat the baby. She even wrote about these so-called \ndiscoveries in the major newspapers, so it is no wonder that her reputation went down with the academic \ncommunity and among those who were trying to help the Aboriginal cause.  I note that Dr White herself travelled to \n\n\n\nOoldea to interview some older Aboriginal people who had known Ms Bates when she lived there. The following \nobservation from Dr White is, in my opinion, telling:I found it rather sad that they did not remember her with the \nrespect and admiration that her dedication to them and their parents and grandparents would seem to warrant, but \nremembered rather the curious figure she cut with her old-fashioned clothes and her parasol.  Of course, this \nobservation may also reveal something of Dr White\u2019s own attitudes to Aboriginal people, but it is a reminder that \nlooking at Ms Bates\u2019 work from a European perspective may provide much less than the full story of how she was \nregarded by Aboriginal people, and what information they were prepared to share with her.  Dr Brunton\u2019s report \nmade the following additional points about Ms Bates\u2019 experience. He notes, as Dr White does, Ms Bates\u2019 work and \ntravels with Professor Radcliffe-Brown. He notes also that while working as journalist for The Western Mail, Ms \nBates visited the Murchison region in December 1903, reporting on the mining industry there.  Dr Brunton notes this \nvisit seems to have lasted for a few weeks and, according to her biographer Ms Elizabeth Salter, during this time \nMs Bates \u201cmade the most of the opportunity to study the Aborigines of the district\u201d.\n\nEvaluation of Daisy Bates\u2019 material  It is fair to say Ms Bates\u2019 attitude towards Aboriginal people had positive and \nnegative aspects and it is not possible, from this historical distance, to be clear about how her attitudes influenced \nher work. The work she did which is relevant to this proceeding arises from some short-term visits by Ms Bates to \nan area not far from the claim area, for other purposes. During these visits, Ms Bates pursued, at some unspecified \ntimes, her interests in Aboriginal people. Dr Brunton\u2019s conclusion drawn from the list of Ms Bates\u2019 visits to the \nMurchison region, Peak Hill, Sandstone, the lock hospitals and Rottnest Island is that \u201cwhile the time she spent on \nher investigations in the region was comparatively short by contemporary anthropological standards, it was \nnevertheless substantial, particularly for its time\u201d. Whether or not, measured against time spent with Aboriginal \npeople by other Europeans in the early twentieth century, the time Ms Bates spent in the area should be considered \n\u201csubstantial\u201d is not a matter that assists the assessment of the reliability of her material in this proceeding.  Dr \nBrunton places some reliance in his account of Ms Bates\u2019 work on Dr White\u2019s observation that Ms Bates\u2019 methods \nwere \u201cnot common in anthropological research for many years to come\u201d, because they involved \u201cgoing to live with \nthe people themselves, setting up her tent amidst their huts and makeshift shelters, sitting on the ground and \nsharing her food with them, observing their behaviour and listening to their accounts\u201d. However, this appears to be \na reference by Dr White to what Ms Bates did in her time in Perth on the \u201creserve\u201d. This was not, at least on Dr \nWhite\u2019s account, the manner in which Ms Bates gathered the information used by Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett in this \nproceeding.  Dr Brunton refers to Dr White\u2019s opinion that many people \u201cwho were regarded as anthropologists at \nthe beginning of the century would not qualify today, first because they had the wrong ideas, second because as \nfieldworkers they did not ask the right questions, and third because their fieldwork was not up to today\u2019s rigorous \nstandards\u201d. Dr Brunton then refers to Dr White\u2019s conclusion on Ms Bates\u2019 work, measured against those criteria, \nwhich is that although Ms Bates \u2013 together with her contemporaries \u2013 would not qualify in terms of current \nstandards by the first or second criteria, Ms Bates would pass muster on her fieldwork methods because she was \u201ca \nsplendid observer and an ever-patient listener\u201d. Dr Brunton then refers, with apparent approval, to Dr White\u2019s \nconcluding observations that:On the positive side are her genuine additions to knowledge about the Aborigines of \nthe west and her innovative methods of discovering knowledge. The reasons on the negative side are serious, but \nentirely due to her being a product of her own generation whose beliefs and values she shared. The balance is, in \nmy opinion, in her favour.  In my opinion, whether Ms Bates was a \u201csplendid\u201d observer or an \u201cever-patient listener\u201d \nis a conclusion which is difficult, if not impossible, to glean from her material, without a great deal more evidence \nand information about the circumstances in which she gathered her material. There are no independent and \ndetailed accounts in evidence about how she behaved with her Aboriginal informants. We do not know whether she \nrecorded all she was told, or was selective. As both experts conceded, we know nothing at all about her methods. \nWe simply have what we have. I am not prepared to accept Dr Brunton\u2019s characterisations of Ms Bates on these \nissues.  Having set out the amount of time Ms Bates spent in areas which could be broadly described as in the \nsame region as the claim area (matters of weeks only), it is as well to emphasise my own opinions on what Dr \nBrunton (himself, and relying on Dr White) has to say about the quality of Ms Bates\u2019 work. It cannot, in my opinion, \nbe measured against contemporary anthropological work. I take Dr Sackett\u2019s qualifications and experience as a \nrelevant comparison. This is not to ignore the qualifications and experience of Dr Brunton, but the relevant \ncomparison here is between the work done by Ms Bates, and the work done by a contemporary anthropologist who \nwas able to work closely with Aboriginal people for the purposes of understanding their accounts of laws and \ncustoms in the claim area. Dr Brunton, as he freely admitted, did not have this opportunity and worked entirely from \n\n\n\nsecondary sources.  Dr Sackett obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from (then) Fresno State College in \n1969, and was awarded Masters of Arts in Anthropology from the University of Oregon in 1971. He earned his \nDoctor of Philosophy in Anthropology from the University of Oregon in 1975, with his preliminary doctorate work \nfocussing on the ethnography of Aboriginal Australia. His PhD research included fieldwork undertaken in 1972 and \n1973 with Aboriginal people then living in and around Wiluna. Wiluna is just to the north of the claim area, and the \nconsent determination under the NT Act in relation to that area is the subject of [758] to [779] of these reasons. \nMany of the claim group members are also native title holders in the Wiluna determination. The country in the \nWiluna determination was recognised by this Court (and agreed by the State) to be Western Desert country. Dr \nSackett\u2019s PhD was supervised by (then) Dr Tonkinson and informally supervised by Professor Berndt, both of whom \nI refer to elsewhere in these reasons. Dr Sackett then spent 20 years teaching anthropology at the University of \nAdelaide, including teaching Aboriginal anthropology. He continued to do research in Aboriginal anthropology and \nreturned to Wiluna for the best part of a year at one stage during this time. From 1998 to the present time, Dr \nSackett has been involved in the provision of anthropological research and advice to various Aboriginal land \ncouncils, organisations and claim groups. He has been involved in eight Western Desert native title claims between \n1994 and 2013. From his PhD work in the Wiluna area, he came to know and was familiar with some of the apical \nancestors for the Tjiwarl claim group. He prepared a report in 2009 for the Wiluna claim. His research in the claim \narea began in January 2000 and continued through until 2006 under a brief from the then Goldfields Land Council. \nHe then worked, as I have noted, on the Wiluna claim in the late 2000s. His Tjiwarl Registration Report was \ncompleted in November 2011. It then appears from the evidence that Dr Sackett has been preparing reports and \ncontinuing his research into the claim group and their connections to country from about September 2013 to \nSeptember 2015 (when his final report in this proceeding was filed).  Taken overall, Dr Sackett has spent more than \n20 years working with Aboriginal people in and around this claim area (including in the Wiluna determination area), \nand with Western Desert people, spending very large amounts of time indeed with them, and getting to know them \nover several generations: their families, their laws and customs and the way they explain their connection to \ncountry. It was apparent to me during the on country hearings that Dr Sackett had a strong and respectful \nrelationship with members of the claim group and I have no reason to doubt, having seen his approach and his \nmanner of interacting with them, that he would have had the same kind of relationship with the apical ancestors of \nthe claim group with whom he worked in earlier times, especially (but not only) during his PhD research around \nWiluna.  While it might be correct to describe (as Dr White does, and Dr Brunton accepts) Ms Bates\u2019 work in the \nearly twentieth century as \u201cgenuine additions to knowledge about the Aborigines of the west and ... innovative \nmethods of discovering knowledge\u201d, it pales against the qualifications and experience, but more importantly the \ndepth and longevity of the work, of an anthropologist such as Dr Sackett with the Aboriginal people of these areas.  \nThus, while historians, and those who write about historical anthropology, may have genuine and valid cause to \nrefer positively to Ms Bates\u2019 fieldwork methods as ahead of her time, and admirable, when a Court determining \nnative title examines such material, it must do so, in my opinion, through the same prism as it deals with any other \nopinion evidence. Where suitably qualified and experienced experts who have been called to give expert evidence \nin the proceeding itself adopt the information, opinions, or conclusion of early ethnographers, anthropologists or \nnon-Aboriginal people visiting claim areas or regions near claim areas, that may lend additional reliability to those \nsource materials. However, ultimately it is a matter for the Court to determine the reliability, strengths, weaknesses, \nand relevance of all the material put forward to support or contradict factual propositions which form part of a party\u2019s \ncase or submissions.  I accept the applicant\u2019s submissions at [166]:While Bates undertook a detailed recording of \ngenealogical information and information about kinship, which did include some information about places to which \nher informants were associated, she did not conduct any systematic inquiry into the laws and customs under which \nNgaiawonga and other surrounding groups obtained rights to country. As Dr Sackett explained ... in the context of \ndiscussing Bates\u2019 genealogies and the differing views of the anthropologists based on them, Bates:\u201c...didn\u2019t provide \nus with the material that we might want. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got generation levels here. We don\u2019t have \nthem there.\u201d She didn\u2019t say, \u201cThis is the rule for taking country.\u201d Whether she provided us with some genealogies \nfrom which we might extract insights into that rule, but she doesn\u2019t head them by saying, \u201cWell, you could see here \nthat patriliny is at work,\u201d or you can see here that people are taking country through birth, through their mothers, \ntheir fathers, and so force [sic]. So I \u2013 so to \u2013 to come back to the answer, I \u2013 I suppose that we\u2019re looking at the \nsame body of material but coming to different conclusions because, I suppose, of the limits in the material and the \nlimits in itself and some of the ambiguity in the material.\u201d(Citations omitted.)  In my opinion, Dr Sackett\u2019s approach \nmore reasonably and realistically measures the limits of Ms Bates\u2019 material than that of Dr Brunton. Dr Brunton \n\n\n\ntends to take too literal an approach to Ms Bates\u2019 material, including drawing inferences from what is not there \nwithout, in my opinion, giving enough weight to the absence of any information about why Ms Bates wrote down \nwhat she did.\n\nMy approach to Daisy Bates\u2019 material  The approach I propose to take to Ms Bates\u2019 material is as follows:(a) Where \nher own notes are in evidence, either directly or indirectly through the reports of Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett, and \nwhere those notes record matters that she saw or heard, I broadly accept they are a reliable record of what she saw \nor heard.\n\n (b) There are, as both experts acknowledge (as does Dr White in her work) many inconsistencies in names and \nspellings, which means that a complex reconstruction process must often be undertaken to try and match the \npeople and places Ms Bates records with other information, whether contemporary or historical. Where such \nreconstruction has been undertaken by Dr Sackett or Dr Brunton (or both) then I will take that reconstruction into \naccount in reaching my own findings on particular factual issues, where required.\n\n (c) Ms Bates\u2019 records should, in my opinion, be taken for what they are, but should not be seen as purporting to \nsupply the universe of the relationship between Aboriginal people and areas of land in the early twentieth century in \nthe areas she visited. In other words, I decline to view them as anything like a complete picture. There is no \nevidence about what proportion the people she spoke to formed of their overall group or community, whether they \nwere representative or not, whether they were entitled or authorised to speak to Ms Bates on behalf of their group \nor community or not, whether they were in fact outliers from their group or community, who translated for Ms Bates \nand how expert they were, what questions she asked, what proportion of what she was told she wrote down, and \nwhat her methods were with the information she did choose to write down. Her short visits in and around the claim \narea cannot be seen as anything like a comprehensive \u201ctour\u201d through all parts of the region. Even if they were, the \nnature of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relationships in that time inevitably means there can be no confidence \nabout how much she really saw in each area, let alone how much she understood what she was seeing.\n\n (d) In evidence, both Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton agreed that there was nothing known of these matters.\n\n (e) Where Ms Bates\u2019 information is used, as it is by Dr Brunton, to draw out conclusions on which the Court is \nasked to rely, I decline to do so because I have no basis (and nor does Dr Brunton, in my opinion) for knowing how \ncomprehensive or reliable the sample provided by Ms Bates is. The overall population sizes of the groups where \nshe spoke to some individual members are not known. As I have noted, the representativeness of the individuals in \nterms of their relationship to other group members is not known. The reliability of what Ms Bates was told is not \nknown: that is, was the informant reliable? With current anthropological work with informants, the anthropologist \nmay express an opinion about the reliability of a particular informant or, at least, is available to be questioned about \nsuch issues. Even if one accepts (as Dr Sackett, Dr Brunton and Dr White all seem to) that Bates attempted to be \n\u201cmeticulous\u201d in what she wrote down from her informants, it is difficult to decide whether she was being meticulously \nwrong or meticulously right in what she was writing down.\n\n (f) It should not need to be said, but Ms Bates\u2019 work is not to be given any preference, or particular weight, \nbecause she was a European writing about Aboriginal people at a time when the voices of Aboriginal people \nthemselves were not permitted to be heard: see generally my comments in Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre Inc v \nSecretary, Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (No 2) [2016] FCA 168; 215 LGERA 1 \nat [225].  A telling exchange occurred during the concurrent session, while Dr Sackett was being cross-examined. I \nreproduce it to illustrate the point I consider important. It concerns the presence or absence in Ms Bates\u2019 records of \naccounts of the Tjukurrpa identified by the claim group members:[MR RANSON].... This is in response to Dr \nBrunson [sic] making the point that Daisy Bates, although she had recorded quite a number of dreaming stories \u2013 \nwe\u2019ve talked about some of those this morning \u2013 she hadn\u2019t recorded the ... story amongst the Ngarlawangga [sic] \ninformants that she met. And you say there\u2019s no reason to suspect, given that Liberman recorded it in the 70s and \n\n\n\nwas told it had been there for some time, there\u2019s no reason to think it wasn\u2019t there when Bates was recording. So \nyour premise there is that it was probably there but she just didn\u2019t record it?---Didn\u2019t record it.\n\n You would accept that it\u2019s equally possible on the evidence that she didn\u2019t record it because it wasn\u2019t there?---Well, \nshe didn\u2019t record it. That\u2019s ... it\u2019s like some of the other things we\u2019re facing with her data. They\u2019re - - -\n\n But it\u2019s possible?---It\u2019s possible, true.\n\n (Emphasis added.)  The point Dr Sackett was making, correctly in my view, is that there is no basis whatsoever for \nthe conclusion that Ms Bates\u2019 records are a complete account of all aspects of the lives, beliefs, practices, laws and \ncustoms of the people whose information she records. Rather, they say what they say \u2013 and even then, there are \nmany inconsistencies and difficulties in interpretation. Piecing together what Ms Bates has recorded requires, as in \nmy opinion Dr Sackett went on to make clear after the extract I have just quoted, checking her work for consistency \nwith other sources where there may have been more thorough, transparent and focussed recording of information \n(the example given by Dr Sackett was Mr Liberman\u2019s work in the 1970s).  A similar approach should be adopted to \nthe work of other early anthropologists and ethnographers. Their work was undertaken in a society where Aboriginal \npeople were treated wholly unequally: they were not entitled to vote or participate on an equal footing in Australian \ndemocracy at any level of government, they were susceptible to forcible removal from their places of residence, and \nthey were required to hold \u201cpasses\u201d to move about in certain regions. If they were part of the workforce at all, it was \nin subjugated positions working for non-Indigenous people and generally being paid little or no wages, and certainly \nnot being paid equal wages for equal work with non-Aboriginal people. These matters are now well recognised. \nAcknowledging those matters does not involve attributing any lack of good intentions to those researchers, or \ndiminishing their work to nothingness. However, nor should their work be elevated unduly because it is from an \nearlier time. The contemporaneity or historic nature of the material is not in and of itself an indicator of reliability, \naccuracy or completeness. In contrast, the way it might be used by experts who give evidence in the case, and \nassessed as reliable or accurate, may be a different matter.\n\nDaisy Bates\u2019 informants  Consistently with my observations to this point, there is very little information available \nabout Daisy Bates\u2019 informants.  In their respective reports, Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton referred to Jal (or Jaal) and \nJinguru, who were two of Ms Bates\u2019 Ngaiawonga informants. Ms Bates described Jal as \u201ca rather powerful Lake \nWay district native\u201d. Jinguru was from Yander, but was imprisoned on Rottnest Island. Dr Sackett recorded the \nfollowing account of Jinguru provided in Ms Bates\u2019 material:Bates ... related how her informant Jinguru had, along \nwith some other men, killed a man they held responsible for magically causing the death of his mother. As Jinguru \ntold her \u201cI was 12 months in jail for that\u201d. Following this, Jinguru killed two other men; his \u201cbrother died from the \nmobarn [magical practices] of these fellows and he had to revenge his brother\u2019s death\u201d...  In its written submissions, \nthe State contends that \u201cmost of Bates\u2019 informants were not residing in the Claimed Area by the time she spoke to \nthem\u201d. In their written submissions, the applicant contends that \u201c[e]ven where the informants are known, we have \nrelatively little information about them\u201d.  There was some opinion evidence that Jinguru was the same person as \n\u201cKoyl\u201d, an uncle of Scotty Tullock. Both Dr Sackett and Dr Clendon expressed an opinion in their oral evidence that \nKoyl (or Coyle) was another of Jinguru\u2019s names.  The conclusion that Koyl and Jinguru were the same person is of \nsignificance in determining how long the claim group members\u2019 ancestors have been in or around the claim area. \nGiven the opinions of Dr Clendon and Dr Sackett, I am prepared to find that Koyl and Jinguru were, on the balance \nof probabilities, the same person. Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion about how the claim group members\u2019 ancestors may have \nacquired knowledge through people such as Jinguru is important. So is the familial connection between Jinguru and \nthe Tullock family.\n\nThe use of \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d as a description of the people in the area at sovereignty  The significance of Ms Bates\u2019 \ndescription of people for whom she recorded genealogies and other details as Ngaiawonga people is at least \ntwofold. First, it is evidence capable of identifying the group of people said to be in occupation of the claim area at \nsovereignty and assisting to decide what happened to them and what, if any, relationship the claim group members \nhave to these people. Second, and on the assumption that the Ngaiawonga people were in occupation of the claim \narea at sovereignty, Ms Bates\u2019 material about them is part of the evidence on which the decision whether they were \n\n\n\nWestern Desert people rests.  What is meant by the use of that word \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d? This requires consideration, \nprimarily, of the evidence of Dr Clendon, together with the opinions of Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett.  Dr Clendon \nconfirmed, and both parties accept, that the literal translation of Ngaiawonga is \u201cI speak\u201d. Several claimant \nwitnesses also identified the term in this way. Ms Geraldine Hogarth understood it to mean \u201cmy talk\u201d or \u201cmy \nlanguage\u201d. Mr Victor Ashwin understood it to be translated as \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cspeak\u201d in a Western Desert language. Mr \nMuir understood it to translate as \u201cmy speech\u201d. It is also true that several witnesses whose evidence I considered \nthe most reliable (such as Ms Wonyabong and Mr Lewis) had never heard of the term. It appears neither had Mr \nPatterson, despite his status in the Wiluna claim area, which is geographically closer to where Ms Bates was \nworking.  Dr Sackett\u2019s Tjiwarl Registration Report describes how Ms Bates used the descriptor Ngaiawonga (my \nspelling). First, he notes in the fifth footnote that:Bates herself did not draw any \u2018tribal\u2019 maps for the area, halting \nwith rough verbal descriptions of the locations or directions of the tribes of the region. In fact, she appears to have \nbeen of the view that, at least in this area, \u201cdefinite [\u2018tribal\u2019] boundaries\u201d would have been difficult-to-impossible to \nmap.\n\n (Citation omitted.)  He then continues:Bates made a number of further points about the Ngaiuwonga and their \nneighbours. Of significance here, she noted that Ngaiuwonga country embraced not just the immediate \u201cLake Way \ndistrict\u201d, but lands to the north, and, as well, country south to \u201cMt. Sir Samuel, and Lawlers\u201d, ie Ngaiuwonga lands \nextended southwards to the southern portions of the lands of the Application area. (Bates sometimes referred to the \nWiluna to Lake Nabberu and Carnarvon Ranges Ngaiuwonga as the northern Ngaiuwonga, and to the Wiluna to Sir \nSamuel and Lawlers area Ngaiuwonga as the southern Ngaiuwonga.)\n\n In much the same way that Bates reported that the ngaiu of Ngaiuwonga meant \u201cI, me\u201d she noted the ngadha of \nNgadhawonga likewise meant \u201cI, me\u201d. While it is possible that this sort of dialect/language, and group, \ndistinguishing occurs in non-Western Desert areas, it certainly is common across the Western Desert, where dialect \nnames or labels commonly flag or point to instances of difference. (This probably is best known in the case of the \nPitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara, and vice versa. The Pitjantjatjara speak the Western Desert dialect which uses or \nhas [the -tjara suffix means \u2018has\u2019 or \u2018having\u2019] the word pitjantja [meaning \u2018to come\u2019 or \u2018to go\u2019]. The Yankunytjatjara \n[who happen to be neighbours of the Pitjantjatjara] speak the Western Desert dialect which uses or has the word \nyankunytja [meaning \u2018to come\u2019 or \u2018to go\u2019].\n\n (Emphasis in original; citations omitted.)  In his report, Dr Brunton did not disagree with this analysis, but added \nthat Ms Bates also spoke of local groups associated with particular areas, indicating their names came from the \ndialectical variations in the first person pronoun. He continued:In one document she wrote of the Ngaiuwonga as \nlocated around Balju Springs near Mount Alice, the Ngaiawonga around Yarnder (or Yander, Yarnderi), Wiluna and \ntowards Lawlers, and the Ngai-yuwonga between Yarnder and Lawlers (which is just to the south of the claim area). \nInsofar as these \u2018tribelets\u2019 seem to have had different rules about the intermarriage of sections or skins, and even \ndifferences in one of the section names, distinguishing between them seems justified ... But the different labels for \nthe groups are not applied consistently in her manuscript.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  I make some findings at [326]-[334] concerning where \u201cYander\u201d is likely to be located, because \nit is of some significance in the fact-finding about not only who lived in the claim area at sovereignty, but about \nwhere people came from who moved into the area.  Despite his qualifications, Dr Brunton himself was content in his \nreport to speak of the \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d as a single group of people: see for example where Dr Brunton referred to the \nNgaiawonga identity at [126], [128], [130], [132], [142], [144], [146], [166] and [170].  However, both Dr Sackett and \nDr Brunton agreed that \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d was a dialect label and not a land owning group. I understood their evidence \non this to mean that they accept that the way the people to whom Ms Bates spoke identified themselves to her was \nthrough the language they spoke. Their agreement on this issue is significant, as is the development of this issue by \nDr Clendon.  Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence, which I accept, was that Western Desert language has a spread of regional \nvarieties or dialects and all native speakers can communicate with and understand each other, although the more \ngeographical separation there is between dialects and varieties, the more difficult this might be. His evidence also \n\n\n\nwas that to the west of the claim area, Western Desert language \u201cgives way\u201d to non-Western Desert languages in \nthe Kartu family, relevantly the Badimaya and Wajarri languages. His evidence was based on the word lists \ncollected by Ms Bates from her informants Jaal and Jinguru, and four informants from Lawlers. In cross-\nexamination, he explained this as follows:MR RANSON: ...So, back to the Lawlers list, now, Lawlers is or was a \nhistoric mining town and it was quite prosperous and large, I think, at the time of \u2013 at Bates\u2019 time?That\u2019s my \nunderstanding, yes.\n\n Yes. And that word list was compiled from four different individuals that she named?Yes.\n\n Do we know anything about those individuals, who they were or where they were from?I don\u2019t know anything about \nthem, no.\n\n And Bates doesn\u2019t provide any detail about that other than ?Not that I could see from her document.\n\n And there\u2019s no explanation as to how those individuals came to be in Lawlers at the time that she recorded the \nmaterial?Not \u2013 not \u2013 not to my understanding.\n\n So, while you might be able to attach the words in that list to those four individuals, it\u2019s not necessarily the case, is \nit, that you can attach them to a particular point on the map in that sense, can you?Well, except that she does say \nthey are of Lawlers, and from my reading of her work she was fairly meticulous, because the point of this \u2013 the point \nof all these exercises was to document language where \u2013 in \u2013 in its geography, where language occurred, and it \nseems to me highly likely that she would have sought reassurances from them that they were actually from the \nLawlers or \u2013 Lawlers, or from that area.\n\n Okay?Because that was the purpose of these word lists, was to show how language varied and altered across a \nlandscape.\n\n ...\n\n You said there [referring to Mr Clendon\u2019s first report]:Four people contributed to the Lawlers word list. It may be \nthat we are seeing here two or more different languages from different regions of Western Australia.So it seems to \nme you were leaving open that possibility, there, that these individuals may have come from different places, in \nfact?Certainly. It\u2019s a possibility.\n\n Yes?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strong possibility; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a probability, but it must be a possibility.\n\n If that isn\u2019t the case, if they were \u2013 let\u2019s assume, for argument\u2019s sake they were all locals to Lawlers, how would \nyou account for the two or more different languages in that circumstance?Because they were offering words that \nwere shared between Wadjari, Badimaya and the Western Desert language in that area. It was an area where, \nalmost certainly, Badimaya and Wadjari were spoken, as well as the Western Desert language. Leonie Dunn and, I \nthink it was, James Bednell locate Badimaya country directly to the south-west of the Tjiwarl claim area. It would \nbe extremely likely that, as I was talking about before, that people in there were multilingual.\n\n You mention that \u2013 use that expression that Bates \u201cwas offered\u201d two or three different languages?Yes.\n\n From my layperson\u2019s look at the words lists, there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s not really an explanation from Bates in there as to \nprecisely what the exercise was, is there? She\u2019s not \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really explain exactly what questions she was \n\n\n\nasking, so how do you come to that interpretation that she was being offered alternatives, as opposed to ?Well, she \nhad a word list \u2013 well, she had a \u2013 she had, I guess, a pro forma, and these questions, like, \u201cKangaroo\u201d, \u201cWhere \nshall I find water?\u201d, whereas these questions recur in each of her word lists that I\u2019ve looked at in this area.\n\n Yes?And I would imagine a situation where there\u2019s four men sitting with her, and one of them offers a response in \na Western Desert language, another one offers a response in, perhaps, Badimaya, or, perhaps, the same man \noffers her \u2013 gives her three different alternatives.\n\n Okay. So she, in your mind, was actually engaged in a slightly comparative exercise in that sense?Well, no, she \nwould not have known that they were different languages.\n\n Okay?I mean, she was not a linguist. She appeared \u2013 everything I can see \u2013 especially, the fact that she wasn\u2019t \ndistinguishing between languages \u2013 she did not know that she was being offered two or three different languages.\n\n But in your opinion, that\u2019s what was happening?Yes.\n\n Yes. Okay. I understand that. Now, if I can take you, Dr Clendon, to your supplementary report, just dealing, still, \nwith this Lawlers word list, and to paragraph 5 on page 4 of that report?Yes.\n\n And that\u2019s your conclusion about that list, effectively, or a description of that list, and you say it shows a large \nportion of the language in there is Western Desert language, a portion of it is Wadjari, and the third portion is a \nlanguage or languages, the identity of which have been uncertain. But I think, as you\u2019ve said to us this morning, \nand, perhaps it\u2019s already indicated in the report \u2013 I must say I\u2019ve taken it from the report already \u2013 you seem \u2013 your \nbest guess is that that was Badimaya Well, I know \n\n based on that ?----I know a lot of it is Badimaya, yes.\n\n Yes. And that was information you didn\u2019t have at the time of your first report?---That\u2019s correct.\n\n ...\n\n Now, that Badimaya dictionary is a relatively recent publication?---Yes.\n\n And, without wishing to be unfair to anyone, it\u2019s a fairly sparse dictionary. It\u2019s not as detailed, for example, as the \nWadjari one. Is that fair characterisation?No, it\u2019s not as detailed as the Wadjari one and it\u2019s nowhere near as \ndetailed as the Ngadjunmaya.\n\n Yes. And you make an interesting comment at paragraph 6 after \u2013 just after where we were, which seems to me to \nsuggest that, perhaps, if we had a more comprehensive Badimaya source, it might be that even a higher proportion \nof the words in the Lawlers word list might---?---That\u2019s absolutely possible, yes.  Despite the State\u2019s submissions to \nthe contrary, in my opinion Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence was clear that, in his opinion, the self-description recorded by Ms \nBates indicated her informants\u2019 principal language was a Western Desert language, accepting (as he did) that some \nof the informants were clearly multilingual, including in non-Western Desert languages or dialects.  I deal with Dr \nClendon\u2019s evidence in more detail at [711]-[756], where I find that his opinions and conclusion provide support for \nthe proposition that the people who occupied the claim area at sovereignty were Western Desert people. For the \nmoment, the relevance of his opinions is to confirm that Ms Bates\u2019 use of the term \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d appears to have \nstemmed from no more than the self-identification given by Jaal and Jinguru (and possibly others) about what they \n\n\n\nconsidered to be their principal language.  Thus, \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d appears to have been a self-description used by Ms \nBates\u2019 informants, but as a way of identifying the principal language they spoke, perhaps without intending (or \nknowing) that Ms Bates would adopt it as a nomenclature for the people they had described themselves as part of. \nWhat is most significant is that their principal self-identification was with a Western Desert language. It does not \nhave any further significance than that. I accept Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion that at sovereignty there were two regional \ndialects spoken by those Aboriginal people who occupied the claim area \u2013 Tjuparn (or Tjupan, Tjupany, or Djubun) \nand Mantjintja \u2013 both of which formed part of the Western Desert Language. I find that Ms Bates\u2019 use of the label \n\u201cNgaiawonga\u201d was a label she derived from words spoken to her by her informants, as a way of identifying \nthemselves by reference to their language. She came to use it, as Dr Clendon identifies in his report, in a mistaken \nway, but it is nevertheless a label which has \u201cstuck\u201d and which the parties and experts in this proceeding have been \ncontent to use. It should be given no higher status than that.\n\nWhat area did the Ngaiawonga occupy?  Ultimately, both Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton agreed that Ms Bates\u2019 material \nindicated the people she described as \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d occupied the whole of the claim area as their traditional \ncountry. Dr Brunton said, in his first report at [512]-[514]:As noted in the previous chapter, Bates\u2019 account of the \nplaces at which the Ngaiuwonga were to be found does appear to encompass the whole of the claim area. She \nspecifically stated that the people she identified as \u2018south Ngaiuwonga\u2019 had their burna \u2013 which she translated as \n\u2018home\u2019, and elsewhere as \u2018group area\u2019, and which Kingsford said can mean \u2018estate\u2019, \u2018home country\u2019, \u2018language \nterritory\u2019, etc \u2013 included \u2018Wiluna, Lake Way, Mt Sir Samuel and Lawlers\u2019. This would indicate that she saw these \nplaces as comprising the country with which the south Ngaiuwonga were traditionally identified, and in which they \nwould have what are now seen as native title rights. While this includes only the eastern third of the claim area, two \nother kinds of statements can be cited to show that the Ngaiuwonga\u2019s country extended over more of the claim \narea.\n\n The first are references to the \u2018runs\u2019 or associated sites of individuals who were identified as Ngaiuwonga \u2013 Lungu \nand Wilamada \u2013 being in the Barrambie and Sandstone districts, to the west of the claim area. As both of these \nmen were deceased and in the first or second generation above Bates\u2019 informants for the genealogies on which \nthey appeared, it seems reasonable to assume that the links to these sites predated European settlement. The \ngenealogy on which Lungu appeared was headed \u2018Ngaiuwonga south\u2019. Bates also identified Mt Townsend, in the \nnorth west of the claim area, with Peter Yandarga, who was said to be both Ngadawonga and Ngaiuwonga, \nalthough he was of a younger generation and one of Bates\u2019 informants.\n\n The second kind are statements about the supposed Ngaiuwonga local group, the \u2018Ngaiyu\u2019, in the Boolygoo Range \narea, which is in the south west of the claim area, and at Mt Holmes, outside the southern boundary. (However, as \nnoted in paras 43-44 for example, there are problems about the consistency with which \u2018Ngai-yu\u2019 or \u2018Ngaiyu\u2019 was \napplied). As already stated in para 74, and as will be readily apparent from Maps 9 and 10, Bates also located \nNgaiuwonga far to the south and south-east of the claim area, usually camped with members of other tribes, \nalthough in my opinion, some of these locations, such as those around Leonora and Laverton, reflect post-\nEuropean, and possibly temporary movements.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  When one takes all the geographic references in these passages, it is clear that all parts of the \nclaim area are included. Lawlers is just to the south of the claim area. Booylgoo Range is in the south-western part \nof the claim area. Mount Townsend is in the north-west corner of the claim area. Sandstone is not far outside the \nsouth-western boundary of the claim area. Wiluna is to the north of the middle of the claim area. Lake Way is right \non the northern boundary of the claim area, to the east of Wiluna.  Dr Brunton made what was no more than a \npassing suggestion that the southernmost parts of the claim area may have been occupied at sovereignty by \nBadimia people. However as the applicant submits, no Badimia people came forward to make a claim over any part \nof the area, despite a recent claim to areas to the west. The better view is that the whole of the claim area was \noccupied at sovereignty by a group of people whose own descriptions of themselves may never be fully \nascertained, but who Ms Bates called Ngaiawonga.\n\n\n\nDr Brunton\u2019s analysis of Ngaiawonga marriage patterns  Dr Brunton conducted a detailed analysis of marriage \npatterns based on Ms Bates\u2019 genealogies and the identification of places referred to in her notes. He concluded that \n\u201cby far the heaviest concentration of marriages [of Ngaiawonga to non-Ngaiawonga people] ... lie in an arc from the \nnorth to the west, with an additional marriage located in the south western quadrant.\u201d Dr Brunton concluded that this \npattern \u201cpresumably reflects a concomitant paucity of social interaction\u201d with people to the east, which he said is \nvery difficult to reconcile with the idea that the Ngaiawonga were Western Desert people. Had they been, Dr \nBrunton said he would have expected at least a more even distribution or, more probably, a skewing to the east. Dr \nBrunton considered the data he used was based on a representative sample of Ngaiawonga people.  In his further \nexpert report, Dr Sackett expressed doubts that Ms Bates\u2019 data was a representative sample of the people in the \nclaim area, pointing out that Ms Bates did not undertake fieldwork in the Yander area, but rather worked in the \nPeak Hill-Meekatharra and Sandstone areas, as well as Rottnest, Bernier and Dorr233; Islands. Sackett \ncommented that \u201chad Bates recorded information at Wiluna or Sir Samuel, the picture generated might have been \nvery different indeed.\u201d  Dr Sackett\u2019s view was that intermarriage between Ngaiawonga and non-Western Desert \ngroups to the west was not inconsistent with the Ngaiawonga being Western Desert people. He referred to data \nfrom other areas suggesting that, where Western Desert and non-Western Desert peoples elsewhere abut one \nanother, they interact and marry.  As the applicant submits, the ultimate issue is whether at sovereignty the \nNgaiawonga and people to the east constituted a single society and, even if Dr Brunton\u2019s analysis of Bates\u2019 data \ndoes reflect some preference amongst some Ngaiawonga located in the west of the claim area for marrying people \nfurther to the west over people further to the east, it does not follow that the Ngaiawonga and people to the east \nhad different laws and customs. I agree with the applicant\u2019s submissions. More importantly, for the reasons I have \noutlined, I do not consider it is possible to conclude that Ms Bates\u2019 data was representative. I do not consider her \nmaterials provide a reliable source for any overall conclusion about the marriage patterns of Aboriginal people \noccupying the claim area at sovereignty. They record what a small number of people told her. It was not even a \nremotely comprehensive study, it was conducted outside the claim area, and it had a focus on lands and people to \nthe west.  Finally, I accept Dr Sackett\u2019s view that there is no necessary inconsistency between the Ngaiawonga \nbeing Western Desert people and such marriage patterns as exist showing interactions and marriage with non-\nWestern Desert people. As Dr Clendon also noted, it was a feature of Western Desert societies that their mobility \nover large areas meant there could be much interaction with other societies.\n\nWhat happened to them?  The question of what happened to the Ngaiawonga is vexed.  In their statement of \nissues, facts and contentions, the applicant states:Nevertheless, the influx of non-Aboriginal people into the \nClaimed Area in the late 19th century and early 20th century:(a) materially affected the access by the Aboriginal \noccupants of the Claimed Area to traditional water and food sources;\n\n (b) resulted in the spread of diseases to the Aboriginal occupants of the Claimed Area; and\n\n (c) resulted in conflict between non-Aboriginal people and the Aboriginal occupants of the Claimed Area, and/or \nbetween Aboriginal people in occupation of the Claimed Area and other Aboriginal people.The matters referred to in \nparagraph 29 contributed to a situation where, by the early 20th century, those Aboriginal people who were in \noccupation of the Claimed Area at sovereignty, and the biological descendents of the Aboriginal people in \noccupation of the Claimed Area at sovereignty, died or moved away from the Claimed Area.  The State is correct to \npoint out that, initially, Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion was that:... evidence suggests there was something of a decimation of \nthe original population of the Tjiwarl area, through the consequences of introduced diseases, dispossession, \nviolence, forced (and possibly voluntary) removals.  Prior to this conclusion, Dr Sackett had discussed in more \ndetail the evidence for his conclusion. It seems apparent from his discussion that the effects of European diseases \nsuch measles and influenza were devastating. Venereal disease was also a noted problem, leading, as I have \nnoted above, to some Aboriginal people being removed in inhumane ways to \u201clock hospitals\u201d on the islands of \nBernier and Dorr233;. What proportion of the population was removed in this way is not revealed by the evidence. \nFor whatever combination of reasons, the original occupants were finding it hard to survive in the most basic of \nways. Dr Sackett extracts a report from the Chief Protector of Aborigines in 1902, which said the local \npeople:wander about in a starving condition from one mining centre to another; their own water-holes appropriated \nby the white race, the few animals completely destroyed, and therefore [they have] nothing but grasses and insects \n\n\n\n... to rely on.  Dr Sackett refers to the work of E Watson, in his 1968 autobiography (Watson E, Journey under the \nsouthern stars (Abelard-Schuman, 1968)) which provided, amongst other things, an account of the expedition of \nProfessor Radcliffe-Brown, accompanied by Ms Bates and Mr Watson, in the Murchison area in 1910. Dr Sackett \nquotes Mr Watson as saying that, although there was some intramural fighting:it was rather the diseases brought by \nthe white man. Whole countrysides were killed by measles and influenza ...\n\n (Citation omitted.)  An informant to another anthropologist, quoted by Dr Sackett, and who lived around Sandstone \nin the early part of the twentieth century was reported as saying that there were:\u201c[t]wo bouts of severe influenza \namong the Aborigines [which] decimated their numbers ... as they had no resistance to it.\u201d  Dr Sackett notes these \neffects were, in his opinion, occurring from, or even (in the case of disease) before, the settlement of this area by \nEuropeans, and the effects continued throughout the First World War. He also notes the evidence establishing, in \nhis opinion, how low the numbers of children were during the early part of the twentieth century in the area, \nalthough he observes that caution is needed in taking too literally contemporaneous observations on these issues, \nbecause many Aboriginal families were astute to conceal their children, lest they be removed by the authorities. Dr \nSackett continues:All the same, evidence from Bates suggests there were few(er) children to hide. In fact, Bates\u2019 \nPedigrees point to something of a fracture in the reproduction of the local population. Take, for example, those for \nJal, Jangari, Kaligurdaji, Ngaiajara, Wonga and Janjimara. These were people Bates identified as Ngaiuwonga, and \nassociated with country to the near north of the claim area.\n\n (a) Jal was shown with four wives, but only one child.\n\n (b) Neither Jangari, nor his sister, nor his three brothers, one of whom had three wives, were shown as having \nchildren.\n\n (c) Kaligurdaji, said to have been about 60, had a son and two daughters, none of whom themselves was shown \nwith children.\n\n (d) Ngaiajara, said to have been about 75, had two sons, neither of whom was shown with children.\n\n (e) Wonga, said to have been about 50 and twice married, was shown with no children.\n\n (f) Janjimara, said to have been about 60, was shown with no children.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  Dr Brunton substantially agreed with Dr Sackett\u2019s assessment of the decimation of the \npopulation in this period, describing it as a \u201cdemographic catastrophe\u201d.  From these propositions, the State submits \nthat the last Ngaiawonga people appear to have died, or moved out, in the immediate period after 1912.  I do not \naccept that a finding with that degree of certainty can be made on the evidence. Rather, the situation was more fluid \nand complex than the State submits.  Dr Sackett\u2019s initial conclusion was that he knew of no descendants of the \noriginal occupants. He did not revisit this conclusion in his supplementary report, or in oral evidence.  What I take \nDr Sackett to mean by his statement is that, in his considerable and long-ranging studies concerning the connection \nof contemporary Aboriginal family groups with country in and around the claim area, he has not come across any \npeople who claim to be descendants of the \u201coriginal occupants\u201d of the claim area. That is, no-one else is claiming \nrights and interests in this country under traditional laws and customs. I take him to be saying no more than that. \nAnd in my opinion, it would be difficult to put the statement in any more absolute terms. The evidence in this \nproceeding is replete with accounts of forced removals of Aboriginal adults and children from their country, of \nAboriginal people fleeing violence from and mistreatment by early European settlers, of Aboriginal people moving to \navoid starvation and the ever encroaching tide of gold prospectors, combined with the tremendous toll taken on \nAboriginal people from introduced disease and illness. There are, accordingly, any number of reasons why no other \n\n\n\ndescendants may be visible. That proposition does not deny, of itself, the connection of the claim group members \nthrough traditional laws and customs to the claim area.\n\nThe role of Tjukurrpa in the applicant\u2019s claim    The evidence \u2013 claimant and expert \u2013 about the Tjukurrpa is what \nprovides a frame of reference for my own navigation through the legal landscape of the applicant\u2019s claim and the \nState\u2019s fundamental criticisms of it.\n\nExplaining the Tjukurrpa  The Tjukurrpa is a central part of the world view of all the claimant witnesses. Translation \nof its meaning and significance into written non-Aboriginal language has its challenges. In the findings I make in the \nfollowing section, I rely to a significant extent on the evidence of Dr Sackett, whose opinions about the Tjukurrpa I \naccept.  Dr Brunton does not disagree to any real degree with how the Tjukurrpa might be described, nor about the \nrole it plays in Western Desert laws and customs. His point of disagreement concerns whether the members of the \nclaim group have \u201cimposed\u201d their own Tjukurrpa on the claim area with the consequence that they have a new and \npost-sovereignty relationship with the land, rather than a \u201ctraditional\u201d one for the purposes of the NT Act.  Dr \nSackett\u2019s description of the Tjukurrpa is:For Western Desert people, proof of the reality of the Tjukurrpa was/is seen \nin the way lives were/are led and experienced, and the landscape was/is organized and related. Put another way, \nas Western Desert people saw/see it (in what for Westerners would be circular logic), if it were not for the Dreaming \nand the Dreaming beings, things would not be the way they are.\n\n In my experience and opinion, Western Desert people, Tjiwarl Claimants amongst them, view the Tjukurrpa in a \ncouple of intertwined ways. At one level, it was the time when (1) the world was given shape and (2) a way of life for \nhumans to follow was laid down. Both acts were carried out by supernatural Beings who themselves are referred to \nas Tjukurrpa.  Many of the commentators, anthropologists and ethnographers to whom Dr Sackett refers in his \nsupplementary report use the description \u201creligious\u201d to describe the characteristics of the Tjukurrpa. There is, based \non the evidence I have heard, no doubt a spiritual dimension to the way the claim group members understand the \nTjukurrpa. The Tjukurrpa comes from mythical beings that shape and mould the landscape, but its nature and \nfunction is not limited to being a spiritual, religious or mythical account of the creation of the landscape and natural \nworld in which Aboriginal people live.  Rather it is also, as Phillip Toyne and Daniel Vachon described it, in a book \nto which Dr Sackett referred, the \u201crational and moral order to their existence\u201d: see Toyne P and Vachon D, Growing \nUp the Country: The Pitjantjatjara struggle for their land (McPhee Gribble Publishers/Penguin Books, 1984). Scott \nCane, also quoted by Dr Sackett, described it as \u201c\u2018the Law\u2019, to which they consider themselves beholden\u201d: Cane S, \nPila Nguru: The Spinifex People (Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 2002).  Thus combining many concepts in one word, \nthe Tjukurrpa is past and present, myth and reality, belief and law. It connotes beings who have always existed and \nstill occupy the landscape, and that continued presence is part of the reason that there is a body of rules of \nbehaviour which exists around sites and knowledge related to the Tjukurrpa. Transgressions have a real and \nimmediate effect. The Tjukurrpa is not consigned to history, but rather is a living guide for the lives of Aboriginal \npeople.  Tjukurrpa does contain, as Dr Sackett elucidated, something that to a non-Aboriginal person might seem \nlike circular logic. This extract of Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence from the concurrent evidence session makes the point \nwell:MR RANSON: It\u2019s on page 9. Dr Sackett, there you say:For Western Desert ... proof of the reality of the \nTjukurrpa was and is seen in the way lives were and are led and experienced and the landscape was and is \norganised and related. Put another way, as Western Desert people saw it or see it, in what, for Westerners, would \nbe circular logic, if it were not for the dreaming and the dreaming beings, things would not be the way they are.So \nwhat you\u2019re saying there is: Aboriginal people look at the landscape, they interpret it as having been created in the \ndreaming and then they use the way the landscape is as proof of the truth of the dreaming. Does that make sense?-\n--You\u2019re close. They\u2019re told about the significance of the landscape \u2013 what\u2019s in the landscape. They\u2019re taught it by \nelders, their parents or somebody else. So they\u2019re taken to and shown places and told about it. But the proof that \nthat happened is evident because it\u2019s there.\n\n Is that - - -?---To go back to the example of the hill, south of the Wiluna, the Lawrence Wells \u2013 those little ... beings \nwere frightened and ran and tried to get into their burrow and in so doing pushed up the hill as evidence that that \nhappened.  Some evidence given in the restricted session by Mr Victor Ashwin and Mr Allan Ashwin was also \npersuasive about the nature of Tjukurrpa. I set it out here because, although given in the restricted session, I do not \n\n\n\nconsider it touched on any restricted subject matter. The evidence was given in the context of questions about \nhanding over rights to country, a topic to which I return later in these reasons. However, it is the emphasised \npassage which is important to the present topic:MR RANSO[N]: Oh, okay. That was going to be my next little \nquestion was, that handing over, was that handing over the law, the men\u2019s law or was it handing over the country \nor was it both?\n\n VICTOR ASHWIN: Both. It comes hand in hand.\n\n MR RANSO[N]: Yes.\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Can\u2019t hand them - - -\n\n VICTOR ASHWIN: You can\u2019t have one or the other.\n\n MR RANSO[N]: Okay.\n\n VICTOR ASHWIN: You got to have the law and the country where the Tjukurrpa went through.\n\n MR RANSO[N]: So when that law gets handed over, the country comes with it maybe.\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Mmm.\n\n VICTOR ASHWIN: Can\u2019t \u2013 Tjukurrpa went through the country. Tjukurrpa \n\nis the country, that\u2019s what I\u2019m explaining to you.\n\n (Emphasis added.)  The claimant evidence demonstrates that the Tjukurrpa of the claim area links the land and \nwaters of the claim area with land and waters outside the claim area, especially (but not entirely) to the east, and a \nlong way across the Western Desert region. In linking the land and waters, it also links the people of the country of \nthe claim area with the people of country through which the Tjukurrpa travelled, and in which it existed, and exists. \nDr Sackett confirmed in his evidence that this was his understanding of the effect of the claimant evidence.  \nHowever, as Mr Victor Ashwin emphasised in the passage I have set out above, the linking occurs because \nTjukurrpa is the country.  Ms Wonyabong explained the linking or unifying nature of the Tjukurrpa \u2013 between \ncountry, and between people, in this way:People in Ranges [Warburton] and other parts of the desert, like north \naround Wiluna, know these stories as well. They know the story coming right from Alice Springs. The old people \nwould know the stories, because they learn it through the law. It is thetjukurrpa that makes it the same law.  As Dr \nSackett noted, the evidence of Aboriginal people outside the claim area also supported this understanding of the \nTjukurrpa. The evidence of Mr Patterson was:It\u2019s the same tjukurrpa in that Tjiwarl claim area as my country. My \ncountry is up north \u2013 but it change the language and so we leave it to that lot. It\u2019s the same tjukurrpa. But that\u2019s for \nthe mob who talk for the area to talk about. Different people have different responsibility for different parts of the \ntjukurrpa.  Mr Patterson is not a member of the claim group. He is a senior wati of the Gingirana native title claim \ngroup, as well as being a native title holder on the Birriliburu, Martu and Wiluna determinations. His evidence has \nparticular weight because, as a Western Desert man, speaking about his own country, he is very clear that the \nsame Tjukurrpa runs through the claim area. There is no sense from Mr Patterson\u2019s evidence that this is a recent \noccurrence, after the arrival of settlers.\n\n\n\nTwo Carpet Snakes and the Dragonfly  The principal Tjukurrpa disclosed in the evidence (both claimant and expert) \nis called Tjila Kutjara: two carpet snakes being chased by a dragonfly (Tjinkuna). During the on country hearing, \nthe Court viewed some of the principal sites related to this Tjukurrpa. Most claimant witnesses gave evidence about \nthis Tjukurrpa, but the principal claimant witnesses who spoke about it in oral evidence were Ms Wonyabong and \nMr Muir. Mr James and Mr Richard Narrier, among others, gave accounts in their written evidence. Ms Wonyabong \ntook the lead in many of the sites visited by the Court during the on country evidence.  Both Ms Wonyabong and \nMr Muir principally learned the story of Tjila Kutjara from Ms Walker, Mr Muir\u2019s mother. Ms Wonyabong also gave \nevidence that she heard part of it from the station owner at Albion Downs, although she said she had previously \nheard it from Angeline Narrier and Doris Foley. Angeline Narrier was the aunt of Ms Narrier, Mr Richard Narrier and \nMr Keith Narrier. She was married to Micky Wonyabong. Doris Foley was part of the Ashwin family. Her brother was \nAlfie Ashwin and she was the aunt of Mr Allan Ashwin. Doris Foley had a son called Lenny Ashwin. In his witness \nstatement, Mr Muir described Doris Foley and Angeline Narrier as the main custodians for the country in that they \nwere \u201cresponsible for looking after the tjukurrpa stories and places throughout the Tjiwarl country, because it was \ntheir country\u201d.  It is an open Tjukurrpa (that is, not knowledge restricted by gender or some other attribute) \nalthough, at least based on Mr Liberman\u2019s report, there may be aspects of it which are not open.  Before \ndescending into any detail about the story, it is important to set out that this Tjukurrpa comes into the claim area \nfrom the east \u2013 from Weebo (which is not far outside the south-eastern corner of the claim boundary) and up \nthrough Lake Darlot and then across west into the claim area, although, as I set out below, it has long been said \nthis Tjukurrpa starts in the Northern Territory. When it enters the claim area, the Tjukurrpa runs north up the Barr \nSmith range, ending (on one version at least) at \u201cPii\u201d, a spring on Albion Downs station, and one of the locations \nvisited during the on country hearings. Mr Liberman\u2019s report also dealt with this Tjukurrpa in considerable detail, \nand I refer to aspects of his report below. Although something was made of changes or differences in this (and \nother) Tjukurrpa by the State, I am satisfied those changes or differences are not material to the issues I have to \ndetermine.  By way of introduction, Mr Liberman notes in his report that throughout the Western Desert region and \nthe Pilbara, the carpet snake is associated with water. He reports that carpet snakes \u201chave great difficulty making \nlong journeys over hot dry grounds, so their presence at a water hole is a strong indication that the water is \npermanent\u201d. He notes that when a waterhole becomes dry \u201cit is often said that the snake has died\u201d. He also notes \nthis Tjukurrpa starts \u201cfrom the region of Ayer\u2019s Rock\u201d and extends \u201cacross some 1600 kilometres of desert to pii (the \nBarr Smith Range) near Albion Downs on one version ... and to Walga Rock on Austin Downs Station on another \nversion\u201d. Walga Rock is a very large rock formation located west of Cue, and north-west of Mount Magnet.  Uluru is \nalso where Mr James places the start of this Tjukurrpa, although other claimant witnesses (Ms Harris, Mr Victor \nAshwin, Mr Muir, Mr Allan Ashwin and Ms Wonyabong) simply describe it coming from further east of the claim \narea. Mr Allan Ashwin said it \u201ccame from over in Mungkali country\u201d, which is country well to the east beyond Lake \nCarnegie.  Mr Liberman also noted that:This yiwarra (\u201ctrack\u201d) of the tjila kutjarra (Two Carpet Snakes) is primarily \nassociated with the creation of vital waters in this transection of the Western Desert, and there are many highly \nsecret-sacred sites located on the track-sites which have been important centres of ceremonial activity.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  In his witness statement, Mr James gave an account of this Tjukurrpa. His ngurra is around \nAlbion Downs. He learnt this Tjukurrpa from his father, Dempsey James. This is how he tells the story:We call the \ndreaming, the tjukurrpa. The main one that I\u2019ve been told is the Carpet Snake Dreaming, the Tjila and the Dragonfly \nman, Tjiinkuna. The story is coming from Uluru coming through Weebo and focusing on this area, the journey \nthrough Lake Miranda [K8/L8], Lake Darlot [L8] and up to Tjiwarl and has them being chased across the country \nand shaping some of the landforms and lake systems and being caught on the other side of Albion Downs.\n\n The Dragonfly shaped two rocks in Uluru and left them to dry. They turned into the Tjila, the Carpet Snakes and \nthey traversed their way across the country as the Dragonfly was chasing them through to Weebo and then the \nstory picks up around here.\n\n The part that I know a bit more in depth is around Lake Miranda [K8/L8], Albion, Yakabindie and Barr Smith \nranges. There\u2019s a red sandhill in the middle of the lake that is where they the Carpet Snakes were speared. I have \n\n\n\nbeen told two different versions of that, one is that the blood red sandhill is where they were speared and the other \none is where one of the snakes had eaten regurgitated bad emu fat which caused the sandhill.\n\n Where Jones Creek is, there is a place called Mail Change Well, Tjulpu, that is linked to some of the Carpet Snake \nand Tjiinkuna stories; the part of the Barr Smith Ranges where there are lots of soaks. There is munta there, a \ncrevice or opening to the hills with two springs with a camping ground. I was told not to go to that area at certain \ntimes of year because the mob would do law business there, coming down from Wiluna.\n\n The two snakes being chased made their way to around Albion Downs where they were subsequently tracked \ndown, around Tjiwarl. One was speared around there and the area to the west of the Barr Smith Ranges which you \nsee it\u2019s all flat. It\u2019s flat because when the snake was writhing in agony and in dying it flattened out all the country \nthrough there. When one of the snakes was caught it was wounded and when it was thrashing around outside of \nTjiwarl it created the land there to the west of Logan Springs.\n\n When he cooked it, he took it back to around Tjiwarl and there is a quartz hill there along a rocky outcrop where it \nexploded. Some of the quartz there represents the scales, and the honey opals and stuff like that around there \nevidence the body of the snake. The other snake went further north.\n\n There are some specifics about the landforms around Tjiwarl that are specific to that area. Like when you see \nthose karlkula\u2019s around Logan Springs, that\u2019s the Dragonfly man dropping seeds there out of his tjilly bag and that \nexplains the formation of the karlkula\u2019s there. That\u2019s part of the story, the Dragonfly man used the plants and they \nare only found there in that section.\n\nThere are other different landforms and things that are linked to that Dreaming story as well which can be seen \naround Palm Springs or Palm Well. The Carpet Snake is there and that\u2019s one area I was told when I was growing \nup that we had to make noise and let it know our smells. It\u2019s a place where I\u2019ve taken my son and taught him that \nprotocol.    Mr Liberman also describes, in a part of his report which has been tendered in evidence under orders \nrestricting its publication, other parts of the journey of the two carpet snakes, pursued by the dragonfly. Without \nrevealing its content in these reasons, it is clear those parts of the journey have broader ceremonial and ritual \nsignificance, and had done for decades prior to Mr Liberman\u2019s report. The matters he described are consistent with \nthere having been ongoing, traditional laws and customs practiced in the claim area.\n\nOther open Tjukurrpa  There is the Watja Tjukurrpa (bush potato), which in the on country evidence was a \nTjukurrpa for which Ms Narrier principally spoke. Mr James, Mr Muir and Mr Victor Ashwin also gave evidence \nabout it. In her evidence, Ms Narrier described this Tjukurrpa and explained how Tjukurrpa and country connect \nwith conception and birth, and with people themselves:That watja is important to me and my granddaughter, \nIrandia. It is like my own tjukurrpa, and Irandia has the same one. My mum was waiting for me, and she used to dig \na lot. She was picking them plants, in the middle of a stream in the Booylgoo Ranges. She found a white potato, \nand that told her that she was pregnant with me. I have a mark on my navel the same shape as those ranges. My \nmum told me the story of that.\n\n It is the same for my granddaughter Irandia. We were out in that country when my daughter Amanda dug up a \nreally big watja with a funny shape \u2013 it looked like a little person. That is how we knew that lrandia was on her way. \nIrandia has a little mark on her head near her left ear; that\u2019s where the watja got a little mark from the crowbar when \nwe were digging it up.  There is a Mallee Hen Tjukurrpa, referred to particularly by Ms Luxie Hogarth and Ms \nGeraldine Hogarth. Mr Lewis and Mr Muir also gave evidence about it. Ms Luxie Hogarth told the story in the \nfollowing way:I also know about the Mallee Hen dreamtime story. It comes from Menzies [which is to the south-east \nof the claim area]. There\u2019s a spot along the Agnew to Sandstone road [which runs east/west along the southern part \nof the claim area] where you can see the Mallee Hen Dreaming. That\u2019s where the Mallee Hen is making a nest. \nThat\u2019s his hollow there, where he\u2019s been dreaming there. In Menzies, there\u2019s a big hill, a granite one, same as the \nsand one here in the Tjiwarl claim. I been to that granite one, but I couldn\u2019t climb up to see.\n\n\n\n The Mallee Hen Dreaming comes from Menzies, makes its nest in this country, and then is all across the sand \nhills, right across to Lake Mason [which is a large lake system located inside the western side of the claim \nboundary, but extending out to the west and outside the claim boundary], and then it keeps going. It goes past Lake \nMason, and keeps following the sand hills. The other side of Lake Mason, other people they take it on and carry the \nstory.  Two further Tjukurrpa should be mentioned, to which Dr Brunton refers, having found references to them in \nDaisy Bates\u2019 material. One is a Waiurda Tjukurrpa (oppossum), which was not referred to in the claimant evidence. \nProfessor Berndt refers to it in his 1959 paper I have cited above at [373]. He states (at 97) that the \u201cwhole Western \nDesert is criss-crossed with the meandering tracks of ancestral beings, mostly though not invariably following the \nknown permanent and impermanent waterhole routes\u201d. He refers to the wajurda\u201ctrack\u201d amongst a number of others, \nsome of which are also mentioned in the evidence before me, such as the Mallee Hen, Two Goanna Men and the \nSeven Sisters. I take \u201cwajurda\u201d to be a reference to \u201cWaiurda\u201d, that is, the oppossum Tjukurrpa.  Dr Sackett \nconfirmed he is aware of a Western Desert Tjukurrpa by this name, but he recorded it out to the east of Warburton. \nWarburton is a considerable distance (approximately 600 km as the crow flies) from the easternmost point of the \nclaim area near Barwidgee. It is closer to the Northern Territory border. This evidence, of course, raises the \nquestion of why or how Daisy Bates had recorded it in areas to the north of the claim area. The applicant suggested \nto Dr Brunton in cross-examination, at least impliedly, that what Ms Bates had recorded was the same Western \nDesert Dreaming identified by Dr Sackett, and by Professor Berndt. The question was tentative, because it is \nimpossible to know why Ms Bates recorded what she did. This is another example of how the absence of \nknowledge about Ms Bates\u2019 methods, her questions, her selection of informants and the like can mean incongruities \nadmit of no clear answer. It is not possible to reach any conclusion whether (as the applicant submits) this evidence \nshows a connection between the Ngaiawonga and other members of the Western Desert.  As I understand it, Dr \nBrunton\u2019s view in his supplementary report that the disconformity between Ms Bates\u2019 recording of this Tjukurrpa and \nthe absence of it from the claimant evidence told against any connection or relationship between Ms Bates\u2019 \ninformants and the claim group members\u2019 ancestors, or between the claim group members\u2019 ancestors and the claim \narea (or perhaps both). This is an example of Dr Brunton elevating too readily, in my opinion, the \ncomprehensiveness and reliability of Ms Bates\u2019 material, when nothing is known about her methods.  There is also \na Maruwa Tjukurrpa (bush rat) in the claim area. Mr Keith Narrier mentioned it briefly in his evidence, saying it is \n\u201cjust a hill.\u201d Dr Sackett described how he had recorded this Tjukurrpa as coming from Mount Lawrence Wells on the \nLake Way station, which is just outside the northern boundary of the claim area, and south of Wiluna. He said:It\u2019s a \nlarge hill and people have told me that the little beings were out, wandering around gathering things, and they heard \nthe dingo cry out and there\u2019s a dingo dreaming nearby, Irrawalla, and they heard the dingo call out and they raced \nback \u2013 scurried back towards their home at Mount Lawrence Wells and that\u2019s how the well came into being, \nbecause they were diving into the \u2013 their little cubbies and the hill came up, and they travelled down into the claim \narea. In fact, I \u2013 when I was doing research earlier on I recorded Murriwa activity at around Dingo Pool, which is on \nthe claim area, and Yakabindie Claypan as well. They came down and went back up.  Relying on the references to \nthe Maruwa Tjukurrpa in both Ms Bates\u2019 material and the evidence, the applicant submits this is \u201csupportive of a \ncontinuity between Ngaiawonga and the present claimants\u201d. Just as I have found the absence of the Waiurda \nTjukurrpa from the evidence, although mentioned in Ms Bates\u2019 material, to be inconclusive, so it seems to me is the \npresence of the Maruwa Tjukurrpa. It might be said, as I have noted elsewhere, that something can be drawn from \nthe fact Ms Bates recorded it: that is, from a positive recording, whereas it is much harder to draw any inference \nfrom the absence of material being recorded, when we know nothing about her methods.  In my opinion, the \nstronger point is that, since I accept Dr Sackett\u2019s opinions that the Maruwa Tjukurrpa is a Western Desert Tjukurrpa, \nthe fact that it emerges in the landscape in the claim area (and in areas just outside it to the north which are, it is \nagreed, Western Desert country), and forms part of the claim group members\u2019 understanding of the landscape of \nthe claim area strengthens the probability that the claim area is, and always has been, Western Desert country.\n\nRestricted Tjukurrpa  Some of the Tjukurrpa in evidence were gender restricted. I heard evidence about each of \nthem to some extent, although the men plainly limited what they spoke of in the restricted men\u2019s session.  Since the \napplicant\u2019s written submissions refer to these Tjukurrpa by name, and with brief identifying details, I will also do so, \nbut will not traverse in these reasons the details of any evidence given in restricted sessions, or in the written \nrestricted claimant and expert evidence.  Ms Narrier talked for the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa. She located an \n\n\n\nimportant site for that Tjukurrpa, in her open evidence, as south of \u201cRed Well\u201d, which is a well a little north-east of \nthe Tjiwarl site, in the east of the claim area. She spoke in more detail about that site in her restricted evidence. Ms \nGeraldine Hogarth described another site in the claim area connected with Seven Sisters in her open \nevidence:There was a place at Depot Springs for Seven Sisters dreaming. It\u2019s where they met, last time back in the \n1970s. That was my nannas, my grandmothers. The old ladies had a big cry, hit themselves; they knew they were \ngoing to pass away. And they passed away a couple of years after. The Darlot mob went across for it. And then \nthey just leave that place. Aunty Tjalajuti [Rosie Jones] was there. Old nanna Trixie Wheelbarrow was there, and \nher sister Aurelia. I\u2019ve never seen that place.  Depot Springs is in the south-western part of the claim area. Yeelirrie \n(in the central part of the claim area) was identified in the evidence as another part of the claim area where the \nSeven Sisters Tjukurrpa is located. Ms Wonyabong gave the following evidence:There\u2019s some woman\u2019s stories \nfrom the tjukurrpa. There are some women\u2019s stories on Yakabindie, but Jennifer will know that more than me. Me, \nJennifer Narrier, Roslyn Narrier and Maxine [Beaman], we go out to look after those stories on surveys. We\u2019d like to \ngo more often, but we don\u2019t have the help; nobody to take us, no Toyota.\n\n I know that there is a woman\u2019s story near to Mount Keith station, just south of Red Well. I\u2019ve been to that place but \nI can\u2019t talk about it in this statement because it is just for women. Jennifer Narrier and her sister Roslyn is the right \nperson to talk for that story. Their mother Dolly Walker told them about that story.\n\n Yeelirrie, that\u2019s the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa going through. They are passing through that country. Lots of \nrockholes around in that country. I don\u2019t know the names for those rockholes. The old people didn\u2019t tell me those \nnames, because we were too young, just kids, and those old people passed away before they could tell us the \nnames. That uranium at Yeelirrie, that\u2019s the kumpu [urine] from the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa. Aunty Doris [Foley] \ntold me about that one. That\u2019s the only part of that story I know.  There is another matter I note from this evidence, \nas something of an aside, but which is nevertheless important. Ms Wonyabong described the difficulty of getting \naccess to these sites. There was at times a sense in some of the State\u2019s cross-examination and submissions that \ninferences against the claim group members should be drawn from the infrequency of visits to some of the places \nabout which they gave evidence. I draw no such adverse inferences, although the whole issue of presence on the \nland becomes important in my consideration of the application of s 47B of the NT Act. Many of the witnesses, such \nas Ms Wonyabong, are getting older, and while she in particular displayed tremendous steadiness and adeptness \non some of the very rocky country we encountered on the on country evidence, it is clear she would require \npeople to drive her to sites. Not only are most of these places on pastoral leases, they are reasonably remote. It is \nclear many of the claim group members would face other challenges \u2013 practical, financial and logistical \u2013 in visiting \nthese sites. The fact that in recent years they have not been there very often, and depend on support from an \norganisation such as CDNTS for visits to be arranged, does not affect my view about the genuineness of their \nevidence.  The restricted men\u2019s Tjukurrpa were: the Wati Katjura (the Two Goanna Men); the Tjarntu/Papa (the \nDingo), the Marlu (Kangaroo), and the Karlaya (Emu). The latter three are all associated with the northern, western \nand north-western parts of the claim area. Very little substantive evidence was given about these Tjukurrpa: in the \nmen\u2019s restricted session, Mr Victor Ashwin in particular made it clear he was \u201cnot allowed\u201d to talk about them.  The \nWati Katjurra Tjukurrpa featured significantly in the men\u2019s restricted session. As I have noted elsewhere, most of \nthe claimant witnesses present demonstrated varying degrees of discomfort in speaking about this with a female \npresent. For some, the discomfort was acute and little or nothing was said. For others, there was what appeared to \nbe a conscious but difficult effort to convey enough to satisfy the lawyers, so to speak. The on country evidence \nabout the Wati Katjurra was taken in the south-western part of the claim area, with Mount Townsend and Mount \nMarion in the background, both of which feature in this Tjukurrpa. There were also a number of locations identified \nin the restricted evidence in the north-western part of the claim area relating to this Tjukurrpa, which travels out of \nthe claim area to the north, into areas around Wiluna. The evidence was clear it was a Tjukurrpa shared with people \nfrom that country. I do not think it is revealing anything restricted to indicate that several of the men described links \nbetween this Tjukurrpa and the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa.  There is also a Tjukurrpa relating to the ant, which comes \nfrom around Yeelirrie, and features heavily in the restricted section of Mr Liberman\u2019s report. Some of the female \nclaim group members spoke in somewhat opaque terms about this, the opaqueness making the demarcation very \nclear between what they considered they were allowed to say, and where they were allowed to go, and where they \n\n\n\nwere not. Two examples suffice. Ms Wonyabong\u2019s evidence was:Places that are sacred for men, no womans and \nno kids can go. You\u2019d get growled at if you did. There\u2019s men\u2019s stories in the claim area. I was told not to go to those \nplaces by old Roly Hill, Jennifer Narrier\u2019s grandfather, Dolly Walker\u2019s uncle. He was a wati who is gone now. He \ndidn\u2019t tell me what would happen if they went there, he just say \u2018don\u2019t come here\u2019. He used to talk about it after they \ntook him out to Yeelirrie. One anthropologist took him and a lot of old mans out, doing some work for the uranium. \nThat was when I was living at Yakabindie, maybe in the late 1970s.  Ms Luxie Hogarth said:I know there are \ndreamtimes that I\u2019m not allowed to talk about or go near in Yeelirrie, and I heard that from my husband, not to go \non that side.  The restrictions, and their implementation, are themselves aspects of the traditional laws and customs \nwhich operate on the land and features of the claim area, and on the claim group members. In my opinion, the claim \ngroup members observed those restrictions in a way which made it clear the restrictions operate as normative rules.\n\nChanges or differences in the Tjukurrpa, as it is related or explained  It is accepted by the applicant, and by Dr \nSackett, that there are different versions of some Tjukurrpa (in particular, the Tjila Kutjara), and that there were also \nchanges apparent in Tjukurrpa over time. It is also apparent that not all the Tjukurrpa articulated by the claimant \nwitnesses, and to which Dr Sackett (and Mr Liberman) referred, can be found in the records created by Ms Bates.  \nThis was really the thrust of the State\u2019s arguments about the Tjukurrpa, and why the state contends they lack \nprobative value in terms of proving either that the claim area was Western Desert country at sovereignty, or \nproving that the claim group members have had the requisite connection with the claim area continuously since \nsovereignty.  The points made by the State in its submissions are the following:(a) The Tjukurrpa (or some of them) \nextend out of the claim area, and there was some evidence they extend to the west; that is, into what is agreed not \nto be Western Desert country.\n\n (b) Daisy Bates recorded the Ngaiawonga people as using the term \u201cmaiamba\u201d or \u201cmiamba\u201d rather than Tjukurrpa, \na term used by other Murchison tribes to the west.\n\n (c) The accounts of the Tjukurrpa vary between the claimant witnesses, and have varied over time.  The State then \nmade submissions about several of the individual Tjukurrpa described in the evidence.  Some of these contentions \nappear to go to the question whether the Tjukurrpa as related by the claim group members existed at sovereignty \nand was \u201ctraditional\u201d; others seemed to go to whether the Tjukurrpa beliefs were properly characterised as part of \nWestern Desert laws and customs.  As to the first point, in my opinion the claimant evidence, and that of Dr Sackett, \nmade it clear that many Tjukurrpa travelled through the country of many different groups. In each country, the \nTjukurrpa provided reference and explanation for the landscape, and the place of people in it, and how they must \nbehave \u2013 where they can go and where they cannot. None of the claim group members purported to know anything \nby way of substance or detail about where the Tjukurrpa went after they left the claim area (or land close to the \nclaim area): they made it clear that was not their business to know. As I understood Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence in \nparticular (and I did not understand Dr Brunton to dissent on this issue), it is in the nature of Tjukurrpa that they \ntravel through the country of different groups. To take but one example from Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence, where he was \nnot speaking about anything contentious in this particular claim, but rather was attempting to interpret an entry in \nDaisy Bates\u2019 records that he described as \u201ccryptic\u201d. He then referred to a Tjukurrpa located in the Wiluna \ndetermination area (which, it will be recalled, was agreed and then determined to be Western Desert country):I \nhave come across kangaroo dreaming. It travels down from the north and ends up around \u2013 well, enters the more \nimmediate Wiluna area around Lake Nabberu, which is the north of Wiluna, and moves across that lake system, \nheading east, through some pastoral leases up further in the Wiluna claim area and then moves off to the east into \nother areas. This is quite an important dreaming. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  I fail to see how this affects adversely the way the applicant puts the claim in this matter.  On \nthe second matter, Dr Sackett recognised \u201cmiamba\u201d as an alternative word for \u201cDreaming\u201d. There was no real \nevidence about its provenance, from either Dr Sackett or Dr Brunton. In the absence of any evidence which \nindicated why Ms Bates used the word \u201cmaiamba\u201d or \u201cmiamba\u201d, I again fail to see how this is material. The State\u2019s \nsubmissions proceed on an assumption that Ms Bates\u2019 expression was undoubtedly correct, and that she intended \nto exclude the use of other terms. There is no basis whatsoever for assumptions of this kind about Ms Bates\u2019 \n\n\n\nmaterial, as I have explained elsewhere in these reasons.  On the State\u2019s contentions about individual Tjukurrpa, I \ndo not accept that any of those contentions should lead to the conclusion that Tjukurrpa \u201cfrom the Western Desert \nwere imposed upon, or extended into, or elaborated upon in relation to, the Claimed Area by the desert \nimmigrants.\u201d In large part, the State\u2019s contentions relied on what was (or was not) contained in Ms Bates\u2019 material \nand I have set out my reasons elsewhere for concluding that her records are not necessarily reliable, and are \ncertainly not to be considered in any way comprehensive.  The State\u2019s contentions about the Tjukurrpa are \npremised, consistently with its concession, on the fact the claim group members are Western Desert people, and \ntheir Tjukurrpa is Western Desert Tjukurrpa. That, in my opinion, tells strongly against many of the State\u2019s other \nbasic contentions. Where it leaves the State\u2019s argument (supported by Dr Brunton, as I understand it) is with the \nproposition that, in the 1930s and 1940s, a group of Western Desert people have appropriated, or taken over, the \nentirety of Aboriginal interests in the land and waters in the claim area (being originally not even Western Desert \ncountry) and made up a series of sacred Dreamings (which happen to fit with the landscape, or which, on this \nthesis, they deliberately crafted to fit with the landscape). The State\u2019s argument (with Dr Brunton\u2019s support) is that \nthe claim group members\u2019 ancestors did this intending to apply to the country, and to their own relationship with it, \na set of rules which they knew to be foreign to that country, and not in accordance with the traditional laws and \ncustoms applying to that area. It is a startling proposition, and should be rejected.  I turn now to the State\u2019s third \npoint in a little more detail. The State did not challenge any of the witnesses about changes or differences in \nTjukurrpa on the basis that one or more of the witnesses\u2019 accounts were not credible, nor that one account was the \ncredible or correct one and others were not. There was no suggestion in cross-examination by the State that \nwitnesses were inventing Tjukurrpa, or versions of the Tjukurrpa. Yet, in my opinion, that is what the State\u2019s third \npoint must to some extent amount to. I have set out what the witnesses\u2019 evidence was about the nature of \nTjukurrpa, and I have set out Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion describing it, including from other anthropological sources. Dr \nBrunton did not disagree with these descriptions or characterisations. In an oral tradition within a community of \npeople where knowledge about and rights and interests in country are held and assigned in complex ways, I see \nno real difficulty with variations in accounts and different emphases placed on aspects of Tjukurrpa by different \npeople.  I accept the following explanation given by Dr Sackett, and do not presume to improve upon its \nexpression:No two tellings of the Tjila Kutjara story are the same. A comparison of the versions recorded by \nLiberman and those put forth by claimants indicates that this is not a recent phenomenon. In fact, as Liberman saw \nit:such discrepancies [between versions] must be considered a natural phenomenon characteristic of widely spread \ncommunities carrying on the same Dreaming. There is no question of which one is the correct version ...Berndt and \nBerndt hinted at how it could happen that different versions could emerge and be maintained. In an introduction to a \ncollection of myths from around the country, they started by noting that the stories they were relating were \u201cset out \nin the form in which they were told on particular occasions.\u201d They went on to say:However, this is not the only way \nin which stories were transmitted. Quite often, fragments would be told, referring to places or to characters without \nexpanding on the actions or following through the story-line. A child travelling though the country of some close \nrelative ... might be told the name of a special site and of its spirit-presence, or a wife might be given such \ninformation on her first visit to her husband\u2019s country. These items would probably be expanded later into more \ncomplete accounts ... In Aboriginal Australia there were no professional story-tellers ... Everyone was a potential if \nnot an actual storyteller ... Myth-stories could be told or exchanged during ceremonial gatherings, or on informal \noccasions such as leisure-time gatherings around camp-fires. In any such situations the most knowledgeable story-\ntellers were those who had direct links with the places were the stories they told were located, and were old enough \nor experienced enough to know these stores well. Of course, some were more articulate and more competent \u2013 and \nacknowledged as better story-tellers. The aspect of creativity and the \u2018personal touch\u2019 was always present in any \nsphere of individual performance ... and the actual telling of stories provided one medium for this kind of \nexpressionThat myth-stories may be learned piecemeal, from different teachers, and a wider picture and deeper \nunderstanding only develop across the years, opens the door to variation(s).\n\n By my reading, Bates did not report any rendering of the Two Snakes story. Rather, it appears first to have been \nrecorded in the area of the claim in the mid-1970s by Liberman. However, Liberman saw the story as having an \nearlier history, writing:it is clear that the major Dreaming track in the region is that of the two Carpet Snakes. This \ntrack comes from Ngaanyatjarra and Martutjarra territories (both Western Desert areas) and enters the Kuwarra [ie \nKoara] region. As recently as thirty years ago Ngaayatjarra and Martutjarra people participated in ceremonies with \n\n\n\nKuwarra people at sites associated with the Carpet Snake Dreaming (ngalpiri and tjampua).That is, by Liberman\u2019s \nreckoning, ceremonies relating to the Tjila Kutjara were last performed on the Tjiwarl Claim area in the mid-1940s.\n\n However, there is no reason to suppose the Dreaming and its associated rites were new to the area in the mid-\n1940s. That is, that Bates did not mention the Tjila Kutjara does not mean the Dreaming necessarily was any less \nimportant to people in the early years of the last century (and to people before them) than it was to Liberman\u2019s \ninformants in the mid-1970s or is to Tjiwarl Claimants today.\n\n Liberman did not discuss or relate how his informants came to have and hold their knowledge of the Tjila Kutjara. \nHowever, some claimants, in their statements, do this. For example:  Allan James says \u201cDad showed me these \nstories and back then it was something that everyone knew and we all shared it. Other people, some of the old \nladies like Aunty Angeline Narrier [deceased] and Adeline Hennessey [deceased] taught me too about different \nthings. I remember my family and I went with Aunty Angeline [Narrier] to a few of those places and she showed me \nwhat to do to stay safe.\u201d  Shirley Wonyabong notes \u201cDolly Walker helped me by telling me the same story that she \nhad put in that paper, the letter. Dolly taught me the story about the dragonfly and the snake, which we call the Tjila. \nThat story goes through Yakabindie, right to Albion Downs and through Mt Keith. Mrs Walker told me that story, and \nso did Aunt Angeline Narrier and Doris Foley, they knew that story too.\u201dIn this, they recount learning of the myth-\nstory and places associated with it from senior, more knowledgeable, people. As I earlier noted, as claimants see it, \ntheir own knowledge comes from those who acquired their knowledge from those before them. Again, there is no \nreason to suppose that the oral tradition of the Tjila Kutjara does not extend back to sovereignty and beyond.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  As the applicant pointed out in oral submissions, and despite suggestions in the State\u2019s \nsubmissions to the contrary, Dr Brunton did not dispute that the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa was traditionally \nassociated with the claim area, as I have noted above. If that is the case, as I understand it, his thesis is that the \nclaim group members\u2019 ancestors knew about it in some kind of vague or general way and then only developed it in \ndetail once they moved into the claim area, and in this sense \u201cimposed\u201d their own version on the claim area. This \nthesis is so wholly antithetical to what I have found to be the genuine evidence of the claimant witnesses about the \nrole of Tjukurrpa in their lives, and to the picture painted by Dr Sackett about how the claim group members and \ntheir ancestors receive and disclose knowledge, that I cannot accept it.  The remaining issue to deal with in this part \nof my reasons is the State\u2019s submission about whether the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa was connected with \nJones Creek. The State adopted the suggestions implicit in Dr Brunton\u2019s evidence that it was not, and this was \nsome kind of recent invention, which itself illustrated (although this was never really made express) that the claim \ngroup members would make up or adjust their accounts of Tjukurrpa to fit the circumstances, and that there was no \nreal connection to the country of the claim area, just some kind of self-serving imposition of Tjukurrpa as and when \nrequired. Of course, it was not put so bluntly, but that must it seems to me be the effect of raising this issue.  As to \nthe reliance by the State on what Dr Brunton said about Jones Creek, I do not accept the interpretation Dr Brunton \nput on this sequence of events, even if (contrary to my opinion) there was sufficient evidence before the Court \nabout what occurred, and why, during the 1990-1991 consultations about mining in the area.  This was Dr Brunton\u2019s \nevidence on the issue:MR WRIGHT: So what point were you trying to make by referring to that dispute?---I was \ntrying to point out that whereas Liberman did not record any sites of importance in Jones Creek in 1977, by, I think, \n1990/91, there were a significant number of people who had come to believe that really it was extremely important, \nand this is reflected in some of the claimants\u2019 evidence. And my point was then to show how, if you like,country \ncan be reinterpreted under different circumstances. It was a similar example to the one that I spoke of generally \nwith Liberman in my first report about the \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say the word, but you know the - - -\n\n Yes?--- - - - the \u2013 the \u2013 the one I\u2019m referring to \u2013 extending over to the Darling Ranges.\n\n Yes. But they\u2019re quite different situations, aren\u2019t they, because the Jones Creek example is really just about a \nparticular site or sites along what you\u2019re acknowledging is an existing track?---The \u2013 it was \u2013 I mean, there are a \nnumber of \u2013 there was a number of different situations which I was identifying in the \u2013 in the second report. One is, \n\n\n\nif you like, the extension of a \u2013 of a track, which is the \u2013 the one that I\u2019m talking about with the Darling Ranges. The \nother is reinterpretation of the movement of a \u2013 of a particular track, and the Jones Creek was the \u2013 was the \u2013 was \nthe second. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  This evidence was, frankly, skirting around what seems to me to be the inevitable implication \nfrom Dr Brunton\u2019s opinion: namely, that in 1990-1991 some Aboriginal claim group members had made up, \nchanged or readjusted the Tjukurrpa in order to prevent mining occurring. There is no other basis for the use by Dr \nBrunton of this kind of language. Under cross-examination, Dr Brunton denied that was the implication he was \nmaking. However, I did not find his explanation, when pressed further under cross-examination, satisfactory. He \nsaid:In terms of the issue around Jones Creek, I don\u2019t wish to make a comment and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily \nrelevant to the kind of point that I was trying to make, which was a question of what was accepted at different times.  \nHe then expressly accepted and agreed with the proposition that the Two Carpet Snakes Tjukurrpa is a \u201ctraditional \ndreaming story in the claim area\u201d. Despite accepting that proposition, he then went on to express the opinion I have \nextracted above about people coming to believe certain matters, and reinterpreting country.  All Dr Brunton bases \nthis on is the absence of any reference by Mr Liberman to Jones Creek as a significant site. Again, there are many \nhypotheses about why Mr Liberman may not have been told this information that do not involve recent invention.  \nNo suggestion of recent invention was put directly to any Aboriginal witness. There may have been any number of \nreasons for differences between what was recorded or mapped by Mr Liberman and what was said by certain \nindividuals in 1990-1991 and why Jones Creek was only mentioned in 1990-1991 as an important site for the Two \nCarpet Snakes Tjukurrpa, if indeed that is the correct description of what occurred. Even if \u201cre-interpretation\u201d (or, as \nI understand what is really being said, invention) is one of them, that says nothing about the veracity of the \nevidence given before me, in the absence of any challenges to the credibility of the witnesses.\n\nConclusions on Tjukurrpa  It is clear from the claimant evidence, supported by the opinions of Dr Sackett and Dr \nBrunton, that knowledge of the Tjukurrpa (its relationship to particular parts of the claim area and how the Tjukurrpa \nfits into the overall landscape, both inside and moving out of the claim area) provides a principal mechanism of \nconnection to country for the claim group members. Possession of that knowledge, its use and divulgence forms \npart of the normative rules that unite the claim group members.  I do not consider the Tjukurrpa of which the Court \nheard evidence is any recent, post-sovereignty invention or development. I consider the Tjukurrpa of which I heard \nevidence are Tjukurrpa that have been passed on, held and disclosed in accordance with a set of normative \nprinciples \u2013 based partly on descent and kinship and partly on birth and long association with the land (and then \ninternally within the group, with particular parts of it).  Consistently with my findings in other sections of these \nreasons, in my opinion the evidence establishes on the balance of probabilities that there was a mixing of the claim \ngroup members\u2019 ancestors with the Aboriginal people who were the original inhabitants of the claim area in a way \nwhich facilitated the sharing of knowledge and the recognition of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors connection \nwith the claim area, albeit no doubt that connection strengthened once the ancestors were living in and around the \nclaim area. That mixing, sharing of knowledge and recognition could occur because in my opinion it is more likely \nthan not that the original inhabitants of the claim area were Western Desert people. As I have found, some of the \nclaim group members\u2019 ancestors were established in the claim area before 1912. Whether they are properly \ndescribed as descendants of the \u201coriginal inhabitants\u201d is not possible to ascertain. The important point is that some \nof them were associated with, living in, using and occupying parts of the claim area before Ms Bates\u2019 work to the \nnorth of the claim area in 1912. Their co-location with non-Western Desert people to their west no doubt led some \nof them to be able to speak non-Western Desert languages, and to establish and maintain some ties with people to \ntheir west through marriage and ceremony. Like other societies anywhere in the world, people must learn to live \nwith their neighbours.\n\nUsing the Tjukurrpa as described by the claim group members as evidence of the laws and customs at sovereignty    \nEvidence of the Tjukurrpa described by the claim group members serves two purposes in this proceeding. \nObviously, it is the critical concept of traditional laws and customs the claim group members contend connects them \nwith the claim area. However, in the context of the particular issues in this proceeding about occupation of the claim \narea at sovereignty, the applicant also relies on evidence about the Tjukurrpa to prove that the claim area was \nWestern Desert country at sovereignty and, at least by final submissions, to contend that the claim group \n\n\n\nmembers\u2019 knowledge of the Tjukurrpa proved, or was capable of proving, that some of the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors had been in occupation of or associated with the claim area at sovereignty (that is, around 1912).  I have \ndealt with the Tjukurrpa in detail in the section above at [532]-[595], where I examine the evidence concerning the \ntraditional laws and customs on which the applicant relies as connecting the claim group members with the land \nand waters in the claim area, and giving rise to rights and interests in that land and those waters. In this section, I \nconfine myself to my findings whether the claimant evidence about Tjukurrpa does, as they contend, inform the \ndecision whether the claim area was Western Desert country at sovereignty\n\nThe applicant\u2019s argument  The way this argument was put is set out at [265] of the applicant\u2019s final written \nsubmissions as follows:The contemporary evidence about tjukurrpa is relevant to the issue of the society at \nsovereignty, because if, as the Applicants submit, the Claimed Area is replete with Western Desert tjukurpa [sic], \nthen that raises an obvious inference that the area is part of the Western Desert cultural bloc society, unless it can \nbe shown that either this is a case of Western Desert tjukurrpa:\n\n (a) being imposed onto the country in contemporary times by incoming Western Desert migrants; or\n\n (b) extending beyond the borders of the Western Desert.\n\n For the reasons submitted below, neither is a likely scenario.  The State is correct to submit that the applicant\u2019s \ncontention on this use of the Tjukurrpa relies on inference. I am prepared to draw the inferences for which the \napplicant contends.\n\nThe State\u2019s arguments and my responses and findings  The State makes three substantive contentions.  First, there \nwas clear and considerable evidence that the Tjukurrpa for the claim area extended beyond it, and indeed a long \nway to the west: that is, into non-Western Desert country. The State referred to the evidence of Mr Allan Ashwin, \nwho said some Tjukurrpa extended to Cue and Mount Magnet and may have been known by the ancestors of the \npeople in those places. Mr James said Tjukurrpa storylines he knows also traverse the Badimia country, and he \nknows this because he knows this country through his mother. The State also pointed out that Mr James said the \nTjukurrpa covered long distances in other directions. The State pointed out that Mr Muir identified that the Wati \nKatjura Tjukurrpa (the Two Goanna Men Tjukurrpa) extends to Perth and to Docker River in the Northern Territory \nand that other stories come from outside Western Desert country. In evidence that ranged similar kinds of \ndistances, Mr Victor Ashwin stated that the Tjukurrpa starts in the ocean at the Burrup Peninsula on the Pilbara \ncoast and it continues to other places, such as Albany. The State also referred to Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s evidence that \nthe Mallee Hen Tjukurrpa comes from Menzies and continues west apparently into Wadjari or Badimia country. \nFinally, the State pointed out that Ms Wonyabong said the Seven Sisters Tjukurrpa runs all over Australia, although \nshe was not sure where it starts or finishes. I note Ms Wonyabong did say that the \u201cmain one\u201d for the Seven Sisters \nTjukurrpa is at Yeelirrie.  As I understand this first point, the State\u2019s emphasis was on evidence from the claim \ngroup members who identified the Tjukurrpa running to the west, and sometimes far away \u2013 that is, into country \nwhich was not Western Desert country. It drew support from the acceptance by both experts that the Tjukurrpa \nextend both within and beyond the Western Desert.  The State submits that Dr Sackett gave a number of examples \nof Tjukurrpa moving in and out of peoples\u2019 country, including of Tjukurrpa referred to in this proceeding, and said \nsuch movements were \u201cif not common, by no means extraordinary\u201d.  That submission is correct, so far as it goes, \nbut it does not capture the tenor of Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence in his supplementary report. The point Dr Sackett was \nmaking by reference to two Dreamings from other areas was that it is not unknown that Dreamings travel in this \nway, but it does not prevent the Dreaming being one which is associated with a particular society \u2013 such as \nWestern Desert society. Rather what it shows is the expansion of knowledge (including general knowledge) and \nincreasing communication and contact (now more possible than in previous generations) between Aboriginal people \nwho hold the Dreaming stories. In his supplementary report he develops this by reference to further examples:I too \nhave recorded stories of Dreamings moving out of and/or into the Western Desert. In the more immediate area of \nthe Tjiwarl Claim, for instance, I have recorded stories of:  a Female being, sometimes referred to as Minyma \n(Woman) who travels from Wilgie Mia, west of Tuckanarra, ie from country to the west of the Western Desert, to \nthe vicinity of Wiluna, and on eastward to the area of Blackstone.  Karlaya (Emu Beings) who were chased south \n\n\n\nalong the line of some of the waters which later became \u2018wells\u2019 on the Canning Stock Route, ie through parts of the \nWestern Desert, to Yagungku southeast of Meekatharra, and west of the Western Desert, then easterly across the \ndesert and into South Australia.  Seven Sisters, and their pursuer Wati Nyirru, who were said, in recent years, to \nhave travelled to the Wiluna area from far to the west \u2013 \u201cnear the sea\u201d \u2013 and then on east into the Gibson Desert \nand beyond.A couple of things are relevant here. First, in my experience, over the years when discussing the \nMinyma Dreaming people at Wiluna consistently have indicated that in their view she came from, or began her \ntravels from, Wilgie Mia. Similarly, they consistently have indicated that in their view Karlaya travelled to Yagungku \nand then moved back into the desert.\n\n Second, the \u201cnear the sea\u201d reference to the Seven Sisters is a more recent view. Earlier, people indicated they did \nnot know from whence they came.\n\n This strikes me as paralleling views that saw certain Dreamings come \u201cfrom near Burrup Peninsula\u201d or go to \nAlbany. When I first arrived in Wiluna, I doubt anyone was aware of the Burrup Peninsula, or knew of its location. (I \nwas with various people when they saw television for the first time, saw the sea for the first time, rode in a lift for the \nfirst time.) When I asked, for instance, where the very important and wide ranging Marlu Dreaming began, I was told \nit had its origins somewhere, undefined and unnamed, to the north. And while I early on heard the Dingo Dreaming \nwent to south Leonora (see Jennifer Narrier), it is only in [t]he past 10-15 years I have been told it goes to Dog Rock \nin Albany.\n\n Myers noted something similar. As he told it:Until 1975 I had been told that one of the Pintupi Dreamings tracks \nended at a place called Pinari near Lake Mackay. However, after [some of his informants] visited their long-\nseparated relatives at Balgo, they returned to tell me that \u2018we thought that story ended, went into the ground, at \nPinari. But we found that it goes underground all the way to Balgo\u2019.Myers was of the view that:The example shows \nthat historical change can be integrated, but that it is assimilated to the pre-existing forms: The foundations had \nalways been there, but people had not known it before ... What appear to be changes do not challenge the \nfundamental ontology of all things ordained once-and-for-all. New rituals, songs, or designs \u2013 for Westerners the \nproducts of human creation \u2013 are for the Pintupi clearer sights of what was always there.Such extensions may raise \nquestions for those operating outside the logic of the system, but for claimants and their fellows they seem to go to \nmake sense of \u2018new\u2019 information that has come their way \u2013 information their ancestors and they formerly had not \nbeen aware of.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  This is the kind of \u201cchange\u201d which, I accept, is apparent in the claimant evidence. It is, in that \nsense, not a change at all, as non-Aboriginal people would usually understand that concept. It is a filling out of \nknowledge.  Viewed in this way, it is unremarkable that the claim group members, as people giving evidence in the \ntwenty-first century, would be able to fill out the Tjukurrpa with content that would not have been expressly part of \nthe Tjukurrpa when related by people who had not, for example, travelled much outside the areas in which they \nlived, nor otherwise been as aware of what existed in the broader world.  I accept, and agree with, Dr Sackett\u2019s \nconclusion on this issue:In my experience and opinion, there is clear evidence that some Dreamings, at least some \nof which are linked with the Tjiwarl Claim area, and others of which are linked to lands far removed from it, move \ninto/out of the Western Desert. There is no suggestion on the part of claimants that they, either as Western Desert \npeople or as claimants to lands through which such Dreamings pass, are able to extend their claims through them. \nOn the contrary, claimants make claims to the lands/places for which they regard themselves as holding \nresponsibilities. As Shirley Wonyabong avers when speaking of the Two Snakes line, \u201cThat story of the Tjila and the \ndragonfly come from Yandal, and from Alice Springs side, from the east. We don\u2019t know that side of the story \nthough; we just know when it comes in to our country, near Henry\u2019s Well.\u201d\n\n (Citations omitted.)  The second point made by the State is that:The evidence is also clear that Ngaiawonga people \nreferred to their dreaming stories using the term \u201cmiamba\u201d, rather than tjukurrpa, and that this was the same term \nand concept used by the other Murchison tribes to the west. As well as differentiating Ngaiawonga from their \n\n\n\neastern neighbours and aligning them with their western ones, this evidence suggests that either: (1) the \nNgaiawonga laws and customs relating to dreaming stories and tracks were substantively different to the WDCB; or \n(2) if miambaand tjukurrpa are substantively the same thing, then it (and the stories and tracks themselves) \nextended to other, uncontentiously non-WDCB groups to the west. There was no evidence that tjukurrpa are limited \nto the WDCB.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  It is correct that in cross-examination, Dr Sackett accepted that the word \u201cmiamba\u201d was, \ninsofar as it is recorded by Ms Bates, used by some of the people she called Ngaiawonga, and it meant \n\u201cDreamings\u201d. He also agreed it was a Wajarri word: that is in the language of the people more to the west of the \nclaim area.  He was also asked about another word in Ms Bates\u2019 notes \u2013 \u201cbimara\u201d (said to relate to waterholes, but \nin a spiritual way, in the sense of beings located in waterholes) \u2013 and it was put to him this was also a Wajarri word. \nWhile he agreed that he understood it was, he added that he knew it also to be a Western Desert expression. He \nsaid:MR RANSON: And again that\u2019s, can I suggest to you \u2013 you may or may not agree with me \u2013 that that\u2019s a \nWudjari word that means a waterhole with a spiritual \u2013 a belief that there\u2019s a snake in it?---It\u2019s a word I\u2019ve heard \nfrom the Western Desert that means something other than you\u2019ve just said. \n\n ...\n\n [On then being shown a Wajarri dictionary extract].\n\n ... and the description there, a spring pool or waterhole that the kujida, a giant water snake, lives in? ---Yes.\n\n So, that would seem to me to be what these references are to in this Bates document. Does that seem correct to \nyou?---As I said, I \u2013 the word is familiar to me from the desert, and I\u2019m sure that I can talk any further about it in \nopen court.\n\n Sorry. It has a different meaning in the desert without - - -?---It has a meaning that might parallel this.\n\n Okay. When you say parallel \u2013 and without going into anything that you can\u2019t go226;128;into \u2013 is that \u2013 does that \nmean, perhaps, the concept and the word are shared between Wudjari and Western Desert, in your view?---An \nimportant place. An important place. There\u2019s perhaps a distinction there, yes?---Not necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s not \nnecessarily that one precludes the other, if you get my \u2013 it could be this \u2013 the two could be together.  The State then \nsubmitted that:Dr Sackett disavowed any suggestion that the course of a tjukurrpa can be used to identify either the \nextent of the Western Desert or the holders of rights and interests in land.  Dr Sackett was asked about the part of \nhis report dealing with Mr Liberman\u2019s theories as to why the claim area was Western Desert country at several \npoints in his oral evidence. I have referred to his oral evidence on this issue in the section dealing with Mr \nLiberman\u2019s work (see [437]-[438] above).  When being cross-examined by counsel for the State, in the passage on \nwhich the State bases this submission above, Dr Sackett clarified what he meant and said:Well, in what I said about \ndreamings leaving the Western Desert, that would apply, yes. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  The \u201cthat\u201d in this sentence is his own proposition in his report that he is not sure \u201cshared \nDreaming and shared ritual participation can safely be read as indicating shared culture\u201d.  It seems to me that, \ntaken in context, Dr Sackett was (as he said in re-examination) disagreeing with Mr Liberman\u2019s emphasis on shared \nDreaming as indicating one society, to use the native title word, or to indicate rights to country. But his clarification \nthat he meant Dreamings coming out of the Western Desert is not unimportant, in the context of his work in Wiluna. \nThat he was told Dreamings left the country of the Wiluna determination and travelled west did not prevent his \ncharacterisation of the country in the Wiluna claim as Western Desert country. The same would seem to apply \nhere.  Third, and related to this, the State submits that in Wongatha, Lindgren J made factual findings to the same \neffect, observing that the evidence did not establish \u201ca suite of distinctively Western Desert Dreaming tracks\u201d which \n\n\n\ncould be used to delineate the Western Desert boundary.  In my opinion, in common with some of the State\u2019s other \npoints, reliance on what Lindgren J said in Wongatha misunderstands how the applicant contends the Tjukurrpa \nprovides a basis (and not, in and of itself the only or sufficient basis) to accept that the claim area is, and always \nhas been, Western Desert country. The applicant does not rely on a \u201ctrack\u201d that necessarily must start in Western \nDesert country and then end at some kind of geographical boundary which demarcates Western Desert country \nfrom non-Western Desert country. That is, with respect, a Eurocentric kind of understanding of the need for definite \ngeographic boundaries.  The link, as the claimant witnesses explained (those whose evidence Dr Sackett refers to \nat [9] of his supplementary report), is that the very account of how the landscape was made, who inhabits it and the \nrules for living that those beings have enacted and continue to enforce, is the same account for the claim group \nmembers in respect of land in the claim area as it is for people to the east. They are united by that Tjukurrpa, even \nthough each group has responsibility for how the Tjukurrpa appears and is enacted in their own country. This is, in \nmy opinion, the kind of law which unites a group of people of which the High Court spoke in Yorta Yorta at [49], [52] \nand [89] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ) and Mabo (No 2) at 186-188 (Toohey J). It is not about lines on \nmaps.  For those reasons, I consider the applicant is correct in the submissions made at [265] of their written \nsubmissions.\n\nConnection: the migration thesis  \n\nThe applicant\u2019s position  At [31] of their statement of issues, facts and contentions the applicant contends:Around \nthe late 19th century and/or early 20th century, the persons referred to in paragraph 64 below:\n\n (a) were members of the Western Desert cultural bloc;\n\n (b) were in occupation of areas in the vicinity of the Claimed Area, which areas formed part of the land associated \nwith the Western Desert cultural bloc;\n\n (c) spoke dialects similar to the dialect spoken by the persons in occupation of the Claimed Area at sovereignty;\n\n (d) migrated into the Claimed Area;\n\n (e) knew of, or learned from other members of the Western Desert cultural bloc, the Tjukurrpa for the Claimed Area \nin substantially the same form as it previously existed at sovereignty.  This contention needs to be read with the \napplicant\u2019s principal contention that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors obtained their rights to country in the \nclaim area through birth in, or long association with, the claim area.  It was this contention which was the subject of \nan objection by the State to the way the applicant put their case in final submissions. I have dealt with this at [52]-\n[60] above.  There are two themes running through the applicant\u2019s submissions on this critical issue. The first is that \nthe Court should find at least some of the ancestors of the claim group members knew and interacted with the \nAboriginal people who were in occupation of the claim area at sovereignty. The second is that the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors were able to do this because they shared, with the original occupants, traditional laws and \ncustoms of the Western Desert.  So, for example, at [321]-[322] of their final submissions, the applicant \ncontends:Several of the Aboriginal witnesses were advanced in age; for example, Luxie Hogarth was born around \n1941, June Tullock around 1946, and Shirley Wonyabong around 1949. Some of Liberman\u2019s informants were said \nto have lived in the Claimed Area around the time of first European contact. The evidence of many Aboriginal \nwitnesses was based not only on their own experiences but on what they learned from their parents or \ngrandparents. This evidence extends back to the time of Bates\u2019 Ngaiawonga. The oral histories of the claimants \nthus include references to Koyl, who was one of Bates\u2019 main informants, and to Waiya, not referred to by Bates but \nwho is likely to have been in the Claimed Area around that time. Waiya is associated by the Redmond family with \nthe site called Pii, which was recorded by Bates and is one of the main sites on the Two Carpet Snake Dreaming \ntrack which both Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton accepted was traditional to the Claimed Area.\n\n\n\n The more rational and likely inference is that as Aboriginal people (the claimants\u2019 ancestors) moved into the \nClaimed Area from the east, they interacted with the original occupants or their descendants in accordance with a \nshared system of law and custom, including shared belief in the tjukurrpa. Equally, the more likely explanation as to \nwhy there is no oral or written record or indication of a non-Western Desert [Ngaiawonga] society having died out or \nmoved away and of Western Desert people having moved in and imposed their own law and tjurkurrpa on the \ncountry, is because it did not happen that way.  Thus, although the applicant accepts that most of the ancestors of \nthe current claim group members originated from areas to the east of the claim area, particularly around Wongawol \nand Darlot, they contend there were, from pre-sovereignty, established links between those people and the persons \nin occupation of the claim area, including links based on shared belief in Tjukurrpa and shared participation in \nassociated rituals, intermarriage and visitation. The movement of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors into the claim \narea from the 1920s or 1930s onwards involved, the applicant contends, a small number of people, invoking \nexisting relationships and shared laws and customs as a basis for taking up residence, with those people being \naccepted and recognised by the existing occupants who passed on knowledge to the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors. There was not, as the applicant\u2019s counsel emphasised in oral submissions, any transmission of rights \n(contrary to the State\u2019s characterisation of what needed to be established) because, it was submitted, Western \nDesert people work on an exchange and sharing of knowledge of country, rather than the handing over of rights.  \nThe applicant relies on the following categories of evidence to make good its contentions: the claimant witnesses\u2019 \nown evidence, the evidence about the studies done by Mr Liberman in the 1970s, and Dr Sackett\u2019s opinions. I deal \nwith those as necessary in my conclusions.\n\nThe State\u2019s contentions  The State contends people who were living in this area in the early twentieth century come \nlargely from the areas of Lake Carnegie, and areas to the north-east, first into the Darlot area, and then into the \neastern parts of the claim area. The State contends the evidence shows the migration of the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors into the claim area post-dated \u201cat least by a little but most likely by many years, the vacation of the area \nby the original Ngaiawonga occupants\u201d.  The State submits the applicant\u2019s approach does not deal with the \nquestions of when, from where, or why the migration of the claimants\u2019 ancestors occurred, nor does this approach \nproperly address the identification of the asserted \u201cprior connections\u201d to the claim area.  The State\u2019s submissions \nwork through the claimant evidence systematically, in order to demonstrate that their evidence is consistent with the \nState\u2019s position that the claim group members\u2019 parents (and grandparents) arrived in the claim area mostly in the \n1940s to 1960s, with a few visits, passings through or temporary residence periods in the 1930s. The State submits \nthat, as to the purpose for the movement, overwhelmingly where the evidence does establish the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors moved into the claim area, the evidence shows they moved for work on the pastoral stations, \nor for other non-traditional reasons (such as escaping violence in the areas in which they had previously lived).\n\nMy conclusions  It is as well to begin with the authority on which the applicant relies for the proposition that \nmovements of this kind, at least within Western Desert country, are no bar to the recognition of native title rights \nunder the NT Act. That case is De Rose [2003] FCAFC 286; 133 FCR 325. Some time should be spent on this \ndecision.\n\nDe Rose  De Rose was an appeal from a determination of native title in relation to the land within the boundaries of \nthree pastoral leases comprising the De Rose Hill Station in the far north-west of South Australia. Unlike the present \nproceeding, there was no dispute at trial or on appeal that the claim area was within the \u201ceastern extremity\u201d of the \nWestern Desert region. What was in issue was described by the trial judge (and by the Full Court on appeal at [36]) \nas:(i) whether the appellants ever had a connection with the claim area;\n\n (ii) if they did, whether they retained that connection; and\n\n (iii) if they retained their connection, what (if any) rights or interests would be available to the appellants if a \ndetermination of native title were to be made in their favour.  The name or concept used by the appellants to \ndescribe those who had rights in accordance with traditional laws and customs in the claim area in De Rose was \nNguraritja. The trial judge found this concept signified someone who belongs to a place, a traditional owner or \ncustodian. At [40], the Full Court outlined the approach of the trial judge:The primary judge accepted (at [99]) the \n\u201coverwhelming thrust of the claimants\u2019 evidence\u201d that it was the Nguraritja who were the traditional owners: they had \n\n\n\nthe rights and responsibilities in relation to the land. He explained (at [100]) the concept of Nguraritja in relation to \nparticular places as follows:Many Aboriginal witnesses identified themselves as being Nguraritja with respect to \nnamed locations. Their evidence leads me to conclude that the correct approach to the concept of \u201cNguraritja\u201d is to \naccept that a person is Nguraritja for a particular place or places \u2013 not Nguraritja for a larger area which includes \nthat or those places. Thus Owen Kunmanara said that he was Nguraritja for Yuta [a location on De Rose Hill \nStation] \u2013 notNguraritja for the Station. Mr Whitington [senior counsel for the Fullers] submitted, and in my opinion, \ncorrectly so, that the Aboriginal concept of territory is a \u201cconstellation\u201d of locations, often along a Dreaming track for \nwhich those who are Nguraritja have responsibility. For example, Peter De Rose said that his land extended from \nYura to Arapa, along the Malu(kangaroo) Dreaming track. It would not, in my opinion be appropriate to use that \npassage in his evidence as a basis for asserting that Peter thereby claimed to be Nguraritja for the whole of the \nland that is represented by De Rose Hill Station. That, however, is not to say that the role of Nguraritjais limited to \nisolated locations. For example, a person could be Nguraritjafor a creek, or a part of a creek. An example was the \nkaru-karu(watercourse) at Apu Maru, which was said to be the path that the Malu, Kanyala and Tjurki took as they \ntravelled across the landscape. Although taken in closed session, it was made clear that women and children would \nknow that fact. There was, unfortunately, no evidence led as to how far that watercourse went, but the implication is \nthat it would not be a short distance and a perusal of the map, Ex A2, suggests that there would be no difficulty in \nfinding a path through the watercourse joining most, if not all of the Malu sites on De Rose Hill Station. I am \nprepared to accept that Peter is Nguraritja for the watercourse and that he conceptualised it as more than a mere \npoint. It would probably be an important part of the Tjukurpa to protect.  As the Full Court observed at [41], one of \nthe critical issues at trial was the identification of the Aboriginal people whose traditional laws and customs related \nto the claim area at sovereignty, and at the date of judgment \u2013 a \u201ccomplex\u201d task, as the Full Court described it. The \ncontention put by the respondents was that the only people capable of claiming native title rights and interests in \nrelation to the claim area were descendants of the Antikirinya people. These were the people the respondents \ncontended occupied the claim area, probably at sovereignty but at least until the early part of the twentieth century. \nThey contended the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara peoples (those being the groups with whom the appellants \nidentified) were recent migrants from the west of the claim area particularly during the early part of the twentieth \ncentury. This, they said, precluded the appellants from claiming native title rights and interests because native title \ncan only be claimed by descendants of the community or group that possessed such rights and interests at \nsovereignty. The appellants, as predominantly if not entirely the descendants of migrants, therefore could not \nsucceed in their native title claim.  The trial judge found (and the parties accepted by final submissions) that the \nclaim area had been occupied by Aboriginal people prior to sovereignty. His Honour further found that \narchaeological remains within the claim area were those of Western Desert Bloc Aboriginals, although it was not \npossible from the evidence to tell whether they were Yankunytjatjara, Antikirinya or Pitjantjatjara. The evidence \nsuggested Pitjantjatjara people had come from the west, however there was no evidence that the Yankunytjatjara \nhad come from the west. At [53]-[55], the Full Court then summarised the trial judge\u2019s critical conclusion, having \nfound there had been migratory movements of people from the west:Later in the judgment, the primary judge again \nrecorded that migratory movements from the west had occurred at different times for different reasons. He found \nthat on occasions this had led to fighting between the Pitjantjatjara people and the Yankunytjatjara people. He did \nnot see (at [316]):... why these events should not be treated as part of the social and cultural history of the \nAboriginal people. Since wars (perhaps better described as tribal disputes), droughts and the search for brides were \npart of their lives, it is permissible, in my opinion, to accept such migratory movements as traditional. There is no \nneed for native title claimants to establish strict biological descent back to the time of sovereignty.The primary judge \nnoted the appellants\u2019 submission that they needed only to establish that they were descended from people from the \nwider Western Desert region and that those people followed traditional laws and customs. His Honour accepted that \nsince (as he found) under traditional law and custom acquisition of land in this region is not solely the product of \ntransmission through biological descendants, the appellants did not have to show biological descent from those \ninhabiting the claim area at sovereignty. He also accepted, in an important finding (at [345]), that the traditional laws \nand customs that once applied to the claim area \u201cwere essentially the same as those of the Western Desert region\u201d. \nBut his Honour was not prepared to make such a \u201cbroad-based finding\u201d as that sought by the appellants, \napparently a reference to the appellants\u2019 contention that they had only to show descent from Western Desert people \nwho followed traditional laws and customs. His Honour considered (at [345]) that:Although it is not necessary for \nthe claimants to prove biological descent from those who occupied the land at the time of sovereignty, I do feel that \nthere has to be some continuity \u2013 even though it might be through migration, marriage or even tribal dispute \u2013 \n\n\n\nbetween those who formerly occupied the land at sovereignty and the present claimants.The primary judge found \n(at [346]) that there was the requisite degree of continuity:The evidence in this case has disclosed that many of the \nclaimants or their parents or grandparents had migrated to the claim area from the west. It would be reasonable to \nconclude that the archaeological remains within the claim area which were identified by Professor Veth are those of \nWestern Desert Bloc Aboriginals. The next and more difficult question is whether those Anangu followed the same \ntraditional laws and customs as the claimants\u2019 ancestors and as the claimants do today? Even though the evidence \nhas not disclosed a biological connection between the claimants and those who inhabited the area pre-sovereignty, \nthere was evidence that, in my opinion, was sufficient to establish a form of connection between the claimants and \nthose Aboriginal people who occupied the land pre-sovereignty. It was a connection that was achieved through a \nprocess of incorporation that reflected the pattern of migratory movements.  One particular finding of the trial judge, \nwhich resonates with the terms of the applicant\u2019s case in this proceeding is reproduced in the Full Court\u2019s reasons \nat [221]:He also found (at [897]) that there would:be nothing offensive or contradictory to there being a substantial \ndegree of ancestral connection if the traditional laws and customs allowed for adoption or allowed for a person to be \n\u201cincorporated\u201d into the status of Nguraritja because of his or her long association with the land or because of his or \nher geographical and religious knowledge of the land.  Despite accepting this aspect of the appellants\u2019 arguments, \nas the Full Court set out at [5], the trial judge ultimately found that although native title had once existed in respect \nof the claim area, the appellants, and the other persons for whom they claimed native title in relation to the claim \narea, had failed to prove that \u201cthey have retained a connection to the claim area by traditional laws and customs \nacknowledged and observed by them sufficient to satisfy s 223(1)(b) [of the NT Act]\u201d. His Honour decided that \n\u201cthose claimants who once had a relevant connection with the claim area have all abandoned that prior connection\u201d. \nThis aspect of De Rose is not relevant to the present proceeding: the State does not suggest there has been any \n\u201cabandonment\u201d.  It is worthwhile recounting the nature of the arguments put on appeal by the State (described by \nthe Full Court at [220]-[226]), before turning to the reasoning of the Full Court about the trial judge\u2019s findings \nconcerning movement of ancestors of claim group members into the claim area in De Rose. One proposition was \nthat the historical fact of population shifts (at [222]):... did not lead inexorably to the normative proposition that \ntraditional laws or customs recognised the expanded Nguraritja rules. It was necessary for the appellants to \ndemonstrate that the traditional laws and customs of the Aboriginal people allowed for the transmission of native \ntitle rights and interests in accordance with the rules identified by the primary Judge for determining who were to be \nregarded as Nguraritja for particular country or sites.  The State\u2019s submissions in De Rose also emphasised the \nneed for \u201ctransmission\u201d of native title rights and interests, given the absence of any biological connection between \nthe claimants and the original inhabitants of the area. The State contended there was no evidence of any such \ntraditional \u201crules\u201d allowing for such transmission. This was especially so since the \u201cmigrants\u201d had arrived at different \ntimes, from different places, and had moved for a variety of reasons \u2013 searching for food, seeking out missions for \nsustenance and shelter, and visiting relatives. There was criticism of the trial judge\u2019s findings that people could be \nNguraritja for particular sites or tracks through rules which were so broad \u201cas to be hardly rules at all\u201d. Rather, what \nwas required, the State submitted, was that \u201cappellants were required to be substantially connected by descent with \nthe pre-sovereignty community of the claim area: that is, the community of persons who were Nguraritja for the \nclaim area at the time of acquisition of sovereignty\u201d: see the Full Court\u2019s reasons at [226] (emphasis added).  At \n[231], the Full Court explained the correct way to approach what the claimants had to prove, an explanation which \nhas some significance for the present proceeding:As Ward (HC) makes clear (at [18]), in any given case it is \nnecessary for the claimants to identify the traditional laws and customs under which native title rights and interests \nare said to be possessed. The appellants did this by identifying the traditional laws and customs as those of the \nWestern Desert Bloc. They did not suggest that the traditional laws and customs were those acknowledged and \nobserved by a specific dialect group or clan within the Western Desert society. In particular, their claim was not \nfounded on traditional laws and customs unique to the Aboriginal people occupying the claim area at sovereignty. \nRather, the appellants contended that the original holders of native title rights and interests in relation to the claim \narea held their interests by virtue of the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc and that they (the \nappellants) were acknowledged by those traditional laws and customs as the successors to the original native title \nholders by virtue of their status as Nguraritja for sites and tracks in the claim area.  The difference between a \nsituation of \u201cusurpation\u201d, or \u201crevival\u201d, and what was required by s 223(1) was also set out by the Full Court (at \n[233]):To satisfy s 223(1)(a) of the NTA the appellants had to show that under the traditional laws and customs of \nthe Western Desert Bloc they possessed rights and interests in relation to the claim area. It was not enough for \nthem to show that they had purported to acknowledge or observe the traditional laws or customs of the Western \n\n\n\nDesert Bloc. If, for example, the appellants had been \u201cusurpers\u201d of the claim area, who were not recognised under \nthe laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc as capable of possessing native title rights and interests, their \nclaim could not succeed. This would be so even though they might have genuinely been attempting to act in \nconformity with their understanding of the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc. Just as the \nYorta Yorta claimants failed notwithstanding that they had genuinely attempted \u201cto revive the lost culture of their \nancestors\u201d (Yorta Yorta (HC) at [69]), the appellants\u2019 claim would fail unless they could show that any rights or \ninterests asserted by them were derived from the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc and that \nthe Western Desert society had continued since sovereignty.  The fallacy in the respondents\u2019 submissions about the \nneed for a biological connection was exposed at [236]-[237] of the Full Court\u2019s reasons:By the same token, it was \nnot necessary for the appellants to show that they had biological or other links with the particular group of \nAboriginal people who held native title over the claim area at sovereignty, other than those required by traditional \nlaws and customs to establish that a person had acquired the status of Nguraritja for the claim area. There was no \nsuggestion in the present case that the Western Desert Bloc society had ceased to exist at any time between \nEuropean settlement and the trial. Nor was it suggested that the appellants themselves, whether or not they \nconstituted a discrete social, communal or political group, were not members of that society. Moreover, the \nrespondents did not challenge the primary judge\u2019s finding that the traditional laws and customs asserted by the \nappellants were essentially the same as those that existed throughout the Western Desert region (at [102]).\n\n The critical question was whether the appellants possessed rights and interests in the claim area under the \ntraditional laws acknowledged and customs observed of the Western Desert Bloc. If by those traditional laws and \ncustoms the appellants had sufficient links to the original native title holders as to acquire the status of Nguraritja for \nthe claim area, that would be enough, provided that they retained, by those laws and customs, a connection with \nthe claim area.  This was not to discount the significance of the fact of population shifts in the claimants and their \nancestors, and its effect on what the claimants had to prove. The Full Court made it very clear that, in \ncircumstances where the evidence disclosed population shifts and movements into a claim area post-sovereignty, \ncertain matters needed to be established by the evidence. It set out what those matters were at [239]:Unless \nAboriginal people coming to the claim area from the west could ultimately be recognised under Western Desert \ntraditional laws and customs as Nguraritja for sites or tracks within that area, they could not succeed in a native title \nclaim (at least not one founded on their status as Nguraritja). Similarly, their descendants could not succeed in \nsuch a claim in the absence of a traditional law or custom recognising descendants of \u201cmigrants\u201d as Nguraritja for \ncountry on which, or near where, they were born. The significance of the approach taken by the traditional laws \nand customs of the Western Desert Bloc to population shifts, for present purposes, lies in the extent to which those \nlaws and customs recognised \u201cnewcomers\u201d or their descendants as Nguraritja for sites or tracks on the claim area.  \nHaving then found that the trial judge did not \u201cexplicitly find that the population shifts that occurred in the early to \nmid twentieth century were recognised by, or were in accordance with, the traditional laws and customs of the \nWestern Desert Bloc, in the sense that newcomers could become Nguraritja for the claim area, depending on the \ncircumstances\u201d, the Full Court held that nevertheless a fair reading of the trial judge\u2019s reasons suggests he intended \nto make a finding to that effect. The Full Court held (at [242]) that the evidence supported such a finding.  In my \nopinion, the approach in De Rose is one which is available on the evidence in this case, and the applicant was \ncorrect to emphasise this authority.  I accept the two key contentions of the applicant in this proceeding to which I \nhave referred. First, that at least some of the ancestors and/or family members of the claim group members (Ada \nBeaman, Biddy Foley (or Nyuringka), Koyl (or Jinguru), Rosie Jones (or Tjulyitjutu), Waiya, Jumbo Harris (or \nTjampula), Mickey Warren and Ruby Shay) interacted with the Aboriginal people who were in occupation of the \nclaim area at sovereignty, and were themselves in and around the claim area at or before 1912. These are some of \nthe people the claimant witnesses identify as their \u201cold people\u201d and who passed knowledge to them about the \nTjukurrpa. Second, that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors were able to pass on knowledge because they shared, \nwith the original occupants, traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert. Both these characteristics meant, \nin my opinion, that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors were recognised as able to acquire rights and interests in \nthe claim area.\n\nKnown violence against, and between, Aboriginal people  This is an important historical fact, which assumes some \nrelevance as part of the explanation for some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors moving in from certain areas \n\n\n\nto the east of the claim area. Dr Sackett\u2019s supplementary report deals in some detail with these matters.  A number \nof claimant witnesses described their understanding of why their ancestors had moved from areas further to the \neast of the claim area \u2013 principally, the Wongawol and Darlot areas \u2013 into the claim area.  Ms Wonyabong\u2019s \nevidence was:My grandparents were on Wongawol station, but came to Barwidgee, to Mount Vernon, a place on \nBarwidgee station, because they got frightened. A whitefella named Tommy Mellon was shooting some Aboriginal \npeople on Wongawol station. I think that was my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side. A lot of old people was talking \nabout that.  Mr James gave similar evidence about what his father (who was born in the early 1920s) and a number \nof other old people (now deceased) told him:There was a pastoralist there, he was not a good man. He committed \natrocities and shootings, they spoke about a well where babies were thrown down and got killed there.\n\n ... Dad used to tell me that his mum would try and run away with him and his sister quite often from Wongawol. On \na number of occasions she was dragged back by the pastoralist. In those days during the war era, people couldn\u2019t \nmove out of stations if they were designated to a specific station. She is buried in Wiluna.\n\n ...\n\n When my father was about eight or nine he ran away from Wongawol station and came to Albion and then spent \nmost of his life until his late 50s/early 60s there. He didn\u2019t go straight to Albion, but he went to that particular region. \nThere were a few people from that area, that Wongawol area that he went with.\n\n ...\n\n Since I was a kid I heard about the migration aspect of some of the families who came from around Wongawol \nstation to this claim area and the group of people associated with that.  Mr Allan Ashwin described how he had \nbeen told that this violence was aided and abetted by an Aboriginal man named \u201cLockie\u201d:He was from Wongawol, \nand he used to go around shooting his own people with the whitefellas. They caught him at Mt Gray [which is to the \neast of the eastern claim boundary, north of Yandal] he went for a holiday over there and my old tjamu, uncle \nMarakutju\u2019s [Norman Thompson] father, and Jimmy Wongawol they got up and chased him with a spear and he \ntook off. They couldn\u2019t catch up to him and he went back to Wongawol and was protected there. They ended up \ngetting him when he got older, they killed him in the 60s.  Ms Geraldine Hogarth recounted how one of her nanna\u2019s \ncousins was \u201cbranded\u201d with a Wongawol sign, the suggestion being Tommy Mellon was responsible for such \npractices. As I note below, branding of Aboriginal people was one of the allegations which caused police at the time \nto investigate Mellon\u2019s activities at Wongawol.  The evidence from some of these same witnesses about how their \nancestors came to move from Wongawol and Darlot is, in my opinion, significant in considering the nature of this \nmovement, and the connection between those people and the land in the claim area.  There are historical reports of \nviolence against, and between, Aboriginal people occurring both in the Wongawol area, and in the Darlot area.  \nViolence between Aboriginal people has been documented in what has been called the \u201cLaverton Tribal Wars\u201d. The \nprincipal source for Dr Sackett\u2019s account of these conflicts in his supplementary report is Bates D, The Passing of \nthe Aborigines: A Lifetime Spent Among the Natives of Australia (John Murray, 1944), but he also relies on the \nmore recent work by Petronella Vaarzon-Morel. The extracts of Vaarzon-Morel\u2019s work quoted by Dr Sackett rely on \nreports of the violence (killings and abductions) concentrated around Laverton and Darlot, although a \u201crevenge \nparty\u201d is recorded as going as far as the Barr Smith Ranges (near Lake Way and Wiluna), before turning back.  The \nviolence appears to have been not only between Aboriginal people, but also directed at prospectors and settlers, \ndue to land being taken and occupied. In the Darlot area, Dr Sackett reproduces accounts from the late 1890s of \nattacks by Aboriginal people on prospectors camping in the area and the spearing of horses. Mr Allan Ashwin gave \na similar account about the spearing of cattle, and then retribution occurring by way of Aboriginal people being shot.  \nIn the Wongawol area, the principal culprit nominated by claimant witnesses was Tommy Mellon. However, Dr \nSackett notes in his supplementary report that contemporaneous evidence of Mellon\u2019s activities is not as strong. He \nsays:In my opinion, if indeed violence, or the threat of violence, caused some claim ancestors to move to the Tjiwarl \nClaim area, (independent) evidence regarding violence comes across stronger for the Darlot area than it does for \nthe Wongawol area. It is true there were concerns raised, eg by Mount Margaret Missionary Rod Schenk (1934), \n\n\n\nabout the behaviour of Mellon and his fellows. And a CIB Sergeant travelled from Perth to Wongawol to investigate \nstories of Mellon and other white stockmen fathering children with Aboriginal and part-Aboriginal women, supplying \nliquor to Aborigines, branding an Aboriginal man, and shooting Aborigines. In the end, though, Mellon could only be \ncharged with three counts of \u201csupplying intoxicating liquor to aborigines on Wongawol\u201d (Detective Sergeant 1935).  \nThe claimant evidence was certainly very clear, and consistent, in terms of what they had been told about the \nreasons for their ancestors moving further west from areas such as Wongawol and Darlot. Dr Sackett emphasises \nthat the evidence is stronger in relation to Darlot than Wongawol:In my opinion, if indeed violence, or the threat of \nviolence, caused some claim ancestors to move to the Tjiwarl Claim area, (independent) evidence regarding \nviolence comes across stronger for the Darlot area than it does for the Wongawol area. It is true there were \nconcerns raised, eg by Mount Margaret Missionary Rod Schenk (1934), about the behaviour of Mellon and his \nfellows. And a CIB Sergeant travelled from Perth to Wongawol to investigate stories of Mellon and other white \nstockmen fathering children with Aboriginal and part-Aboriginal women, supplying liquor to Aborigines, branding an \nAboriginal man, and shooting Aborigines. In the end, though, Mellon could only be charged with three counts of \n\u201csupplying intoxicating liquor to aborigines on Wongawol\u201d (Detective Sergeant 1935).  I am prepared to accept the \nevidence from some of the claimant witnesses that the violence of pastoralists, and in particular Tommy Mellon, \nwas one of the principal explanations given within their families for the movement of their ancestors down from \nWongawol and into the claim area. I am also prepared to accept their evidence that experiences and risks of \nongoing violence in other areas (such as Darlot, and including between Aboriginal people) were also given as \nexplanations for the movement into the claim area. There is nothing at all implausible in this evidence. It is not \nnecessary to make findings of fact about the actual levels of violence or whether this was the only reason people \nmoved. It is likely, as I note elsewhere, that people moved for a variety of reasons, and from this historical distance \none could never confidently ascribe, or describe, the full nature and extent of those reasons. Nor is it necessary to \ndo so.  There remains however, other evidence about presence and movement in the claim area around or before \n1912 by claim group members\u2019 ancestors, or family members. The historical situation was, in my opinion, fluid and \ncomplex, rather than one-dimensional. Some of the historical situation remains unexplained. It is certainly not as \nsimple as some kind of uniform migration of all apical ancestors into the claim area, at about the same time, and for \nthe same reasons. The State\u2019s submissions tended to encourage acceptance of such a uniform historical \nexplanation. In my opinion the evidence does not bear this out.\n\nPresence and movement into the claim area  As I noted in the section of these reasons dealing with the ancestors \nof each of the claimant witnesses, and the evidence about the apical ancestors, the position about occupation of the \nclaim area in the early twentieth century, and the turn of the twentieth century, is not as clear cut as either of the \nparties\u2019 respective cases might have at first suggested. In my opinion, not only were some of the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors in the claim area at the time of Ms Bates\u2019 writings (and some for some time before), but it is \nalso likely that some of them may have been in the claim area closer to sovereignty itself, or certainly during first \nwhite settlement of the Goldfields area. This supports my conclusion that the claim area is, on the balance of \nprobabilities, Western Desert country.  It is also my finding that some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors \nmoved into the claim area at times where they had the opportunity to acquire knowledge from, and be recognised \nby, some of the Western Desert people who had occupied the claim area, and lands around the claim area, at \nsovereignty. Indeed, some of the claim group members had family connections to such people, such as Ms \nTullock\u2019s connection to Koyl. Ms Tullock\u2019s evidence places her \u201cuncle\u201d Koyl in the claim area at the time Ms Bates \nwas conducting research. In the case of Ms Luxie Hogarth, her evidence was that Waiya had responsibility for the \nsite of Pii within the claim area, and that was something well recognised in the 1960s, when Waiya would have \nbeen an old man. That is why, in my opinion, the picture about the relationship between the members of the claim \ngroup and the \u201coriginal\u201d occupants of the claim area is not of the binary nature the State suggests, and the \napplicant \u2013 at least at the outset \u2013 also appeared to concede.  An example of a variation on this is evidence is \nwhere Mr Richard Narrier\u2019s grandfather used to walk between Mungkali, Barwidgee, Weebo, Darlot and the claim \narea. That is a considerable distance of many hundreds of kilometres; however, it demonstrates that for some of the \nclaimant families, their connections were direct, and traditionally based.  The movement of people from time to time \nand the use of multiple pathways to acquire rights in the claim area has resulted in different family groups reporting \ndifferent time lines, and different histories, although what unites them is their shared laws and customs connecting \nto the land and waters in the claim area.\n\n\n\nEvidence of knowledge and interaction  Several claimant witnesses gave evidence about apparent interaction \nbetween their ancestors and people occupying land in and around the claim area. I say \u201caround\u201d to refer to area \ngeographically close to the claim boundary, given that three of the four boundaries are artificial, as I have noted \nelsewhere.  Mr Victor Ashwin described his understanding of the interaction between his own ancestors and, in my \nopinion, other Aboriginal people occupying the claim area in the following way. I note his parallel with Wiluna, which \nis accurate when one reads this Court\u2019s reasons for judgment in the determination of the Wiluna claim:The \ncustodians, when they came in from the desert they been give them the right to Wiluna. It\u2019s like giving them the key \nto a house, those old people that belong here they dying out a bit. Those people coming in from the desert they \nalready knew the songs, so the Traditional Owners from here they say that you can look after it now.\n\n This Tjiwarl area has always been western desert. At North Well [which is, broadly, in between Yakabindie and \nAlbion Downs pastoral stations] there used to be old people staying there and there was a law ground there. It was \na stop at North Well between Leonora and Wiluna. From there they would go to Leonora to practice law there. It\u2019s \nthe same law and culture as in Leonora and Wiluna, they had a law ground there at North Well. The old people \ntalked about it \u2013 they tell you all the old people who used to camp here and live here, where they had the law \nceremonies and all that. That\u2019s what the old people tell me.  In this passage, I consider Mr Victor Ashwin is using \n\u201cold people\u201d in two senses. When he describes \u201cold people\u201d staying at the law ground and \u201cold people who used to \ncamp there\u201d, he is referring to Aboriginal people who occupied the claim area before his ancestors. When he says \n\u201cthe old people talked about it\u201d and \u201c[t]hat\u2019s what the old people tell me\u201d, he is referring to his ancestors. In other \nwords, it was his ancestors who told him about the law ground, and about other old people who used to camp at \nthat law ground.  Dr Sackett referred to the use by the claimant witnesses of the term \u201cold people\u201d in the first sense I \nhave described:HER HONOUR: Yes. And so \u2013 and the second part of that question then is:\n\nWhat connections if any do you see out of the evidence between those two groups?\n\n DR SACKETT: Between the original - - -\n\n HER HONOUR: The native title holders in relation to the claimed area at sovereignty and the ancestors of the \nJawal [sic] claimant group. And the answer may be - - -\n\n DR SACKETT: Well, we have statements from claimants and this is not something that is exclusive to this context \nbecause I recorded similar statements elsewhere, Wiluna and so forth, that people say, well, the old people told us. \nAnd the assumption is those old people got that information from somebody else, older people. And there\u2019s a refrain \nin the desert about how things come down through the generations. So those people told my parents, my parents \ntold me and I\u2019m telling my kids, that sort of rendering of the way in which information is received and passed on. As \nI said earlier, the \u2013 there\u2019s a shallow generation reckoning. There\u2019s a real difficulty, at least earlier on, of people \nmentioning, divulging the words, the names of deceased people. So it would be quite conceivable, in my view, that \nthose people that might have learned from somebody like Jingooroo [ie Koyl] but he would not have been recalled \nby today\u2019s claimants or even their parents. \n\n So there were people on the country that taught \u2013 and I can explain that, I think we\u2019ve got another question about \nthat, that explain the country to the ancestors or the claimants and that knowledge has been passed down to the \nclaimants.  Mr James explained in his evidence the longevity and singularity of connection of the claim group \nmembers and their ancestors to the land and waters in the claim area:From my living memory the people that were \nliving in this area had always been there; there was always a connection to this country. I don\u2019t have any other \nmemories that there was any animosity or clash between different groups as regards to ownership. Nowadays, the \nnature of native title has meant that there is a bit more fragmentation in regards to boundaries but my memories of \ngrowing up in the region were that there was never any of this issue. The family groups like, the Narriers, Tullocks, \nHarrises and Beamans had always been there and there was no dispute about where they fitted in.\n\n\n\n My dad never spoke of anyone who came before him for this country but he did say that there were families \naround there at the same time that he moved across to Albion that he knew from Wiluna way.  On the State\u2019s \ncontentions, when a witness such as Mr James says there has \u201calways\u201d been a connection to this country, he does \nnot mean \u201calways\u201d in the sense of since well before white settlement, he means only one (or perhaps two) \ngenerations before him. That is not how I understood witnesses such as Mr James to speak about the claim area. \nThe apparent dichotomy the State seeks to erect between this kind of evidence and provable and reasonably \npermanent settlement in the claim area is a false one. When one looks carefully at evidence such as this from Mr \nJames, he is talking of longevity of connection to country. As I set out elsewhere in these reasons, that connection \n\u2013 through Western Desert laws and customs and in particular through Tjukurrpa \u2013 existed long before the claim \ngroup members\u2019 families came to settle reasonably permanently in the claim area.  Mr James also recounted his \nunderstanding of previous knowledge of the claim area:As a kid living in the region and what I learnt afterwards \nfrom my dad and in conversation with other family members; my understanding is that in the early 1900s there was \na migration of people from east of Wiluna, from the Wongawol station area. What the timeframe of that migration \nwas, I\u2019m not sure, but my understanding is that there was a lot of law business happening over in this claim area \nanyway, so the migration wasn\u2019t such a noticeable thing, because they were often going to that area.The men were \ndoing law business, like the initiated men, the wati\u2019s and the women as well doing their women\u2019s law in certain \nareas. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  In his evidence, Mr Allan Ashwin said:Over in Barwidgee country they used to have places \nover there where they would meet for law time, near Mt Grey or Mt Vernon. They used to have an old meeting \nground where people from way out there, Wongawol and Lorna Glen and even people from this way, Albion Downs \nwould go and meet there.\n\n...  They used to have a lawground at Albion Downs there somewhere, that was before my time. Like near the old \nhomestead, must have been there in my parents\u2019 time because one old fella from Nullagine he came there a long \ntime ago; there\u2019s other places like a meeting ground everywhere.\n\n...  Jigalong, back when they first come in there that was the main law ground there. It\u2019s been that way for \ngenerations and generations. All that tjukurr that goes through here, that mob in Jigalong all know it all the way to \nWarburton side, they know it.  Barwidgee and Mount Grey pastoral stations are both to the east of the claim area, \nBarwidgee being closer to the northern end of the claim boundary and Mount Grey being directly to the east of the \nmiddle of the eastern claim boundary. It might be said that this evidence is equivocal whether Mr Allan Ashwin is \nreferring to law grounds that existed early in his own ancestors\u2019 time in and around the claim area, after they \u201ccame \nin\u201d. However, there was no sense in his oral evidence, when he spoke about these matters, that he was describing \nlaw grounds that had been newly created by his own parents, or grandparents. As he notes about Jigalong, the law \ngrounds relate to the Tjukurrpa in the landscape at particular places \u2013 the same Tjukurrpa that all those in these \nareas shared. During cross-examination, Mr Allan Ashwin said the following about law grounds:MR RANSON: You \nsay: \u201cJigalong, back when they first come in there\u201d \u2013 sorry I\u2019ll start again \u201cJigalong, back when they first come in \nthere that was the main law ground there\u201d. When you say in there \u201cwhen they first come in there\u201d what did you \nmean by that?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Lot of people they\u2019re all from the Western Desert. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: And like when I asked Henry about like law grounds and things like that and how come, you \nknow if they\u2019re from the Western Desert. Well people from the Western Desert all split up. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: And like some come to Wiluna. It\u2019s sort of like that, you know, all split up. \n\n\n\n MR RANSON: Yep. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: From the \u2013 that\u2019s why when they went there they started their law ground there when they went \nin from the desert, you know. Same like when we\u2019re at our law ground at claypan and when they come in from like \npeople that came in from out of the desert and joined our group then they turned around at Bondini you know, that \nwas lately, that was afterwards, you know. \n\n MR RANSON: Okay. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: And like I say, you know, like they had law grounds everywhere and it\u2019s not \u2013 what I\u2019m saying \nabout the main law grounds nowadays, you know, that\u2019s all the law grounds that\u2019s around nowadays. Cause like \nyou go to - - - \n\n MR RANSON: Jigalong\u2019s a big one now isn\u2019t it?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: - - - you go to Mount Newman there\u2019s nothing there. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Same like Leonora, there\u2019s nothing there. Kalgoorlie there\u2019s nothing, Laverton there\u2019s nothing. \nWiluna we got a law ground there. You know, like all the other old law grounds are all closed down we\u2019ve only got \ncertain places like Warburton Ranges, you know. Out at Warburton they\u2019ve got a law ground there and we\u2019ve got a \nlaw ground here, you know.\n\n MR RANSON: So - - -\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Even Kwinana, you know, people they even go from Wiluna or even from Jigalong to Kwinana. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. So is it - - -\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Like this last time, you know, like people they send the young fellas right through to across the \nborder, you know. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: South Australian border. Border mob back to Wiluna. \n\n MR RANSON: Can I ask you this: so these days there\u2019s not so many. There\u2019s a few big ones these days?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Yeah. \n\n MR RANSON: In the old days there were lots of little ones?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Yeah. \n\n MR RANSON: And that\u2019s what\u2019s changed?\n\n\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Yep.\n\n MR RANSON: And those people, those Western Desert people, when you say they came into Jigalong and \nWiluna, why was the reason that they were moving \u2013 have you ever heard what reason were they coming in for?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Well people were getting them and bringing them into civilisation, you know. \n\n MR RANSON: Yeah. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Like you go out there, like my father-in-law now Freddie Freddie he\u2019s the one that bought that \nlast \u2013 the last of the nomads you know like even when they bought them back in there. \n\n MR RANSON: Yes I\u2019ve heard a bit about that. \n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Like that now \u2013 and even like \u2013 talk about like \u2013 we got \u2013 like me and Henry and us now like our \ngrandmother on mum\u2019s side, one of her sisters ended up in Balgo, you know.  In his witness statement, Mr Brett \nLewis said the following about the law grounds at Booylgoo and Depot Springs:The law grounds at Booylgoo and \nDepot Springs are old. My father said that they were old before his time. It was the same law, but those places told \na different story, about what relates to that country, like what\u2019s the story behind that creek or that cave. Other laws \ncome down from other places. In my father\u2019s day they preferred to do what they had to do and move on.  Later on in \nhis witness statement, Mr Lewis explained how he learned about law grounds and other sites.All the sites that I had \nbeen shown \u2013 rockholes, law grounds, the springs at Pulyku, Depot Springs, Kaluwiri and Calulyu station. I grew up \nall around that area and it\u2019s where my dad travelled up and down. My dad taught me about the sites and places in \nthis area, and he learnt it from his father and fathers before him and so on from there. It was all handed down like \nthat.  On the two law grounds around Booylgoo Range, he said the following:There are two law grounds are \nBooylgoo Ranges.\n\n The first one is north of the homestead from Booylgoo Ranges. That law ground was last used in the early 1950s. \nMy dad went through with a mob from Kaluwiri to take them through the law there. There was a big mustering \ncamp, and there were some young men who needed to go through a certain stage of the law there. My dad would \nlook after that place. He would make sure that it was ready for the ceremonies. I went there a couple of years ago \nto have a look and I go through there and look after it now. I have a look around but I don\u2019t go often as I would like. \n\n I first went to that law ground with my father in the 1960s. There\u2019s drinking water there and a camping ground \nwhere you can see grinding stones from the old people. Up from the water there is the law ground. It\u2019s a fair-size \nlaw ground. People came from Leonora, coming through the east heading north-west. It\u2019s part of the different areas \nof their ceremonies. Women can\u2019t go to that law ground. \n\n The second law ground is nearby to the first law ground. It is right in the hills of the Booylgoo Ranges, and is hard \nto get to. I went through there with a motorbike a long time ago.\n\nEvidence of shared traditional laws and customs: acquisition of rights and interests  I have accepted Dr Sackett\u2019s \nopinion that there were multiple pathways through which the claim group members, and their apical ancestors, \nidentified possible ways of acquiring rights to country. In his Tjiwarl Registration Report, he reports accounts that \nhad been given from some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors, who have now died. Although his report does \nnot make it clear, the form of these accounts appears to come from earlier proceedings. Dr Sackett has made \nsome commentary in square brackets.As regards the Tjiwarl claim area, claimants similarly pressed claims based \non Western Desert law and custom. In this regard, after naming places she claimed were in her country, \n\n\n\nTjampula/Jumbo\u2019s daughter, Cecily Harris... said:CECILY HARRIS: I say that\u2019s always been my country. That\u2019s \nwhere we roamed.226;128;\n\n MR O\u2019DEA: Where you roamed.226;128;\n\n CECILY HARRIS: When we were little kids and all. \n\n MR O\u2019DEA: Yes. And are there any other reasons?226;128;\n\n CECILY HARRIS: Mostly because we was all born around that area too.226;128;\n\n MR O\u2019DEA: Born; right. And were any of your other relatives born there? \n\n CECILY HARRIS: Oh well, Gary [this undoubtedly should be Gay, as in her sister Gay Harris] was born in Wildara, \nLes [her brother Les Harris] in Weebo, James [her brother James Harris] in Lawlers. \n\n Cecily... also indicated, \u201cThat\u2019s my run. I\u2019ve always been there, and I\u2019ll go there, I make it there every year, all the \ntime, you know, the first chance I go, I just go straight there, to them places.\u201dGay Harris... another of \nTjampula/Jumbo\u2019s daughters, noted:GAY HARRIS: No. My country is where my brother and sisters are born and \nwe \u2013 me and my sister Cecily always live in the area. ...\n\n MR WALKER: Okay. Where is your manta [country]?226;128;\n\n GAY HARRIS: My manta I believe it\u2019s right in Wildara where I was born.Named apical Nimpurru/Spider Narrier\u2019s \ndaughter\u2019s daughter, Adeline Narrier, was asked and replied:MR VINER: And why is that your country?226;128;\n\n ADELINE HENNESSEY: Well, we been walking through and they used to carry me right through and we used to \nwalk. We had no motor car, nothing, and when we went to Leinster, we got a cart and horse then. That\u2019s how we do \nour mill runs through that - - -226;128;\n\n MR VINER: Now, did the \u2013 did your Mum and Dad or the old people tell you why that\u2019s your country? Does \nanything Aboriginal way tell you what is your country?226;128;\n\n ADELINE HENNESSEY: Yes, Mum would talk about it but we don\u2019t talk Dad\u2019s because we never been there at his \nplace \u2013 Laverton. I go now and again, but I don\u2019t go and stop there.226;128;\n\n MR VINER: So, what did your Mum tell you about why this was your country?\n\n ADELINE HENNESSEY: Well, she lived here \u2013 living in Mount Sir Samuel when she was younger. She walked to \nWiluna, then she walked back, got me [became pregnant with Adeline]. I was born in Wiluna, then she walked back \ncarrying me. And she worked at the mine and the hotel, then she \u2013 when they shift \u2013 close that mine down, they \ncome to Leinster ... and we lived there then with the Whites [ie a family with the surname of White].  This led Dr \nSackett to conclude (at [40] of his Tjiwarl Registration Report):These and other claimants said their country was \nwhere they were found or dreamed, where they had been born, where they roamed around as children, and where \nthey consistently returned. As evident in Adeline\u2019s account, however, things did not stop with these sorts of links. In \n\n\n\naddition, many claimants, essentially the many younger claimants, made descent based claims. These claimants \ndid not themselves have the sorts of personal linkages to the Tjiwarl area noted above; rather they traced their \nlinkages to the claim area through antecedents who were said to have been conceived or born or raised or had long \nlived in the claim area countryside.  He gave as one example of a descent-based claim what he had been told by \nMr Bingham, who also gave evidence in this proceeding:Douglas Bingham ... son of named apical Kathleen \nBingham, when asked why he was a claimant, responded \u201cWell my mother bin born there\u201d.  However, Dr Sackett \nalso filled out this part of his report with examples from some of the current claim group members, such as Mr Allan \nAshwin, Ms Wonyabong, Mr Lewis and Mr James. All of the accounts given by these people demonstrated, in Dr \nSackett\u2019s opinion, that birth on country, long association (including through one\u2019s parents and grandparents) and \nspending time on country learning about laws and customs related to that land were all ways in which rights were \nacquired. To give one example from Dr Sackett\u2019s first report:Dempsey James claimed country from \u201cWongawol \ndown towards Lawlers\u201d through his mother\u2019s mother\u2019s, ie Biddie\u2019s, Wongawol associations, his mother\u2019s, ie \nTjilu/Fannie James\u2019, birth north of Agnew/Lawlers, and his own birth, on the Wiluna to Wongawol Road, and his \nlong personal experience on country, principally Albion Downs and Yeelirrie. Dempsey\u2019s son, Allan James, \nindicated his claims to the Tjiwarl area were through \u201cmy kaparli (Tjilu) and my father\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause I spent a lot of \nmy childhood there.\u201d  This, Dr Sackett said, was consistent with the pathways which existed under Western Desert \nlaws and customs, the collection of which was broader in nature and content than methods existing under other \nlaws and customs in other parts of Australia \u2013 which may, for example, have been more strictly based on patrilineal \ndescent.  These pathways are to be contrasted with simply \u201croaming\u201d through country, which Dr Sackett explains, \nin a lengthy section in his first report (and by reference to some individuals who made claims in the Wongatha \nproceeding), would not be seen as enough to acquire rights in the country through which people passed:... I am \nnot aware of any instances of such movement, such \u2018roaming\u2019, in and of itself,being or becoming a pathway for \nclaiming country within the Western Desert. Such movement simply was an aspect of life in the harsh environment \nof the desert. \n\n (Emphasis added.)  Dr Sackett later described claims based on \u201croaming\u201d as not based on Western Desert laws \nand customs, but as more in the nature of recent, \u201cambit\u201d claims.  As I have noted earlier in these reasons, in the \nsection on Western Desert laws and customs, one description applied to groups with connection to country is \n\u201cemergent\u201d. I have referred to some of Dr Sackett\u2019s explanations of this in the Western Desert section, but it is \nappropriate to do so again here, because I accept this is the explanation for how the claim group members\u2019 apical \nancestors (and, it would seem, some of their own ancestors and families) acquired rights in the land and waters in \nthe claim area. Of course, it should be recalled that my view of the evidence is that it is sufficient to make it likely \nthat at least some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors were in and very close to the claim area well prior to the \ntime Ms Bates was working north and west of the claim area. Even if that is the case, the multiple pathways to \nrights to country still appear to have been at work. Dr Sackett gave a further description of these pathways in his \noral evidence in the concurrent session:DR SACKETT: Well, I look to the pathways available to people in the \nWestern Desert, and those include learning the country in its physical and metaphysical sense and enacting that. \nParticipating in ritual. And then out of that some people would be born there. There were a couple of ancestors that \nwere born on the plain area nearby. So people move in, learn the country, pass that onto their descendants, kids \nand grandkids, and that in itself \u2013 but I suppose what needs to be understood in my understanding in the Western \nDesert, groups are not given but they\u2019re emergent. Elsewhere in Aboriginal Australia you have like clan groups. It\u2019s \na descent model and you\u2019re either in it or you\u2019re not. In the Western Desert you can join a group through your birth \nor through being on that for a period of time, learning the country, participating in the ritual activities, as I\u2019ve said. \n\n So the groups, in a sense, gain \u2013 potentially gain members through time. Not through birth but through \u2013 pardon \nme. Not through being born into the group but being born of the country or learning the country - - -  Dr Sackett \nreaffirmed this opinion in cross-examination. The extract I set out is from the restricted expert session but its subject \nmatter is not restricted and I see no difficulty in including it in these reasons:MR RANSON: Is it nevertheless the \ncase that for a person in the Western Desert to come to new country, as it were \u2013 to migrate to a different part of \nthe Western Desert, there needs to be acceptance of that person\u2019s rights by the people that are already there? \n\n\n\n DR SACKETT: Certainly, that\u2019s the case, I would imagine. Yes. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t tell them anything. \n\n MR RANSON: Yes. \n\n DR SACKETT: Yes. There would be pre-existing links, I would \u2013 I can only imagine. And from what the claimants \nhave said, their understanding is that their old people were coming down and already knew some of the people. \nThese were not new events.226;128;\n\n MR RANSON: Yes. \n\n DR SACKETT: They were just more permanent arrangements. And remember, there\u2019s only a few of them. There \nare not stacks and stacks of people doing this. \n\n MR RANSON: No\n\n DR SACKETT: It\u2019s just a few ancestors\n\n MR RANSON:226;128;But it\u2019s not the case, for example, that a person could come from, let\u2019s say, a South \nAustralian part of the Western Desert and travel 500 kilometres west to, let\u2019s say, Lake Carnegie, somewhere like \nthat, and perhaps bring their pregnant wife with them and give birth to someone and then just announce that they \nthen own that country. There would have to be acceptance from the people that are there. \n\n DR SACKETT: Well, there \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned Fred Myers before, and he viewed land tenure in the Western Desert \nas large-part politics. And it would depend on the circumstances. If that person from South Australia lived there for a \nnumber of years, the child was conceived and born there, it might be that that child was recognised as part of that \ncountry, because of the commonality in law and custom. \n\n MR RANSON: Yes. \n\n DR SACKETT: Certainly, there\u2019s some minor differences, but they couldn\u2019t come there and articulate some non-\nlocal pathway. For example, it would be unlikely that people from the south of the desert, where umbilical cords \u2013 \nthe place where an umbilical cord falls off is significant in locating your country \u2013 if they went up to the top Builgu \narea and said my son\u2019s umbilical cord dropped off, people there would say so what? It wouldn\u2019t be something that \nthey recognise as a valid pathway. \n\n MR RANSON: Yes. \n\n DR SACKETT: But if a pathway that was valid was articulated, it could be that a person could gain rights and \ninterest in them.  These findings have two particular consequences for the opinions expressed by Dr Brunton in this \nproceeding, on these issues. First, they mean I do not accept the premise of his opinion that there were no \nAboriginal people left in the claim area who had occupied it at sovereignty, or were descended or otherwise \nconnected to people who had occupied the claim area at sovereignty. To the extent that Dr Brunton\u2019s opinions were \nbased on this premise, it is one I have rejected. Accordingly, the appropriate starting point is not that the claim \ngroup members\u2019 ancestors moved into \u201cempty\u201d land (in the sense of Aboriginal occupation) and \u201cimposed\u201d Western \nDesert laws and customs onto the country in the claim area. Thus, Dr Brunton\u2019s opinions in his first report (for \nexample, at [594]) are not ones I accept, as in my opinion the evidence discloses there must be a different starting \n\n\n\npoint or premise to the one he adopts.  Second, I do not accept Dr Brunton\u2019s view that the absence of evidence of \nformal transmission of rights to the claim area means there was no such transmission, nor that the absence of such \nevidence is fatal to the applicant\u2019s claim. This is how Dr Brunton put his difficulty, in his first report, with the \napplicant\u2019s thesis:There is no evidence to suggest that the Ngaiuwonga, a non-Western Desert people, transferred \nrights and interests in estates in the claim area to any Western Desert people before they disappeared through \nmeans that would have been regarded as legitimate in terms of the laws and customs that would have traditionally \napplied to the claim area. The knowledge that the Tjiwarl applicants probably possess about sites and associated \nstories, etc, in the claim area can be explained in terms of attempts by their Western Desert forebears to legitimise \ntheir occupancy of country into which they had migrated. Such attempts, which do not have to be thought of as \ncynical, are likely to have had similarities with interpretative processes that have been described by anthropologists \nstudying Western Desert and other Aboriginal people.  He expressed similar opinions at [157] of his supplementary \nreport:If people outside the WDCB could not take over the country in the claim area, then, given that it is my strong \nopinion that the Ngaiuwonga were not Western Desert people, why should it be thought that the forebears of the \nclaimants were able to say that Ngaiuwonga country had become theirs? I discussed this question in my earlier \nreport, and I think that the statements from Victor Ashwin about the need for a ceremonial transfer of sacra to \nincoming people serve to highlight the significance of the apparent absence of any transfer from the Ngaiuwonga to \nthe claimants\u2019 forebears. The transfer that Mr Ashwin and Ms Tullock were referring to probably occurred in the \n1960s, and involved Scotty Tullock \u2013 who was certainly not a Ngaiuwonga man \u2013 and Mudjon Freddie, a Western \nDesert man from Mungkali. \n\n (References omitted.)  As I have noted, the premise in Dr Brunton\u2019s opinion is one I do not accept. Even if that \npremise is put to one side, I do not accept the conclusion reached by Dr Brunton about lack of transmission.  It is \ntrue, as the State submits in its written submissions, that there is some support in the evidence of some of the \nclaimant witnesses for the need for a formal handover of some kind, through ceremony. The clearest statement of \nthis is in the evidence of Mr Victor Ashwin, who said:You can look after someone else\u2019s country, in our law. In our \nlaw we do it through the law. If the traditional owner of a country thinks \u201cOh, all my mob died out, and I\u2019m the last \none, I\u2019ll give this to these mob coming in\u201d. And they have a ceremony, and a law, and they give it like that. I can\u2019t \ntalk about that in this paper. You got to do the ceremony like when the custodian comes in. It is sort of like how \nwhitefellas sign the paper, giving permission for someone to help you. You\u2019re giving permission for someone to do \nsomething on your land, that\u2019s how it is in our culture. Like signing the land over to the custodians to look after it. \nThe old people will think \u201cIt\u2019s no good me just dying out if I\u2019m the last one\u201d so they will sign it over to someone to \ntake care of and look after the country.  The State appears to accept, as does Dr Brunton, that Mr Victor Ashwin is \ngiving an accurate account of his understanding of what would be required under Western Desert laws and customs \nfor country to be \u201chanded over\u201d in circumstances where there was only one custodian alive, or perhaps a couple of \ncustodians.  Ms Tullock also gave some evidence about how her father handed over responsibility for law business \nin a ceremony at Wiluna, for country around Wiluna, when he decided to take his family to Port Hedland. Ms \nTullock said in cross-examination that she was about 13 or 14 years old at the time. She said:I remember they had \na big law meeting at Wiluna, and I think that might have been the last for a long time. But they might have been \ndoing law secretly after my dad left, cause when he left, he handed the law and culture and all the stuff that he was \ndoing over to Mr Freddy [Freddie Freddy]. He told them he had to go, and take his kids. He told Mr Freddy to take \nover the law for the country around Wiluna. My dad was very passionate about protecting sacred sites.  There was \nalso a discussion about handing over custodianship which took place in the restricted men\u2019s session. As I \nunderstood it, and without revealing matters which should not be revealed, the discussion was more about the \nprocess, and about some of the terminology used. The examples discussed by both Mr Allan Ashwin and Mr Victor \nAshwin were not examples about any handovers of country in the claim area. Mr Allan Ashwin in particular was \nable to discuss the example he did because it occurred in the 1950s, and thus in living memory.  Dr Sackett and Dr \nBrunton also dealt with this issue in the restricted expert evidence session. Dr Brunton gave some examples from \nhis own previous work of country and people where there had been some kind of ritual handing over of country. \nOn questioning, he accepted that both examples (Jigalong and another place so poorly recorded by the transcript \nthat it is unidentifiable) were examples of Western Desert people moving into non-Western Desert areas. Dr Sackett \nsubsequently pointed out that there remains a dispute about the \u201chandover of title\u201d at Jigalong, and he was cross-\nexamined briefly about the nature of that dispute. There are no doubt many nuances in other examples, which were \n\n\n\nnot explored in the brief evidence given in this proceeding about those circumstances.  In relation to Ms Tullock\u2019s \nevidence about the \u201chandover\u201d she had understood occurred with Mr Scotty Tullock and a man called Mudjon (or \nFreddie), Dr Sackett provided an explanation in the restricted session of what was likely to have occurred between \nthe two men. I will say no more than that in these reasons, but in my opinion Dr Sackett\u2019s explanation was \npersuasive. Dr Brunton did not dispute that explanation in relation to Mr Scotty Tullock.  In relation to the evidence \ngiven by Mr Victor Ashwin, this was also the subject of evidence from Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton during this \nrestricted session. There was evidence given by Mr Victor Ashwin about handing over country in his witness \nstatement and in open session, but also in the men\u2019s restricted session. Dr Brunton took some of Mr Victor \nAshwin\u2019s answers to questions literally, and said they showed that where it was intended to \u201chand over\u201d country, \nthere were formal ceremonies. This then contributed to Dr Brunton\u2019s view that an absence of evidence about \ntransmission suggested there was no \u201chand over\u201d in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs.  Without \nmaking any inappropriate disclosures about the restricted expert evidence, or the restricted men\u2019s evidence, it is fair \nto say that Dr Sackett\u2019s explanation for the evidence given by Mr Victor Ashwin was consistent with the view I have \ntaken, and focussed on Mr Ashwin\u2019s age at various points in time. Nevertheless, the thrust of Mr Ashwin\u2019s evidence \nin oral testimony and in the restricted men\u2019s session was consistent with what is in his witness statement, which I \nhave quoted at [689] above.  Dr Sackett\u2019s view of these issues is one I accept. He said (in the restricted expert \nsession but again the subject matter is not in my opinion protected):I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s [transmission of rights, \nthrough ceremony or otherwise] necessary at all. As I said yesterday, it\u2019s my opinion that people become part of the \ncountry through active involvement with it. And as part of that, they would learn about the objects, perhaps make \nsome of the objects that would be part of the country, but there wouldn\u2019t necessarily be any transfer of what might \nbe construed as title or handover of objects, other than outside the context that I spoke about this ... exchanging \nobjects.  That is not to make a finding on the balance of probabilities that there were no such rituals or ceremonies \nconcerning the claim area. There may have been, although none of the claimant witnesses was old enough to give \nany direct, or reasonably direct, evidence about such things. The fact that no one gave positive evidence about \nsuch rituals or ceremonies is of some weight, but is not conclusive in proving a negative.  In that sense there is no \nnecessary inconsistency between Mr Victor Ashwin\u2019s evidence and Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion.\n\nEvidence of shared traditional laws and customs: Tjukurrpa  I consider that the evidence given by some of the claim \ngroup members about the way their ancestors came into the claim area, following Tjukurrpa paths, supports my \nconclusions. This is another example of how central the claim group members\u2019 accounts of Tjukurrpa are to the \nviews I have taken of the evidence and argument in this proceeding. I do not accept that these accounts are \nconstructed, or \u201cimposed\u201d, or whatever description one chooses to apply. As Mr Victor Ashwin said, \u201cthe Tjukurrpa \nis the country\u201d: to reject the claimant evidence on this does involve, in my opinion, finding that the claim group \nmembers (and their parents and grandparents before them) have made up these dreamtime accounts, or adapted \nthem in some wholly untraditional way. I do not accept that is the case.  There are two aspects to the claim group \nmembers\u2019 evidence on this matter, both of which are addressed by Dr Sackett in his supplementary report. The first \nconsists of accounts about how some of the claim group members\u2019 families moved into the Tjiwarl area by following \nTjukurrpa tracks. The second consists of accounts of how the Tjukurrpa travels through and connects areas to the \neast (and north) with the claim area.  Mr Muir also gave some evidence about his mother, Ms Dolly Walker, as a \nyoung child moving through country to the east following Tjukurrpa that come into the claim area:They moved \naround following ceremonies even my mum was a little girl, walking from Mulga Queen through Croft, north of \nDarlot, using a yiwarra [a traditional track] that goes through Henry\u2019s Well and Townsend Well. That\u2019s really the \nwalking journey that people took into this claim. That\u2019s the yiwarra, the pathways. Following the dragonfly, the \nTjiinkuna dreaming.  The two places Mr Muir refers to \u2013 Henry\u2019s Well and Townsend Well \u2013 are both in the eastern \npart of the claim area, just north of Mount Sir Samuel, and south-east of Yakabindie station homestead. This \nevidence is also an illustration of how the Tjukurrpa travel into the claim area, connecting the country with country \nfurther to the east.  The way the Tjukurrpa travel and connect country is further illustrated by the following \nevidence.  Although it might well be said that he was surmising, rather than speaking from direct knowledge, or \neven from information handed down to him, the way Mr Victor Ashwin described the connection the Tjukurrpa \nprovided for the claim group members\u2019 ancestors between the land they came from and the land they settled in, is \nan apt description. It is apt because it locates the Tjukurrpa centrally as the evidence of shared traditional laws and \ncustoms between those Aboriginal people who occupied the claim area and its surrounds at sovereignty, and the \nclaim group members\u2019 ancestors:In most of the cases, the old people already know about the tjukurrpa. Even \n\n\n\nthough they\u2019re from the desert, they\u2019ve still been singing about this tjukurrpa, and they know it already. Some time, \nwhen they\u2019re coming from the desert and they see the country for the first time, they think to themself \u2018oh this is \nwhat we were singing about all them years, this water and this hill\u2019.\n\n Most of the tjukurrpa in the Tjiwarl area, people sing about it right through, and they know the songs although they \ndon\u2019t know where the country is.  Ms Narrier gave some vivid evidence about how the Tjukurrpa in the landscape \nlinked country. She also explained in clear terms how the translation of the Tjukurrpa into English, and then into a \nname for a geographic feature, has made the connection less obvious:That Booylgoo Ranges [which are in the \nsouth-western corner of the claim area], that\u2019s my dreaming right there, my tjukurr. The story for that country \ncomes from the tjukurrpa; it\u2019s in my mind, about this tjukurrpa. It\u2019s an old story taught to me by my mother. She \ntaught me this story as I was growing up.\n\n The Booylgoo Ranges are the leg of a kangaroo, lying in the country. The two old people, a woman and a man, \nwere walking along, and they had kangaroo meat and bush potato seeds with them. They were gnawing on the leg \nof the kangaroo \u2013 junta[thigh] they call it. A crow man was following them, wanting the meat. The crow man is the \nson-in-law for those two people walking, and the woman is not allowed to talk to the son-in-law, because he\u2019s \nwrong for her skin group way. He\u2019s just following them, and he can\u2019t ask for the meat, but they getting sick of him \nfollowing them.\n\n The people got sick of that crow man, and so they scattered out the seeds and they dropped the meat. They had \nthe seeds in a carrying dish, like a little dish on her head, and they must have got sick of the crow annoying them \nfor that meat, so they scattered those seeds. The Booylgoo Ranges are the leg of the kangaroo, lying down. On the \nmap it is marked Booylgoo Ranges, but really the word is pulyku [sinew] \u2013 that means the sinew of the kangaroo.\n\n The two old people are the tjukurrpa, and they traveled from Wongawol, from the north-east of the Tjiwarl area. \nBecause the Booylgoo Ranges come from the tjukurrpa, are made by the tjukurrpa, they are all important. Right up \nto the Agnew-Sandstone road, it is a special area. Even today, when you go past, you can see the crows eating all \nthe dead meat.\n\n The name for that bush potato is watja. There is a big mob of watja around those ranges, especially on the bottom \nof that range, on the west side, where the range is going up. The watja grow where they were left by the tjukurrpa, \nwhere those seeds were dropped.\n\n (Emphasis added.)  Dr Sackett was asked about these issues in cross-examination in the restricted expert \nevidence session. I consider it is permissible to reproduce the exchange, because it does not touch on the content \nof any restricted evidence. Rather, it deals with more general issues between the parties in this proceeding: in \nparticular, the State\u2019s thesis that the claim group members\u2019 ancestors \u201cimposed\u201d the Tjukurrpa and other laws and \ncustoms on the claim area in the 1930s and 1940s. In cross-examination about what could, or could not, be made \nof the fact that Ms Bates did not record certain Tjukurrpa in her material, the following exchange occurred:[MR \nRANSON]: Yes, the same report, supplementary. This is in response to Dr Brunson [sic] making the point that \nDaisy Bates, although she had recorded quite a number of dreaming stories \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about some of those \nthis morning \u2013 she hadn\u2019t recorded the ... story amongst the [Ngaiawonga] informants that she met. And you say \nthere\u2019s no reason to suspect, given that Liberman recorded it in the 70s and was told it had been there for some \ntime, there\u2019s no reason to think it wasn\u2019t there when Bates was recording. So your premise there is that it was \nprobably there but she just didn\u2019t record it?---Didn\u2019t record it.\n\n You would accept that it\u2019s equally possible on the evidence that she didn\u2019t record it because it wasn\u2019t there?---Well, \nshe didn\u2019t record it. That\u2019s ... it\u2019s like some of the other things we\u2019re facing with her data. They\u2019re - - -\n\n\n\n But it\u2019s possible?---It\u2019s possible, true.\n\n Yes?---I would say it\u2019s unlikely, being as it has been around and spoken of for some time and Liberman\u2019s \ninformants were saying it has been there for quite a while.\n\n Yes. Liberman\u2019s informants were what he said were Dupan [Tjupan] people, effectively, in relation to that issue?---\nSome were, not all of them.\n\n Yes?---He described some of them as Dupan [Tjupan], yes.\n\n Those Dupan [Tjupan] people, on your view, are not \u2013 be careful, bearing in mind my conversation with your \nHonour earlier \u2013 that your view about the Dupan [Tjupan] is they\u2019re not locals in the sense that they weren\u2019t there at \nsovereignty, in the claim area?---No. But they learned from people that were, in my view. Yes. There\u2019s no direct \nevidence that they learned. That\u2019s your assumption?---But it\u2019s an assumption based on the stories that people tell, \nhow their old people learned from older people. And these stories hook up with other stories in some way, shape or \nform.\n\n Yes?---It\u2019s not like the Jilla Kogara [Tjila Kutjara] are there and only there. It\u2019s an extensive dreaming with the \nsame features as it moves through the countryside.\n\n (Emphasis added.)\n\nOther matters material to my reasoning  In his further expert report at [224]-[225], Dr Sackett provides a response to \nsome of Dr Brunton\u2019s explanations for how the current claimant witnesses can speak of the Tjukurrpa and provide \ntheir knowledge about sacred sites in the claim area. Dr Brunton\u2019s opinion (at [563] of his first report) was \nexpressed in the following, slightly pejorative, terms:Given this, together with my opinion that the traditional society \nin the claim area was not a part of the WDCB, the question of how the claim area has come to be the repository of \nseemingly Western Desert Dreamings, stories, sites, and perhaps sacred paraphernalia, needs to be addressed. \nThere are a number of ethnographic reports from the Western Desert and other areas which point to what probably \noccurred, providing accounts of how newcomers to an area have attempted to legitimise their move in terms of the \nsacred geography of the country they are taking over.  Dr Sackett\u2019s response to this (at [225]) was:In saying this, \nDr Brunton seems to assume that the Dreamings, stories and the rest are imports. I am not aware of any evidence \nthat this was/is the case. I accept that what Dr Brunton says about people reading meaning into the landscape. \nHowever, if this happened in the way(s) Dr Brunton suggests it might have, it went unrecorded.  I accept Dr \nSackett\u2019s opinion. I am unaware of any plausible justification offered by Dr Brunton, or to be found in the evidence, \nfor the assertion that the people he calls \u201cnewcomers\u201d \u201cattempted to legitimise their move in terms of the sacred \ngeography of the country they are taking over\u201d. It was not suggested to any of the claimant witnesses that they, or \ntheir ancestors, had attempted to \u201clegitimise\u201d their presence by adopting the Tjukurrpa for the claim area. Aside \nfrom one use of the word \u201cnewcomer\u201d in the cross-examination of Mr Muir, but not put as a direct proposition, there \nwas no suggestion put to any claimant witnesses that this was an accurate description of what their ancestors were. \nIt is tantamount to a suggestion that the Tjukurrpa was invented or fabricated, since it is not possible, so far as I \nunderstand Western Desert traditional laws and customs, to separate the Tjukurrpa from the country to which it \nrelates.\n\nConnection: using evidence about language to determine the Western Desert society issue    As the applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions acknowledge, the evidence about the language spoken by the people who occupied the claim area at \nsovereignty is but one piece of the puzzle concerning the characterisation, on the balance of probabilities, of those \npeople as Western Desert, or non-Western Desert people.  In its written submissions, the State contends that, in \nany native title proceeding, expert linguistic evidence is of marginal relevance and probative value in identifying the \ntraditional laws and customs in relation to land and society. The State submits that this is the case in this \n\n\n\nproceeding, particularly where the issue is the identity of the society and its laws and customs at sovereignty. In \nother words, the State submits that there is no necessary connection between language and land ownership. In \nmaking this submission, the State points to the applicant\u2019s submission that dialects and dialect labels, such as \nNgaiawonga, have shifted ephemerally over time and have not been uniformly used at any one given time.  \nLeaving to one side the State\u2019s unduly broad submission that expert linguistic evidence is of marginal relevance in a \nnative title proceeding, the difference between the parties\u2019 approaches is one of weight. The State submits Dr \nClendon\u2019s evidence is of no or marginal weight. The applicant submits it has a role to play, and should be given \nweight as one factor.  I note also that, at least in relation to the word lists he used as the foundation for his opinions \non the issues I discuss below, Dr Clendon did not find any \u201cglaring errors\u201d in Ms Bates\u2019 work, although he accepted \nthere were such errors in some of her other reports. He said:They [Daisy Bates\u2019 word lists] are all very consistent. \nWord lists from particular places are clearly Western Desert. Word lists from other places are clearly Wadjari or \nBadimaya. Word lists from the areas we\u2019re looking at show a \u2013 a \u2013 a mixture, and they\u2019re also consistent. It would \nbe highly unlikely to be the result of \u2013 of people randomly moving around, and randomly \u2013 randomly offering word \nlists.  This is an example of the way the combination of Ms Bates\u2019 original work with the opinion of an expert can \nlead me to be satisfied it is appropriate to accept expert opinion based on Ms Bates\u2019 source material, because it is \nconsidered reliable and is being used as a basis for opinions drawn from what she has recorded, but no more (that \nis, not from what she did not record). There are still issues of representativeness, which concern me, but at least \non the language issues I accept Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion that Ms Bates\u2019 word lists are a suitable source.\n\nThe competing contentions  The applicant contends that the conclusion to be drawn from Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence is \nthat those Aboriginal people associated with the claim area recorded by Ms Bates were speaking a Western Desert \ndialect, but were also multilingual in Wadjari and Badimia, which are agreed to be non-Western Desert languages. \nThe applicant says that the linguistic evidence (including the name \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d itself) supports a finding that the \nNgaiawonga spoke a dialect of the Western Desert language, and that this \u201cadds weight\u201d to the proposition that the \nclaim area was occupied by Western Desert people at sovereignty. The applicant rightly recognises, on the basis of \nDr Clendon\u2019s evidence, that the original occupants may have been multilingual. They also accept that language is \nnot of itself an indicator of shared laws and customs. On this latter point, it seems to me the applicant may have \nbeen a little too ready to make such an absolute concession, and I return to this below.  The State contends that if \nanything, Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence supports the State\u2019s proposition that the claim area was not Western Desert \ncountry, nor occupied by Western Desert people, at sovereignty. In particular, the State relies on Dr Clendon\u2019s \nevidence about the multilingual nature of people in the claim area at sovereignty, and the need to \u201cdecouple\u201d \nlanguage spoken from rights to country, and laws and customs about rights to country. The State emphasised Dr \nClendon\u2019s agreement with the propositions, based on Bates\u2019 material, that there was considerable linguistic mix in \nthese areas from movement, intermarriage and deaths. The State suggested that Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence in the \nearlier Sir Samuel claim, which covered substantial parts of the claim area suggested that he saw the claim area as \noccupied by people who principally spoke Wajarri, a non-Western Desert language. The State contends that, if Dr \nClendon had changed his views, he had not adequately explained why he had done so.\n\nThe claimant evidence  Given the agreed position that the claim group members are Western Desert people, it is \nnot surprising that the languages many of them gave evidence about hearing, understanding and speaking were \nmostly Western Desert dialects: namely Tjupan, Martu, Koara, Ngalia, Mantjintjarra, Putijarra and Ngaanyatjarra.  \nThe claimant evidence was, unsurprisingly, that they learned language from their ancestors, although several gave \nevidence that their ancestors spoke more languages than they do.  As to knowledge of \u201cNgaiawonga\u201d, a couple of \nwitnesses (Ms Geraldine Hogarth and Mr Victor Ashwin) identified the word as meaning \u201cmy talk\u201d or \u201cmy language\u201d, \nor \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cspeak\u201d. Mr Victor Ashwin identified Ngaiawonga as a Western Desert language. This kind of \nknowledge is likely, I find, to have been recently rather than traditionally acquired. Some witnesses said they had \nnever heard of Ngaiawonga: Brett Lewis, Ms Wonyabong, and Mr Bingham are examples.  Some witnesses \nidentified ancestors as having spoken Ngaiawonga. Ms Luxie Hogarth\u2019s evidence was:All the people speaking \nNaiawongga, they all pass away. They were coming from the west, back towards Meekatharra and Cue, coming in \nto the west part there [of Tjiwarl claim area]. They all gone now, and the words gone now too. You don\u2019t much hear \npeople saying those words.\n\n\n\n All those people that talk Naiawongga, they all pass away now. Like Mr Narrier [Frank Narrier], old Rosie, Alice \nRedmond. Mr Narrier was with them mob, and he might have spoke the same language too. He might have talked \nlike that because he was all in that area. I think old Rosie was speaking that, and I heard James Redmond, my \nbrother-in-law, saying that word, a long time ago. They joke around and they say them words. No one around to talk \nlike that now.\n\n That old man Waiya, he was living there. He was talking that other language coming in from the west side. Might \nbe, but I never seen him. But they might have been all together, married in the one lot. But I don\u2019t really know, \nbecause I didn\u2019t meet him. He was one of the main elders for the country before he passed away.  To some extent, \nMs Hogarth\u2019s evidence is consistent with Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion, based on Daisy Bates\u2019 word lists. That is, that Ms \nBates\u2019 informants spoke Western Desert and non-Western Desert languages.  Ms Harris\u2019s evidence reflected the \ncomplications of language acquisition and retention. She clearly separated out Badimia as a non-Western Desert \nlanguage, but her evidence suggests she understands the other languages she identifies to be Western Desert \ndialects:My parents spoke Martu and Wongai, but more Martu than Wongai because my mum\u2019s a Martu lady and \nshe mainly spoke Martu. When my dad passed away, we lost some of that language for Wongai. I know bits and \npieces but I can\u2019t speak it in a sentence, but Martu I can.\n\n Martu and Wongai languages are a bit different, but some words and meanings are the same. If someone was \nspeaking Wongai to me, I could understand what they say but I can\u2019t speak it well.\n\n In Wiluna, most people speak Manyjilyjarra, but now some people are adopting Ngaanyatjarra, because \nNgaanyatjarra lands mob are married into the Martu tribe too, so they\u2019re sort of adopted into the language.\n\n People also used to speak Koara in Wiluna, but that\u2019s before my time. I think it stopped after the 1980s, before the \n1990s, in Wiluna. In Leinster and this Tjiwarl claim area, they still speak Koara. Koara is the same through law and \nculture as Martu; it\u2019s sharing the same culture.\n\n I can understand Tjupan language, but I don\u2019t know how to speak it. That\u2019s a really old language. I got told about it \nby my mum, Aunty Gay [Harris] and other family members in Leonora. The Beamans and the Ashwins, they still \nspeak it a little bit. The old people spoke it mostly.\n\n I\u2019ve heard about a language called Naiawongga but I never really knew much about it. I was told about it by my \nmum. I heard people speaking it, a little bit. I think that old Aunty Angeline Narrier and old Frank Narrier, they spoke \nNaiawongga.\n\n Ngalia language group is from the Goldfields, I think. I\u2019ve heard of it but I don\u2019t have knowledge of that. I\u2019ve just \nheard of them through the old people. Mainly my mum and my aunties told me about that.\n\n The old people shared languages. When people marry into families, you pick up other people\u2019s languages. That\u2019s \nhow it is today, and how it used to be back then in the old days too.\n\n Badimia language, that\u2019s from the Yamatji side, near Cue. They have separate law and culture. They\u2019re now \ninteracting with our law and culture because they lost some of their culture and law. We\u2019re trying to help them to \nregain, to get up and going again.  Mr Patterson\u2019s evidence was that he had never heard of Ngaiawonga. He \nidentified the Narriers and the Ashwins as speaking Puruantjiltjarra, a Western Desert language.\n\nThe expert evidence  Aside from Dr Clendon, Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton also addressed language issues in their \nevidence.  Dr Sackett used Dr Clendon\u2019s opinions in his first report, and then also in his further expert report, where \nhe dealt with some of Dr Brunton\u2019s criticisms. In his further expert report, Dr Sackett recognises, and I find it is the \n\n\n\ncase, that based on Ms Bates\u2019 word lists, Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion suggests that although non-Western Desert \nlanguages (Badimaya and Wajarri) were also widely spoken, he considers that the \u201cbottom line is that Dr Clendon \nspoke of the language materials Bates recorded in the area as having been Tjupan \u2013 a way of speaking he took to \nbe a dialect of the Western Desert language\u201d.  Dr Brunton dealt with Dr Clendon\u2019s opinions in his report, while \nacknowledging he did not have the experience to make a linguistic assessment of Dr Clendon\u2019s report and had \nvery limited familiarity with Aboriginal languages. He nevertheless contends that \u201cit is still possible for me to raise \nquestions about the robustness of his conclusions, and in particular, about the way in which these have been \ninterpreted by Dr Sackett\u201d. Dr Brunton focuses on Dr Sackett\u2019s use of Dr Clendon\u2019s report, rather than Dr Clendon\u2019s \nreport itself. I am satisfied Dr Clendon, in his responses to Dr Brunton, dealt adequately with the issues raised and \nmy reliance on Dr Clendon\u2019s views is not affected by anything Dr Brunton had to say. Ultimately, Dr Brunton\u2019s view \nwas:... the issue of whether, at the time of European settlement, the Tjiwarl claim area as a whole, or even a \nsignificant portion of the claim area, would have been associated or identified with a Western Desert language, \nrather than a Kartu language, remains open.  Acknowledging that each of them did not profess to trespass into Dr \nClendon\u2019s area of expertise, I did not find anything in the opinions of Dr Brunton and Dr Sackett which led me to \ndiscount the weight I would otherwise give to what Dr Clendon has said, in the terms I set out below.  Dr Clendon\u2019s \nopinion was that Ms Bates\u2019 informants, who identified the claim area (amongst other areas) as their country, were \nmultilingual but spoke predominantly a Western Desert language. In my view, Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion is reliable and \nshould be preferred, especially given his expertise.  There was no dispute about Dr Clendon\u2019s expertise, and the \nState acknowledges his expertise in particular in Western Desert language. It submits that he had less experience \nwith non-Western Desert languages and this might explain what it described as his \u201cdifficulty\u201d in differentiating \nbetween Western Desert words and non-Western Desert words, such as Badimaya and Wajarri words.  I do not \naccept that criticism of Dr Clendon\u2019s expertise. In my opinion, his expertise with Western Desert language obviously \nequips him to identify words, dialects and language that do not share the characteristics of the Western Desert \nlanguage. Whether or not he can definitively identify what other dialect or language it might be is not to the point in \nterms of the relevance of his opinions to the issues in this proceeding. What is relevant here is his opinion about \nhow much of the language recorded by Ms Bates came from the Western Desert language. For that task, he is \nparticularly well-qualified.  Dr Clendon described his particular interest and expertise in the following way:... that my \nmain interests is in the way that language is used by living people and it\u2019s \u2013 my interest is also in the way that \nlanguage, especially language shift and linguistic geography, impacts upon historical linguistics. That is our \nunderstanding of pre history.  Relevantly to this proceeding, he described the Sir Samuel claim as one of the most \ninteresting case studies he had been involved in:... that was interesting because of my work there with the [Sceghi] \nfamily of Leonora, who speak a quite distinct and undocumented variety of the Western Desert language which they \ncall Djilbarn [Tjuparn]. Other people call it [Bini]. And the way that the speech correlated extensively with speech \nrecorded by Daisy Bates a hundred years previously, especially in the speech of [Thuradha], who was a man from \nthe Laverton area, from an area a bit north \u2013 north west of Laverton. It was extremely interesting to me to see how \nlots of material in these historical documents that are quite unfamiliar to me became clear and apparent in the \nspeech of the [Sceghi] family of Leonora.  I have noted elsewhere Dr Clendon\u2019s explanation of why he chose to \nfocus on Ms Bates\u2019 word lists provided by Jinguru as opposed to those provided by Jaal. In cross-examination he \nexplained it this way:But it\u2019s not a particularly realistic hypothesis because Jingaroo\u2019s word list is so much more \ncomplete. \n\n Yes. I accept that?---A much \u2013 a much bigger word list. I would not choose the smaller over the bigger word list.  In \nhis report, Dr Clendon noted that a grammatical description of Western Desert language was beyond the scope of \nhis report. Nevertheless, as I have noted elsewhere in these reasons, it is necessary to understand to some extent \nwhat is meant when various witnesses, and pieces of evidence, refer to features of \u201cWestern Desert\u201d society, \nculture, laws and traditions. The same applies, in my view, to issues about language. In his oral evidence, Dr \nClendon said:Well, the Western Desert language is a vast dialect spread of language varieties that are mutually \nintelligible to all its members. These language varieties have minor differences from one place to another, pretty \nmuch in the same way that dialects of any language have minor differences. If you go to Britain you will find \ndialectal differences between Devon and Norfolk and Yorkshire and up into the lowlands of Scotland. But this is \nspread over a much wider area. All varieties in my experience are mutually intelligible, although varieties from either \nends of the dialect spread have significant differences. The Western Desert language is called that because there is \n\n\n\nno emic or native name for it. The labelling applied to the Western Desert language is extremely tricky for people \nwho aren\u2019t used to it because the labels are ephemeral. They \u2013 the labels do not map onto actual linguistic \ndifferences and real linguistic differences are not necessarily labelled and often the labels are not even linguistic \nlabels. And \u2013 and when I say they\u2019re ephemeral, they\u2019re often made up on the spot and could be used for a little \nwhile and then discarded, and I think in my \u2013 one of my reports I give an example of that from the Northern Western \nDesert. There\u2019s also an excellent essay by the late anthropologist Ronald Burnt [sic], and I think he wrote it in about \n1973, called On the Concept of the Tribe in Western Australia, in which he points out in the Leonora Laverton area \nthere \u2013 I think, was something like, if I\u2019m remembering right \u2013 something like 80 labels that were applied to \nessentially what is one language and one dialect of one language. And these labels are coined to describe \nparticular words that some people use that might not be used by other people, so words for \u201cthis\u201d are typically used \nbecause the words for \u201cthis\u201d vary from place to place. And words in the Western Desert, words for \u201cthis\u201d in the \nWestern Desert can be \u201cna\u201d and with a particularising suffix it would be \u201cna\u201d and with another kind of suffix it could \nbe \u201cna tha\u201d. And if you had the group-label suffix to that you get \u201cna dhurra\u201d and \u201cna tha dhurra\u201d and, further north, \nthe word is \u201cgnaya\u201d and that group label added to that would give you \u201cgnaya djata\u201d. And all these are labels \nfrequently found in the literature. Other \u2013 over in the east words for \u201cgo\u201d are commonly used as ways of describing \nthe way you speak, so in the north of South Australia, far north of South Australia, the word \u201cverbeyuningee\u201d which \nhas an infinitive stem from \u201cyungcuncha\u201d is used as a verb of motion, and those people refer to their speech \n\u201cyungcuncha djara\u201d whereas north of them another verb of motion is used with a stem from \u201cpidjunja\u201d and those \npeople refer to themselves are \u201cpidjunja djara\u201d and they use those forms simply to \u2013 as, I guess, indexical terms \nthat 5 distinguish to what they see as two separate ways of speaking.\n\n ... And, historically, in the 1930s those same people, who now refer to themselves pidjundjara used another verb of \nmotion, \u201cwudjaparkanee\u201d and they refer to themselves as \u201cwudjarapkandjara\u201d, and that\u2019s documented by the linguist \nand 10 missionary, JRB Love, who worked there in the nineteen thirties and forties. So labels are very ephemeral.  \nDr Clendon noted that Badimaya was spoken in a large area to the south-west of the claim area: Lake Moore, \nNhingan Station and Paynes Find (all of which are not far to the south of Mount Magnet). Wajarri was spoken to the \nwest and north-west of the claim area. The latter was used for its own sake and as a proxy for Central Badimaya.  \nDr Clendon used Western Desert language varieties (Mantjintja) represented by an informant of Ms Bates called \nThuradha (Thurratha) from the Cosmo Newberry area, north-east of Laverton. He also used texts provided to him \nfrom the Sceghi family of Leonora, who spoke Tjuparn and were the last known surviving speakers of this Western \nDesert dialect. I note the State did not contest Dr Clendon\u2019s evidence that Tjuparn was a Western Desert dialect. \nHis evidence, which I accept, is that these two dialects showed close similarities to each other.  In respect of Ms \nBates\u2019 transcriptions, Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion was that:... transcription is always difficult and it\u2019s perhaps quite unfair to \ncomment from a perspective where we have access to modern methods of discovering \u2013 of doing ... analysis and \ndiscovering a ... of a language. Comparing this to someone who was essentially not a linguist, and who was \nworking without the benefit of modern understanding of linguistic analysis, I would say her transcriptions are \nextremely good, in that \u2013 in the context of the historical period.  Dr Clendon explained the feature of multilingualism \nwhich he said was common in the Western Desert and more broadly, in the following terms:Multilingualism in \ntraditional Australia was the norm. It was helped by Australian languages, especially in this area, having an \nabsolutely, or near absolutely uniform phenology. So if you\u2019re an English speaker learning French, you have to \nlearn a lot of sounds that English speakers don\u2019t use. You have to learn to make nasalised vowels. You have to \nlearn that primary stress in French goes on the final syllable of a word as opposed to where stress is placed in \nEnglish words. You have to use sounds in combinations that are quite foreign to English, whereas in Australian \nlanguage the phenology was pretty much uniform so you didn\u2019t have to master a distinct set of sounds. You just \nneeded to master \u2013 you just needed to know words in a neighbouring language, which made language learning \nextremely easy \u2013 well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I will say it made language learning \u2013 it facilitated language learning, and people \nwere habitually multilingual and took pride on being multilingual. It was a sign for males. It was a sign that you had \ntravelled widely on ceremonial business, that you had travelled widely among different people and that you knew \nthe languages of different people.  His analysis of Daisy Bates\u2019 word lists given to her by her informant Jinguru led \nDr Clendon to the following conclusions about Jinguru\u2019s language, recalling he was a man who identified himself \nwith the Lake Way area, just to the immediate north of the claim area. Dr Clendon concluded that Jinguru\u2019s natal or \nmost regularly used language was a variety of the Western Desert language; although it was heavily influenced by \n\n\n\nCentral Badimaya, and possibly also by Wajarri. Jinguru was bilingual, or more likely trilingual in these languages, \nand moved habitually and easily between all three languages.  In his first report, Dr Sackett referred to a 2006 \npublication of Dr Clendon where he said:A distinct, regional variety (dialect) of the Western Desert Language \nappears to have been spoken within an area which took in Lakes Nabberu and Carnegie in the north, and Menzies \nand Laverton in the south. In the west this speech variety was bounded by the Kartu languages Wajarri and \nBadimaya (or varieties thereof) ... The label \u2018Tjupan\u2019 was probably used in the north of this area, and another label \n\u2018Walyiny\u2019 may have been used in the far south ... Between these two, the label \u2018Koara\u2019 appears to have been used.  \nDr Clendon was not able to identify the position, in the sense of a geographical line, of his phrase \u201cin the west\u201d. He \ndid not say there was any clear geographical demarcation between Western Desert and non-Western Desert \nlanguages. However, I accept Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion (supported, it seems to me by Dr Sackett\u2019s opinion in his \nsupplementary report at [222]) that the drawing of lines and boundaries in this way is an inapposite approach to \nthese issues.  One of Dr Clendon\u2019s key conclusions is expressed as follows:[T]he northern Goldfields region, \nincluding the area of the Tjiwarl Claim, was occupied at sovereignty by people speaking a distinct variety or dialect \nof the Western Desert Language. This dialect has been referred to by a number of labels by a number of writers, \nbut most consistently by the terms Mantjintja or Mantjintjatjarra.  He then noted that Mantjintja in turn had at least \ntwo regional sub-varieties: one in the east, also called Mantjintja, as represented by the speech recorded by \nThuradha; and one in the west, called Tjuparn (amongst, he said, other names), as represented by the speech \nrecorded by Jinguru (Lake Way), and by that of the Sceghi family (Leonora). He considered Tjuparn seemed more \nheavily influenced by Wajarri and Badimaya as non-Western Desert languages.  Yet, as the State points out in its \nsubmissions, Dr Clendon later in his report expressed some opinions, after considering the contents of Dr Brunton\u2019s \nreport, which might seem not entirely consistent with this opinion. In his report at [49]-[50], he said:... in my \nconclusions to the Sir Samuel & Tjupan no 2 Report I stated that in the northern Goldfields region the Western \nDesert Language was bounded in the west by Wajarri and Badimaya. I made and do not make any claims about \nwhere exactly this boundary was, except that the boundary must have been fuzzy and highly mobile. Given the \nnature of the terrain, and its very small carrying capacity for humans, the pre-contact population of the Tjiwarl Claim \narea must have been small indeed. It would take the movements of only a few people to drastically alter the \ndemography of such a relatively small, relatively infertile region. In such circumstances the location of a putative \nboundary must have fluctuated wildly as people came and went, as marriages were contracted, and as people died.\n\n ... in my understanding, the question of whether or how much of the Tjiwarl Claim was occupied historically by \nspeakers of the Western Desert Language seems to miss the point that comes out of the linguistic investigations I \nhave undertaken so far. The most likely answer to this question is probably that Western Desert speakers occupied \nall of the claim area, and that Wajarri and/or Badimaya speakers also occupied all of the claim area. In any \ninstance, Western Desert speakers and Wajarri or Badimaya speakers may or may not have been the same \npeople. In a region with very low population density, and where it was likely that everyone could find a Wajarri \nspeaker, a Badimaya speaker and a Western Desert speaker in their immediate ancestry, disentangling linguistic \nidentity might seem to be a fruitless exercise.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  In his supplementary report, produced after having access to further Badimaya language \nresources, Dr Clendon seems firmer in his opinion that the word lists show a \u201csignificant amount of mixing\u201d of \nBadimaya and Western Desert words in the same sentence. He concludes that his further analysis provided \n\u201csupport for the conclusion reached in my primary report, namely that the Western Desert Language and the Kartu \nlanguages Badimaya and Wajarri were all spoken at sovereignty over the area of the Tjiwarl Claim.\u201d  This mixing of \nlanguage, and dialects, was not something Dr Clendon believed Ms Bates would have recognised. He gave the \nfollowing evidence in cross-examination about Ms Bates\u2019 methods and what we can reliably accept she did and did \nnot know:---And I would imagine a situation where there\u2019s four men sitting with her, and one of them offers a \nresponse in a Western Desert language, another one offers a response in, perhaps, Badimaya, or, perhaps, the \nsame man offers her \u2013 gives her three different alternatives. \n\n\n\n Okay. So she, in your mind, was actually engaged in a slightly comparative exercise in that sense?---Well, no, she \nwould not have known that they were different languages. \n\n Okay?---I mean, she was not a linguist. She appeared \u2013 everything I can see \u2013 especially, the fact that she wasn\u2019t \ndistinguishing between languages \u2013 she did not know that she was being offered two or three different languages.  \nLater in cross-examination, Dr Clendon explained how he considered this mixing, and multilingual developments, \ncould have occurred. He gave the following evidence:[MR RANSON]: So there\u2019s an inherent difficulty, isn\u2019t there, \nwith drawing lines on the ground, because \u2013 this seems to me to be the point you\u2019re making: language attaches to \npeople rather than country, in a linguistic sense, and, as those people are moving around, as you say in paragraph \n49, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s where the language is?---Yes.\n\n So is that the point you were trying to make, there, effectively?---Partially, because, traditionally, people were \u2013 \npeople were not free-floating. They were anchored to particular places. \n\n Yes?---But that, as people moved between places occupied by various relatives, and as people married, and as \npeople died, over time, that would have altered, I guess, the linguistic mix of any particular area in a boundary zone. \n\n All right?---But I wasn\u2019t saying that people were floating completely free of any attachments to particular areas of \nland.  He also appeared, as counsel for the State pointed out to him in cross-examination, to have modified his \nopinion about where the \u201ctransition zone\u201d (as he called it) was between Western Desert dialects and non-Western \nDesert dialects:... there seemed to me to be a slight shift in opinion, which was, in fact, sort of, what I was getting at, \nwhich is \u2013 this is at paragraph 24 on page 12 \u2013 you set out a series of conclusions, but one of them was:The claim \narea was just to the east of a wide and fuzzy transition zone \u2013and that seemed to me to be a slight shift from your \nearlier opinion which was that it was in a fuzzy transition zone?---Yes. Yes, it is. And that shift was based on the \nmore complete analysis I was able to do with the dictionaries available to me.\n\n (Emphasis added.)  I am not confident Dr Clendon\u2019s answer here grappled with this issue, because his access to \nBadimaya dictionaries occurred after the completion of his first report, and it was the contents of his first report to \nwhich counsel was here referring.  Dr Clendon resisted the idea of boundaries, which in my opinion is why he spoke \nof \u201ctransition zones\u201d and \u201cfuzziness\u201d. He explained this in response to a question I asked him:---I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an \nemic boundary, from my knowledge of other people who \u2013 who have full control over their languages. What \nAboriginal people in these places tend to do, in my experience, is indicate a series of places, and these places will \nbe named as belonging to particular families. They never \u2013 they characteristically do not speak in terms of \nboundaries. They name places that belong to particular families, and those families may speak one language or \nthey may speak two languages. For instance, there\u2019s a \u2013 a family name in the Great Sandy Desert, Girriwadi. And \nmembers of that family speak both the Manjtjiltjara dialect of the Western Desert language and Wanman language \nas a distinct language, but the sites all belong to them \u2013 the places all belong to them. I don\u2019t know how you draw a \nnon-fuzzy \u2013 I don\u2019t know how you draw a boundary there. You would have \u2013 simply have to say a zone where on \none side of that zone the Manjtjiltjara is spoken, on the other side Wanman is spoken.  Dr Clendon was cross-\nexamined also about his opinion concerning the geographical extent of the Tjupan language, which was that it \nextended from around Lake Carnegie in the north down to Menzies in the south. What was less clear was how far \nto the west he considered it extended. He accepted in cross-examination that these regions were to the east of the \nclaim area, but agreed he could not say how far Tjupan may have spread west into the claim area, although he \naccepted later in his evidence it went as far south as Laverton. Laverton is still in the eastern half of the claim area, \nif one examines the claim area from an east to west perspective.  What Dr Clendon was not substantially \nchallenged on were those passages in his first report where he seeks to place language spoken by Aboriginal \npeople in its wider context, in terms of how Aboriginal societies functioned under traditional laws and customs. It is \nappropriate to extract the entirety of these passages:What emerges from Bates\u2019 work relating to the northern \nGoldfields region at sovereignty is a picture of a single society that was multilingual in the Western Desert \nLanguage, Wajarri, and Badimaya.\n\n\n\n Exogamous marriages and joint ceremonial and exchange activities reinforced the status of individual families and \nof extended families as units or links within a social and linguistic network spreading over what must have been \nalmost the entire arid zone of Western Australia, and perhaps beyond. This situation is characteristic of societies \nwith low population densities in landscapes with scarce resources and in the absence of geographical barriers. \nWhen called upon by Bates or others to nominate affiliation to a group, people in this region appear to have been \nable to volunteer or evince a number of linguistic identities, without contradiction or inconsistency\n\n I have some difficulty with regard to the notion of a \u2018Western Desert Cultural Bloc;\u1fbd I think this construct could only \nbe useful if decoupled from language. In the Goldfields region it is clear that a single, dispersed but interconnected \nsociety cut across language boundaries, fuzzy and variable though these boundaries may have been. Similarly, in \nthe north of Western Australia emic accounts of life in the desert before contact...make it clear that, for example, \npeople speaking varieties of the Western Desert Language mixed with people speaking Nyangumarta, Warnman \nand Mangarla, and interacted socially, matrimonially, religiously and economically, again as family units in a single, \ndispersed, interconnected society.\n\n Bates, as nearly all other observers among \u2018primitive\u2019 people until recently, was working within a model of society \nthat equated race with culture and with language, which together constituted the bounded ethnic group; this last \nbeing a largely theoretical construct coming out of a European political ideology which partitioned landscapes along \njust these lines.... Australian society in the arid zone, in contrast, appears to have consisted of networks of kin and \nceremonial totemic or \u2018dreaming\u2019 relationships that frequently operated over considerable distances and in more \nthan one language. Individuals identified with their places of birth or childhood, and held these places to be their \nhomes, with their extended home countries radiating thence outwards in a core \u2013 fadeout disposition ... Individuals \nwere and are the embodiment of the intersection of the four lineages represented by their grandparents. This \nunderstanding of social identity, and of society and sociality more generally, was and is not confined to speakers of \nthe Western Desert Language.\n\n (Citations omitted.)\n\nMy conclusions  Considering all of his evidence, and in particular the passages I have just extracted, I do not see \nthere is any necessary inconsistency in Dr Clendon\u2019s various statements. In my opinion, in these passages he is \nemphasising the multilingual character of the likely occupants of the claim area at sovereignty and at first or early \ncontact. He is also emphasising, at [27] of his report, the extent, in traditional societies, of social, matrimonial, \nreligious, and economic interaction, which is also a feature of some of the information recorded by Daisy Bates.  \nHowever, what he is also making clear is that there was a point to the west at which the predominant or notable use \nof Western Desert language gave way, or diminished considerably. He is, correctly, unwilling to draw a line on the \nmap about where that point was. The critical aspect of his evidence is the preponderance of Western Desert \nlanguage extended throughout this claim area, and came from movements of people from the east of the claim \narea. How much further west it went is not a matter which needs to be decided. Finally, Dr Clendon\u2019s opinion is that \nin circumstances of multilingual informants, a claim made by a person\u2019s affiliation with a particular dialect or \nlanguage label could well be part of a claim to inherited rights of affiliation to land or Dreaming, rather than a claim \nabout what language that person actually speaks in mundane day-to-day situations. Whether or not this was a \nmotivation at work with Ms Bates\u2019 informants cannot be stated with any certainty, but it also cannot be discounted \nentirely. This, it seems, to me, is part of the reason Dr Clendon adhered to his views about the significance of a \nclaim of Western Desert dialect by the words given to Ms Bates by her informants and their self-indication with the \npronoun \u201cngayu\u201d as a speaker of Western Desert dialect.  I consider that Dr Clendon\u2019s opinions are consistent with, \nand supportive of, the view I have taken of other aspects of the evidence in this proceeding.\n\nConnection: the relevance of other decisions and determinations close to the claim area    The parties made various \nreferences to other determinations, and judicial decisions, dealing with land close to the claim area. In this section, I \nset out how, if at all, I have relied on those other determinations and decisions, and why I have taken the approach I \nhave.\n\n\n\nWiluna and Tarlpa consent determinations  In 2013, McKerracher J determined three native title applications by \nconsent. Two were known as the Wiluna and Wiluna #3 applications, and one as the Tarlpa application: see Wiluna \n[2013] FCA 755.  The Tarlpa application covered an area of approximately 2,265.26 square km to the south of the \ntownship of Wiluna, and adjacent to the northern boundary of the claim area. There was no evidence any of the \nclaim group members in this proceeding were members of the claim group in that application, but I am not \ndiscounting the possibility.  The Wiluna application covered approximately 47,595.90 square km. The Wiluna #3 \napplication covered approximately 3,596.52 square km.  The westernmost section of the Wiluna native title \ndetermination is to the north of the Tarlpa determination. Included in this is the township of Wiluna, which is only \nabout 35 km north of the northern side of the Tjiwarl claim boundary. The following claimant witnesses are native \ntitle holders under the Wiluna determination: Ms Wonyabong, Ms Tullock, Ms Harris, Mr Victor Ashwin, Mr Henry \nAshwin, Mr Allan Ashwin, Mr Richard Narrier, Mr Keith Narrier, Ms Narrier, Ms Geraldine Hogarth, and Mr \nPatterson. At least two apical ancestors in the Wiluna determination are also identified as apical ancestors in the \npresent application: namely, Scotty Tullock and Alfie Ashwin.  There was also a considerable amount of evidence in \nthis proceeding about the conduct of law business in Wiluna, and the fact that the claim group members (and their \nfamilies, where necessary) go to Wiluna for law business, including initiations.  One of the consequences of the \nState\u2019s contentions in this case is that there could be nothing in accordance with traditional laws and customs about \nsending young men from the claim area for initiation at Wiluna. That is because those young men would hold no \nrights and interests in the claim area in accordance with traditional laws and customs. They would be invaders, \nusurpers.  However, the evidence shows that, in this kind of interaction, other Aboriginal people \u2013 Western Desert \npeople \u2013 recognise the claim group members\u2019 rights to country and are key participants in the passing down of \nknowledge about that country, allowing ceremonies on their own country to be used for that purpose. It seems an \nobvious inference, and one I am prepared to draw, that the elders in the Wiluna area who permit this to occur do so \nbecause those young men are recognised as having rights to country in the claim area in accordance with \ntraditional laws and customs, and are not seen as recent arrivals who have imposed Western Desert law on that \ncountry. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr Patterson, a senior elder from Wiluna.  In his first report at [49], \nDr Sackett noted his conclusions about the Wiluna and Tarlpa claims:After reviewing the available evidence, both \nethnographic and linguistic, I concluded that:the ethnographic evidence leads me to the to the view that the eastern \nportion of the Wiluna claim area was/is part of Western Desert Society. Moreover, the combination of the \nethnographic evidence and linguistic evidence lead to the view that the western portion, and indeed the entirety, of \nthe Wiluna claim area was/is part of Western Desert Society... \n\n (Citations omitted.)  Dr Sackett also expressed the following opinion:That the Wiluna and Tarlpa Claim areas fall \nwith the Western Desert means that a number of the places associated with various of the named Tjiwarl apicals \nand various of their ancestors lie in the Western Desert. This includes: the lands along the Wiluna-Wongawol Road, \nCarnegie Pastoral Lease, Wongawol Pastoral Lease, Windidda Pastoral Lease and the former Yelma Pastoral \nLease. By extension, it also would include the area south of Mangkali, which itself lies to the east of the Wiluna \nClaim area.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  Dr Sackett\u2019s general conclusion was:It is accepted that the places/areas of \u2018origin\u2019 of some \nnamed apicals and many of their ancestors lying in and to the east of the Wiluna Claim area are Western Desert \nplaces/areas. It is my view, and this is grounded in material I explore below ... that theTjiwarl Claim area, like the \nWiluna/Tarlpa Claim area to its north, lies in the Western Desert. It as well is my view that as the Tjiwarl Claim area \nlies in the Western Desert, so too do those places/areas to the east of it with which some named apicals and some \nof their ancestors are associated.  These conclusions were built on a foundation of fact and opinion arising from the \ncircumstances of the Wiluna and Tarlpa claims, which bear some considerable resemblance to the circumstances \nof the current claim. They should be referred to in some detail.  In his Tjiwarl Registration Report, Dr Sackett \ndescribed the work he undertook for the Tarlpa and Wiluna claims, each of which eventually resulted in a consent \ndetermination. He said:As noted in my brief, I prepared a 2009 report on \u201cthe extent of the Western Desert\u201d. In this \nreport, which is titled The Wiluna Native Title Claim and Western Desert Society, I focused on \u201cwhether or not the \nlands embraced by [the Wiluna and Tarlpa Native Title claims] fall (1) outside, (2) partially in, or (3) wholly within the \nembrace of the Western Desert society.\u201d I did this for a number of interrelated reasons.\n\n\n\n First, my research showed that most Wiluna claim group ancestors and some senior claimants were not \nindigenous to the claim area, but had moved there from countries to the north, northeast and east of the claim \narea, specifically from lands of the earlier Martu, Birriliburu and Ngaanyatjarra claims. These latter were areas \n[where] people made claims to country through Western Desert law and custom, ie through the laws and customs \nof the Western Desert society.\n\n As I noted in my report in support of the Birriliburu claim, like others in the Western Desert:the claimants\u2019 land \ntenure system offers a degree of scope for making claims to country. Put another way, it presents people, \nespecially today\u2019s more senior claimants, with various avenues along which they might link to country and country \nowning groups. These include, though are not necessarily limited to, having:  been found [in spirit form], ie \nconceived, in the area,\n\n  \n\n  been born at a site in the area,\n\n  \n\n  grown up in the area,\n\n  \n\n  lived in the area for many years and come to know its physical and mythological landscapes,\n\n  \n\n  been initiated in the area,\n\n  \n\n  had a parent or grandparent from the area, or\n\n  \n\n  had a parent who died and is buried in the area, or ... grandparent who died and is buried in the area ...Second, \nthose ancestors and the Wiluna/Tarlpa claimants themselves likewise made claims to the Wiluna area through \nWestern Desert law and custom. For example, and again as I noted when considering Birriliburu law and custom:At \na 24 August 2000 meeting at Wiluna, Wiluna people ... spoke of the situation with respect to people and country in \nthe Wiluna area. As Mr P/Billy Patch put it, to murmurs of approval:  if a person was born in Wiluna and was sent or \nmoved to Perth, they always can come back: \u201cthat\u2019s [ie Wiluna is] his home.\u201d\n\n  \n\n  if such a person had children, these children too can move to Wiluna \u2013 to \u201cfollow\u201d their mother or father.\n\n  \n\n  \u201cOnly one thing, if he is a boy he still gotta go through the Law [ie be initiated into manhood].\u201d\n\n  \n\n  \u201cLong as father\u2019s or mother\u2019s country he can walk around free ... He [merely] gotta learn where can\u2019t go [ie what \nplaces must be avoided]\u201d.Third, this being the case, it was important to ascertain whether the Wiluna claim area \nitself sat inside or outside of the Western Desert. If the Wiluna claim area lay/lays inside the Western \nDesert/Western Desert society, Western Desert peoples from elsewhere (such as claimants\u2019 ancestors and some \nsenior claimants) could, through Western Desert law and custom, make claims to it. Similarly, their descendants too \ncould make claims to it. However, if the Wiluna claim area stood, in whole or in part, outside the Western \nDesert/Western Desert society, claimants\u2019 ancestors and claimants could not have made claims to those non-\nWestern Desert lands.\n\n In my 2009 report I relied heavily on the findings of earlier ethnographers: principally the findings of Daisy Bates, \nalong with those of Norman Tindale, Jo Birdsell and Jud Epling, Ron Berndt, and Ken Liberman. I also turned to the \nfindings of linguists Wilf Douglas (with the non-Western Desert Watjarri peoples), Leone Dunn (with the non-\nWestern Desert Badimaia peoples), and Mark Clendon (with former Sir Samuel claimants).\n\n\n\n After reviewing the data in some detail, I opined in summation that: the ethnographic evidence leads me to the view \nthat the eastern portion of the Wiluna claim area was/is part of Western Desert Society. Moreover, the combination \nof the ethnographic evidence and linguistic evidence lead to the view that the western portion, and indeed the \nentirety, of the Wiluna claim area was/is part of Western Desert Society... \n\n By my reading, that this was/is the case meant that Western Desert people who had and have shifted to the Wiluna \nand the adjacent Tarlpa claim areas from Western Desert lands to the north, northeast and east of those claims, \ncould and can, by Western Desert law and custom, make claims to the lands of those claim areas.\n\n (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)  Dr Sackett then notes that he undertook a \u201csimilar exercise in respect to the \nTjiwarl claim area and claimants\u201d. The first point he makes about this in the very next paragraph is:My research \nindicates that, as was the case in respect to the Wiluna claim, most \u2013 possibly all \u2013 Tjiwarl claimant ancestors came \nto the claim area from places outside it. Specifically, they came from the lands of the Birriliburu, the Wiluna, the \nMantjintjarra Ngalia, and the Ngaanyatjarra claims to the north, northeast and east. A couple of examples of named \napicals and their descendants follow.  In their final submissions, the applicant contended that the fact that many \nclaim group members in the current proceeding are native title holders in the Wiluna determination is not relevant to \na finding whether native title exists in the claim area, nor can it be used to support such a finding.  I confess to not \nunderstanding why such an absolute contention is made by the applicant. In circumstances where the key issue in \nthis case is whether the land in the claim area was part of Western Desert country at sovereignty, the fact that \ncountry immediately to the north, on the same longitude, is \u2013 by agreement of the State rather than after any \ncontested determination process \u2013 accepted to be Western Desert country \u2013 would seem to me to have some \nrelevance. That is especially so when the opposing thesis \u2013 proposed by the State \u2013 depends on the proposition \nthat land in the Tjiwarl claim is too far west. It is to be recalled of course that the Wiluna determination is a judgment \nby this Court of the existence of native title over the determination area, and accepting it is a long way from \ndeterminative, there are at least three factors which in my opinion give it real significance.  First, the area of the \nWiluna determination is a long way west of the so-called \u201cBerndt line\u201d, marking out the allegedly westernmost area \nof Western Desert country. On the map handed up by the State during the hearing (which was taken in to form part \nof exhibit A3), and in the extracts from Professor Berndt\u2019s book tendered in evidence, it can be seen that the \n\u201cBerndt line\u201d is well to the east of Lake Darlot, and extends in a north-easterly direction through the centre of what \nwas the Mantjintjarra Ngalia claim (part of the unsuccessful Wongatha claim heard by Lindgren J), with the \u201cline\u201d \nheading to the east of Lake Carnegie. That part of the \u201cline\u201d is broadly on the same latitude as the Wiluna \ndetermination area.  Second, a very substantial part of the Wiluna determination area is also west of what is \nidentified by the State in opening submissions as the \u201cMenzies-Lake Darlot line\u201d, which is a term derived from \nLindgren J\u2019s judgment in Wongatha at [702]. What Lindgren J found in Wongatha (see [702]) was that at \nsovereignty the culture of the \u201cWestern Desert Cultural Bloc\u201d extended to the \u201cBerndt line\u201d, and then \u201cfaded out \ngradually\u201d west of it in a zone that came to an end at the Menzies-Lake Darlot line. As I understand both Lindgren \nJ\u2019s reasoning, and the State\u2019s submissions in the present proceeding, including the way the \u201cMenzies-Darlot line\u201d is \nmarked on the State\u2019s map in evidence, the \u201cMenzies-Darlot line\u201d is said to extend further north and south (or, at \nleast, further north) than its actual marking on the State\u2019s map. This must be the case because it is clear from Map \n11 in exhibit 3 (which shows the claim boundaries for all the claims which made up theWongatha claim) that the \nWongatha claim extended north much further than the upper end of the \u201cMenzies-Darlot line\u201d, shown on the State\u2019s \nmap. In other words, there is an inconsistency between the proposition that:(a) the \u201cMenzies-Darlot line\u201d (running \nnorth\u2013south to the east of the Tjiwarl claim area, but extending north right through virtually the middle of the Wiluna \ndetermination area) marks the end of the fading out of Western Desert Cultural Bloc; and\n\n (b) all of the land in the Wiluna determination is Western Desert country.  Third, given the findings by this Court in \nthe Wiluna consent determination, the fact that the evidence in this proceeding shows that young men from the \nclaim group go to Wiluna to be put through the law, and that they are being put through the law in respect of their \ncountry in the claim area, suggests that the Western Desert lawmen in Wiluna see the claim area as Western \nDesert country. Indeed, that was precisely the evidence of Mr Patterson:I am a member of the Gingirana native \n\n\n\ntitle claim group. I am also a native title holder on the Birriliburu determination, the Martu determination and the \nWiluna determination.\n\n I am a senior wati and elder. I went through the law in Jigalong when I was about 15 years old at that time. Since \ngoing through at Jigalong, I\u2019ve done a lot of law business at Bondini [Reserve, in Wiluna], at Jigalong, and at many \nother places in Western Australia and South Australia; even in the Northern Territory. Today, I am one of the \nleaders of law business in the Wiluna and Jigalong areas.\n\n ...\n\n My mum remarried twice: first to Tinker, and then to Paddy Long, who grew me and my sisters up. Paddy was a \nPutijarra man and his language name was Majunka. His country was around Beyondie Station, Katjarra and Well \nNo 6 and Well No 7 (Milyiniri) on the Canning Stock Route. Paddy grew me up until I was a man. I called him my \nfather and he called me his son. He did all the things for me that a father normally does for his son. I follow him for \ncountry.\n\n ...\n\n I can\u2019t talk for the area of the Tjiwarl claim. That\u2019s not my country.\n\n One of the Narrier brothers are good blokes to talk to for that country. The Narriers speak for that country. Their \nfather came from that country. Beasley [Mr Keith Narrier], he\u2019s the right one, he\u2019s the right people. Beasley lives in \nWiluna.\n\n ...\n\n Those families would come up to Wiluna for law business, and I saw them at Bondini Reserve. They\u2019d come from \nthe south. The Narriers and Redmonds were the two lots of families I would see at law business in Bondini \n[Reserve]. Some old people that stopped in Leonora, they were there too. I didn\u2019t really know them.\n\n Some of the wati for that [Tjiwarl] country are in Leonora. If you ask Beasley [Mr Keith] Narrier, he\u2019ll tell you who \nthey are. They used to be doing the same law as in Bondini. Some of the young fellas from Leonora still come up to \nlaw in Bondini; I don\u2019t know any of their names.\n\n The Ashwins, like Victor, Henry and Alan, they\u2019re the right lot for that country too. Victor and his brothers, they can \nspeak. When I was a young boy, Alfie Ashwin grew me and Miparl [Frankie Wongawol] up at Wongawol station. We \nwere working there as stockmen, cattle mustering. He told us his country was around this [Tjiwarl] area. He didn\u2019t \ntalk much about the law because we were just boys, hadn\u2019t been through the law yet. \n\n The tjukurrpa is the story \u2013 the Law \u2013 about the country. It is passed down from the old people. It started in the \nbeginning; in the dreamtime. Tjukurrpa makes special places. From the dreamtime, we pass it on from generation \nto generation. It is still alive today. Tjukurrpa tells us about country: how to look after it, where the special places \nare, and how to travel through country. Tjukurrpa is still alive today.\n\n\n\n It\u2019s the same tjukurrpa in that Tjiwarl claim area as my country. My country is up north \u2013 but it change the \nlanguage and so we leave it to that lot. It\u2019s the same tjukurrpa. But that\u2019s for the mob who talk for the area to talk \nabout. Different people have different responsibility for different parts of the tjukurrpa. It\u2019s like bumping into \nsomeone else on the land; you got to keep to your side. Like I keep to Katjarra, and the Gingirana side.\n\n The desert law goes all the way to South Australia, the tjukurrpa moves east. It comes through this Tjiwarl area \nnow. That Meekatharra way is a different law, I can\u2019t talk their language and they can\u2019t talk my language. The \nGascoyne, Mt Augusta and that area, it\u2019s different too.\n\n ...\n\n Those families [Ashwins, Redmonds, Narriers] have always been there [Tjiwarl claim area], right through. When \nthat mob were there for that Yakabindie mine, they were getting the rations there. It was Beasley\u2019s old people, his \nfather and uncles there.\n\n ...\n\n Best to get them lot in the group now to talk for their country. You can get Beasley [Mr Keith Narrier] to talk for his \ncountry. That\u2019s a rule \u2013 because he\u2019s the right person. All the Narriers and Redmonds, they can talk. You got to \ntalk to them right lot. All decisions about country have to be made by the right people. Important decisions about \ncountry have to be made by the senior people for the country.  Mr Patterson was not required for cross-\nexamination, and his evidence was otherwise unchallenged and uncontradicted. I accept it.  Far from being \nirrelevant, or of little weight, all of the three matters to which I have referred are consistent with the contents of this \nCourt\u2019s reasons for determination in the Wiluna proceedings. Indeed, parts of McKerracher J\u2019s reasons are more \nthan consistent: they reflect with considerable precision the opinions of Dr Sackett which I have accepted in this \nproceeding, and they reflect the very thesis put forward by the applicant in this proceeding, which I have also \naccepted.  At [14] of the reasons for judgment in Wiluna (which included the three applications \u2013 Wiluna, Wiluna #3 \nand Tarlpa), McKerracher J said:The joint submissions in support of the Minute and Dr Sackett\u2019s filed report provide \nthe following information regarding the applicants\u2019 connection to country:(a) the Wiluna and Wiluna #3 applications \ntake their name from the township of Wiluna and the Tarlpa application takes its name from a significant rockhole \nknown as Tarlpa, in the south of the proposed determination area; \n\n (b) the applicants are members of the broader Western Desert cultural bloc, the relevant \u2018society\u2019 for native title \npurposes; \n\n (c) being members of the broader Western Desert cultural bloc, the applicants share a body of law and custom with \nother Western Desert native title holding groups including shared beliefs, rituals and gathering for ceremonial \npurposes; \n\n (d) the applicants\u2019 fundamental belief in the Jukurrpa (\u2018the Dreaming\u2019 or \u2018simply the Law\u2019) is the source of Western \nDesert law and custom to which the applicants adhere, and governs their religious practices, social rules, systems \nof land tenure and other aspects of their lives; \n\n (e) the applicants are an identifiable subset of the wider Western Desert cultural bloc who have rights and \nresponsibilities to the land in the proposed determination area in accordance with Western Desert law and custom \nthat recognises that certain individuals and family groups are associated with particular areas of country within the \nproposed determination area (with a degree of overlap or \u2018shared country\u2019); \n\n\n\n (f) many of the applicants live at Kutkububba, Bondini, Windidda or in the township of Wiluna which are all within \nthe proposed determination area and describe themselves, along with people from other parts of the Western \nDesert, as Martu; \n\n (g) the applicants are also able to trace connection to countries north, northeast and east of the proposed \ndetermination area and some antecedents and/or senior claimants came to the proposed determination area from \nmore remote traditional Western Desert homelands; \n\n (h) traditionally the mechanisms for association with areas of land in the Western Desert included being conceived, \nborn, grown up or initiated on country, or by having acquired knowledge of the country through long traditional \nassociation, or being descended from a person who had those connections. As a result, landholding groups were \nnot patrilineally-patrilocally structured but rather members of these groups were landholders through their shared \nassociations with and to land, and the groups were open and inclusive so that people had potential access to a \nnumber of areas through a variety of means; \n\n (i) in the eastern part of the proposed determination area, the applicants have an ancestral connection to those \nwho occupied the area at or around the acquisition of British sovereignty;\n\n (j) in the western part of the proposed determination area, which it is agreed is within the areas traditionally \nassociated with the Western Desert, there is limited ancestral link between the applicants and those who occupied \nthe area at sovereignty. Rather, during the period of about 1925 to 1975 the applicants and their antecedents \nmigrated into the area, mostly from areas to the north east, and over time rights were acquired in that area \nconsistent with Western Desert traditional law and custom; and\n\n (k) the Western Desert system of law and custom remains vital for the applicants who have an intimate knowledge \nof the law and custom including an extensive knowledge of Western Desert dreaming tracks and associated sites, \nstories and songs, and their importance in the context of the broader Western Desert (with associated restrictions \non women, young men and children). This includes acceptance by the applicants of responsibility which attaches to \nacquisition of knowledge both in relation to land and generally and the need to transmit that knowledge to younger \ngenerations. This is grounded in a system of kinship under which roles and responsibility are known and \nacknowledged (including in relation to ritual, marriage, death/burial etc). Appropriate behaviour is expected, and \nsanctions for breach exist under law and custom. Language is generally spoken by the applicants and traditional \nnames for people and places are widespread and generally known.(Emphasis added.)  For those reasons, the \nconclusion I have reached on the evidence before me in this proceeding is consistent with the Court\u2019s findings in \nthe Wiluna determination, and the recognition of the Wiluna claim area as Western Desert country tends against \nthe hypotheses relied on by the State, and against the findings of Lindgren J in Wongatha.\n\nThe Birriliburu determination  I propose also to refer here to the Birriliburu determination: Birriliburu [2008] FCA 944. \nGeographically, the Birriliburu determination area sits to the north and to the east of the Tjiwarl claim area, and \nnorth of the Wiluna determination area.  I refer to it because that determination area was mentioned by many \nwitnesses in this proceeding as an area from which some of their ancestors came, or had connections through \ntraditional laws and customs. In that context, I consider it relevant to reproduce some of French J\u2019s conclusions in \nthat matter. Again, I do not consider the fact that this was a consent determination to diminish the precedential or \nother value of what was said: his Honour still needed to be satisfied of the matters required by the NT Act.  At [17] \nof Birriliburu, French J stated:Most of the claimants reside at Wiluna, Jigalong, Patjarr, Warnarn, Warakurna and \nParngurr which are close to, but not inside, the proposed determination area. Together with people from other parts \nof the Western Desert they describe themselves as Martu. They share a body of laws and customs with other \nWestern Desert groups. They acknowledge shared beliefs and rituals and gather for ceremonial purposes. Some of \nthem are recognised native title holders in neighbouring Western Desert areas. It is agreed between the parties, \nhowever, that the claimants are identifiable as a subset of the wider Western Desert society, being members of 17 \n\n\n\nfamily groups and other individuals recognised as custodians with rights and responsibilities in relation to the \nproposed determination area in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs. They recognise, in accordance \nwith their traditional laws and customs, that certain individuals and family groups are associated with particular \nareas of country within the proposed determination area.  In Birriliburu, the native title holders were to be identified \nby relationships of descent from certain named apical ancestors: that is, the same method as proposed in this \nproceeding. That is notwithstanding the multiple pathways finding made by French J, to which I have just referred, \nwhich is similar to the multiple pathways argument relied on by the applicant in the present proceeding. At [22] his \nHonour noted, and (it can be inferred) accepted as appropriate, the parties\u2019 agreement that:... the narrowing of \npathways to group membership and rights in land does not represent an interruption in the acknowledgment and \nobservance of traditional laws and customs. It may represent a change or adaptation of those laws and customs, \nbut it is agreed that the change or adaptation is not of such a kind that the rights or interests now asserted are no \nlonger held under traditional laws and customs. Descent remains the means by which people acquire rights.  I note \nalso that, as his Honour observed at [23], Birriliburu was a claim where the claimants no longer lived in the claim \narea but his Honour did not see this as an impediment to the determination of native title in their favour because \n\u201cthey continue to assert their rights and carry out their responsibilities in accordance with their laws and customs\u201d.  I \nshould also make it clear that I do not accept the State\u2019s broad contention that the Wiluna and Birriliburu judgments \ncan be put to one side because they relate to country the claimants\u2019 ancestors migrated from, whereas the Tjiwarl \nclaim relates to country those ancestors migrated to. While it is true that the claimant evidence does disclose some \nancestors came from around Lake Carnegie (which is located in the eastern part of the Wiluna determination area), \nthe evidence does not support that proposition for the part of the Wiluna determination area immediately to the \nnorth of the Tjiwarl claim area, nor for the Tarlpa determination area, also immediately to the north of the Tjiwarl \nclaim area. Nor does the evidence support that proposition for the Birriliburu determination area. Even if it were the \ncase that all land and waters covered by these determinations could broadly be characterised as country the claim \ngroup members\u2019 ancestors \u201ccame from\u201d, in my opinion that would tend to support the claim rather than defeat it, \nbecause it would tend to suggest, as the applicant has suggested, migration within country with shared traditional \nlaws and customs. That is precisely the findings made by McKerracher J in Wiluna at [14(j)].\n\nBadimia  The State seeks to rely on Badimia in at least two ways. First, from the perspective of the State\u2019s \ncontentions about absence of connection, it was submitted that at sovereignty the relevant society in the claim area \nwas one whose laws and customs were akin to the groups to the west, such as Wajarri and Badimia.  For the \nreasons I have set out elsewhere in this judgment, I reject that proposition. In my opinion it is clear from the \nevidence, of both the claim group and Dr Sackett, that the Tjiwarl claim area is Western Desert country. However, \nit may also be the case, based on those sources of evidence, that land and waters covered by the Badimia claim is \nless likely to be Western Desert country. As Mr Bingham said in his evidence:Yamatji mob are that way, to the \nwest. They used to have law but I think it\u2019s gone out now, they lost it all years ago. I don\u2019t know that mob over at \nSandstone, they all Yamatji\u2019s from Cue, Sandstone, Mt Magnet. They all Wajarri mob, Badimia mob. Yamatji mob, \nthey don\u2019t talk about what we talk about. They have another way of talking about it too, different language. They\u2019ve \ngot a different way to say it. We have one way, that we know.  Second, the State submits the Court could reach the \nsame kind of findings Barker J reached in Badimiaconcerning the arrival of the apical ancestors of the claim group \ninto the claim area post-sovereignty, and the establishment of a non-traditional connection, through activities such \nas working on pastoral stations: see Badimia at [473]-[481]. For example, his Honour described the associations of \nthe claim group members in that case with the claim area as \u201chistorical\u201d rather than \u201ctraditional\u201d: see [476]-[478].  \nBarker J said:In this case, the evidence suggests, and the Court infers, that cultural information obtained by current \nclaimants was not acquired from people who have been shown, on the evidence, to be engaged in any normative \nsystem of law and culture of the Badimia people that has endured from sovereignty. Rather, claimants possess a \nrange of information that they have gained about the extent of Badimia country, places or sites of importance, and \ncultural practices, otherwise than as a part of a normative system of traditional Badimia law and custom. \n\n The life histories of the claimants who gave evidence \u2013 who are the principal members of the core group of \nBadimia people mentioned by Mr Robinson \u2013 tend to reinforce this conclusion. In most instances, they have been \nborn or brought up away from the claim area and without any exposure to the laws and customs traditionally \npracticed by Badimia people. Their evidence does not provide any real detail of the laws and customs that their \n\n\n\nancestors followed in the generations before them, save to assert that at least the claim area is within what they \nunderstand to be traditional Badimia country and that they are Badimia because they understand their old people \nwere Badimia people. Some know about some important beings, such as the Bimara, and try to protect and enjoy \nthe land and resources.\n\n While some of the claimants are closely connected as members of immediate families, there is little evidence \ntoday, or for many years, of a Badimia \u201csociety\u201d or community identified by laws and customs having force. In that \nsense, the acknowledgement and observance of traditional law and customs has been replaced by some other \nforce which binds the claimants and which is explained mostly by their historical association with the claim area and \neach other and their recognition of the cultural significance, in Aboriginal terms, of a number of places in the claim \narea.  As my findings elsewhere demonstrate (in both the section dealing with the length of association of the claim \ngroup with the claim area and in my acceptance of Dr Sackett\u2019s opinions) I do not consider the claim group \nmembers have only a \u201chistorical\u201d association with the land and waters of the claim area. In my opinion, they have a \nconnection borne out of traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert.\n\nWongatha  The applicant submits that the factual findings of Lindgren J in Wongatha and Sackville J in Jango \ncannot be used to support the State\u2019s contentions about the appropriate factual findings in this proceeding. The \napplicant submits the Court must proceed to make findings on the evidence before it, not adopt findings by another \ncourt, on different evidence. The applicant relies on two statements to that effect in Lindgren J\u2019s reasons \nthemselves, where his Honour was explaining how he approached the previous decision of the Full Court in De \nRose [2003] FCAFC 286; 133 FCR 325: see Wongatha at [305] and [501].  I accept this submission, and indeed \nLindgren J took the same approach in Wongatha. The State is correct that there may be \u201csome\u201d overlap in the \nevidence before Lindgren J and the evidence adduced in this case, but that does not alter the task of the Court, \nwhich is to consider the evidence and the arguments for itself, as they were presented in this proceeding.  In \nanswer to the State\u2019s reliance on what was said by Lindgren J in Wongatha (at [301]-[303] and [704]) about \nmigration to points of European contact, rather than in accordance with traditional laws and customs, the applicant \nmade alternative submissions. Either his Honour\u2019s findings should be confined to the decision in Wongatha on the \nbasis they were made on the evidence before him (a repeat of the more general submissions above); or if they \nwere to be seen as statements of legal principle, they should not be followed. On this alternative, the applicant \ncontends the Court should adopt the approach taken by the Full Court in De Rose [2003] FCAFC 286; 133 FCR \n325, namely: whether the rights asserted are in accordance with traditional laws and customs, including any \npermissible adaptation post-sovereignty. The applicant submits there should not be a hypothetical comparison (as \nthey submit Lindgren J undertook) with what might have happened had Europeans never arrived. I agree with the \napplicant\u2019s submission, although in my opinion Lindgren J\u2019s observations in Wongatha at [301]-[303] and [704] are \nconcerned with his Honour\u2019s fact finding in that case, on the basis of contentions put to him in that case, rather than \nany broader statement of general legal principle.  The State\u2019s submission on this matter is that \u201cLindgren J\u2019s \nstatements of legal principle, for example, that migration to points of European contact is not an adaptation of \ntraditional migration, are correct, apt and should be persuasive in this case.\u201d  This submission contains a number of \nassumptions I am not prepared to make, and also misunderstands the point being made in De Rose. The correct \nquestion, as the Full Court in De Rose made clear, is:... whether the appellants possessed rights and interests in \nthe claim area under the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed of the Western Desert Bloc. If by \nthose traditional laws and customs the appellants had sufficient links to the original native title holders as to acquire \nthe status of Nguraritja for the claim area, that would be enough, provided that they retained, by those laws and \ncustoms, a connection with the claim area.\n\n ... \n\n Unless Aboriginal people coming to the claim area from the west could ultimately be recognised under Western \nDesert traditional laws and customs as Nguraritja for sites or tracks within that area, they could not succeed in a \nnative title claim (at least not one founded on their status as Nguraritja). \n\n\n\n (Emphasis added.)  In other words, the movement (or \u201cmigration\u201d, as the State would have it) need not be \n\u201ctraditional\u201d, whatever that is intended to mean. To impose such a gloss would be effectively to defeat claimants \nwho were not living completely traditional lifestyles, and would be inconsistent with the recognition in Yorta Yorta \nthat there can be post-sovereignty adaptation, so long as the normative effects of traditional laws and customs \ncontinue to be observed.  Numerous subsequent cases have cited the relevant passages from Yorta Yorta with \napproval, or otherwise recognised that post-sovereignty adaptation is permissible within these confines: see, for \nexample: Sampi v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 at [961], [964]; Rubibi Community (No 5) v Western Australia \n[2005] FCA 1025 at [266]; Gudjala People #2 v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 1167 at [26]; Western Australia v \nSebastian [2008] FCAFC 65; 173 FCR 1 at [119]; AB (deceased) on behalf of the Ngarla People [2012] FCA \n1268;300 ALR 193 at [739]; Graham on behalf of the Ngadju People v Western Australia [2012] FCA 1455 at [49]; \nDempsey (No 2) [2014] FCA 528; 317 ALR 432 at [129], [688]; Croft (on behalf of Barngarla Native Title Claim \nGroup) v South Australia [2015] FCA 9; 325 ALR 213 at [640]; Rrumburriya Borroloola Claim Group v Northern \nTerritory of Australia [2016] FCA 776 at [302].  The reasons that Aboriginal people moved from one area to another \nmay be various. As I note elsewhere, one of the reasons which dominated the evidence in this case is that people \nmoved to escape the violence of white settlers towards them, in particular the pastoralist Tommy Mellon. This could \nnot be described as \u201ctraditional migration\u201d (if there is such a concept) because it only arose after the occupation of \nAboriginal land by a white settler. However, the reason for people moving may say little or nothing about whether \nthose people had \u201csufficient links\u201d with the original inhabitants of the claim area to be recognised as having the \nsame kind of rights and interests in the country into which they moved, and to have been accepted as having those \nrights and interests.\n\nCONCLUSION ON CONNECTION    My findings depend, ultimately, on the view I have taken about the reliability of \ndifferent kinds of evidence, and its provenance. I have preferred the evidence of the claim group members, and the \nopinions of Dr Sackett.  In the absence of any challenges to the credibility of the claimant witnesses, or through \nthem to the credibility of what their ancestors have told them, and passed on to them, concerning the nature and \nextent of their connection to the land and waters in the claim area, I consider it is more likely than not that:(1) First, \nthe land and waters in the claim area are and always have been Western Desert country.\n\n (2) Second, those Aboriginal people who were in occupation of the claim area at sovereignty were Western Desert \npeople who had rights and interests in the land and waters of the claim area in accordance with Western Desert \nlaws and customs.\n\n (3) Third, that some of those people were still in occupation and/or still alive when the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors came into the country more permanently and shared knowledge of the Tjukurrpa with them, recognising \nthe claim group members\u2019 ancestors as Western Desert people entitled to possess and exercise rights and interests \nin the country of the claim area in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs.\n\n (4) Fourth, a considerable number of the relatives and/or ancestors of the claim group members were associated \nwith, living in, and/or using land within the claim area in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries. They \nwere doing so in accordance with traditional Western Desert laws and customs. Those people included Ada \nBeaman, Biddy Foley (or Nyuringka), Koyl (or Jinguru), Rosie Jones (or Tjulyitjutu), Waiya, Jumbo Harris (or \nTjampula), Mickey Warren and Ruby Shay.\n\n (5) Fifth, the claim group members as a group recognise each other as entitled to those rights and interests and \nhave continued to observe them in accordance with traditional Western Desert laws and customs to the present \nday.  In terms of chronology, practicality and believability the claim group members have satisfied me of their \nconnection to this country. As part of summarising the approach I have taken, I refer to the description given by \nSelway J in Gumana at [211]:The evidence given by the Yolngu witnesses and the anthropologists in this regard is \nnot inherently unlikely. It is not inherently unlikely that a person may have a legal right to exclude, but that others \nare entitled to assume that they have permission to enter and use the land in the absence of any express exclusion. \n\n\n\n (Emphasis added.)  I refer to this not as any substitute for the ordinary application of burden of proof, nor do I \nconsider that is how Selway J was using these phrases. Rather, his Honour was referring to the believability of the \nYolngu evidence in that case and why, considered in context, what the Yolngu witnesses said was likely to be the \ncase.  That is the approach I have taken here. What the claimant witnesses have said in their evidence about the \nTjukurrpa in this country, about the sites, their obligations and responsibilities, the laws which govern how they \nconduct themselves on country and relate to it, and how they relate to each other as a group is coherent and \npersuasive. It is likely that their ancestors learned about this country from old people, perhaps very few in number, \nwho were still occupying the claim area when those ancestors came in. It is likely that some of the claim group \nmembers\u2019 ancestors had prior connections with this country in accordance with Western Desert tradtional laws and \ncustoms, and with its original occupants, before they came in more permanently. It is also likely, on the evidence, \nthat some of the claim group members\u2019 ancestors had been in the claim area for some time prior to the work done \nby Daisy Bates to the north of the claim area. That is the conclusion I have reached after consideration of the \ngenealogies. It is not possible to find on the balance of probabilities any more than these were Western Desert \npeople living traditional lives in the claim area around the turn of the century. Were they the \u201coriginal\u201d inhabitants in \nthe way the parties, and Dr Sackett, have used that term? Perhaps some were. Certainly, that is how Ms Bates \ntreated Jinguru (Koyl), and the State seemed to accept that position.  It is inherently unlikely that between about \n1912 and 1930 there was absolutely no Aboriginal person left in or around the claim area who had rights and \ninterests in the land and waters in the claim area which were derived from a pre-sovereignty period. It is inherently \nunlikely in times where traditional laws and customs were still relatively strong, a group of strangers \u2013 with \ncompletely different laws and traditions \u2013 moved into the claim area and made up Dreamings, sites, stories and \nimposed foreign law, on country that was traditionally associated with very different laws and customs, without \nobjection and in a way which only a decade or two later, appeared to those who learned about it to have been going \non since before European contact.  I do not accept the State\u2019s written submission (at [132]) that the \u201cCourt must \nmake positive findings in respect of the membership and geographical extent of the Western Desert Cultural Bloc\u201d \nboth at sovereignty and today (and during each generation in between). Aside from the use of the imperative, this \nsubmission is cast too broadly. It is not the task of the Court in this case to determine \u201cthe membership and \ngeographical extent of the Western Desert Cultural Bloc\u201d. It is the Court\u2019s task to determine whether the applicant \nhas made out their claim to native title, and whether the land and waters in the claim areas were held at sovereignty \nby persons who had rights and interests in that country in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs, and \nwhether those interests were passed or transmitted to, or otherwise acquired by, the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors, again in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs. It should not be any part of the Court\u2019s task \nto decide where the (in my opinion misnamed) Western Desert Cultural Bloc begins and ends. I say that without \naccepting such a task is possible, or desirable.\n\nThe claim group as a subset of Western Desert society    The agreed position is that there is a \u201csociety\u201d of people \nwho are united in their observance of, and adherence to, the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert. It \nis also agreed that within that broader society there are smaller landholding groups, which can be reliably identified \nin accordance with the principles in Yorta Yorta, as united in their shared observance of traditional laws and custom \nin relation to an area of land or waters.  In De Rose (No 2), the Full Court (Wilcox, Sackville and Merkel JJ), found \nthat the native title holders were a subset of a society comprising the Western Desert Bloc. The Full Court\u2019s \nconsideration of this issue is set out as follows (at [38]-[40], [44]):It is hardly likely that the traditional laws and \ncustoms of Aboriginal peoples will themselves classify rights and interests in relation to land as \u201ccommunal\u201d, \u201cgroup\u201d \nor \u201cindividual\u201d. The classification is a statutory construct, deriving from the language used in Mabo (No 2). If it is \nnecessary for the purposes of proceedings under the NTA to distinguish between a claim to communal native title \nand a claim to group or individual native title rights and interests, the critical point appears to be that communal \nnative title presupposes that the claim is made on behalf of a recognisable community of people, whose traditional \nlaws and customs constitute the normative system under which rights and interests are created and acknowledged. \nThat is, the traditional laws and customs are those of the very community which claims native title rights and \ninterests. By contrast, group and individual native title rights and interests derive from a body of traditional laws and \ncustoms observed by a community, but are not necessarily claimed on behalf of the whole community. Indeed, they \nmay not be claimed on behalf of any recognisable community at all, but on behalf of individuals who themselves \nhave never constituted a cohesive, functioning community.\n\n\n\n The distinction between group and individual rights and interests (to the extent it matters) is perhaps more difficult \nto identify. An example of group rights and interests may be those held by a subset of a wider community, the \ntraditional laws and customs of which determine who has interests in particular sites or areas. The members of the \nsubset may or may not themselves be an identifiable community, but their rights and interests are determined by \nthe traditional laws and customs observed by the wider community. The members of the subset might be expected, \nunder the traditional laws and customs, to share common characteristics in relation to certain land or waters, such \nas rights and responsibilities as the custodians of particular sites. Ordinarily, it might be expected that the \u201cgroup\u201d \nholding native title rights and interests would have fluctuating membership, the composition of which would be \ndetermined by the relevant body of traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed. \n\n A person holding individual native title rights and interests, by contrast, may not necessarily share common \ncharacteristics, in relation to land or waters, with other members of that community under the relevant body of \ntraditional laws and customs. Unless the traditional laws and customs provide for the individual rights and interests \nto be transmitted to other community members, they presumably will terminate upon the death of the holder. \n\n ...\n\n If it is necessary to classify the rights and interests claimed by the appellants in the present case, they are best \nregarded as group rights and interests, rather than individual rights and interests. It is true that the appellants do \nnot claim to be a discrete or functioning community and that the normative system on which they rely for their rights \nand interests is that of the wider Western Desert Bloc. But the appellants claim to be Nguraritja for the claim area \nand, by virtue of that status, they have common rights and responsibilities under the laws and customs of the \nWestern Desert Bloc in relation to the claim area (although not necessarily in relation to precisely the same sites or \ntracks). Moreover, the appellants claim on behalf of all people who are Nguraritja for the claim area. The \ncomposition of that class will vary from time to time depending upon who can satisfy the rules identified by the \nprimary judge for identifying Nguraritja ... On the appellant\u2019s case, native title rights and interests over the claim \narea will not cease on the death of the last survivor among them. \n\n (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)  In Birriliburu, French J recorded the following at [17]:Most of the claimants \nreside at Wiluna, Jigalong, Patjarr, Warnarn, Warakurna and Parngurr which are close to, but not inside, the \nproposed determination area. Together with people from other parts of the Western Desert they describe \nthemselves as Martu. They share a body of laws and customs with other Western Desert groups. They \nacknowledge shared beliefs and rituals and gather for ceremonial purposes. Some of them are recognised native \ntitle holders in neighbouring Western Desert areas. It is agreed between the parties, however, that the claimants are \nidentifiable as a subset of the wider Western Desert society, being members of 17 family groups and other \nindividuals recognised as custodians with rights and responsibilities in relation to the proposed determination area \nin accordance with Western Desert laws and customs. They recognise, in accordance with their traditional laws and \ncustoms, that certain individuals and family groups are associated with particular areas of country within the \nproposed determination area.  See also Wongatha at [536]-[537] (Lindgren J) and Bodney at [144]-[146] (Finn, \nSundberg and Mansfield JJ).  The description by French J is in my opinion particularly apposite here. The members \nof the claim group form a subset of wider Western Desert society. On the evidence, there is a shared \nacknowledgment of each other\u2019s rights and interests in the land in the claim area, albeit with clearly identified \ndemarcations of which family groups, and which people within those family groups, can speak for different parts of \nthe claim area. However, none of the evidence suggested there was any dissent from the view that all members of \nthe claim group were united in their shared continued observance of traditional Western Desert laws and customs in \nrelation to the way they hold and transmit rights and interests in their country.  There was ample evidence from the \nclaimant witnesses about the way in which they recognised each other\u2019s rights and interests in the claim area. A \nsummary is set out in the applicant\u2019s written submissions at [346]-[366]. As there was no real dispute about this \nissue, it is sufficient to note some examples of that evidence.  Ms Wonyabong gave a comprehensive picture in her \nevidence of how the various family groups within the claim group fitted together, and which parts of the claim area \n\n\n\nthey were recognised by others as able to speak for, by reason of it being their ngurra. Much of the evidence I \nextract below is also relevant in relation to the multiple pathways still recognised by the claim group members in \nterms of rights and interests in country.I\u2019m connected to this Tjiwarl country more than Wiluna [recalling Ms \nWonyabong is a native title holder in the Wiluna determination] because I grew up there. I was living there and \nworking there. I\u2019d rather claim Yeelirrie, Albion Downs, Yakabindie, and Mount Keith; this is my ngurra.\n\n ...\n\n I can talk for Yeelirrie, Yakabindie and Albion Downs. I can talk for Mount Keith, because it is part of Yakabindie \nand Albion Downs really. I don\u2019t speak for Leinster, because I only ever went there on holidays, and I don\u2019t speak \nfor the Booylgoo Ranges.\n\n I wouldn\u2019t speak for places that aren\u2019t my country. If someone asked me to go out to somewhere that wasn\u2019t my \ncountry, like Booylgoo Ranges, I would say \u201cI don\u2019t know that country, it\u2019s not my country\u201d. Keith Narrier or Brett \nLewis, they could give the okay for that area. I might get growled at if it wasn\u2019t my place and I gave the okay.\n\n ...\n\n All of the families on the claim can speak for Lake Miranda. That\u2019s because that is the tjukurrpa there \u2013 the one \nabout the red sandhill and the lake.\n\n Richard and Keith Narrier know the country of the claim area well. Roslyn and Graham Narrier, Jennifer Narrier, \nthey all know of the stories right through. The story of the carpet snake comes a long way. Roslyn Narrier was told, \nby her mum Dolly Walker, that she had to look after the stories on the woman\u2019s side. Kado and Jennifer\u2019s mother, \nDolly Walker, she told all her kids the stories. Kado knows all that country too, with Graham and Keith and Richard \n[Narrier], and he\u2019s been through the law.\n\n My cousin Ted Tullock, he was born out at Jones Creek, where the dreaming for the water snake went through, \nrunning from the dragonfly. Ted Tullock\u2019s mother was living on Yakabindie and Yeelirrie a long time ago. Ted \nTullock was my mother\u2019s nephew; his mother and my mother were sisters who came from Barwidgee, Darlot and \nthe Tjiwarl claim area. Scotty Tullock, Bobby Kelly and Harvey [Scadden] were the three brothers, and they had the \nsame mum, called Naringa; Biddy they used to call her. Ted Tullock\u2019s children, they can claim for that area.\n\n The Hennesseys, Harrises, Beamans can all claim for Leinster.The Ellisons can too \u2013 Creamy and Monty \u2013 and I \nthink Geraldine Hogarth, she can talk for Leinster. Creamy and Monty used to live there, and grew up in Leinster \nDowns. Creamy and Monty\u2019s mother was Mavis Narrier, and their father was a non-Aboriginal man.\n\n The Harrises went to Albion Downs schooling their kids. They can say it is their ngurra, because they lived there, \nwent to school there. Cecily Harris [deceased] used to stay there, and school the kids. She used to go up and down \nto Yakabindie. The Ashwins can say that Albion Downsis their ngurra too, because Alfie Ashwin was working \nthrough Albion Downsand Yeelirrie\n\n If a person from Mt Magnet came and went to Albion Downs for school, they couldn\u2019t have said it was their ngurra; \nthey\u2019re different, and other people will say \u2018well they\u2019re not from that country\u2019. Their own family will say \u2018well we not \nfrom there\u2019.\n\n The Beamans were born in Leonora, but they can still claim Yakabindie as their ngurra. Their father and mother \nwas there, and then when they had them they grew up there, and their mother and father had a camp near North \n\n\n\nEnd, an outstation for Yakabindie, near Tjiwarl. They used to go to school from there to Albion Downs. That\u2019s Roy \nBeaman, and Joyce, and they had Maxine, Theo and Edwin.\n\n Brett Lewis\u2019 mother and father \u2013 old Scotty and Mary Lewis \u2013 had a camp near there too, and Brett\u2019s mother used \nto take Brett and all the kids to school.\n\n People in the claim, even young people, they know what they can talk for and what they can\u2019t talk for. People don\u2019t \ntalk up when they shouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t think of a time when anyone broke that rule.\n\n Keith Narrier can talk for the whole Tjiwarl claim area.  As an example of a younger claimant witness who gave \nsimilar evidence, I refer to the evidence of Mr Leroy Beaman:If other families are connected to that country then it\u2019s \nright, they can claim it. Mostly, I don\u2019t know if that Wiluna mob know the area. The Ashwins know Lake Way, Mt \nKeith and Yeelirrie, the top of that area of the claim. But I don\u2019t know if they know further down there at Yakabindie \nor Leinster and that. The Wonyabongs, Nanna Lizzie and Shirley and Pop Harvey [Scadden], they used to live there \nat Yakabindie, they on this Tjiwarl claim.\n\n The only family that I used to bump into out there when I was a kid was the Narriers. Nanna Jennifer, Pop Keith \nand Pop Hounddog. When I say \u201cPop Hounddog\u201d, I mean Graham Narrier, sometimes I call him \u201cPop Tjupan\u201d as \nwell. Pop Kado and Zabar Muir mob they from this claim too.\n\n Them Elliotts-Clause family. They speak that language now, Tjupan. We used to bump into that mob up this way \naround Albion Downs and Yakabindie when they used to come for their holidays.\n\n The Harris family is another mob on this claim. I say mum Gay Harris because she helped grown me up. I used to \nstay with her and go bush with her a lot around Leinster and Yakabindie, she grew up there with my grandmother \nJoyce.\n\n ...\n\n An elder is a leader and they show others the right way to do things when you\u2019re out bush. Leadership is the main \nthing an elder should do. My auntie, Maxine Beaman, she\u2019s the eldest in my family; she\u2019s one of my elders. My \nother elders are also Aunty Gay Harris, Nanna Shirley and Lizzie Wonyabong, Jennifer Narrier and the other \nNarriers.  Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s evidence was:Some of the other families for this claim are the Beamans, Harris\u2019, \nWonyabongs, Ashwins, Allisons, Hennesseys, James\u2019, Tullocks and Lewis\u2019. They all speak for that area too. The \nKellys was on it from old Bob Kelly, but there\u2019s no more of them around.\n\n ...\n\n The elders have all passed away and we take it over now \u2013 me, Richard, Jennifer, Shirley and Lizzy Wonyabong \nand all them. An elder has to look after everyone; look after the country.  Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence was as \nfollows:Some of the others for this country are Lizzie and Shirley Wonyabong, the Beamans; Harrises, Redmonds, \nNarriers and Monty and Creamy [Allison], because they stay in those areas and grew up around Leinster and \nAltona there. Mrs [Doris] Foley and her son Lenny Ashwin and his children and grandchildren, they\u2019re from this \ncountry too.\n\n\n\n You also have the Hennesseys, but most of them come under the Abdullahs, like that now. The Abdullahs, their \nfather come from down south, a Ngoongar out from Perth and their mother is a step-sister to Monty and Creamy \n[Allison], she\u2019s from this country.\n\n With the Harris\u2019s, really their grandfather come from up that way too, Wongawol side. Been coming down this way \nand living down this way, Leonora way and Darlot and ended up around Yakabindie. Like Gay Harris and her sister \n[Cecily Harris] was more or less at Yakabindie all their life. When I used to work there I remember seeing Jodi \nHarris and Murray Harris when they was just kids when we was working around Yakabindie and Mt Keith and that.\n\n The Beamans had a camp at North End near Yakabindie; we used to go there from Albion Downs and visit them, \neven from Wiluna we would go there and visit them. All the old people used to camp there, Maxine and Eddie \n[Beaman] mobs\u2019 parents and uncles and that.\n\n In the south-western part of the claim, you got to ask the other mob about the tjukurrthere; like Brett Lewis and his \nmob. Old Scotty Lewis he come from that Tjiwarl country too, he been right through here that\u2019s his country there. \nHe been right around this area, shearing and that. He grew up through here. He tied in with all our families, we all \none family group.\n\n Some other old people used to live there too, like the Hill brothers.\n\n When I worked at Yeelirrie Dion Redmond grandfather used to work there too. Old Wimie Redmond used to work \nat Yeelirrie, he worked with me. He got to know the country when he was working there, he been there for a few \nyears.  It might also be said that evidence such as this from Mr Ashwin also illustrates the point the State wishes to \nmake \u2013 namely, that the movement of some families into the area is recent and associated with working on the \npastoral stations. This kind of evidence does illustrate this aspect of the families\u2019 history. However as I have \nattempted to explain in these reasons, that history is neither uniform in timing nor in the character and extent of the \nmovement, and it must be considered together with other evidence about established connections with original \noccupants in the claim area, with the Tjukurrpa of the claim area, and with the workings of Western Desert laws and \ncustoms.  Finally, the evidence of Mr Patterson confirmed that, as a Western Desert man from a neighbouring claim \narea, he recognised the members of the claim group as entitled to speak for the country of the claim area. I have \nset out his evidence at [775] above. There is no reason to doubt that when he made these statements Mr Patterson \nhad in mind that their entitlement to do so was in accordance with traditional laws and customs of the Western \nDesert, and he was not cross-examined to suggest otherwise.  As the applicant also notes in this part of their \nsubmissions, there is no evidence of other individuals or groups asserting they have competing rights and interests \nin the claim area, or disputing the entitlements of any of the claim group members. There was a slight suggestion \nfrom Dr Brunton to this effect in relation to a portion of the south-west of the claim area, but as the applicant notes \nin their submissions, no Badimia person has come forward in the duration of this proceeding (taking into account \nthe function of the notice provisions in the NT Act: see Badimia [2016] FCAFC 67; 240 FCR 466 at [52]; [60]-[61]) to \nassert any such rights or interests and the Court is able to take the absence of any such assertion as between \nneighbouring and contemporaneous claimants as reliable evidence that no such claims are made. Further, I do not \nconsider the situation in the claim area resembles that discussed by the Full Court in Banjima People v Western \nAustralia [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at [54], which concerned shared rights at sovereignty, but no \ncontemporary assertion by another group of such shared rights. That is not this case, on the findings I have made. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish that any other group, and certainly that a non-Western Desert group, held \nrights and interests in the claim area at sovereignty.\n\nCONTINUITY    It is important to recall that what has come to be expressed, by way of shorthand, as a requirement \nfor \u201ccontinuity\u201d of connection arose in Yorta Yorta through the Court\u2019s analysis of the meaning of two particular \naspects of the definition of native title in s 223 of the NT Act: first, the meaning of the word \u201cpossessed\u201d when it is \nused in relation to interests in land and waters; and second, the meaning of the word \u201ctraditional\u201d when it is used \nadjectively in relation to laws and customs.  It is worth recalling again how Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ \n\n\n\nexpressed this at [46]-[47]:As the claimants submitted, \u201ctraditional\u201d is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission \nof law or custom. A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a \nsociety, usually by word of mouth and common practice. But in the context of the Native Title Act, \u201ctraditional\u201d \ncarries with it two other elements in its meaning. First, it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions: the \norigins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown. It is only those \nnormative rules that are \u201ctraditional\u201d laws and customs.\n\n Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under \ntraditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, requires that the \nnormative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and customs) is a system \nthat has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed \nthroughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  And at [50], their Honours said:To speak of rights and interests possessed under an \nidentified body of laws and customs is, therefore, to speak of rights and interests that are the creatures of the laws \nand customs of a particular society that exists as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and \ncustoms. And if the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which \nacknowledges and observes those laws and customs, those laws and customs cease to have continued existence \nand vitality. Their content may be known but if there is no society which acknowledges and observes them, it \nceases to be useful, even meaningful, to speak of them as a body of laws and customs acknowledged and \nobserved, or productive of existing rights or interests, whether in relation to land or waters or otherwise.  Despite the \nbreadth of the Court\u2019s observations in these passages concerning the need for \u201ccontinuous existence and vitality\u201d in \ntraditional laws and customs, it is in my respectful opinion important to recall that the definition in s 223 is \nconcerned with rights and interests in land and waters held in accordance with traditional laws and customs. The \nfocus of the definition, and indeed the focus of the NT Act, is on the body of traditional laws and customs observed \nin relation to the acquisition, possession and exercise of rights and interests in land and waters. The NT Act is not, \nfor example, concerned with traditional laws and customs concerning social structures unless those laws and \ncustoms are relevant to the way rights and interests in land and waters are acquired and transmitted, or the content \nof those rights determined.  In assessing continuity (if that shorthand expression might be used) the central \nquestion is whether the traditional laws and customs of a claim group which relate to the acquisition, transmission \nand exercise of rights and interests in land and waters are recognised and observed by claim group members as a \nliving normative system in substantially the same form they had at sovereignty (allowing for permissible adaptation, \nas I discuss below).  So, for example, in terms of weighing and assessing evidence about continuity, the fact that \u2013 \nas in this case \u2013 some traditional laws and customs, such as those concerning the skin system, may be seen to \nhave broken down and become somewhat confused is of less weight in the determination of the continuity required \nunder s 223. See, to this effect, observations of the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110;145 FCR 290 \nat [63].  It is also appropriate to recall, as the State submits, that continued recognition and observance is assessed \nat the level of the group as a whole, rather than each and every individual member of it; and what constitutes \nsufficient acknowledgement and recognition will be a question of fact and degree in each case: see De Rose (No 2) \nat [58].\n\nThe State\u2019s concession on continuity if the Court finds Western Desert people occupied the claim area at \nsovereignty    The State\u2019s written submissions make some valid points about some of the traditional laws and \ncustoms of the claim group which are either \u201cpatchy\u201d or confused. The skin system evidence is the key example. \nNotwithstanding these submissions, the State properly made the following concession:Nevertheless, despite the \nuneven and often contradictory evidence and the clearly diminished nature of the laws and customs said to be (and \nto have been) acknowledged and observed by the claimants, the First Respondent accepts there is sufficient \nevidence for the Court to find that, if native title rights and interests were obtained by the claimants\u2019 ancestors, then \nat least some of those rights and interests have endured until the present day.\n\n\n\nContinuing recognition of traditional laws and customs within the claim group    Although I have accepted the force \nof some of the State\u2019s submissions on the continuity of some of the traditional laws and customs, the aspects of the \ntraditional laws and customs which appear to have weakened most amongst members of the claim group are not \nthe aspects which are most closely associated with the possession and enjoyment of rights and interests in land; \nrather, they are some of the social aspects of the traditional laws and customs.  There was ample evidence about \nthe firm view of the claim group members that the law continued to be observed and practiced in the claim area, \nand they gave that evidence by comparison with other areas where the law was no longer practiced. An example is \nthe following evidence from Mr Leroy Beaman. What Mr Beaman said about his father in the first paragraph of the \nbelow extract also confirms the continuing importance of the practice of the law to a person\u2019s position within a \ngroup, how the law is enforced and by whom. This evidence also illustrates the clear connection the claim group \nmembers see between the law in the claim area and the law in other areas recognised by this Court, by the State, \nand by the Aboriginal people concerned on all sides, as Western Desert country:If you do the wrong thing as a \nwati, you might cop a spear through the leg or you get a hiding. The old people will pull up and say \u201cWhat you \ndoing? Misbehaving!\u201d and then they might hit you. You can\u2019t hit them back because you not allowed to; you just \nhave to sit there. They will take you somewhere and tell you that you got to face your trouble. My dad isn\u2019t a tribal \nman so he couldn\u2019t do nothing, and he would take me down to face my trouble. If he was a tribal man, then he could \nstick up for me, and say \u201cthat\u2019s my son\u201d and he could take the punishment or face the trouble with me, side-by-side.\n\n My mother\u2019s side, they don\u2019t do that. Their culture died out a long time ago when my mother\u2019s mother was a little \ngirl. Keith Narrier saw that last ceremony they did there at Nallan Dam. They closed the law down over there but \nthey still speak their language and that. If they wanted to become a lawman then they would have to go to Wiluna or \nRoebourne.\n\n They never closed the law down for this country. I would have known if they would have closed it down. The law \nstill there because it runs from Wiluna and the other laws around. The Ngaanyatjarra people, and even the South \nAustralia mob, come out and they camp on the side of the road here, in the bush. That\u2019s how the law is still running, \nbecause they still travelling through, even along the back tracks to Leinster, taking shortcuts to Wiluna.\n\n The desert law in Warburton is similar to here and in Wiluna. It\u2019s been there for that many years, it stays there. The \nlaw for that place will always be there, it will never change. It won\u2019t go nowhere for anyone. People in this country, \nthe Wongai, Tjupan and Ngalia mob, they do law mainly in Wiluna and go east that side. That\u2019s towards Warburton.  \nThere was ample evidence of continuing observance of transmission of knowledge and responsibility for particular \nparts of the claim area. For example, Mr James\u2019 evidence about Lake Miranda was:For example, the red sand dune \non Lake Miranda, Yulkapa, that person who had custodianship of that area, passed away a few years back and so \nher daughter became responsible for some aspects of the story there, that was their tjukurrpa. I think Aunty Angline \nand Aunty Adeline Narrier/Hennessey and even Aunty Dolly [Walker] had the custodianship over that part of the \nCarpet Snake dreaming and it passed on to some of their direct descendants, like Colleen Berry Vicky McCabe and \nSally [Abdullah] and to Jennifer and Rosslyn Narrier. Shirley and Lizzie Wonyabong also speak for the country \naround there.  Other aspects of traditional laws and customs which, on the evidence before me, remained central to \nthe lives of the claim group members and their connection to their country included their practices concerning the \ntaking of resources from country, including ritual observances about killing and eating of certain animals especially \nkangaroo. The Court saw evidence of this during the on country hearing, and it was also apparent in much of the \nwritten claimant evidence.  Mr Richard Narrier gave some detailed evidence about hunting practices, and said this \nabout preparing kangaroo:Lot\u2019s of rules about kangaroo. You got t[o] cook it in the ground; cut him up the right way. \nYou get the legs off and cut it through the middle. You use any sort of wood, mulga or that, for the fire.  Mr Henry \nAshwin gave the following evidence with respect to killing and cooking kangaroo:This good country to go hunting, \ntake the kids for school holidays and things like that. When we go hunting in that country we look for kangaroo, \ngoanna, emu eggs. Too much kangaroo, too much emu, too much turkeys, porcupine and all them things.\n\n\n\n We cook kangaroo the same way that them elders used to do it, got to be cut the same way. Put them in the \nground to cook and prepare them the same way, we only cut it one way, there\u2019s no other way to cut it for desert \npeople. If you cut it another way then you breaking the law and you get sick, might die.\n\n My dad taught me how to cook kangaroo when I was growing up. We did it everyday. These days we hunt with \nrifles and kangaroo dogs; before white people came we used spears. You would wait at the waterhole or hideaway \nand then when they come and drink you could spear them.\n\n We trade food with each other. If I got lots of kangaroo and that person got no kangaroo but a couple of goanna, I\u2019ll \ntrade him. I\u2019ll give him one of my things for a goanna. There\u2019s a lot of trading, you got to look after each other. \nThat\u2019s the way you can still be a family.\n\n If I got too much kangaroo I might just give it up. Take it to elder peoples and share it up with them too. The bloke \nthat done the most hard work takes the best bits, then he leave the rest for whoever.  Further on this topic, Ms \nGeraldine Hogarth said as follows:I don\u2019t own the land; it owns me, and my people. It owns the people who look \nafter it, and harvest it. There\u2019s nothing on my country that I can\u2019t harvest. I can take all the food that is in season, \nas long as you only take what you need. We kill the kangaroo so it can keep going; we don\u2019t kill during breeding \ntimes. Like with emu eggs, you got to leave some eggs for the father to sit on, not take the whole lot.\n\n I can take the kulyu [bush potato] plants from under the ground, and dig for the bush onions, and the goanna from \nunderground.\n\n We don\u2019t tend to hunt the jilkamarta [echidna] anymore because other food is plentiful. When you kill one, you do \none hit, and sing it a little song; when you kill it you\u2019re explaining why. And then you put it on the hot dirt - not the \nashes - to burn off the spikes. When the spikes have burned off, and it\u2019s flat, then you put him in the hole. It tastes \nlovely, very nice! Uncle Brett Lewis he knows that song - all the nannas painted him up and had him sing the song, \nand they was really happy. He was a really special kid.  Ms Hogarth also gave some restricted evidence regarding \nthe teaching of young women about the use of natural resources from the claim area.  Mr Victor Ashwin gave the \nfollowing evidence on hunting and cooking:Lots of people from Wiluna go out there looking for emu eggs. People \nwho aren\u2019t on this claim they don\u2019t come this far, usually if someone comes from further away they will ask \nsomebody to take them out.\n\n In our culture, we share what we hunt; that\u2019s our way. Part of our culture is sharing what we hunt. We give it out to \nfamily members, anybody really. Back in Wiluna we share our meat out. We look after the old people first.\n\n Whatever people need they can, and do, take from the country. The old people taught me that you can take \nenough for your fridge or your freezer, but you can\u2019t just leave it lying around. If you got a bit extra you can maybe \ngive it away. In the bush, you give them meat and share, maybe next time they\u2019ll pay you back. Give you meat back \nor something else. We call that Ngyapagi-ngyapagi, like give and take.  I found Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence \nespecially persuasive, bearing in mind my earlier observations about what an impressive witness he was:Through \ninitiation, singing songs and stories; you keep it strong. Each generation you tell them where they allowed to go and \nwhere they not allowed to go. Anyone will tell you. Some of the old ladies they know and they tell the younger ones. \nKids, they tell them from a little age, that\u2019s how you keep that strong because you tell them from an early age. It\u2019s \nngurlugka, not allowed to go there, it\u2019s sacred. It\u2019s mans business or womens business there.\n\n That\u2019s the job of an elder now, where they allowed to go what they allowed to do. They teach them all, take them \nout hunting and all that. Same with a kangaroo and all that, you don\u2019t just get a kangaroo and that you got to cook it \nproperly, the right way. How to take the guts out. You can get in trouble if you break the law, if you don\u2019t clean the \n\n\n\nkangaroo properly. You got to gut him properly, you got to cook him in the ashes, there\u2019s one way you got to do it. \nSome places they can kill you for that. Out that way, through the centre [Ngaanyatjarra Lands]. You make trouble \nand you make trouble for your family, you know. You still hear about that, you not allowed to do that, the elders tell \nyou and they tell all the younger generations. You gotta show them when they young. The young boys, you gotta \nshow them how to clean it, how to cook it.\n\n If I saw someone cooking it the wrong way I\u2019d tell them \u201cNo! You don\u2019t do that that\u2019s the wrong way; you do it like \nthis!\u201d Even before the boys get initiated we tell them how to cook the kangaroo and emu and things like that. How \nyou gotta gut them and cook them. That\u2019s handed down from generation to generation.\n\n They\u2019ll tell them, \u201cArgh! No. You don\u2019t do that. Otherwise you\u2019ll get in trouble. Or make a trouble for your family\u201d \nThey stop them before they do it. Anybody will tell them. Even like lady folks, some of the old ladies will tell them \noff.  The claimant evidence showed that death rituals, intimately connected with country, continued. For example, \nMr Victor Ashwin\u2019s evidence was:I seen my grandmothers making baskets and hairbelts and they put them there for \ndoing the funeral, the second funeral. That\u2019s their payment for doing the second funeral now. When a person pass \naway here, within six months or twelve months, the family cut their hair and make hair belts and sometimes make \nthem baskets things. The brother-in-law of the deceased person, that\u2019s their job. In the old days they would leave \nhairbelts, spears, boomerangs, baskets, whatever you can make from the bush - that was the payment for \norganizing the sorry camp. Her and her same skin group, like her brothers and sisters, they have to do it, the \nreburial. As soon as they go back and clean out the gravesite, then they go back and finish everything there, then \neverything will be laid out for them there. These days people have blankets for the payment.\n\n When it first happen, someone pass away, you can\u2019t eat kangaroo, you have to eat hill kangaroo. After the second \nfuneral you can eat it again.  Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence was as follows:When someone dies we can\u2019t say their \nname so we say \u2018nyaparu\u2019 or you call them \u2018kumuna\u2019.\n\n When someone dies, like the person got to be a grandson or a jamu or like a brother-in-law that organise the \nfuneral. They bring the family in when you meeting and bury someone. It\u2019s got to be done like that. The sons and \ndaughters can\u2019t do that, mothers and father can\u2019t do that. They got to wait. The wife or the husband, they got to do \nit. The jamu, grandsons and granddaughters got to do that, sister-in law or brother-in law, organise the funeral and \nthings like that.\n\n Sometimes they take the dead persons things and they burn them. Sometimes things like law side are handed \ndown to the sons and grandsons, like that. Same with ladies. You got to give things to the right people, the right \nfamily.  There was ample evidence about the continued use of Western Desert dialects (Tjupan, Koara and Martu in \nparticular) amongst the claimant witnesses, and that was also evident during the on country hearings.  As I have \nrecognised earlier in these reasons, while language may not necessarily be a strong indicator of rights and \ninterests in a particular area of land, it is capable, in my opinion, of having some weight in the assessment whether \nthere is a continued, living normative system of laws and customs. Here, the continued use of Western Desert \nlanguage by claim group members as a core element of the continued observance of their laws and customs is not \nwithout significance. I consider the following passages from Dr Clendon\u2019s report and oral evidence respectively bear \nout the links between continuing tradition and language, while acknowledging it may say less about rights over \nparticular land. In his report, Dr Clendon states:Bates, as nearly all other observers among \u2018primitive\u2019 people until \nrecently, was working within a model of society that equated race with culture and with language, which together \nconstituted the bounded ethnic group; this last being a largely theoretical construct coming out of a European \npolitical ideology which partitioned landscapes along just these lines. Australian society in the arid zone, in contrast, \nappears to have consisted of networks of kin and ceremonial totemic or \u2018dreaming\u2019 relationships that frequently \noperated over considerable distances and in more than one language. Individuals identified with their places of birth \nor childhood, and held these places to be their homes, with their extended home countries radiating thence \n\n\n\noutwards in a core \u2013 fadeout disposition. Individuals were and are the embodiment of the intersection of the four \nlineages represented by their grandparents. This understanding of social identity, and of society and sociality more \ngenerally, was and is not confined to speakers of the Western Desert Language.\n\n (Citations omitted.)  He also gave the following oral evidence during re-examination:What Aboriginal people in \nthese places tend to do, in my experience, is indicate a series of places, and these places will be named as \nbelonging to particular families. They never \u2013 they characteristically do not speak in terms of boundaries. They \nname places that belong to particular families, and those families may speak one language or they may speak two \nlanguages. For instance, there\u2019s a \u2013 a family name in the Great Sandy Desert, Girriwadi. And members of that \nfamily speak both the Manjtjiltjara dialect of the Western Desert language and Wanman language as a distinct \nlanguage, but the sites all belong to them \u2013 the places all belong to them. I don\u2019t know how you draw a non-fuzzy \u2013 \nI don\u2019t know how you draw a boundary there. You would have \u2013 simply have to say a zone where on one side of \nthat zone the Manjtjiltjara is spoken, on the other side Wanman is spoken.\n\n Yes. All right. And do I take it from that answer then that, in your opinion, the better view is to locate \u2013 the location \ncan be place specific rather than drawing lines?---Yes, absolutely.\n\n And what you can say is in that place, you get speakers of this language or that language or both?---Yes. Yes.\n\n And then what inferences you draw from that is a different question?---Yes.  Another aspect of traditional laws and \ncustoms which on the evidence remains strong amongst the claim group members is the observance of totems. \nThese are connected with a person\u2019s birth, but also with their country. A remarkable example is the evidence of Ms \nNarrier where she said:That watja is important to me and my granddaughter, Irandia. It is like my own tjukurrpa, and \nIrandia has the same one. My mum was waiting for me, and she used to dig a lot. She was picking them plants, in \nthe middle of a stream in the Booylgoo Ranges. She found a white potato, and that told her that she was pregnant \nwith me. I have a mark on my navel the same shape as those ranges. My mum told me the story of that.\n\n It is the same for my granddaughter Irandia. We were out in that country when my daughter Amanda dug up a \nreally big watja with a funny shape \u2013 it looked like a little person. That is how we knew that Irandia was on her way. \nIrandia has a little mark on her head near her left ear; that\u2019s where the watja got a little mark from the crowbar when \nwe were digging it up...\n\n Because watja is my tjukurrpa, I can\u2019t eat it, because then I\u2019m eating myself! If Irandia have a little taste of it, she\u2019ll \nsay \u2018yuck!\u2019 because it is part of her.  A photograph of her granddaughter\u2019s mark was annexed to Ms Narrier\u2019s \nstatement, and indeed Irandia came to the on country hearings so that her special mark could be seen firsthand.  \nMs Harris also gave some vivid evidence on this:A jarrin is the sign of a female getting pregnant. The old people \ndidn\u2019t know about medical symptoms, but they knew a lady was pregnant if they were getting lots of something \nwhen they were hunting. The jarrin is how the old people knew they were going to be parents.\n\n My son, Corban, his jarrin is that big black perentie goanna; we call it tilti. We was hunting it, and it is usually hard \nto get them big ones, because they\u2019ll turn around and attack you right back. My cousin, he shot it in the leg with a \nstone, and it died instantly. Corban\u2019s got a birth mark on his ankle, where my cousin shot the goanna with the stone. \nThat was when I was pregnant with him. You can\u2019t eat your totem, so Corban can\u2019t eat that black goanna and he \nwon\u2019t.\n\n A lot of people have those totems, like emu or kangaroo. The jamu is the one that gives you that totem. My mum, \nCorban\u2019s grandmother, gave Corban his totem because she knew, she was there. It\u2019s like a mysterious thing; you \n\n\n\ncan\u2019t see it but you just know. For us, we found a big black goanna but it wasn\u2019t the season for it, so that\u2019s how we \nknew.  Mr James gave the following evidence on totems:For me I have two known totems. My birth totem was the \ndingo. The other totem is the galah or piyarrku. For me it relates back to situations when my mother was pregnant, \nwhen we were camping on country. My galah totem, piyarrku, relate to the creeks behind Albion Downs station. \nYou hear them a lot at certain times of year, when they are birthing. What the totems mean for me is that you must \nlook after it and protect it, so I don\u2019t harm them.  On the subject of totems, Mr Richard Narrier said:People have a \ntjarrinpa, a totem. That\u2019s the same word all over the desert. I don\u2019t know what they call it in Cue, but they got no law \nthere. It all finish up.\n\n My totem is the dingo, my mother told me it. That happen at that place on Kaluwiri, a fella named Andy Fisher, \nNgungkupayi, he shot a dingo there coming from Sandstone, my mother was pregnant at the time. It happen like \nthat, a lot of people have it like that.\n\n Dingo is special to me. Lot\u2019s of dogs follow me around because they know that I\u2019m one of them.\n\n If you kill a kangaroo when your woman is pregnant and that woman gets birth, then the baby is the kangaroo. \nMost people\u2019s tjarrin is a kangaroo and they not allowed to eat it.  As to the continued observance of, and \nknowledge about, the Tjukurrpa, I have dealt with this extensively earlier in my reasons and need not repeat it. \nHowever, I emphasise here that the claimant evidence about the Tjukurrpa is some of the most persuasive \nevidence about the continued vitality of Western Desert traditional laws and customs giving rise to rights and \ninterests in the land and waters in the claim area.  The claimant evidence about the skin system is, as the State\u2019s \nsubmissions contend, somewhat contradictory, especially in relation to the number of sections in the skin systems \nas described by various witnesses. Other claim group members, such as Ms Wonyabong, frankly admitted they do \nnot follow the skin system at all. The skin system has no bearing on rights and interests in land, and its breakdown \nis of no material significance to the Court\u2019s assessment whether the rights and interests in land articulated by the \nclaim group members are \u201ctraditional\u201d, and continue. I accept that there was little if any correlation between the \nclaimant evidence and the records made by Daisy Bates (aside from Ms Geraldine Hogarth\u2019s evidence, which the \nState, and Dr Brunton, accept bears some correlation), but I do not find the absence of any correlation particularly \nprobative of any of the disputed issues between the parties about the Ngaiawonga and the claim group members\u2019 \nancestors\u2019 acquisition of rights and interests in the land and waters in the claim area. We simply know too little \nabout Ms Bates\u2019 methods to use her data to draw any reliable conclusions, or to use it for comparative purposes in \nrelation to the claimant evidence. In my opinion, those exercises take one into the realm of sheer speculation.\n\nContinuing recognition of multiple pathways to rights and interests in country    There was ample evidence that the \nclaim group members continue to recognise and acknowledge multiple pathways to acquiring rights and interests in \ncountry. Each of the claimant witnesses gave evidence which reflected this and I propose to set out some \nexamples here.  A good example, because it also indicates the links the claim group members see between Tjiwarl \ncountry and country further to the east, is the evidence of Mr Leroy Beaman about the different (legitimate, in his \neyes) paths to claiming country he and his sister have taken. His evidence also indicates two matters Dr Sackett \nnoted: first, that pathways are often between grandparents and grandchildren, rather than simply parents and \nchildren; and second, that knowledge and long familiarity with country can also be a pathway:I love all my country \nthere, right through there in this claim area, that\u2019s my ngurra. I claim from where my grandfather was up in this area \nhere now. I follow my father. That\u2019s where they were born, from that area.\n\n My grandmother wasn\u2019t from there so I can\u2019t claim it through her. She\u2019s from another tribe but I could claim the \nMulga Queen area through her, but I feel strong about this area.\n\n My sister Willamina claims Mulga Queen. She been up and down there, she was out there when she little and she \nlikes going out there to that country. She made that choice and I made my own choice. That way, she can tell \nstories about my grandmother\u2019s country to her kids and I can tell my grandfather\u2019s stories to my kids.\n\n\n\n Me and her planned it, when she was about thirteen and I was about ten. She knows that I been up and down \nthere in this claim area with my grandmother now. My grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, she used to take me to her \nhusband\u2019s country when I was a kid. We made our own choice about which country to follow but we didn\u2019t have \nto.  Rights to country through one or other parent were identified as one pathway by many claimant witnesses (for \nexample, Ms Wonyabong, Ms Tullock, Mr Lewis and Mr Bingham). Some witnesses, such as Ms Wonyabong \n(whose evidence was that she was conceived on Yeelirrie), mentioned conception on country as one pathway. \nBirth on country was also strongly identified (Ms Wonyabong, Ms Narrier, Mr Keith Narrier, Ms Geraldine Hogarth \nand Mr Allan Ashwin). The adaptation in attitudes to birth because of people being born in hospitals was apparent in \nthe evidence: each witness who spoke about this was clear that birth in a town where the hospital is does not \nentitle a person to that country. Correspondingly, birth in a hospital does not disentitle a person to rights and \ninterests in land with which they, and their ancestors, have long associations.  Dr Sackett\u2019s evidence (apparently \nwith Dr Brunton\u2019s agreement) confirmed this as an adaptation:DR SACKETT: And I look at how that\u2019s transformed \nand there was an opening up of the view that \u2013 to a view that there were multiple pathways and these pathways \nvaried from place to place in the desert but were multiple in instance \u2013 in most instances. And what I\u2019ve said is that \nbecause a lot of the pathways are no longer ones that are, in a sense, available like birth on country, people are \nbeing born in hospitals or in communities, people are not living on country \u2013 growing up on country, learning the \ncountry that way because they\u2019re living in communities. But they\u2019re taken out to country briefly by their \u2013 you \nknow, on holidays as a \u2013 so the way in which people are articulating claims to country are along not patrilines, as \nDr Brunton was verballing me, but, rather, a variety of lines, through mother, father, a grandparent and so forth.\n\n While some change has occurred, obviously, those possibilities were present in the past. People could claim \ncountry of the mother or the father or grandparent in the past. It\u2019s those avenues that now predominate rather than \nperhaps, in the past, a birth would have dominated the situation.\n\n DR BRUNTON: I apologise. I did not present what Dr Sackett had said accurately. Yes, I \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just patrilines, \nso, yes.  Shared traditional laws and customs could in some circumstances be a pathway, especially where the \noriginal custodians were small in number and others needed to step in. Mr Henry Ashwin\u2019s evidence was:If all the \nowners for the country pass away, other people will have to go in and look after it. You can\u2019t leave country empty \n\u2013 another lot of family have got to take it on. They got to be tribal. They got to have been through the law, through \nour law. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d let the mob from Cue come in, as they\u2019re too far out \u2013 they don\u2019t speak our language, \nthey can\u2019t take over our thing. They\u2019d get in big trouble.  Growing up on country, and familiarity and knowledge \nabout country through long association with it, were also seen as legitimate pathways. Mr Victor Ashwin said the \nfollowing:My grandfather Yalpie was staying in Yeelirrie, and he looked after all that country, and he was still \npracticing law. There is a law ground there in Albion Downs, where that been done, passing the law and the \ncountry on to him, for around Yeelirrie, Albion Downs, Yakabindie, all that area. Some of the old people who are \nfinished now, they told me that. I don\u2019t know what year it was, I just heard of it. My grandfather was living in \nYeelirrie, he looked after that country. He had them old people who belonged to that country, like Mr Frank \nNarrier, he was staying there too.  Some claimant evidence conveyed the view that something more than working \non country was required, especially if the work was transient. The same is true of marriage. Mr Allan Ashwin made \nthat clear in his evidence:I worked at Lake Mason; it\u2019s not my country but I worked there. I know a little bit about \nthat country but not much. Really, I never been stayed there that long. You might work there for a year or a couple \nof years but it doesn\u2019t make that your country. Like I been around Yeelirre since I was about six months old or \nsomething and I\u2019ve more or less lived there my whole life at Albion Downs, Yeelirrie, Altona, Mt Keith and Windidda.\n\n ...\n\n My wife can\u2019t claim this country. She come from that end north-east, she don\u2019t come from this area. She only \nbeen around this area when she got with me that\u2019s all.  At least two witnesses did mention marriage as a way to \n\n\n\nacquire rights. Mr Keith Narrier referred to it in his witness statement:My parents are dead so they can\u2019t speak for \nthat country now. My grandparents on my father\u2019s side could speak for that country as well. My mother could \nspeak for that country too. She was part of it, from living with my father.  The applicant\u2019s submissions construed \nthis evidence as identifying marriage as a pathway. I am not certain that is what Mr Narrier meant: it could just as \neasily refer to residence and long association. The only other person who mentioned marriage as a pathway was \nMr Muir. Although he did refer to marriage as a pathway in relation to his grandmother (\u201cMeekathara ... was her \nngurra through marriage and living in that country\u201d), again I do not read his evidence about his mother as \nnecessarily depending on marriage, so much as residence and close familiarity with the claim area:My mother \nspent her early years out in the desert, through Mulga Queen, Weebo and Melrose. My mum lived in Mantjintjarra \nNgalia country around Mulga Queen and further east and came back to this Tjiwarl country when she married Mr \n[Frank] Narrier, the father of Beasley [Keith Narrier] and my Narrier siblings. My mother and Mr Narrier spent a lot of \ntime at Kaluwiri and Albion Downs, which is where a lot of the community were living in those days. My mother had \ndetailed knowledge of country all through the areas in which she lived.  As well as Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence, Ms \nLuxie Hogarth\u2019s evidence made it clear that she could not claim Tjiwarl country because of her marriage to her \nhusband Mr Wimmie Redmond, although she knew a great deal about the traditional laws and customs associated \nwith the land and waters of the claim area:My husband was telling me about the tjukurrpa, and I got to listen to him, \nlearn what he told me. But I can\u2019t talk for that country, because that\u2019s his parents\u2019 country. My husband told me \nthat his great, great grandfather \u2013 old Mr Hill \u2013 he was looking after that spring Pii at Albion Downs, and then he got \nold and passed away there. And that snake must still be there. Mr Hill was looking after that tjukurr because he \nbelonged there, he was from there. He must have been taught to look after it. If he hadn\u2019t looked after it, the water \nwould go dry and it would be nothing, he\u2019d know no stories for that area.\n\n ...\n\n I don\u2019t know so much about this Tjiwarl side because I\u2019m just an in-law, but I can help look after it and teach my \nkids. They got to get the boys to go through the law and the other cousins, and they must get together and look \nafter it.  It seems to me from the evidence that the witnesses were indicating there was sometimes a constellation of \nattributes which led to a person acquiring rights, or being recognised as having rights and interests. Obviously, a \nshared tradition of laws and customs was essential. Building on the shared tradition of laws and customs, long \nresidence, great familiarity, and recognition from others with the shared tradition might all provide pathways in \naddition to descent pathways.  In my opinion, it is not insignificant that many witnesses emphasised the need for \npeople to follow \u201cthe same law\u201d, and were clear that they did follow \u201cthe same law\u201d as people from Wiluna, or to the \neast, making a distinction between those people and people to the west. The connections in law and in particular \nTjukurrpa (but not only Tjukurrpa) were underlying foundations for recognition and acquisition of rights, but not in \nthemselves sufficient \u2013 as Mr Patterson\u2019s evidence made clear.  The distinction between those who shared Western \nDesert laws and those who did not came through in many witnesses\u2019 evidence, but the evidence of Mr Patterson \n(although not a claim group member) is an example:The desert law goes all the way to South Australia, the \ntjukurrpa moves east. It comes through this Tjiwarl area now. That Meekatharra way is a different law, I can\u2019t talk \ntheir language and they can\u2019t talk my language. The Gascoyne, Mt Augusta and that area, it\u2019s different too.  In her \nwitness statement, Ms Tullock said:My grandson has been through the law with the Nyamal people, but a lot of the \nboys in my family have been through the desert law in Parrngurr [Cotton Creek]. One of my sons did law at \nParrngurr and one of my sons did law at Punmu. The law there is all the same as the law on my dad\u2019s side, but it\u2019s \ndifferent to Roebourne, and Cane River, and all that. All of my sons and grandsons follow the law because of my \ndad.  In terms of the nature of Western Desert society, and the way in which rights and interests in land and waters \nare determined through multiple pathways in accordance with traditional laws and customs, there is existing \nauthority which deals with this issue, notably the decision of French J (as his Honour then was) in Birriliburu [2008] \nFCA 944. This was a consent determination, but that fact does not lessen the authority of what was said by his \nHonour at [20]:The association of individuals and groups with particular areas of country comes about through a \nvariety of mechanisms. These include conception, birth, growing up or initiation on the country, acquisition of \nknowledge through long residence or descent from a person who has had such a connection. Landholding groups \nare not patrilineally-patrilocally structured. The members of the groups are landholders through their shared \n\n\n\nassociation with and to the land. The groups are open and inclusive so people have potential access to a number of \nareas through the mechanisms mentioned above.\n\nSome adaptation, but within existing legal principles    There is little doubt on the evidence that many of the younger \nclaim group members do not say they have acquired rights and interests in the Tjiwarl claim area through being \nborn on country, or living on country for substantial periods of their lives, as their parents or grandparents were \nable to do. The realities of changes in land use and ownership in the claim area have made that far less possible \nthan it used to be.  Thus, many of the younger claim group members claim their native title rights and interests on \nthe basis of descent, and descent from a parent or grandparent who was born on country or lived on country for a \nlong time and came to know the land and its Tjukurrpa.  The applicant submits this is a permissible adaptation of \ntraditional law concerning acquisition and transmission of rights and interests in country. I accept that submission.  \nIn Wyman [2015] FCAFC 108; 235 FCR 464 at [260]- [261], the Full Court said (albeit dealing with different \npathways and different changes to them):In particular, it does not necessarily mean that, in every circumstance \nwhere a presumptively patrilineal or patrifilial \u201cestate\u201d group model of rights in relation to land and waters is shown \nto have operated pre-sovereignty, a claimant application is bound to fail where the contemporary rule allocates \nrights and interests by virtue of a person\u2019s membership of a claimant group based on cognatic descent, where all \nmembers are recognised as possessing similar or largely similar interests in the whole of the group\u2019s traditional \ncountry. Apart from anything else, a question may arise, as the plurality said in Yorta Yorta at [82], about what it is \nthat is said to have changed or been adaptedsince sovereignty. If local groups and environmental clusters, for \nexample, are shown by the evidence to have \u201ccoalesced\u201d (as Professor Sutton\u2019s evidence suggested may happen), \nit may be that a contemporary \u201ctenure rule\u201d can be explained by the exigencies of post-sovereignty depopulation \nand population movement, and seen as an acceptable adaptation of the pre-sovereignty rule designed to ensure \nappropriate people spoke for country, protected sites, carried on the Law, and enjoyed the resources of the \ncountry, for example. For this reason, reference to the \u201ctenure system\u201d as it operated at sovereignty may be \nmisleading and likely to lead to a false inquiry. The question would remain, in such a case, whether the \ncontemporary \u201ctenure system\u201d, for s 223 purposes, can still be shown to be rooted in pre-sovereignty law and \ncustoms.\n\n In each case the evidence before the Court will dictate whether any relevant change in the \u201ctenure system\u201d is an \nacceptable adaptation of a pre-sovereignty rule, or a new rule reflecting a lack of continuity of the traditional \nnormative system.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  I do not consider that any \u201cnew rule\u201d has been developed for acquisition and transmission \nof rights to the Tjiwarl claim area that reflects a lack of continuity with the normative system of multiple pathways \nwhich I have found operated at sovereignty in the claim area. There is more emphasis on descent, but, on the \nevidence before me, what goes with descent is affiliation with and interests in country. Recognition by the group \ncontinues to be important. For men, initiation remains a pathway. I consider all these matters to be adaptations \nwhich are designed, to adopt the language of the Full Court in Wyman, to ensure that appropriate people continue \nto speak for the Tjiwarl area, to protect sites and to carry on the law.\n\nTHE CONTENT OF THE NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS    As the State\u2019s submissions observed, this \npart of the Court\u2019s findings is dependent on the findings already made concerning the land and waters in the claim \narea being Western Desert country at sovereignty.  There was a great deal of claimant evidence about the nature \nof the rights and interests they have over the claim area, and many examples of how they and their ancestors have \nexercised them. Properly, subject to its critical objections to the preconditions to native title rights and interests \nhaving being met in this application, the State accepts the strength of the evidence on many of the individual rights \nclaimed. That acceptance facilitates findings being made in a briefer way than might otherwise have been the case. \nThe approach I take below is to note the State\u2019s concessions where they are made, and to give some examples \nfrom the evidence which support the findings I make.\n\nThe right to exclusive possession    In areas to which s 47B of the NT Act applies, the applicant claims a right of \nexclusive possession, occupation, use and enjoyment to the exclusion of all others. Subject to my findings \n\n\n\nconcerning s 47B, I am satisfied the applicant has proven such a right exists, and has existed since sovereignty in \naccordance with traditional laws and customs, and has been continuously observed by the claim group members \nand their ancestors.  The Full Court in Griffiths v Northern Territory [2007] FCAFC 178; 165 FCR 391 at [127]- [128] \nconsidered the integers of a right to exclusive possession, and the Full Court in Banjima [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 \nFCR 456endorsed the approach taken in Griffiths. In Banjima, the Full Court said at [34]:What Griff\u0131ths discloses is \nthat the source or foundation of that ability is not necessarily (or even likely to be) an assertion by traditional owners \nthat the country is \u201ctheircountry\u201d but rather the control of access to the country by other indigenous people by \nreason of the spiritual sanctions suffered for unauthorised entry. In other words, control of access by traditional \nowners, who see themselves and act as \u201cgatekeepers for the purpose of preventing ... harm and avoiding injury to \nthe country\u201d, was found in Griff\u0131ths to be recognised by the common law as a right of exclusive possession. By \n\u201cability to exclude others\u201d in the context of traditional law and custom, the Full Court in Griff\u0131ths did not have in mind \nWestern proprietary concepts of barring entry with signs, fences or physical opposition, nor concepts of trespass \nand eviction, but an ability or capacity embedded in and springing from the spiritual relationship of indigenous \npeople with the land to which they are traditionally connected. In this context, as theprimary judge\u2019s conclusions \nproperly recognised, the continuing need of otherindigenous people for Banjima permission to enter Banjima \ncountry to provideprotection from harm for people and country provided evidence of what the common law will \nrecognise as a right of exclusive possession in the Banjima People.  In light of these authorities, the State properly \naccepts that in the present proceeding (if the connection issues are decided favourably to the applicant) the \nevidence set out in the applicant\u2019s submissions is sufficient to prove that the claim group members are \n\u201cgatekeepers\u201d for country in the claim area, in the sense that term was used in Griffiths and Banjima.  That \nconcession having been made, and having reviewed the evidence myself, it is not necessary to set it all out in \nthese reasons. I am satisfied the evidence is ample to prove that the claim group members are \u201cgatekeepers\u201d for \ncountry in the claim area, in the sense that term was used in Griffiths and Banjima. The applicant has set out a \ndetailed summary of all the evidence in their written submissions from [486]-[534], and I accept that evidence.  A \nfew examples, focussing on the matters identified in Griffiths, will suffice. Mr Victor Ashwin\u2019s evidence was:The \ntjukurrpa has always been there in the country. It is the same law right through the desert. It has been passed \ndown by songs and ceremonies. It is all connected up, from north to south to east to west. Even when white people \ncame, our people still practiced the law.\n\n ...\n\n It\u2019s the law from the tjukurrpa which tells people where there country is and what country they can speak for. It\u2019s \nyour birthright that you can speak for this country or that country\n\n ...\n\n I feel strongest about the country in Yakabindie, Mt Keith, Albion Downs and Yeelirrie. Right through that area \nthere on the eastern side of the claim and the top western corner part. That\u2019s my ngurra.\n\n ...\n\n I can go wherever I want to go, there\u2019s nobody there to stop me, say \u201cYou can\u2019t go there, that\u2019s not your ngurra.\u201d\n\n ...\n\n People from Meekatharra or Mt Magnet they don\u2019t come this way hunting but if they wanted to they would have to \nask us for permission. They would have to take some of the mob out with them. We would growl at them, back in \nthe old days they would spear them if they went out without permission.\n\n\n\n We don\u2019t want them coming this way; they got their own tucker in their country. If they want to come camping in \nour country, they\u2019ve got to have someone with them, someone from this country. Otherwise they go into the wrong \nplaces, ngurlu[sacred/secret] places. In 2001 my auntie and uncle, they from Ngaanyatjarra Lands and we took \nthem out emu egg hunting. Something out there made them get lost, they lost their sense of direction because they \nnot from this country.  Ms Narrier\u2019s evidence was:If I want to go visit my country, I don\u2019t need to ask anybody. We \ndo it ourselves. It\u2019s my ngurra. It\u2019s where I grew up, on that ground on that land, and it\u2019s in my heart that I just want \nto go out there.\n\n ...\n\n An Aboriginal person from Mt Magnet could go round Booylgoo Ranges as long as they leave things how it is \u2013 \npeople got to clean their mess up! Even when we go to their country, we ask \u201cis it alright if we go this way?\u201d They \nsay \u201cyeah go help yourself\u201d, but we got to ask first because we\u2019re stepping on their parna [ground] on their sacred \nthings. We do ask.\n\n ...\n\n Aboriginal people from other areas should ask us for the okay, because they get frightened of sacred sites. That\u2019s \nthe main issue for families and peoples, you know. They frightened for country, now. If someone went out and hurt \none of those sites, the spirit might know who they are and will make them sick. And if you see that person sick, you \nknow that that\u2019s from that country.\n\n There are mamatjitji living in the Booylgoo Ranges. Some people call them wudarji. They are little men that come \nfrom under the ground, that\u2019s the story. I\u2019ve never seen one yet, but lots of other mob have felt them under the \nground. We sing about those men, the song you sing to protect yourself. We teach that to the kids too. You need to \nknow the songs to go to that country. Those little men are protecting those ranges.  Mr Bingham\u2019s evidence \nwas:Going through the law is important for those sorts of decisions. Like when you go through the law you take \nafter the bundu, wati. Anyone who wants to do anything to any sacred things, they got to come to us. We got to talk \nabout it, because we\u2019ve been through.\n\n ...\n\n If someone hurts the country, I\u2019d probably have a yarn with him and say \u2018What the hell you doing that for?\u2019 If it was \na really sacred area, with men\u2019s business, then they\u2019ll do something to him. Something bad. Take his life, I \nsuppose. That still happens. They send featherfoots after them. You got ninjas, the mafia, and we got featherfoots! \nThey is everywhere, right around all over. We call them jinakarrpil \u2013 a bloke who will go after you if you break the \nlaw. I never seen one and I don\u2019t want to! You\u2019re mucking around with your life if you see one of them. I can\u2019t talk in \nthis statement about it beyond that.  Finally, Mr Henry Ashwin, whom I found to be one of the claimant witnesses \nwho took these matters most seriously in the way he conducted himself during the on country hearings, gave the \nfollowing evidence:Other people could go to this area for hunting, if you know this country you can go for as long \nas you don\u2019t get lost. If they want to come here, still someone got to ask us. In the right way, otherwise they\u2019ll get \nthemselves in shit. They\u2019ll feel the same way if I go there and muck around, they got to ask and have someone who \nknow the country.\n\n If people want to do any work on country you\u2019ve got to ask us. We don\u2019t like people sneaking through the \nbackdoor. If they want to come here, still someone got to ask us.\n\n\n\nNgurra means we almost got a separate place, all us mens, we got a strong story coming through there. In the Mt. \nKeith area at Palm Spring we got some tjukurrpathere, the father and son snake in the spring down there, it\u2019s flat \nlike a pan. You get killed if you go there without permission, some people they go in and they find out for \nthemselves. I tell them: \u201cDon\u2019t dig there! It\u2019s not safe to dig there.\u201d That\u2019s why we look after that area now so the \nmining company don\u2019t go near that area.\n\n ...\n\n If a person hurts a sacred site, they\u2019ll die \u2013 they\u2019ll lose their life. If he goes and helps the mining company hurt that \nsite, he\u2019ll lose his life. It will happen to him.\n\n There are spooky things that happen. You\u2019ll get sick, get skinny, and it will take your spirit. You\u2019ll die slow, getting \nskinnier and skinnier, and the doctor will never find a problem. But the spirit from that area will be making you sick. \nThere are some spooky areas, you can\u2019t go next to them.\n\n There are places like this in that Tjiwarl country. I don\u2019t go next to them, I stay next to them. There\u2019s one like that \nat Palm Well; it\u2019s a bit of a spooky area. We want to fence them off, that way people will know that they can\u2019t go in \nthere. That way they won\u2019t get sick or lose their life.\n\nNon-exclusive rights    In relation to some of the non-exclusive rights, the State submits that the manner in which \nthese rights are expressed in the Wiluna determination is an appropriate manner for them to be expressed in any \ndetermination in this proceeding. That formulation is:Subject to Orders 6 to 9, the nature and extent of the native \ntitle rights and interests in relation to each part of the Determination Area referred to in Schedule 4 [being areas \nwhere the native title right of possession, occupation, use and enjoyment is not available at law including by reason \nof partial extinguishment] are the following rights or interests:\n\n (a) the right to access, to remain in and to use that part;\n\n (b) the right to take and use resources in that part; and\n\n (c) the right to have access to, maintain and protect places, and areas and objects of importance on or in that part.  \nI consider the precise formulation of the terms of a determination is a matter the parties should attempt to agree \nupon, in accordance with the Court\u2019s reasons. It may well be that the Wiluna formulation is, in respect of the rights \nidentified, appropriate, but that is a matter the parties should attempt to agree on before the Court forms any final \nview. Accordingly, I deal with each of the rights which may or may not form part of the formulation on an individual \nbasis.\n\nThe right to access, remain in and use the claim area  The applicant submits at [537]-[538]:The evidence referred to \nabove in relation to the right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment to the exclusion of all others also \ndemonstrates the existence of a right to access, remain and use the Claimed Area, even if the right to control \naccess by others is incapable of recognition because of \u2018extinguishment\u2019 (See Western Australia v Ward[2002] HCA \n28; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at [21], [26], [95]).\n\n Furthermore, to the extent it is necessary (cf paragraph 114 above), the evidence referred to below concerning \n\u2018occupation\u2019 for the purposes of s.47B of the NTA demonstrates the ongoing exercise of this claimed rights [sic].  I \naccept that submission. The State did not contest these propositions.\n\nThe right to take resources for any purpose  The content of this right is actively contested by the State.  The dispute \nbetween the parties is whether the content of the right includes a right to exploit commercially resources taken from \n\n\n\nthe land and waters in the claim area, rather than a right which is limited to the taking and protection of resources \nfor personal, domestic and non-commercial communal use.  The parties\u2019 submissions in this matter were filed \nbefore the decision of the Full Court in Pilki was available. That decision considered both the correct approach to \ndetermining whether a right to trade commercially in resources can be established and also the nature of the \nevidence which may be sufficient to support such a finding. It is binding on me as a single judge and is the most \nrecent consideration by this Court of the matters in dispute between the parties on this issue.  In Pilki, Dowsett J \nsaid (at [37]):The remaining question is whether the primary judge correctly inferred that, according to traditional law \nand custom, the claim group was entitled to take resources from the claim area for commercial purposes, \nnotwithstanding the absence of any direct evidence of such pre-first contact usage and of subsequent usage. As I \nunderstand the law, it is not a sufficient basis for such an inference that the claim group claims to \u201cown\u201d the claim \narea, and that which is on or under it. On the other hand, the claim group need not prove a specific canon of \ntraditional law and custom, dealing expressly with taking resources for commercial purposes. In effect the claim \ngroup must show that had the question of taking for commercial purposes arisen at any relevant time, traditional law \nand custom would have permitted the claim group to act in the relevant way.  His Honour noted that an absence of \npositive evidence of trading for commercial purposes in resources in the claim area at sovereignty did not answer \nthe question whether there was any limit on the right to take and use resources of the kind for which the State \ncontended (that is, for non-commercial purposes). His Honour continued, at [41] and [44]:The resolution of the case \nshould start with acceptance of the concessions made by the State as to the pre-first contact society. At that time \nthere was a society, having a system of laws and customs which regulated the relationship between it and the claim \narea. Members of that society exercised a wide range of rights over, and interests in the claim area, including the \nright to take resources. One wonders why those rights should have been limited to taking resources for non-\ncommercial purposes. However one need not speculate. Rather one may look to the detailed evidence given by Dr \nCane concerning the wider society which occupied the Western Desert, or at least parts of it adjoining or near to the \nclaim area. The Court might also take account of human nature. Commerce emerges where there is a need, and a \ntangible reward for satisfying that need.\n\n ...\n\n Given the history of trade in the wider Western Desert area, one must ask why the resources of the claim area, \nsuch as they were and are, would not have been used for trade or commercial purposes. There is no obvious \nanswer to that question. It is more likely that the absence of evidence of trade in resources from this area is \nattributable to the lack of resources than to any limitation upon the general right to take and use them. The claim to \nbe entitled to take resources from the claim area should not be seen as a claim to lesser rights and interests than \nthose exercised in other parts of the Western Desert by the larger group of which the claim group is part. In my view \nthe primary judge\u2019s conclusion was correct.  In her reasons, Jagot J made it clear that mere assertion of a right to \ntrade in resources for commercial purposes would not be enough, but her Honour concluded the trial judge had not \nacted on any mere assertion. Rather, her Honour said (at [99]):The only dispute was whether those traditional laws \nand customs extended to exploitation of the land for any purpose. In this context, his Honour\u2019s proposition that if \nsuch laws and customs giving a right to access and take resources from land for any purpose had been proved \nthen proof of actual trading activity in the exercise of that right is not a necessary pre-condition to a finding of the \nright, is consistent with authority (Yorta Yorta at [84]). The fact that their Honours were dealing with the issue of the \ncontinuity of rights at [84] in Yorta Yorta may be accepted. But as the primary judge recognised the passage is \nauthority for the proposition that lack of evidence of the exercise of a right otherwise proven to exist under a \ntraditional law or custom that has also been proven does not necessarily preclude a finding that the right exists and \nhas continued.  Her Honour explained why the distinction the State sought to draw between use of resources for \npersonal and domestic purposes, and use for commercial purposes, could not withstand scrutiny (at [112]-\n[113]):Sixth, the submissions in support of the appeal seek to draw what, in the specific context of this case, is an \narbitrary distinction between the use of land for some purposes (domestic, communal, spiritual, ceremonial and \nexchange) and use for another purpose (commercial). The distinction is arbitrary because virtually all of the pleaded \nfacts about the Pilki People were accepted (as summarised above) including their right to exploit land for, \napparently, any purpose other than a purpose described as commercial. Yet nothing in the evidence supported any \ndistinction in traditional law or custom, or any difference in activity that was or could properly be inferred to have \n\n\n\nbeen carried out in accordance with traditional law and custom, between use of land for purposes other than \ncommercial purposes and use for commercial purposes. This lack of distinction, in common with the lack of any \nprohibition to which the primary judge referred at [124], is to be understood in the context of the evidence that was \navailable \u2013 being evidence about the continued observance and meaning of the Tjukurrpa and its significance to the \nrelationship of the Pilki People to their land, the opportunistic nature of these societies in terms of resource \nexploitation, the location of the claim area and its context in a larger overall system of desert societies, the \nrelationship between the claim area and the two vast and ancient trade routes, and the limited resources, being the \nhardwoods, of the claim area and the likelihood of them being exploited for trade.\n\n As the primary judge concluded about the lack of any prohibition on commercial exploitation in traditional law or \ncustom, if that alone was the extent of the evidence then the State\u2019s arguments about impermissible reasoning may \nhave force. But given the evidence that was available in this case, the lack of a prohibition or any relevant \ndistinction in traditional law and custom about the use of land for one or other purposes become material. The State \nand Commonwealth could not explain how it was that the evidence supported a finding that the Pilki People had a \nright under traditional law and custom to use their land for all purposes other than commercial purposes. Traditional \nlaw and custom, as Dr Cane said, protected sacred matters but otherwise the Pilki People, like all desert peoples, \nwere opportunistic exploiters of what was available them. As a consequence, the evidence provided no proper \nfoundation for the distinction the State sought to draw between commercial purposes and all other purposes.  The \napproach in Pilki is different from that taken in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, \nWakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135; 145 FCR 442 (Alyawarr). In Alyawarr, the Full Court upheld \nthe proposition that a right to trade in resources is a right relating to land for the purposes of s 223(1) of the NT Act, \nbut found that the evidence was not capable of supporting such a right to trade and the determination should be \naccordingly varied.  Here, as in Pilki, the right identified by the applicant is a right to take and use resources from \nthe claim area \u201cfor any purpose\u201d. The content of the right is posited to be without limit as to the purpose for which \nresources are taken. That does not mean, as Dowsett J and Jagot J both observed, the evidence needs to show an \nexercise of such a right for the purpose asserted. However, if the evidence shows that at sovereignty the ancestors \nof the claim group were entitled to take and use whatever resources were available from the land and waters of the \nclaim area for any purpose they chose, then this is the content of the right which should be expressed in a \ndetermination, without an excision for \u201ccommercial\u201d purposes.  Barker J took, it seems to me, a different approach \nto Dowsett J and Jagot J. At [183], his Honour said that evidence by Aboriginal claimants of \u201cownership\u201d or of land \n\u201cbelong[ing]\u201d to them is insufficient to identify the rights and interests which are said to inhere in such ownership. \nNor, his Honour said, would such general statements support a finding of a right to take resources for any purpose. \nSo much may be accepted. His Honour said (at [169]-[170]):When it comes to proof by claimants of a right they \nclaim to possess under traditional laws and customs, such as that contended for in this case, to access and take for \nany purpose resources in their country, ordinarily one would expect that activity evidence, that is to say, evidence \nof the exercise of such a right during the period between sovereignty and the present, would be led to ensure the \nCourt is satisfied, to the requisite civil standard of proof, not only that such a right was possessed at sovereignty but \nthat it has continued to be possessed by the acknowledgement and observance, generation by generation since, of \nthe sovereignty laws and customs giving rise to the claimed right. It should be noted, however, that this is a different \nproof question from that which may arise where there is no dispute that, at sovereignty, such a right was possessed \nand the only question is whether the right has, in effect, been \u201clost\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d through lack of \nacknowledgement or observance of the traditional law or custom giving rise to the right since sovereignty. As to this \nlatter question, see Banjima People at [775].\n\n While it might, at least in theory, be possible for a court to be satisfied that the particular right contended for is \nproved without any such activity evidence, it must be said that, without any evidence of the exercise of a right, a \ncourt would ordinarily be reluctant to find that the right exists. It is one thing for claimants to say that, under their \nlaws and customs, they own everything on, under and above their traditional country, and that their \u201cownership\u201d \nrights include the right to take any resources and use them as they wish, and another thing to support what might \notherwise be at risk of being treated as a mere assertion with corroborating evidence. While it may be said that the \nfailure to adduce activity evidence in many, if not most cases, is likely to prove fatal to claimants\u2019 contentions that \n\n\n\nthey possess certain rights, it should also be said that each case will ultimately depend on the nature and quality \u2013 \nrelevance and probative value \u2013 of the evidence led.  His Honour\u2019s approach does, it seems to me, come close to \nrequiring evidence of exercise of rights, which imposes a qualitatively different forensic task on claimants than the \napproach taken by Dowsett J and Jagot J. With respect, I prefer the approach of Dowsett J and Jagot J.  In Pilki at \n[212], Barker J described the anthropological evidence in that case at trial concerning \u201cpost contact opportunistic \nresource use by Western Desert people and Pilki people (sales of artefacts) during the 20th century\u201d, as well as \nevidence from claimant witnesses about more recent activities of the same kind, as capable of corroborating a \ntraditional right to use resources within Pilki country opportunistically. It is not necessary for me to express a \nconcluded view on Barker J\u2019s approach in this paragraph, since I have found the evidence in this case supports the \nexistence of a right to take and use resources for any purpose and have, consistently with the approach taken by \nDowsett J and Jagot J, found that to be sufficient to support the inclusion in a s 225 determination of a right as \nexpressed by the applicant, without excision or exclusion as to commercial purposes or use.  At [48] of their written \nsubmissions, the applicant fairly put both the nature of the right asserted (and what must be excluded from it) and \nthe State\u2019s position, which I understand is supported by other third party respondents (namely, MPI Nickel Pty Ltd \nand the Nickel West respondents (comprising BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd, BHP Billiton Yakabindie Nickel Pty \nLtd, Albion Downs Pty Ltd and Weebo Pastoral Co Pty Ltd)):In Applicants SIFC [66(b)] the Applicants also claim the \nright to access resources and to take for any purpose resources in the Claimed Area. This is also denied by the \nState. The Applicants accept that the reference to resources does not (as a matter of law, because of \nextinguishment) include minerals or petroleum. The Applicants understand that more specifically, the matters in \nissue are: \n\n (a) whether there is any limitation (apart from that conceded above) on the resources that can be taken i.e. must \nthey be \u2018traditional\u2019 resources; and\n\n (b) whether resources can be taken for commercial purposes (i.e. for the purposes of trading them), or whether the \nnative title right to take resources is limited to particular purposes (e.g. for subsistence, ceremonial and/or non-\ncommercial communal purposes).  That approach is reflected in the following three paragraphs of the State\u2019s final \nsubmissions, each of which in its own way seeks to impose a requirement of evidence of pre-sovereignty rights to \ncommercial use and exploitation, or activity of that kind:The First Respondent submits that the evidence in these \nproceedings demonstrates that the pre-sovereignty law and custom with respect to exchange of resources, such as \nochre and pearl-shell for spears and other goods, was rooted in personal, non-commercial communal needs, \nincluding social, ceremonial and cultural needs. \n\n The evidence of Dr Sackett that a spear was given to receive something in return is of the same nature as the \n\u201cthank you or pay him off\u201d relationship considered in Alyawarr(FC), and the claimants\u2019 evidence of the old people \nexchanging spears for ochre is in the context of subsistence; that is, for personal use. \n\n Similarly, the evidence of contemporary use of emu eggs to carve and sell to tourists, and the sale of seeds to \nmining companies, is similar to the evidence of the collection of beans to make beads for purchase by tourists in \nAlyawarr (FC). The basis for the exchange of resources remains, as demonstrated by the evidence of Henry \nAshwin and Kado Muir, an exchange based upon a relationship for personal, domestic or communal needs, not for \ncommercial exploitation, which has its basis in the pre-sovereignty law and custom of the sharing and exchange of \nsubsistence goods.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  The State\u2019s approach is not consistent with the Full Court\u2019s approach in Pilki, and it pays \ninsufficient regard to the way the native title right is identified by the applicant. The native title right is to access and \ntake resources for any purpose. As Dowsett J and Jagot J in particular made clear in Pilki, evidence may establish \na right to take resources for any purpose without specific evidence of an exercise of that right for a commercial \npurpose, or even without specific association of the right with commercial purposes.  The task in the present \nproceeding is to assess the evidence to determine whether it establishes that at sovereignty, and continuing to the \n\n\n\npresent day, the claim group members and their ancestors have been and are entitled to use and take resources \nfrom the claim area for any purpose. I turn now to that task. The applicant\u2019s written submissions contained many \nexamples from a range of claimant witnesses, and I do not reproduce them all, although I accept all the evidence \nreferred to in those submissions is probative of the existence of a right to take and use resources for any purpose, \nand without any limits as to commercial or non-commercial use.  Some of the claimant evidence I have already \nreferred to in related contexts, such as that of Mr Victor Ashwin \u2013 see [835] above. In terms of other evidence which \ndescribes the claim group members\u2019 understanding of traditional laws and customs, some examples include the \nfollowing.  In her witness statement, Ms Wonyabong said the following with respect to the use of sandalwood as \nbush medicine:There\u2019s sandalwood around there too, for bush medicine. Aunt Angeline would collect the \nsandalwood, cook it in the ashes, grind it and make into a soft cream, and she would rub it on herself when she got \na sore. There\u2019s sandalwood all over that country \u2013 Yakabindie, Yeelirrie, Mount Keith. These days Kado is \ncollecting and selling sandalwood. Nothing in our Aboriginal law says we can\u2019t do that but you got to get a \nwhitefella license.  In his witness statement, Mr Richard Narrier spoke of hunting and gathering in the following \nterms:If you want to start selling meat you probably need a permit or something, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get into that; \nselling my kangaroo. You might get charged for it. But there\u2019s no rule against it under Aboriginal law.\n\n Ochre was the main one traded. Main one at Wilgie Mia. That\u2019s that Watjari mob, Mullewa side. They got different \nlaws to us.\n\n The womens make baskets out of spinifex stalks. They can sell it if they want, nothing wrong with that. They do it in \nWarburton too, make them baskets and sell to tourists.\n\n People can make artifacts like spears and boomerangs. They make the spears themselves. You can get that wood \nanywhere, you get it from a gum tree or a mulga tree, but you mainly use gum trees. They used to trade them \nthings early days when they meet up they just say \u201cYou have this\u201d and that other mob say \u201cYou have that\u201d. There\u2019s \nno Aboriginal law that says I can\u2019t sell it. Not as far as I know.  Mr Lewis gave evidence about a \u201claw trail\u201d his father \nfollowed, and taught him about, running through the west of the claim area, and around Booylgoo Range. Included \non this trail was a quarry. This was his on country evidence about what the old people used the quarry for:BRETT \nLEWIS: This is where they\u2019d come and get their rocks, stones, for them to make a knife or tools, yeah, the quarry. \nThere are quarries right through the country but this is a big one, you know. They come, sit down and get the best \nones, chip away and make the best ones, put on the woomera or \u2013 or the (kawidjin).\n\n MR WRIGHT: Okay, what\u2019s a woomera?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: A woomera is the thing that they throw the spear with.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Okay,\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Put it on the end of the spear and throw the spear.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Yes. So they use rock as part of that, do they?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: On the end, yeah. It\u2019s the - they\u2019d make other wooden artifacts or cutting kangaroo, cutting meat \nup, yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And what else would they use rocks from around here for?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: They\u2019d use it for their ceremonial stuff, initiation and all that, yeah. They had back then no knife, \nnothing, so they had the rock, use the rocks.\n\n\n\n MR WRIGHT: All right. And we\u2019ve been saying \u201cthey\u201d; what\u2019s your understanding of who \u201cthey\u201d are?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Well, the people that went through here, my father\u2019s people and people that walked through here, \nyes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Yes, and what sort of timeframe are we talking about when this was happening?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Oh, going back a long time, back in the 30s when people were walking around, 40s I suppose, \nmid-50s. The 40s backwards, yeah, 30s, 20s, right back, yeah, further.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And where did you learn this from?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: I learned all that from my father. He told me and showed me all this.  Mr Lewis went on to give \nquite detailed evidence about the different kind of rocks found at the quarry and what they were used for. He also \ngave the following evidence:MR WRIGHT: Yes. And did you ever hear anything from your father about what the \npeople who say came here and made the objects out of stone? What would they do with them? You\u2019ve talked about \nthem using them themselves; was there anything else that they\u2019d do?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, they\u2019d take it to where they go, to ceremonies, big ceremonies. They can use it for trade if \nthey want it or give it if they see their relation or people from the other side come or whatever, give them a stone \nand trade, yeah, for something that the other mob might have had that they need.\n\n MR WRIGHT: So do you know where they would trade or who they would trade with?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: They\u2019d trade with the mobs coming for the big ceremonies, you know, if they go to that law ground \nover there or the mob coming from the- - -\n\n MR WRIGHT: From the west?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, and people coming from the north, same like back this way, you know. They might trade with \nthe Laverton mob coming from that way or going over here and trade with the Wiluna mob.  His evidence \ncontinued:MR WRIGHT: And you said they would trade; would they get things in return?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yeah, they might get things, whatever the mob got over that side. They might get a bit of oak or \nsomething, you know. Back in them days someone may have got something like a shell from further up.  The word \n\u201coak\u201d here is clearly a mistaken transcription for ochre, as Mr Lewis\u2019s subsequent evidence makes clear. This \nevidence gives specific examples of what occurred in past times, and I am satisfied that this evidence provides a \nsufficient basis to infer that these activities, and the rights which they are based on, existed at sovereignty in the \nclaim area and were part of the traditional laws of the people who occupied the claim area. They were, I find, no \nmore than examples of the broader right identified by the applicant. The claim group members\u2019 ancestors took and \nused, I find, whatever they needed from the claim area by way of natural resources, and used them for whatever \npurposes they saw fit. There were no restrictions.  There is also sufficient evidence that in more recent times claim \ngroup members have taken and used natural resources from the claim area for commercial purposes, and have not \nconsidered that by doing so they are acting otherwise than in accordance with traditional laws and customs.  In his \nwitness statement, Mr Victor Ashwin described hunting and gathering in the claim area as follows:I seen elders \nmaking spears, boomerangs, shields. People used to sell them to tourists, when they come through town, just on \nthe street. Like Norman Thompson, Ululla Boss and Miparr. They sometimes make hairbelts and sell them. I never \nhear any one say there was anything wrong with that.\n\n\n\n I seen people carving emu eggs and selling them in Wiluna. My mother and father used to do it. Mum was talking \nabout doing some soon.\n\n The Department of Agriculture set up Emu Farm in the 1960s. I think Ngaanganawili community bought it in the \nlate 70s. I worked there. We used to go out and catch emus and sell them to the farm. Me and my siblings, cousins \nand aunties and uncles. Catch them all and then bring them back and sell them to the farm. We catch some around \nthe north of the claim, when we see the father and the chick we go and chase.\n\n The old people been collecting seeds. They been collecting anywhere. That\u2019s no problem, we can sell them to \nmining companies if we want. \n\n They used to go to trade with them at Wilgie Mia. They trade spears and boomerangs and things to get that ochre. \nPeople from around Wiluna area. People use that ochre for everything, like ceremony.\n\n A lot of steel axes made it\u2019s way right into the desert. Before the old people came into contact with whitepeople, \nthey had the axe part. It got traded and traded way out into the desert. My grandmother used to talk about it, even \nmy mother used to talk about it, they call it Kartju, or Yillibie. That was the stone axe, but they still called the steel \none by the same name.\n\n When you younger, you can\u2019t do any woodcraft. Can\u2019t make anything until you go through the law.  Ms Narrier \nsaid the following in her witness statement:There was a whitefella who wanted to try growing watja. He took them to \nAlbany to try growing them out there. He tried to grow some in Albany, but it didn\u2019t work. He had to go through us \nfor permission to take the plant. If a whitefella comes out with us, they got to wait for permission, or we just say \u2018do \nyou wanna taste?\u2019 or something like that.\n\n There\u2019s nothing to stop me selling watja if I wanted to. I could take other bush tuckers too, grass berries or \nsomething, to the shop and sell them. Me and Kado, [w]e want to start that at the shed at the Katampul Village in \nLeonora; trying to plant some bush foods to try and sell it.  Mr Henry Ashwin gave some evidence which made clear \nthe proprietary attitude which claim group members had, and considered they were entitled to have in accordance \nwith traditional laws and customs, towards natural resources:We got knowledge about bush medicine. Men and \nwomen know it, but mainly ladies do it. Men, they go out hunting and all the ladies for gathering and things.\n\n We got a lot of bush medicine, but people don\u2019t wanna show them. I won\u2019t show doctors and that, they will take it \naway and make a big plantation of it and then they\u2019ll make money and the people of the country will miss out on \nour share.\n\n When I was young, before doctors and hospitals then it was a bit hard to look after your health. If you got a cut you \ncan use sandalwood seed, cut it up and chuck it on the sore. You can use some parts of the lake too, the salt, and \nrub it on your sore leg.  As the State\u2019s submissions note, Mr Henry Ashwin also gave some evidence that \nconcerned gift giving, as part of keeping and maintaining relationships, and involved such objects as spears made \nfrom resources on country. Far from this being a limit on the use of natural resources (as the State submits), in my \nopinion, it was just a further example of the way, in accordance with traditional laws and customs, people used what \nwas available in the claim area to suit their current needs \u2013 including in facilitating relationships with other groups. \nThis was Mr Ashwin\u2019s evidence on that point:Slim Williams, from Parnngurr he rang me up. Him and his father \nmade a lot of boomerang, shield, everything; he\u2019s going to bring it down for me from Parnngurr, but I\u2019ve got nothing \nto trade him. I\u2019ve got to figure out something to give him, because he can\u2019t give it to me for free. We still do that \ntrade today, so when he brings it down for me, I\u2019ve got some time to figure out what to give him \u2013 he can\u2019t go back \nempty handed, you got to give him something, that\u2019s the law, now. He made a big mob of those things; he does that \n\n\n\nall the time.  Dr Sackett gave evidence, with which Dr Brunton agreed, about the existence of trade, including in \nobjects made from natural resources which then might become sacred objects:DR SACKETT: Well, people in the \ndesert, there\u2019s some evidence \u2013 there\u2019s not heaps of evidence but there\u2019s certainly evidence of people engaging in \ntrade in the desert and who crossed the desert into non-Western Desert areas and Daisy Bates herself talks about \nsome spears coming down from the northern parts like the Ashburton area I recall and she also talks about some \nsacred objects, particular sacred objects coming down from \u2013 ultimately from the coast. And in \u2013 when I was at \nWiluna in the 70s an anthropologist ... by the name of Kim Ackerman visited and recorded the same sort of trade \nobjects coming down to Wiluna as the sacred objects Ms Bates has recorded and in fact, some of the claimant\u2019s \nancestors were there for that. I can say \u2013 Ackerman doesn\u2019t mention that but I happened to be there when it was \nhappening, so I observed it, so yes, there\u2019s a precedent of trade.\n\n HER HONOUR: All right. And would you describe those as natural resources because they\u2019re made from - - -\n\n DR SACKETT: Well, they\u2019re made from things in nature, but then they take on another meaning obviously, \nparticularly the sacred objects, they have new meaning altogether, but even the spears, they can take a meaning \u2013 \nit\u2019s a relationship that people have with that. It wasn\u2019t we just got a spear. You could be in a trade relationship with \nanother person so you \u2013 they might give you a spear and sometime later you would give them something else in \nreturn.\n\n HER HONOUR: Yes, I see. Dr Brunton, anything you want to say about that?\n\n DR BRUNTON: I\u2019ve got nothing to add to that.\n\n HER HONOUR: All right.\n\n DR BRUNTON: I agree with what Dr Sackett said.  Dr Sackett and Dr Brunton were expressly asked, as part of the \nconcurrent evidence session, whether they considered that under the traditional laws and customs of the occupants \nof the claim area at sovereignty there was any limitation placed upon the types of natural resources that could be \nexploited, and both said there were none, aside from restrictions in the exchange or trade of sacred objects which \nmay arise from age, gender or other characteristics of the recipient of a sacred object.  In summary, the evidence \n(both of the claimant witnesses and the experts) demonstrates that at sovereignty and in accordance with traditional \nlaws and customs, the Western Desert people whom I have found occupied the claim area had rights to take and \nuse natural resources from the claim area for any purpose they saw fit. Their traditional laws and customs placed \nno limits on what they might choose to do with those resources. The evidence shows they tended to use those \nresources in ways which assisted production or harvesting of food, hunting, exchanges with other groups, gift \ngiving, and participation in sacred and ceremonial aspects of their lives. The evidence also shows that the members \nof the claim group and their ancestors have continued to see themselves as entitled to take such resources from \nthe claim area as they need, or want, for such purposes as they see fit. As they have seen various opportunities to \nuse what grows or lives in the claim area, they have done so, and that has continued to the present day. They \ncontinue to recognise a right to turn the resources of the claim area to other uses as they see fit.\n\nThe right to engage in spiritual and cultural activities  The State accepts the claimant evidence has established this \nright. I am satisfied there is ample evidence of the existence of this right. Some examples from the evidence suffice.  \nMr Muir gave the following evidence:Two law grounds that I know of in the east of the claim area are called \nTjampuwa, also known as Townsend Well, and Ngalpirri, also known as Henry\u2019s Well. They are both traditional \nwater places which now have windmills put on them and they are part of a route that mum used to travel as a young \ngirl when she participated in ceremonies. She would walk west from Mulga Queen towards Darlot and then through \nto these waters and through to Kalyuwintal [Calowindie Well].\n\n Those two waterholes are different stages of the initiation cycle. Tjampuwa is getting scars on your chest, and the \nother one, Ngalpirri, is getting scars cut onto your back.\n\n\n\n Mt Sir Samuel was a place where a lot of old people would camp and would have a lot of ceremonies there. That\u2019s \none of the reasons why our original native title claim was called \u2018Sir Samuel\u2019; it was named after that place. That \nwas an important gathering ground and an important cultural feature because it was basically the point at which \npeople travelling from the east would stop and then start travelling north. So the journey from there was up to \nWiluna, which in those days was called Mulyi Well which is somewhere between Bondini Aboriginal Reserve, \nMillibillie Station and the old village. They went there because that\u2019s where ceremonies would be conducted in \nWiluna, after Sir Samuel.\n\n Near Black Tank near Logan Springs is a law ground. The last person to go through the law there was tjamu Wawi \n[Roy] Beaman when he was a young man.  Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence, both in his statement and orally, dealt quite \nextensively with spiritual and ceremonial activities:The first one is north of the homestead from Booylgoo Ranges. \nThat law ground was last used in the early 1950s. My dad went through with a mob from Kaluwiri to take them \nthrough the law there. There was a big mustering camp, and there were some young men who needed to go \nthrough a certain stage of the law there. My dad would look after that place. He would make sure that it was ready \nfor the ceremonies. I went there a couple of years ago to have a look and I go through there and look after it now. I \nhave a look around but I don\u2019t go often as I would like.\n\n I first went to that law ground with my father in the 1960s. There\u2019s drinking water there and a camping ground \nwhere you can see grinding stones from the old people. Up from the water there is the law ground. It\u2019s a fair-size \nlaw ground. People came from Leonora, coming through from the east heading north-west. It\u2019s part of the different \nareas of their ceremonies. Women can\u2019t go to that law ground.\n\n The second law ground is nearby to the first law ground. It is right in the hills of the Booylgoo Ranges, and is hard \nto get to. I went through there with a motorbike a long time ago.\n\n Booylgoo is really pulyku, which means \u2018sinew\u2019. I couldn\u2019t tell the story for that place but it has something to do with \nthe man there and the kangaroo sinew. I know the part of the story where they cut the sinew. You can see the gap \nin the ranges wherethe sinew has been chopped.  In oral evidence, he described what he could say of his father\u2019s \ninitiation and the law grounds where this occurred:MR WRIGHT: And if I or Mr Ranson ask you questions that you \ndon\u2019t feel comfortable to answer, then just feel free to say. But, I just wanted to ask you about your father. So, \nyou\u2019ve told us that he was initiated?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And do you understand what law was he initiated in?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Meaning? What do you mean?\n\n MR WRIGHT: Is it \u2013 is there a particular name for the law that he was initiated in? You may not know.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Okay. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re really getting at or - - -\n\n MR WRIGHT: Okay. Were there other places that you know of where that law was practised?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, the \u2013 well, the law that I know he was initiated in is practised in Warburton and Wiluna and \nthrough this area. Yes, so, it\u2019s a pretty common sort of law, yes.\n\n\n\n MR WRIGHT: And were there different stages to your understanding of that law?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, there is.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Do you know whether he\u2019d been through different stages?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And can you just explain that to the extent you can?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: The extent that yes, he\u2019s been through different stages. I can\u2019t go through \u2013 he\u2019s been marked \nfront and back and yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Right. And there were some lawgrounds that you\u2019ve mentioned?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Can you just explain what\u2019s a lawground?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: That\u2019s a very sacred site for Aboriginal people and that\u2019s where the initiations are and the songs \nand dances of the area and what they\u2019re going through happens, yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Yes. And there are some lawgrounds around here I understand?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Can you point out where they are?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: To the north of us, and there\u2019s two lawgrounds to the north, yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Okay. And do they have a particular name?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: No, not that I know of, yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Now, when \u2013 on our site map we\u2019ve got one in F8 [in the north-east part of the claim area and to the \nnorth of Booylgoo] called Pulyku lawground?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And that\u2019s Pulyku just to identify it as being in this general area?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, yes, correct.\n\n MR WRIGHT: So, that\u2019s one of the ones you\u2019re referring to?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, and one is just a bit further away in the same area, yes, over there, yes.\n\n\n\n MR WRIGHT: So, you\u2019ve just pointed on F8 but just south, sort of halfway between the purple dot and the bottom \nof F8 - - -\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes. Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: - - - on our site map? And your father \u2013 or how did you learn about those lawgrounds?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: He told me about those and the vicinity they were in and went to the rockhole. He showed me the \nrockholes where the ladies and stuff used to all camp down and get water from, yes.  Mr Lewis was asked in cross-\nexamination whether the law grounds were used in his lifetime, but I do not consider that his answer gave a clear \nindication one way or the other. My impression was that he did not wish to speak publicly about such matters, as he \nthen said. The following exchange then occurred:MR RANSON: Are you the main person that speaks for those \nlawgrounds and knows about them? You\u2019ve been put - - -\n\n BRETT LEWIS: I know about them but yes, because I\u2019m not initiated I can\u2019t publicly speak about them, yes.\n\n MR RANSON: Yes. Yes.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: But I know about them and I look after them, you know, and I\u2019d go in there and do things, but yes - \n- -\n\n MR RANSON: Okay.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: - - - just make sure they don\u2019t get damaged.\n\nThe right to maintain and protect places of significance  The State accepts the evidence had also established the \nexistence of this right. I am satisfied there is ample evidence of the existence of this right, and of its exercise.  For \nexample, in his witness statement, Mr Lewis said the following with respect to protecting rockholes:The little \nrockholes are mainly covered up with sticks or rocks and you don\u2019t need to clean them out. The main reason for \ncovering them up this is to stop animals from drinking as there will be no water left. If there are sticks or animals in \nthere, you clean them out, but if there\u2019s just dirt in there you leave it because it stops it evaporating. It keeps the \nwater underneath by making it harder for the sun to penetrate the water. My father taught me how to cover up the \nlittle rockholes. \n\n In the old days, people were moving around, making sure they were close to water. People made sure to look after \nthe big rockholes and the big soaks. That\u2019s one of the reasons we are one big family, but with little different groups; \nso you don\u2019t have a big impact on the country by having lots of people in the same place. People were always \nmoving around, looking after the country \u2013 burning it, and then letting it regrow, constantly moving around and \nfixing it up.  Then, in oral evidence, he said the following:BRETT LEWIS: Yes, just \u2013 they clean out rockholes or \nsometime they\u2019d leave the sand in there to stop the water from evaporating. So, you know, water would be under \nthe sand and if you come along and you\u2019re thirsty, you just dig, and I think if you\u2019ll \u2013 if it\u2019s clean water there all the \nbirds and animals will just drink it if they can see it, but kangaroos and dingoes will come and dig or goanna, yes.\n\n HER HONOUR: Okay. So that helps preserve it does it?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n\n\n HER HONOUR: Right.\n\n BRETT LEWIS: It keeps the water there longer. Either they clean them out and they can come them over with \nsticks or stuff so they know water is there.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And how did you learn about that rockhole there?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: My father.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Did he explain to you - - -\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes.\n\n MR WRIGHT: - - - that that rockhole had any particular purpose?\n\n BRETT LEWIS: Yes, that\u2019s one of the water sources on the trail walking, yes. You can walk through there and get \nwater at certain time when it\u2019s raining, yes.  In her evidence, Ms Narrier said the following on cleaning \nrockholes:You look after rockholes by cleaning them all out \u2013 for the animals, like the kangaroos. Those rangers, if \nthey seek a rockhole they clean it out. That\u2019s the main thing, cleaning those rockholes. They clean it out with a \nshovel, or they dig it out with their hands. We leave a stick in there, in the hole, if it is a little rockhole, for the birds to \nperch on. If it is a big rockhole, we cover it up because when you come back you might want a drink of water and \nyou don\u2019t want to see a dead carcass in there, like kangaroos.  Mr Allan Ashwin also gave evidence on the process \nof cleaning rockholes:At Community Bore, that country there is all sort of spinifex country on there in some places \nyou can bump into like a little gnamma hole like a rockhole. You clean them out with your hands, take all the dirt out \nif there\u2019s not water in them. Or if you got a mug or something you can use that to clean it out, if they full of sand. If \nyou don\u2019t do it then it\u2019s going to be full of sand and there will be no water in there. You got to clean it out to keep it \nclean so there will be more water there.  In his witness statement and in oral evidence, Mr Victor Ashwin recalled \ncleaning out rockholes in the Barr Smith Ranges when he was a child.  Ms Hogarth gave evidence of men cleaning \nout rockholes, as follows:When the men were doing the mustering for the shearing, they would go and visit places. \nThey would visit Mica Well on Yeelirrie. There\u2019s men\u2019s business at that place, and we\u2019re not supposed to go there \nso we don\u2019t go there. The men would go to sacred places over there, and we go one other side to come into the \nstation. We never ever go there. When we were going from Altona, the shearing shed, all the way back to Yeelirrie, \nthe men would point \u2018don\u2019t go that way\u2019, so we don\u2019t ever go.\n\n When the men were mustering, they would go to the rockholes and clean them out for the next rain to come and fill \nit up.  Mr Muir gave evidence of rockholes being cleaned at Mount Keith, as follows:At Mt Keith, before the mine \nwas there we travelled out there to clear out the rockholes. It was the end of a long hot summer and it was all \ncovered up. You could smell it from quite a way because all the animals had come and died there because of the \ndrought. We cleared everything out and burned it all on the side and got the water clean and flowing again. Some of \nthe oldies had done a ceremony on it and then when we went away that year there was a plague of emus! This is \npart of releasing the power, the pimarr, which brings the emus out.  Ms Wonyabong said in her oral evidence that it \nis the job of the \u201cold people\u201d, such as Mr Keith Narrier or Mr Richard Narrier, to clean out rockholes.  In her oral \nevidence, Ms Geraldine Hogarth explained the process of protecting rockholes in the following way:... when we dig \nthe water we can \u2013 in rockholes and soak you can put branches in there to stop it evaporating or if animals might \nfall in there. But after the quartz will cover it over because after the couple of rains we had the last couple of days \nthere\u2019s water plentiful for the animals out.  Ms Hogarth also said that the location of rockholes and soaks are \nsignalled through the use of rocks placed on the ground or in trees.  A number of witnesses gave evidence with \nrespect to controlling access to the claim area by others. In particular, Mr James said that non-Aboriginal people \nshould seek permission to access the Tjiwarl area. He said that as a result of community consultation, a sign had \n\n\n\nbeen erected at Tjiwarl to prevent non-Aboriginal people entering the site. Mr Leroy Beaman said in his evidence \nthat non-Aboriginal people should not access Lake Miranda as it is a place \u201cfor our black fellas and this is our story, \nyou know, dreaming about this place\u201d. Mr Beaman also expressed the concern that non-Aboriginal people \naccessing protected sites might wake up the \u201cdreaming Snake\u201d. In his evidence, Mr Muir said that members of the \nclaim group had controlled the access of non-Aboriginal people by ensuring that a mining camp was not built at \nLogan Spring. He said they also controlled access by managing the impacts of power transmission lines and \nmanaging the relocation of roads to avoid ceremonial grounds. Mr Muir also said that a fence had been erected \naround the site at Pii in order to protect the site from any impact of grazing.\n\nA right to protect the environment?  The applicant also advanced a separate right, described as a \u201cright to protect \nresources and the habitat of living resources\u201d in the claim area. They seemed to nominate this as a separate right \nout of an abundance of caution, lest the content of the right to \u201cmaintain and protect places\u201d was not seen as \nextending to a positive right to \u201cdo things necessary to ensure the preservation and propagation of the resources of \nthe Claimed Area\u201d.  In Alyawarr at [136]-[140], the appellant challenged a determination of native title on a large \nnumber of grounds, but the Full Court grouped the grounds into three main issues. The second of the three issues \nwas the nature of the native title rights defined in the determination. One of the formulations in the determination \nwhich was challenged by the Northern Territory was para 3(d), which defined a right of access to the land and to \nprotect sites on the land in the following way:the right to have access to, maintain and protect places and areas of \nimportance on or in the land and waters, including rock art, engraving sites and stone arrangements.  The debate \nbefore the Full Court was over the content and scope of the word \u201cprotect\u201d and whether it necessarily involved a \nright to control access and to exclude others from the land. The Full Court held (at [140]) that the non-exclusive \nnature of the right meant it would not confer a right to control access to sites or resources. The Full Court endorsed \nwhat had been said by a previous Full Court in Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283; 134 FCR 16 at \n[25] about a right of that kind:The notion of protection of significant Aboriginal sites is well understood. It may \ninvolve physical activities on the site to prevent its destruction, but it also extends to control of ceremonial activities.  \nIn their submissions, the applicant accepts that even if identified as a separate right to \u201cprotect resources\u201d such a \nright \u201cwould not give rise to an enforceable right to preventing others from taking resources or doing things that \nwould damage the habitat of living resources\u201d. Instead, the applicant submits such a right would involve a \u201cpositive \nright to do things necessary to ensure the preservation and propagation of the resources of the Claimed Area, \nwhich may not fall within the scope of maintaining and protecting places and objects of significance\u201d.  It seemed \nfrom some of the evidence relied upon (such as that from Mr Muir, Mr Lewis and Mr Allan Ashwin about burning off \ncountry) that the focus was not on sites and places, as might be thought to be the focus of the right accepted by \nthe State, but a right which has more active content in relation to the natural environment.  I am not satisfied such a \nright has been made out on the evidence. The evidence about traditional burning practices was sparse to say the \nleast. In contrast, the evidence about cleaning rockholes as part of protecting sites of significance was ample, but \nthis falls well within the right in the form accepted by the State. The right has some positive content, which includes \nthe protection of natural resources \u2013 that is, it contemplates activities designed to protect and preserve the quality of \nand access to waterholes. I do not consider any different right of general protection of the environment has been \nproven.  Even if it had, I would have doubts whether it could properly be seen as a non-exclusive right, because the \nonly activity identified as falling within it (burning country) would seem to involve, of its nature, a right to control \naccess and exclude others, which would seem to be inconsistent with a non-exclusive right.\n\nThe right to receive a portion of any traditional resources (not including minerals and petroleum) taken from land or \nwaters by Aboriginal people  The State conceded that a right of this kind can be recognised in a determination of \nnative title. I am satisfied on the evidence that such a right has from sovereignty been part of the traditional laws \nand customs of Aboriginal people in occupation of the claim area. I give three examples from the evidence.  First, \nMr Edwin Beaman\u2019s evidence was:Marlu, it\u2019s there for us, for Aboriginal people. I can\u2019t say \u201cDon\u2019t kill that\u201d to \nanother blackfella because that\u2019s for him to feed his family. No one else can tell me not to hunt kangaroo either, no \nway. But if they\u2019re hunting on Yakabindie, it would be mine. That\u2019s my kuka [meat]. They might kill it, but they gotta \nshare it out to us if we pull up.  Second, Mr Richard Narrier\u2019s evidence was:My father and them old peoples taught \nme how to hunt. All that thing with spears gone a long time ago, we use rifles now. We get a vehicle and a rifle and \nthat\u2019s all.\n\n\n\n When we go get a feed from hunting we share things out to every people from different towns. We have close \nknitted families.\n\n You follow goanna around and knock them in the head, or dig them out. You use whatever you got, a stick or a \nstone to knock \u2018em out. You roast it in the fire and clean them out; get the skin off them. Tie the back legs and front \nlegs up and put a stick through it. Most people go for the tail but I like the liver! People can take their pick.\n\n Lot\u2019s of rules about kangaroo. You got t[o] cook it in the ground; cut him up the right way. You get the legs off and \ncut it through the middle. You use any sort of wood, mulga or that, for the fire. \n\n There\u2019s a rule from the old people, the man go out and catch a kangaroo with the spear and they cook it and cut it \nup and then they give it out to people, they share it out. To the older people first and then to whatever is left over. \nThe one who gone out and killed it, cooked it gave out the best bits to the old people and then took his pick. That\u2019s \nthe traditional rule I got from stories from the old people. I think that law is gone now; it\u2019s finished.  I should make it \nclear that what I understood Mr Narrier to be saying was \u201cgone\u201d by way of the law was that the person who caught \nkangaroo had to give the best bits to the old people, then took his pick. I understood him to mean that was not a \nsteadfast rule applicable at all times, given how men hunted in current times. However, for example, during the on \ncountry hearings when a kangaroo was caught and cooked, it was apparent that those elders present were offered \npieces before others.  The third and final example is from the evidence of Ms Harris:If you\u2019re going into another \nperson\u2019s country, you light a fire, waru, to let people know you\u2019re coming, like a greeting. You\u2019ll light a fire or smoke \nthem, at a boundary. I never seen it happen, I was small, but I heard the stories, and heard of people asking \npermission to come into my father\u2019s area. They\u2019d go off and talk, the tribal men together. They\u2019ll ask permission to \ngo out there and hunt on the other side of the boundary, and then they\u2019ll come back and share out the feed. I heard \nof this happening around Leinster Downs, Lawlers and Mount Keith too. My dad told me about that.  In contrast to \nthe next asserted right, the evidence about the content of this right was sufficiently consistent for me to be satisfied \nof its existence and continued acknowledgment.\n\nThe right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of land and waters in the claim area by Western Desert \npeople  This right is claimed by the applicant on the basis that the claim group is a \u201csubset\u201d of Western Desert \nsociety, and a right of this kind should be recognised as enforceable against other members of Western Desert \nsociety. The State disputes this claim, mostly on the basis that the recognition of such a right would be inconsistent \nwith the partial extinguishment of the exclusive right to possession, use and occupation. Although the dispute \nbetween the parties is in one sense a dispute about the nature and extent of extinguishment, I consider it is best \ndealt with in this section of my reasons. I deal first with the evidence, then with the law, and then set out my \nconclusion on this issue.  I have set out in various places in these reasons evidence from the claimant witnesses, \nand anthropological evidence from Dr Sackett, about the way in times past Aboriginal people whose country is \nclose to the claim area, or is situated further to the east, traversed and used the country, and interacted with \nAboriginal people occupying the claim area. The claimant evidence is that such interaction continues to occur, \nespecially with areas to the north around Wiluna.  I have found the claimant evidence somewhat equivocal in \nrelation to interactions in the claim area, and use of the claim area, by other Western Desert people or non-Western \nDesert Aboriginal people. It is less clear than their evidence about how they treat people who are total strangers to \nthe claim area. There is some evidence of the need to seek permission, but some evidence of no such need. There \nwas no evidence suggesting the circumstances in which permission could be refused, suggesting perhaps that if \npermission were required, it was more a kind of \u201cnotice\u201d rather than real permission. There is also some overlap \nwith the right to receive a portion of any traditional resources taken from land and waters by Aboriginal people.  \nSome of the evidence includes the following.  Mr Bingham\u2019s evidence was:If someone another Aboriginal person, \nnot from that area, they wanted to take emu eggs from Yeelirrie or somewhere, it would be okay, as long as we\u2019re \nwith them. As long as they go back where they from, they can\u2019t make a ngurra there if they not from there, just \nvisiting is okay.  Mr Henry Ashwin gave the following evidence, which does not expressly relate to other Western \nDesert people, but it seems to me this is implicit in the way he expresses the need for permission, and his reference \nto the country of such other people:Other people could go to this area for hunting, if you know this country you \ncan go for as long as you don\u2019t get lost. If they want to come here, still someone got to ask us. In the right way, \n\n\n\notherwise they\u2019ll get themselves in shit. They\u2019ll feel the same way if I go there and muck around, they got to ask and \nhave someone who know the country.  Mr Ashwin also gave this evidence about Aboriginal people who were \nclosely associated with the claim area:I learned about the stories for country from Mr P [Billy Patch, deceased] and \nF.J. [Friday Jones]. They taught me what my father taught them; he taught them about the country, and then they \npassed it on to me. You got to pass it on otherwise everything fade away and you\u2019ll have nothing. They taught me \nabout the Two Mans [Wati Kutjarra], the Snakes [Tjila Kutjarra], and some other stories I can\u2019t say in front of \nwomen. Mr P was always invited to that country, because we share the same law and the same language \u2013 we \ncan\u2019t tell them to go along and leave, why can\u2019t they stay? It\u2019s a home for any tribal people.  Mr Billy Patch was, I \nnote, the lead applicant on the Birriliburu determination.  Mr Keith Narrier\u2019s evidence was as follows:Other \nblackfellas; they can hunt on this country. We go to their country and hunt around there and they let us. We let \nthem the same way. They might not ask me; they go there and hunt and I do the same over there.\n\n If I went out to country a long way away from here then I would ask the elders for that place where to go before I \nwent hunting. There might be some sacred sites, mens places, womens places. Like that. Otherwise you might go \nto the wrong place. You would get punished I suppose, you do. You get punished by the guardians from that place, \nWarburton Ranges, those people there.\n\n [Warburton] Ranges people, they know where to go. They been here before.  Ms Wonyabong said in her \nevidence:Lately people from Wiluna just go out on Yakabindie and Albion Downs, collecting emu eggs. They don\u2019t \nask. I don\u2019t think they really have to ask. We just hear people talking about going out there; they just go where the \nemus are laying.  The clearest evidence on the issue came not from one of the claim group members, but from Mr \nPatterson, who said:If I wanted to go hunting in that Tjiwarl area then I would have to ask someone, like the \nRedmonds, the Ashwins or the Narriers and ask if it was okay.\n\n Best to get them lot in the group now to talk for their country. You can get Beasley [Keith Narrier] to talk for his \ncountry. That\u2019s a rule \u2013 because he\u2019s the right person. All the Narriers and Redmonds, they can talk. You got to \ntalk to them right lot. All decisions about country have to be made by the right people. Important decisions about \ncountry have to be made by the senior people for the country.\n\n I don\u2019t know much about that Tjiwarl country, but I know about the rules. I can\u2019t say nothing much about that \ncountry. We still respect that Law. I ask permission to go onto other people\u2019s country \u2013 their ngurra \u2013 and other \npeople ask permission to go onto my country. If outside people want to come onto country, they should speak to \nthe right people first.  While this evidence is clear and reliable on several aspects of the content of the native title \nrights and interests also identified by the claim group members, it is somewhat at odds with the claim group \nmembers\u2019 own evidence about whether permission is required for other Western Desert people.  Despite the \napplicant\u2019s reliance on it in their written submissions, I do not consider those portions of Dr Brunton\u2019s report to \nwhich the applicant referred can be used to support the applicant\u2019s claim for a right of this kind. What Dr Brunton \nsaid appeared in a section of his first report where he set out his opinions about what kind of laws and customs may \nhave existed in the claim area occupied, as he considered it was, by Ngaiawonga people who were not members of \nWestern Desert society. I do not see how that evidence can assist a claim which is based, as the applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions recognise and the authorities below make clear, on a group being a \u201csubset\u201d of a larger society.  On \nthe evidence, I am not satisfied the applicant has established a right of the kind claimed existed at sovereignty, nor \nhave they established that, even if it did, the members of the claim group have continued to observe such a right. \nThe evidence suggests a more flexible attitude to the way in which other Western Desert people can come into, \nenjoy, and take resources from, the claim area.  That finding makes it unnecessary for me to determine the legal \nissues which divide the parties about how, if at all, a native title right of this kind survives the extinguishment of a \nnative title right to exclusive possession, and in what circumstances such a right exists in any event. However, since \nthe matter has been the subject of detailed submissions, I will make some observations to indicate what my position \nwould have been, had I needed to decide the question.  The determination of a right of this kind appears to have its \n\n\n\norigins in the Full Court decision in Ward [2003] FCAFC 283; 134 FCR 16 at [27]. That formulation was set out at \n[5(e)] as follows:The right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the NT determination area by \nAboriginal people who are governed by the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the native \ntitle holders.  A right of this kind was recognised in De Rose (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110; 145 FCR 290 at [168]- \n[170], although the issue raised on appeal was whether such a right was inconsistent with the rights of access \ngranted to Aboriginal people by s 47 of the Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 (SA), which the \nFull Court held it was not.  The applicant also relied on Selway J\u2019s decision in Gumana. It seems to me the rights as \nexpressed in Gumana were of a different kind.  Both the rationale for, and the difficulty with, the recognition of such \na right was explained by the Full Court in Alyawarr at [151]:Although para 5(e) of the determination in Ward FC 2 \nhad the sanction of the Full Court in that case, it is not without difficulty. There is a risk that it may be seen as \ncreating a criterion for exclusion based in part upon Aboriginality. In any event it does not appear in this case that \nthere are persons other than the native title holders who are bound by their traditional laws and customs. The \nposition would be different were the native title holders a subset of a wider society incorporating other groups bound \nby the same traditional laws and customs. An example of such a case is De Rose v South Australia[2002] FCA \n1342 where the native title holders were found to be a subset of a society comprising the Western Desert Bloc. To \nthe extent that the native title holders could collectively exclude particular members from particular areas, such as \nwomen from law grounds, that is a matter best left to the intramural workings of the traditional laws and customs. It \nis not a matter requiring determination as a distinct native title right.  The Full Court in Alyawarr recognised the kind \nof right for which the applicant contends could exist where (as here) a claim group is \u201ca subset of a wider society \nincorporating other groups bound by the same traditional laws and customs\u201d. The reference to De Rose (No 2) \nconfirms this. The next sentence (concerning intramural allocation) is, in my opinion, a separate point being made \nby the Full Court and not one which would be appropriate had this kind of right been made out on the evidence. It \nwould not be an issue of intramural allocation, because it concerns relationships between members of the native \ntitle holding group and people outside that group, albeit other Aboriginal people who form part of the same \u201cwider \nsociety\u201d.  The State\u2019s essential contention is that:... the claimed non-exclusive right to make decisions is not a right \nor interest which would have existed prior to the acquisition of sovereignty but is rather an incident of a right [that is, \nthe right of exclusive possession] which has been extinguished by inconsistent grant, if it ever existed.  I do not \nconsider the State\u2019s submission is correct. To commence, as its submission as developed does, with the concept of \nextinguishment and what this entails, is to commence at the wrong point. The correct starting point is to consider \nwhether the applicant has established on the evidence there was a right of this nature existing in relation to the land \nand waters of the claim area at sovereignty, then to see whether it has continued, and finally whether it is \ninconsistent with the non-native title rights and interests which have subsequently been granted over the claim area.  \nAlthough I have found the applicant has not established the right existed at sovereignty, and even if it did they have \nnot established that it has continued to be observed in substantially the same form to the present time, I consider \nhad I been satisfied of those matters I would have found the right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment \nof land and waters in the claim area by other Aboriginal people was a right, on the authority of Western Australia v \nWard [2000] FCA 191; 99 FCR 316 (Ward (FC)), Alyawarr,Gumana and Jango (see [571]), which was capable of \nbeing recognised in a determination of native title.  However, there would then have been a factual question to be \ndecided: namely, whether the continued existence of that right would be inconsistent with all or any of the non-\nnative title interests which have been granted over the claim area. This, it seems to me, would be a factual question \nof no small measure, and some of the State\u2019s contentions about the dilemmas the continued existence of such a \nright might throw up have some force. I do not propose to decide this factual question because it is too far removed \nfrom, and hypothetical to, the findings I have made. It should await a case where the issue is squarely raised.\n\nEXTINGUISHMENT    There are limited, but substantial areas of disagreement between the parties on \nextinguishment issues. Where the matters are agreed, I deal with them in summary form, relying substantially on \nthe amended parties\u2019 agreed statement of issues regarding extinguishment and other interests.\n\nMatters that are agreed    During the course of the trial, the applicant and participating respondents, to whom I will \nrefer as \u201cthe parties\u201d, filed an agreed statement of issues regarding extinguishment and other interests. The agreed \nstatement was amended in November 2015 in order to correct errors in the Schedule. The agreed statement also \ncontained the four issues that are in dispute in this proceeding, but before those issues are considered, it is \nconvenient to record below the extinguishment matters that are agreed between the parties.  At the outset, the \nparties agreed on a number of preliminary matters. First, the parties agreed that native title, if it exists, has been \n\n\n\npartially extinguished by executive acts over the whole of the claim area. The parties agreed that, on that basis, it \nwould not be necessary for the Court to determine the validity of certain acts and whether those acts had the effect \nof partially extinguishing native title. Second, the parties agreed that native title, if it existed at the relevant time, has \nbeen wholly extinguished by the acts identified as agreed in the statement, namely: the granting of freehold titles \nspecified in the Schedule to the statement; the vesting of specified reserves; the granting of specified leases of \nreserves under s 41A of the Land Act 1898 (WA) and s 32 of the Land Act 1933 (WA); and the granting of specified \nspecial leases.  Third, the parties reached agreement that any determination of native title should recognise \u201cother \ninterests\u201d as identified in the agreed statement. Fourth, it was agreed by the parties that the issues to be \ndetermined by the Court in respect of extinguishment and \u201cother interests\u201d are those identified in the agreed \nstatement. Fifth, the parties reached consensus that the agreed statement should prevail to the extent of any \ninconsistency between the agreed statement and the parties\u2019 respective statements of issues, facts and contentions \non extinguishment.  Sixth and on the issue of partial extinguishment, the parties reached agreement on the \nexistence of partial extinguishment over the claim area, and flowing from that, reached agreement on two sub-\nissues. First (and overlapping with some of the earlier propositions in the agreed statement), any right to control \naccess to the land and waters has been extinguished, and as a result, any native title does not confer possession, \noccupation, use and enjoyment of the land and waters to the exclusion of all others. Second, the parties agreed that \nif a native title right existed in relation to the ability to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the lands and \nwaters (despite the participating respondents denying that such a right ever existed), a native title right to receive a \nportion of any traditional resources, excluding minerals or petroleum, taken from the land and waters in the claim \narea would have survived any partial extinguishment.  Seventh, the parties conveniently summarised the agreed \nrelationship between any native title rights and interests and \u201cother interests\u201d in the following terms:(c) any \ndetermination of native title does not affect the validity of those other interests;\n\n (d) to the extent of any inconsistency between the other interests and the continued existence, enjoyment or \nexercise of the native title rights and interests, the native title rights and interests continue to exist in their entirety, \nbut the native title rights and interests have no effect in relation to the other interests to the extent of the \ninconsistency during the currency of the other interests; and\n\n (e) otherwise the other interests co-exist with the native title rights and interests and, for the avoidance of doubt, \nthe doing of an activity required or permitted under those interests prevails over the native title rights and interests \nand their exercise, but does not extinguish them.  On the issue of freehold titles, the parties agreed that freehold \ntitles set out in the agreed statement wholly extinguished native title, and as such, those areas are to be excluded \nfrom any determination of native title. There are 132 freehold titles in this category. They are set out in Table 1 to \nthe amended parties\u2019 agreed statement and need not be set out here.  In respect of vested reserves, the parties \nagreed that native title was wholly extinguished by the vesting of the reserves set out in the amended parties\u2019 \nagreed statement and accordingly, those areas are to be excluded from any determination of native title. Those \nvested reserves are as follows: RES 5505, RES 8400, RES 10378, RES 17675, RES 30897, RES 39075, RES \n41816, RES 41817, RES 41818, RES 42277, RES 42315, RES 42831 and RES 42934.  The parties then agreed \nthat the unvested reserves set out in the amended parties\u2019 agreed statement should be included in any \ndetermination of native title as \u201cother interests\u201d. Those unvested reserves are as follows: RES 4004, RES 6405, \nRES 6913, RES 7003, RES 7553, RES 7724, RES 9016, RES 9288, RES 9416, RES 9417, RES 9418, RES 9699, \nRES 10037, RES 10247, RES 10293, RES 12207, RES 12833, RES 12834, RES 12835, RES 12836, RES 13093, \nRES 13094, RES 13095, RES 13711, RES 13871, RES 15441, RES 15889, RES 16611, RES 18137, RES 18760, \nRES 19403 and RES 46801.  In respect of leases of reserves, the parties agreed that native title was wholly \nextinguished by the granting of leases under s 41A of the Land Act 1898 and s 32 of the Land Act 1933. Those \nleases of reserves are as follows: L332/767, L332/783, L332/1085, L332/1177, L332/1178, L332/1986 and \nL954/41A. Further, the parties agreed that reserve lease J711475 is valid as an \u201cother interest\u201d which excludes it \nfrom any determination of native title. The parties submit that particular reserve lease should be included as an \n\u201cother interest\u201d on the basis that native title was previously wholly extinguished over the area of the lease.  The \nparties reached agreement in respect of special leases. Specifically, the parties agreed that native title was wholly \nextinguished by the granting of special leases 3116/6675 and 3116/6676 and that those areas will be excluded from \nany determination of native title. Further, the parties agreed that leases H586770 and I123689 will be excluded from \n\n\n\nany determination as \u201cother interests\u201d for the reason that native title was previously wholly extinguished over the \narea of the leases.  As to roads, the parties agreed that specific roads should be included as \u201cother interests\u201d in any \ndetermination of native title but those roads have not extinguished native title. Those roads are as follows: Road 2, \nRoad 5, Road 6, Road 7, Road 8, Road 11 and Road M069 (Mount Magnet \u2013 Leinster Road). The parties then \nagreed that the following roads are to be excluded from the claim area: Road 10, Road 13, Road 14, Road 15, \nRoad 16, Closed Roads 20-23.  On the issues of water bores and gravel pits, the parties agreed that the water \nbores and gravel pits referred to in the affidavits of Mr Shane Power, Ms Mia Dohnt and Ms Andrea Nunan should \nbe included as \u201cother interests\u201d in any determination of native title.  In respect of easements, the parties agreed that \nspecific easements should be included as \u201cother interests\u201d in any determination of native title but have not had any \nextinguishing effect on native title. Those easements are as follows: EASMT 1, EASMT 2(a), EASMT 2(b), EASMT \n3 and EASMT 4.  In respect of mining tenements in the claim area, the parties agreed that the mining tenements set \nout in the amended parties\u2019 agreed statement should be included in any determination of native title as \u201cother \ninterests\u201d. There are 541 mining tenements listed in this category. They are set out in Table 5 to the amended \nparties\u2019 agreed statement and need not be set out here.  As to petroleum tenements in the claim area, the parties \nagreed that specific petroleum pipeline licences should be included as \u201cother interests\u201d in any determination of \nnative title but those licences have not had any extinguishing effect on native title. Those petroleum pipeline \nlicences are as follows: PL 24; PL 25 and PL 26.  The parties reached agreement in respect of some issues relating \nto ownership of minerals and petroleum. Specifically, they agreed that any determination of native title should \nprovide that there are no native title rights and interests in the claim area in or in relation to:(a) minerals as defined \nin the Mining Act 1904 (WA) and the Mining Act 1978 (WA); or\n\n (b) petroleum as defined in the Petroleum Act 1936 (WA) and in thePetroleum and Geothermal Resources Energy \nAct 1967 (WA); or\n\n (c) geothermal energy resources and geothermal energy as defined in thePetroleum and Geothermal Energy \nResources Act.  In respect of groundwater areas, the parties reached consensus that the groundwater areas under \nthe Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 (WA) should be included in any determination of native title as \u201cother \ninterests\u201d. The parties identified two groundwater areas to be included, namely the East Murchison Groundwater \nArea and the Goldfields Groundwater Area.  Finally, the parties reached agreement with respect to the rights and \ninterests of Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra). The parties agreed that any determination of native title should \ninclude those rights and interests as \u201cother interests\u201d, as follows:(a) as the owner or operator of telecommunications \nfacilities within the determination area;\n\n (b) created pursuant to the Post and Telegraph Act 1901 (Cth), theTelecommunications Act 1975 (Cth), the \nAustralian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989 (Cth), the Telecommunications Act 1991 (Cth) and the \nTelecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) including rights:(i) to inspect land;\n\n (ii) to install and operate telecommunications facilities; and\n\n (iii) to alter, remove, replace, maintain, repair and ensure the proper functioning of its telecommunication \nfacilities;(c) for its employees, agents or contractors to access its telecommunications facilities in and in the vicinity \nof the determination area in performance of their duties; and\n\n (d) under any lease, licence, access agreement or easement relating to its telecommunications facilities in the \ndetermination area.  One of the matters identified as not agreed was whether any determination should contain an \n\u201cany other public works\u201d clause with liberty to apply to the Court to identify such works. Subsequently, the State \nindicated it did not press for the inclusion of such a clause and, as no public works have been identified, a clause of \nthis kind may not be necessary.  Accordingly, that leaves four issues in dispute. They are:(1) whether the renewals \nof the pastoral leases that fall wholly or partially within the claim area on 1 July 2015 are valid future acts; \n\n\n\n (2) whether miscellaneous licences L53/161 and L53/177 were validly granted;\n\n (3) whether seven specified miscellaneous licences are invalid future acts; and \n\n (4) whether s 47B of the NT Act applies to disregard extinguishment in specified areas of the claim area.\n\nThe consequences of non-compliance with the future act procedural provisions    I propose to deal with this issue at \na general level since the resolution of this debate is capable of affecting the pastoral leases and all of the \nmiscellaneous licences which are still in issue. The issue turns on the effect and application of the Full Court\u2019s \ndecision in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414; 108 FCR 453, and two single judge decisions which \nhave applied it consistently with the contentions of the respondents.  It appears to be common ground that the grant \nof miscellaneous licences such as those in issue here passes the freehold test under section 24MD of the NT Act. \nActs which pass this test are future acts (whether legislative, executive or administrative) that apply in the same \nway to native title holders or native title claimants as they do to other people who hold a fee simple freehold in land. \nThere then do appear to be various concessions (at least, from some of the licence holders) about which of the \nprovisions in Pt 2 Div 3 would have applied to each licence: see, for example, the submissions filed on behalf of \nBHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd, BHP Billiton Yakabindie Nickel Pty Ltd, Albion Downs Pty Ltd and Weebo Pastoral \nCo Pty Ltd at [17] and [28]-[29].  Although the State relied on Lardil in its submissions about the validity of the \nrenewals of the pastoral leases, in its submissions about the miscellaneous licences it does not refer to Lardil. Nor \ndoes it do so in its reply. However, the licence holders then make submissions about the effect of the Full Court\u2019s \ndecision in Lardil. The basic contention is that Lardil is authority for the proposition that compliance with the \nprocedural requirements in Div 3 (other than those in Subdiv P) of Pt 2 of the NT Act does not condition the validity \nof the future act. The licence holders therefore submit that any procedural non-compliance established by the \napplicant will not affect the validity of the grant or renewal of the miscellaneous licences as future acts.  In its \nsubmissions on pastoral leases, the State relied on the reasons of French J in Lardil at [58]:As appears from the \nprovisions of each of the subdivisions referred to in Div 3 of Pt 2, the acts which they validate must be future acts. \nTheir validation by a particular subdivision is conditional upon their characterisation as a future act to which that \nsubdivision or section within it applies. The subdivisions which provide for prior notification to registered native title \nclaimants and others do not appear to condition the validity of the future acts to which they apply upon compliance \nwith that requirement.  The State also relied on the reasons of Dowsett J at [117]:[It is a] relatively surprising \nassertion that Parliament intended to invalidate acts because of failure to give notice to registered claimants \npursuant to the relevant validating subdivision ... [T]he express wording of each of the validating provisions \nsuggests otherwise. Section 24HA(3) validates a future act without any suggestion that such validation is \ndependent on any other aspect of the section or subdivision. Native title rights are not extinguished by the act in \nquestion, but enjoyment of them may be suspended. Compensation is payable, but there is no suggestion that \npayment is a condition of validity. There is also nothing to suggest that compliance with s 24HA(7) is a condition \nprecedent to validity. Similarly, s 24MD(1) validates a future act with no suggestion that validity is dependent upon \nobservation of procedural rights.  The licence holders also rely on two single judge decisions which they submit \nhave applied Lardil to the same effect. Those decisions are Daniel v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1388; 212 ALR \n51 and Banjima People v Western Australia (No 2) [2013] FCA 868; 305 ALR 1.  As I understand the position, the \nState relied on Lardil to defeat the consequence of the applicant\u2019s second argument about pastoral leases. That is, \nthe argument that there had been, in the renewals, an extension to the term of the pastoral leases so as to trigger \nthe application of s 24MD of the NT Act. If, contrary to the State\u2019s submissions, there had been such an extension, \nthen the State relied on Lardil to submit that non-compliance with the terms of s 24MD did not affect the validity of \nthe renewals as a future act. Given that I have accepted the State\u2019s submissions on the applicant\u2019s second \nargument, there is no need to decide how Lardil might operate in relation to the application of s 24MD(1) to the \npastoral leases. I do however need to decide, on the submissions of some of the licence holders, how Lardil affects \nthe validity of the grant of any of the miscellaneous licences as future acts.  Lardil came before a single judge, and \nthen a Full Court, on an application in the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction for declaratory and final injunctive relief to \nprevent the establishment of a buoy mooring in the Gulf of Carpentaria, in an area of waters over which the \napplicant had a registered native title claim, which was yet to be determined. The buoy mooring was to be used by \na ship, the MV Wunma, designated to transfer zinc concentrate from Pasminco\u2019s mine near Mount Isa to bulk \n\n\n\ncarriers moored further out in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Pasminco, the third respondent, had applied for and been \ngranted an authority under Queensland regulations to establish the mooring, the grant having occurred sometime \nafter the native title claim had been transferred to the Federal Court. There had been, it was common ground, no \ncompliance with the procedural requirements of Pt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act. At first instance, the applicant was \nunsuccessful, broadly on the basis that, given their status as claimants and without a final determination of native \ntitle, they could not make out a claim for the final relief they sought. The applicant was also unsuccessful on \narguments challenging the validity of the authority under the state regime pursuant to which it was granted. The \napplicant had not sought interlocutory relief.  It is pertinent to set out how French J (as his Honour then was) \ndescribed (at [44]) what he called \u201cthe federal question\u201d (the validity of the authority under state law also being in \nissue, as I have noted):... whether the appellants, as registered claimants, have on that basis alone a right to \nrequire compliance with procedures under Div 3 of the NTA as though the grant of the Authority were a future act \nwith respect to the asserted native title rights. Absent any such right and absent any evidence of, or reliance upon, \nnative title rights and interests affected by the grant of the Authority, there is a real question whether the State \nquestion is encompassed by the federal matter.  His Honour went on to characterise Pt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act as \nproviding for the protection of native title, such protection being said to exist through the \u201cbroad procedural \nframework\u201d established by that Division for the doing of future acts.  There were two real difficulties in the way the \napplicant in Lardil put their case, which affected the reasoning of the Full Court. The first was, as Merkel J observed \nat [70] (see also French J at [59] and [61]) that the applicant sought to rely on their status as a registered native title \nclaimant as sufficient to establish an entitlement to the relief it sought. They did not seek to establish that the future \nact \u201caffected\u201d native title rights and interests. It was that step which the Full Court held was the critical one in \nsecuring any relief. The second difficulty was that, as Dowsett J pointed out at [105], the applicant contended non-\ncompliance with the Div 3 procedural requirements resulted in a future act being invalid, whether or not the \nunderlying native title claim was ultimately successful. This was the aspect of the applicant\u2019s reasoning which \nDowsett J found so problematic.  It can be seen that the second difficulty is linked to the first, because both give \nlittle or no work to the requirement in the definition of a future act that the act \u201caffects\u201d native title rights and \ninterests. The definition assumes that there are underlying native title rights and interests to be protected, but does \nso in a precautionary and protective way so that Div 3 will cover circumstances where there is a registered claim but \nno final determination concerning the existence of native title.  The difficulties which troubled the Full Court in Lardil \n\u2013 namely that the argument for injunctive and declaratory relief against Pasminco was founded only on an assertion \nof the existence of native title rights and interests \u2013 are not difficulties present in this proceeding. I have found that \nnative title rights and interests have continued to exist in the claim area and they should be recognised by a \ndetermination. On this finding, native title rights and interests existed at the time the miscellaneous licences were \ngranted. There is no doubt the grants \u201caffected\u201d those native title rights and interests because the grants were at \nleast partially inconsistent with the enjoyment and exercise of those native title rights and interests: seeWestern \nAustralia v Ward [2002] HCA 28; 213 CLR 1 at [22]- [23] (Ward (HC)); s 227 of the NT Act.  In those circumstances, \nthe relevance and applicability of the observations of the Full Court in Lardil arises for consideration. French J made \nit expressly clear his remarks were obiter dicta: see [59]. Dowsett J\u2019s observations fall into the same category. \nMerkel J described the matters raised by French and Dowsett JJ as \u201csubstantial and cogent\u201d, but then said (at \n[72]):In my view, however, it is preferable to determine this issue, which is one of considerable importance, in a \ncontext where the existence of native title, and the question of how a future act affects it, have been determined.  I \ndo not consider I am bound by Lardil to conclude that in the circumstances of this proceeding the non-compliance \nwith Div 3 means that each of the miscellaneous licences should be given full force and effect as against the \napplicant\u2019s native title rights and interests which have been found to exist. That is because, first, their Honours \nmade it clear their observations were obiter, but also, second, and more importantly, Lardilwas not a case dealing \nwith native title rights and interests which had been recognised as existing.  The reasoning of French J in particular \nis resonant of the distinctions between unlawfulness and invalidity made by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v \nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355, decided some three years prior to Lardil. \nRejecting the traditional dichotomy between mandatory and directory provisions, the plurality in Project Blue Sky \nentrenched a different approach based on ascertaining legislative intention whether non-compliance was intended \nto render an act or decision invalid. At [91], the plurality (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) said:An act done \nin breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. \nWhether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to \ncomply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, \n\n\n\nits subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the \ncondition. Unfortunately, a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment. \nThe cases show various factors that have proved decisive in various contexts, but they do no more than provide \nguidance in analogous circumstances. There is no decisive rule that can be applied; there is not even a ranking of \nrelevant factors or categories to give guidance on the issue.\n\n (Footnotes omitted.)  The erection of this distinction then led the plurality at the end of its judgment to clarify that \nnon-compliance with statutory requirements may nevertheless have legal consequences (at [100]):In a case like the \npresent, however, the difference between holding an act done in breach of s 160 is invalid and holding it is valid is \nlikely to be of significance only in respect of actions already carried out by, or done in reliance on the conduct of, the \nABA. Although an act done in contravention of s 160 is not invalid, it is a breach of the Act and therefore unlawful. \nFailure to comply with a directory provision \u201cmay in particular cases be punishable\u201d. That being so, a person with \nsufficient interest is entitled to sue for a declaration that the ABA has acted in breach of the Act and, in an \nappropriate case, obtain an injunction restraining that body from taking any further action based on its unlawful \naction.  Merkel J made a similar point at [73] in Lardil, where his Honour said:I would add that even if non-\ncompliance with the statutory procedural requirements does not invalidate a future act, it does not follow that the \nprocedural rights conferred under the relevant statutory provisions are illusory or ineffective. The procedural rights \nare important entitlements conferred, for an obvious purpose, on native title claimants or holders in certain \ncircumstances. Although the NTA may not, in all cases, provide an effective or adequate statutory remedy for the \nfailure to afford those rights, equity can intervene to protect or give effect to them: see Fejo v Northern Territory of \nAustralia[1998] HCA 58; (1998) 195 CLR 96 at 123 and 139; Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie \nInfrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11; (2000) 74 ALJR 604 at 621; and Carpentaria Land \nCouncil Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland (1998) 83 FCR 483 at 508. As the appellants have failed to establish \nthat the grant of the Authority is a future act the issue of equitable intervention or relief does not arise for \nconsideration.  The context in which the High Court in Project Blue Sky considered \u201cvalidity\u201d was an administrative \nlaw context, for the purposes of exercising the Court\u2019s supervisory powers over an administrative decision, and \ndetermining the consequences of non-compliance with statutory requirements for the validity of that decision, in the \nface of statutory provisions which on their face suggested the imposition of inconsistent obligations on a decision-\nmaker. As the High Court made clear, the key issue is the ascertainment of legislative intention through the text, \ncontext and purpose of the particular statute concerned.  In the present case, the context of the NT Act, and Pt 2 \nDiv 3 in particular, should be recalled. By s 10 the NT Act declares that \u201c[n]ative title is recognised, and protected \n(emphasis added)\u201d, in accordance with the NT Act. The need for \u201cprotection\u201d arises where acts inconsistent with the \nexistence or establishment of native title may affect it, because the underlying priorities recognised in Mabo (No 2) \nand then in the NT Act are that grant of property rights over land and waters which are inconsistent with native title \ncontinuing will prevail and will extinguish native title. The important point to take from s 10 is that, as a fundamental \npremise and within the legislative compromises evident in the scheme, the NT Act contemplates a need to protect \nnative title rights and interests, both when they are claimed but not yet established, and once they are established. \nInherent to the \u201cprotection\u201d offered by the legislative scheme is s 11, which provides that \u201cnative title\u201d cannot be \nextinguished contrary to the NT Act.  However, as the High Court said in the Native Title Act Case [1995] HCA 47; \n183 CLR 373 at 469 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ):... a law protecting native title \nfrom extinguishment must either exclude the application of State and Territory laws or prescribe the areas within \nwhich those laws may operate. The Commonwealth has chosen to prescribe the areas available to control by other \nlaws by prescribing what State and Territory laws are \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d and, if valid, the conditions of validity.  \nHence the central concepts in the legislative scheme are the \u201cvalidity\u201d and \u201cinvalidity\u201d of acts affecting native title. \nAnd those terms are, as the plurality in Ward (HC) made clear, used with particular meaning in the NT Act. In the \nNative Title Act Case at 469, the Court explained what those terms mean in the context of the NT Act:The use of \nthe term \u201cvalid\u201d raises the question whether the Native Title Act is attempting to prescribe conditions relating to the \npower to make or the making of a State law, even though the validity of a State law cannot be affected by a law of \nthe Commonwealth. But the term \u201cvalid\u201d (or its derivatives), which appears in more than one of the impugned \nprovisions, has more than one meaning and it is defined in the Native Title Act to include \u201chaving full force and \neffect\u201d. In accordance with s 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), that term must be construed to have a \nmeaning which is supported by Commonwealth legislative power; it must not be construed to have a meaning \n\n\n\nwhich, in its context, would carry the Act outside Commonwealth legislative power. Therefore the use of the term, its \nderivatives or its opposite in the impugned provisions, so far as those respective terms relate to a State law, must \nbe taken to mean having, or not having, (as the case may be) full force and effect upon the regime of protection of \nnative title otherwise prescribed by the Act. In other words, those terms are not used in reference to the power to \nmake or to the making of a State or Territory law but in reference to the effect which a State law, when validly \nmade, might have in creating an exception to the blanket protection of native title by s 11(1). In using the terms \n\u201cvalid\u201d and \u201cinvalid\u201d, the Act marks out the areas relating to native title left to regulation by State and Territory laws \nor the areas relating to native title regulated exclusively by the Commonwealth regime.  The definition to which the \nHigh Court referred in Ward (HC) is contained in s 253 of the NT Act. It is an inclusive rather than an exhaustive \ndefinition, and provides that \u201cvalid includes having full force and effect\u201d. Although Div 3 of Pt 2 was not considered \nin Ward (HC) (and did not exist at the time of the Native Title ActCase) it seems to me the same analysis must be \napplied to the use of the concepts of \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201cinvalid\u201d inPt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act. The concepts are not being \nused in the sense they were used by the High Court inProject Blue Sky, with the attendant baggage of acts or \ndecisions being void, and not recognised by law in any sense. Rather, they mean capable of having full force and \neffect upon the regime of protection of native title, or not, as the case may be.  A further aspect of the context and \npurpose of the NT Act which is critical to this analysis is the continued application and effect of the RDA on the \nterms of the NT Act, and conduct pursuant to it. As the High Court in Ward (HC) explained at [99]:One effect of [s 7 \nof the NTA] is that, contrary to what otherwise might follow from the fact that the NTA is a later Act of the federal \nParliament, the NTA is not to be taken as repealing the RDA to any extent. The significance of s 7(3) is to make it \nclear that, notwithstanding the continued paramountcy of the RDA stated in the earlier sub-sections, the effect of \nthe validation achieved by the NTA is to displace the invalidity which otherwise flowed from the operation of the \nRDA.  Again, it can be seen the High Court is using the concepts of \u201cvalidity\u201d and \u201cinvalidity\u201d, in terms of s 10 of the \nRDA, as meaning having full force and effect on the regime protecting native title. I turn then to the provisions in Pt \n2 Div 3.  The terms of the \u201cOverview\u201d in s 24AA, and especially s 24AA(2) and (4), describe the effect of the \nensuing Subdivisions as making a future act valid to the extent it is \u201ccovered\u201d by the provisions. That word suggests \nthe exercise required by the provisions is to ascertain if the kind of future act in issue fits within or is comprehended \nby one of the Subdivisions. Section 24AA(2) is clear in its terms that acts not so comprehended will be invalid \u2013 that \nis, they will be without force and effect on native title.  Indigenous Land Use Agreements (Subdivs B, C and D) are \nbased on consent arrangements between native title holders, or those claiming native title, and others with property \ninterests in the relevant lands and waters. For those Subdivisions, consent of native title holders, claimants, or their \nrepresentatives, is a condition of conferring validity on future acts covered by an ILUA. However, the terms of s \n24AA(4), and the use of the language of \u201ccovered\u201d, especially when read with s 24AA(6) (\u201cThe Division also deals \nwith procedural rights and compensation for the acts\u201d), do not expressly link compliance with procedural provisions \nand validity. Rather, s 24AA(4) suggests that validity derives from an act being \u201ccovered\u201d by a particular section. \nSection 24AA(6) strengthens this construction, because it identifies procedural rights as something separate from \nthe validity of future acts. In contrast, the description in s 24AA(5) of acts covered by s 24IC or s 24MD links \ncompliance with a procedure (the right to negotiate) with validity, because it states:... for the acts to be valid it is \nalso necessary to satisfy the requirements of Subdivision P ...  The \u201calso\u201d serves to indicate a separate requirement \nfor validity is added to those set out in s 24AA(4).  Section 24AA does not refer to s 24OA, a provision I consider is \nof importance in the constructional choice to be made about the effect of the procedural requirements in Div 3. On \none view, the textual indications in s 24AA can be seen as supporting the approach taken by the Full Court in Lardil. \nOn another view, what they indicate is that in relation to future acts \u201ccovered by\u201d certain Subdivisions (for example, \nss 24IC and 24MD, which pick up Subdiv P), strict compliance with those provisions is required for validity: that, in \nmy opinion, is one way to read s 24AA(5) and the Subdivision to which it refers. Alternatively, it could be performing \nthe function of a signpost and no more, given that ss 24IC and 24MD contain cross-references to Subdiv P.  It is \nnecessary to consider each of the Subdivisions separately, to understand how the scheme is structured. Putting to \none side the ILUA provisions, and Subdiv F (which deals with non-claimant applications), the first relevant \nSubdivision is Subdiv G \u2013 primary production activities.  The category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d by this Subdivision are set \nout in s 24GB. The notification provisions in s 24GB(9) apply to some, but not all, of the activities covered by s \n24GB. The terms of the provision are that, for those activities covered by subs (9) \u201cbefore the future act is done\u201d \ncertain notifications must be given, including relevantly to either the native title holders (through their body \ncorporate) or native title claimants. There must be notification and an \u201copportunity to comment on the act or class of \nacts\u201d: see s 24GB(9)(d). Section 24GC has no notification provisions because, instead, in relation to non-exclusive \n\n\n\nagricultural leases (see s 247B) and non-exclusive pastoral leases (see s 248B) granted before 23 December 1996, \nthose future acts are deemed to prevail over (but not extinguish) native title rights and interests and any exercise of \nnative title rights and interests: see s 24GC(2), and there is no right to compensation. However, s 24GD (off-farm \nactivities directly connected to primary production) does have notification requirements (see s 24GD(6)) and it is in \nrelevantly the same terms as s 24GB(9). The same is true of s 24GE.  The second category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are \nthose in Subdiv H \u2013 management of water and airspace. The notification and comment provisions are in the same \nterms as s 24GB.  The third category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are those in Subdiv I \u2013 renewals and extensions of pre-\nexisting rights and leases. The notification requirements, in s 24ID(3), are in the same terms as previous provisions \nto which I have referred. However, subs (4), headed \u201cOther procedural rights\u201d applies the regime set out in s \n24MD(6B) to some renewals as if they were compulsory acquisitions. The terms of s 24MD(6B) provide for an \nobjection process after notification, and offer the possibility of an objection by native title holders or claimants being \nupheld in a way which could affect the renewal of the lease, subject to overriding discretions exercisable by state or \nterritory ministers: see s 24MD(6B)(d)-(g).  The fourth category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are those in Subdiv JA \u2013 public \nhousing. Section 24JAA(10) imposes both notification and consultation requirements, the latter arising if a \nregistered native title claimant, or a registered native title body corporate, requests consultation. The subject matter \nof such consultation is \u201cways of minimising the act\u2019s impact on registered native title rights and interests\u201d and, if \nrelevant, access to land and waters: see s 24JAA(14). A report of any such consultations and their outcomes must \nbe given, and may be published: see s 24JAA(16). This is an elaborate procedural provision, but it does not contain \nany text expressly conditioning validity in relation to native title rights and interests on compliance with its terms.  \nThe fifth category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are those in Subdiv J \u2013 various reservations and leases (including public works). \nSection 24JB(6) contains a similar notification provision to that in s 24GB. Section 24JB(7) then contains a further \nand separate notification obligation relating to the creation of plans of management for state, territory or national \nparks. This obligation is a good example of the importance of the timing of the imposition of the obligation. Like the \nother notification provisions, this requirement arises before the future act is done. In this example, the future act is \nthe creation of a management plan for (to take one situation) a national park. If there are (to take one situation) \npersons who have been finally determined by this Court to hold native title in land and waters covered by the \nproposed plan of management, then on its face s 24JB(7) imposes an obligation (in a way determined by a \nlegislative instrument \u2013 as to which, see below) \u2013 beforethe creation of a management plan \u2013 to give those native \ntitle holders an opportunity to comment on the plan. The intention of the provision is that the native title holders \nshould be able to have substantive input into the contents of the management plan before those contents are \nfinalised, even if they are not permitted to dictate or insist upon any particular outcomes, priorities, management \nstrategies or initiatives.  The sixth category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are those in Subdiv K \u2013 facilities for services to the \npublic, such as roads, railways, bridges, wharves, street lighting, drainage, pipelines, cables and antennae and \nelectricity transmission lines etc. This Subdivision treats native title claimants and holders in a different way. By s \n24KA(7), it deems them to be in the same position as either certain kinds of lessees or holders of \u201cordinary title\u201d, in \nterms of the consultation which must occur with landholders before such facilities are installed. Subsections (8) and \n(9) deal with how notification can occur if there are no registered native title bodies corporate. This would appear to \ngive native title holders and claimants potentially robust notification and consultation rights, but there is nothing in \nthe text of s 24KA which suggests that, if those parallel procedures are not complied with, there is any effect on the \n\u201cvalidity\u201d of the future act.  The seventh category of acts \u201ccovered\u201d are those in Subdiv L \u2013 \u201clow impact\u201d acts, \ncovering conduct such as tree lopping, clearing of land and environmental assessment activities. There are no \nnotification provisions at all for these kinds of future acts. That would seem to indicate a legislative judgement that \nthe capacity of such acts to affect native title is sufficiently low that native title claimants or holders need not receive \nprior notice that such future acts are to occur. It should be noted that one consequence of the approach taken in \nLardil is, in substance, that future acts undertaken without compliance with applicable notification provisions such \nas those (for example) in s 24HA(7) are placed in the same position as future acts the Parliament has determined \nshould not be subject to notification and comment provisions at all. That is because non-compliance has no \neffective consequence, and the future act can have full force and effect against native title interests in the same way \nas a \u201clow impact\u201d future act.  Subdivision M concerns future acts which pass the freehold test. Principally, the kind \nof future act with which the Subdivision deals is compulsory acquisition. The rationale for creating the freehold test \nin relation to some future acts was set out by the High Court in Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and \nEnvironment [2008] HCA 20; 235 CLR 232 at [43] (Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ):What is apparent from these \nParliamentary materials is a legislative proposal to proceed on the basis provided by the previous s 23, permitting \n\n\n\nfuture compulsory acquisition of native title rights, but also to ensure that where, as it now appeared to be feasible \n[post Wik], native title rights subsisted concurrently with non-native title rights, any power of acquisition was \nexercised in a non-discriminatory fashion by acquiring and extinguishing both species of rights.  Section 24MD(1) \nprovides:Validation of act\n\n (1) If this Subdivision applies to a future act, then, subject to Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate), \nthe act is valid.  It is this provision to which French J referred in Lardil. There can be no doubt on the language of \nthis provision (\u201csubject to\u201d) that where a future act was done which required but did not involve compliance with \nSubdiv P, it would not have full force and effect against native title rights and interests. However, one possible \nconstruction of a provision such as this is to require strict adherence to all of the requirements in Subdiv P as \npreconditions to validity: for example, to make time limits such as that in s 28(1)(a) essential preconditions. In \ndetailed legislative schemes dealing with notification, distinctions are regularly made between substantial and strict \ncompliance with notification provisions: see for example Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIZO [2009] \nHCA 37; 238 CLR 627 at [34]- [35] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ). The language of s 28 itself \nwould support such a distinction, and would support construing Subdiv P as requiring strict compliance for validity. \nIn other words, the terms of s 24MD(1) are construed to require strict adherence to all procedural requirements in \nSubdiv P and the presence of s 24MD(1) does not necessarily tend against a construction of less strictly worded \nprocedural requirements which would see them having an effect on validity, where there is non-compliance. That is \nespecially so when the terms of s 24OA are considered, which I discuss below.  This approach is supported by \nother parts of Subdiv M. Aside from s 24MD(1), other procedural requirements are imposed for future acts to which \nSubdiv P does not apply: see ss 24MD(6), (6A) and (6B). These are the provisions (s 24MD(6B) in particular) which \nare also picked up and applied by earlier Subdiv I. The procedure they set out reaches well beyond notification and \ncomment, to provision for consultation about minimising impact, and then for native title claimants and holders to \nmake objections which are to be heard and determined by an independent body. That determination must be \ncomplied with, unless (to express it in shorthand) it is decided that it is \u201cin the interests of the Commonwealth, the \nState or the Territory not to comply with the determination\u201d. Presumably, provisions of this kind were seen by the \nParliament as strong and detailed accountability mechanisms, even if ultimately their implementation depends on a \nresidual executive discretion.  Section 24MD(6B) (which contains the more detailed procedural prescriptions, in \ncomparison to s 24MD(6A)) is not expressed in language that resembles s 24MD(1). Rather, its language \nresembles the other Subdivisions to which I have referred: that is, it is silent on any link between compliance with its \nterms and the validity of a future act to which it applies. Yet, if the construction favoured by the Court in Lardil is \ncorrect, then the whole objection and determination process set out in s 24MD(6B) could be ignored and a future \nact could still have full force and effect against native title interests, including ones which have been recognised in a \ndetermination by this Court.  Subdivision N concerns future acts done in offshore places. By s 24NA(8), native title \nholders and claimants are placed in the same procedural position as non-native title holders over lands and waters \naffected by acts of the kind dealt with in this Subdivision. So, again, as in some of the procedural provisions I have \nalready considered, if there is, outside the NT Act, an elaborate process of consultation and notice, and if Lardil is \ncorrect, non-compliance with such a process (including deliberate disregard) will not deprive a future act under \nSubdiv N of its full force and effect against native title interests, including ones which have been recognised in a \ndetermination by this Court.  I have dealt with Subdiv P above, and need not repeat what I have said. Subdivision O \nconsists of a single provision, which in my opinion assists in resolving the construction issue. It provides:24OA \nFuture acts invalid unless otherwise providedUnless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid \nto the extent that it affects native title.  The provision contemplates that other parts of Pt 2 Div 3 will \u201cprovide\u201d for a \nfuture act to be valid, which each Subdivision does. And each Subdivision so provides by prescribing procedural \nrequirements, in detail, and of varying levels of stringency; or, by not prescribing any procedural requirements. The \nstarting point of s 24OA \u2013 the legislative choice made \u2013 is the invalidity of future acts in relation to native title. That \nis, the legislative choice made is that future acts will not have full force and effect on, at least (taking into account \nthe definition of native title in s 223) those native title rights and interests which have been recognised by this Court \nin a determination, unless the NT Act \u201cprovides\u201d that they will. The scheme then sets out, in great detail, the manner \nin which each kind of future act may have full force and effect on native title. In my opinion, s 24OA compels \nattendance to the detailed terms on which each kind of future act is to be given force and effect against native title \ninterests. It discloses a legislative intention that compliance with the requirements set out in each Subdivision \n\n\n\n(including procedural requirements) is a precondition to a future act having force and effect against native title \ninterests. That is the \u201cprotection\u201d which is achieved, in combination with the general prohibition contained in s \n24OA.  Accordingly, in my opinion, s 24OA provides sufficient statutory indication of a legislative intention that \ncompliance with procedural requirements is a precondition to a future act having force and effect against native title; \nat least native title in the sense defined in s 223. Whether the same is true in relation to claims for native title which \nnever result in a positive determination is not something I need decide in the present proceeding. It seems to me, \nhowever, the answer to that issue may lie in what the Full Court said in Lardil: namely, if native title claimants are \naware of a future act which has not complied with Div 3, they are able to seek injunctive relief pending the \ndetermination of their claim to native title. If there is no native title, the injunction will be discharged and the future \nact can be undertaken (assuming there has still been no procedural compliance). If native title is recognised, then \nbefore the future act can be undertaken, compliance will need to occur.  In situations such as those presented by \nthe miscellaneous licences, such a process is not possible. Those licences were granted without compliance with \nDiv 3 and have been in use. The only outcome in such circumstances is to give effect to the legislative intention in s \n24OA: namely that on determination of native title those future acts which have not complied at all with the relevant \npart of Div 3 have no force and effect on the native title interests as declared by the Court.  In each of the provisions \nto which I have referred, the notification is required to be made \u201cin the way determined, by legislative instrument\u201d: \nsee, for example, the Native Title (Notices) Determination 2011 (No. 1) (Cth). If the procedural provisions are \nconstrued as not conditioning the validity of the future acts, then that construction extends to the effect of the \nlegislative instruments prescribing the way notification is to be undertaken. In that sense, the legislative instrument \nis also given no real force or effect. As I explain below, falling back on remedies of injunctions (or declarations) \nwould be wholly unsatisfactory.  Also, in each of these provisions the language used is imperative and, subject to \nany contrary intention, is not to be construed as affording the repository of the obligations only a discretion whether \nto comply with the notification procedure set out in the provision: see Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) s 33(2A). \nSee also SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24; 228 CLR 294 \nat[206] (Hayne J). Imperative language is only one factor, but Parliament is taken to understand the difference \nbetween the use of \u201cmay\u201d and the use of \u201cmust\u201d. In the present context, that imperative language is combined with \nthe terms of s 24OA.  All of the provisions have been drafted on the legislative assumption that it is appropriate for \nthose whose native title interests are, or may be, affected by a future act to be given notice in advance of the future \nact occurring and to have an opportunity to comment on the future act. The purposes of extending such an \nopportunity manifestly include an opportunity to express a view whether the future act should occur at all, the \nmanner in which it should occur, whether there should be any further consultation prior to it occurring, and what the \nconsequences of the future act might be for native title in the area. Most of these purposes will be rendered \nnugatory if there is no notice and opportunity to comment until after the future act has occurred. It is true that, \nbecause the notification provisions cover registered native title claimants as well as native title holders, the \nobligations may need to be performed in circumstances where, ultimately, no native title will be found to exist. That \nis the scheme. That feature of the scheme is in my opinion an insufficient reason to downgrade the protection given \nto those found to be native title holders so that their native title interests can be affected by future acts without any \neffective or meaningful notice or consultation.  The giving of notice prior to conduct or decisions affecting (generally \nadversely) a person\u2019s interests (especially proprietary interests) is a cornerstone of the content of procedural \nfairness. It has been described as a \u201ccardinal principle\u201d (R v Small Claims Tribunal and Homeward; Ex Parte \nCameron [1976] VicRp 41; [1976] VR 427 at 432) and, in the United Kingdom, of \u201cconstitutional importance\u201d (Re \nHamilton[1981] AC 1038 at 1047). Similarly, in Ruatita v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2013] FCA 542; \n212 FCR 364, Flick J said (at [55]) that: \u201c[n]otice, put more simply, is not a mere formal requirement; it is a matter of \nsubstance going to the very heart of procedural fairness.\u201d  Notice is intended to have the substantive effect of \ninforming a person how her or his interests may be affected, and of giving her or him the opportunity to be heard \nabout why they should not be so affected, or why they should be differently affected. The concern is with fair \ndecision-making processes that pay sufficient regard to interests affected: see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex \nParte Aala [2000] HCA 57; 204 CLR 82 at [59] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ). That is particularly so in a legislative \nscheme which expressly seeks to \u201cprotect\u201d native title interests, and does so in large measure not by making those \ninterests immune from the effects of future acts, but rather by requiring those who seek to undertake future acts to \nconsult and take account of what those with native title say will be the impact of future acts on their proprietary \ninterests.  In SAAP at [208], Hayne J reached the following conclusion in relation to procedural steps in the \nMigration Act 1958 (Cth):Where the Act prescribes steps that the Tribunal must take in conducting its review and \n\n\n\nthose steps are directed to informing the applicant for review (among other things) of the relevance to the review of \nthe information that is conveyed, both the language of the Act and its scope and objects point inexorably to the \nconclusion that want of compliance with s 424A renders the decision invalid. Whether those steps would be judged \nto be necessary or even desirable in the circumstances of a particular case, to give procedural fairness to that \napplicant, is not to the point. The Act prescribes what is to be done in every case.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  While conclusions reached on other statutory schemes cannot be imported into the NT Act, \nmy purpose in referring to Hayne J\u2019s conclusion is to demonstrate how the combination of imperative language, \ndetailed prescriptions of steps to be undertaken, and the nature of interests affected can lead to emphatic \nconclusions about the validity of a decision (or conduct) undertaken without compliance with the statute.  Notice is \nalso imperative to access the remedies that both French and Merkel JJ recognised as available in Lardil. Injunctive \nrelief will only be effective if there is notice of a future act and proceedings can be taken to prevent the future act \noccurring. Most kinds of future acts do not involve ongoing conduct. Rather, they involve \u201conce off\u201d conduct \u2013 the \ngrant of leases, licences, permissions, the making of decisions to undertake certain works. Once the future acts \nhave occurred, injunctive relief to enforce a right to be given notice and to comment is hardly likely to be effective in \nthe majority of future acts covered by Pt 2 Div 3. It does not \u201cprotect\u201d native title; rather it facilitates its defeat.  For \nthose reasons, although the matter is not free from difficulty, the better construction in my opinion is that non-\ncompliance with express procedural requirements of a given Subdivision in Div 3 of Pt 2 has the result that the \nfuture act has no force and effect against native title interests as determined by this Court.  I accept that this \napproach differs from that taken by Barker J in Banjima (No 2) [2013] FCA 868; 305 ALR 1 at[986]- [990] and from \nRD Nicholson J in Daniel. In Banjima (No 2), Barker J said (at [986]-[990]):Failure to comply with s 24MD(6B) issue: \nThe respondents place particular emphasis on the fact that in Lardil Peoples v Queensland (2001) 108 FCR 453; \n185 ALR 513; [2001] FCA 414 (Lardil FC) the Full Court found that a failure to satisfy the right to negotiate did not \nresult in the invalidity of the act in question. The claimants, however, seek to distinguish Lardil FC in that regard \nsaying that it does not apply in circumstances such as the present.\n\n I accept the submissions of the respondents that in Lardil FC at [58], French J appears to have accepted that the \nsubdivisions which provide for prior notification to registered native title claims and others do not appear to \ncondition the validity of the future acts to which they apply upon compliance of that requirement. Dowsett J (at \n[117]) is to similar effect. Additionally, in Daniel 2004 Nicholson J (at [63]) proceeded on a similar understanding.\n\n As French J noted in his judgment, s 24ID(3) imposes a particular notification requirement in respect of a future act \nto which subs (1)(b) applied; although that is not relevant here. By subs (3) it would appear there is a mandatory \nnotification procedure. There is no similar mandatory notification procedure provided in respect of other acts to \nwhich Subdiv I applies.\n\n Thus, as French J found, Subdiv C to M inclusive of Div 3 do not impose procedural requirements that condition \nvalidity (save, one may suggest, for a provision such as s 24ID(3)). His Honour considered Subdiv P to be of a \ndifferent character because certain provisions state that non-compliance will result in invalidity: see s 25(4) and s \n28(1). Dowsett J found to similar effect (at [117]). As the Full Court recognised, Subdiv M, for example, could have \ncontained such provisions but does not. Nor does Subdiv I.\n\n In these circumstances, I accept that authority supports the view that failure to comply with s 24MD(6B)(f) cannot \ninvalidate the grant of tenure in this case, as contended by the claimants.  With the greatest respect to both Barker \nJ and RD Nicholson J, I must reach a different conclusion on construction. For the reasons I have set out, in my \nopinion there are consequences for the capacity to affect native title of a future act which does not comply with the \nprocedural requirements set out in one of the Subdivisions of Pt 2 Div 3. It appears to me both judges proceeded on \nthe basis of the obiter observations in Lardil, taking this as authority. I have taken a different course, and have \nreached a different conclusion.  If, contrary to my principal opinion (that non-compliance with the procedural \n\n\n\nprovisions deprives a future act of validity in the sense of full force and effect against native title interests when \nthose interests are determined by this Court), what remains available is some kind of declaratory or injunctive relief, \nI do not accept such relief provides any kind of workable solution in these circumstances. The exercise and \nenjoyment of the native title rights I have found should be recognised, including over the land and waters covered \nby the current pastoral leases, cannot be regulated in an ongoing way by any declaratory or injunctive relief issued \nby the Court. There will be a myriad of different factual and practical situations in which an exercise of those rights \n(at its most basic level, for example, to enter onto the land at the Tjiwarl site for purposes connected with looking \nafter the site) will come up against the assertion of rights under a pastoral lease and I do not consider the \nappropriate way to address that is to have some ongoing general moderation through declaratory or injunctive \nrelief. Non-compliance with other forms of order is contempt of court and individuals should not be exposed to that \nrisk in circumstances lacking clarity and particularity. For those reasons, had I reached a view that it was \nappropriate to apply the obiter statements in Lardil, I would not as a matter of discretion have made any orders of \nthe kind sought by the applicant.  If the ultimate outcome of the conclusions I have reached is that there must be a \ncompulsory acquisition of the native title interests through a right to negotiate process or ILUA then, as the applicant \nsubmits, that is not inconsistent with the protective purposes of the NT Act in respect of native title.\n\nPastoral leases renewed on 1 July 2015    In issue are the 11 pastoral leases which are either wholly or partially \nwithin the claim area.

The current pastoral leases for these properties all commenced on 1 July 2015. Each of the \nproperties had previously been the subject of a pastoral lease. The same persons (natural or corporate) who were \nparties to the previous leases as they stood on 30 June 2015 are parties to the renewed leases. The term of the \ncurrent leases is the same as the term of the previous leases (save for one day). Those terms vary between 26 \nyears, 8 months and 10 days (for Yuono Downs) and 49 years and 24 days (Depot Springs). All except two (Yuono \nDowns and Lake Way) are for more than 40 years.  The NT Act contains a definition of pastoral lease in s 248:A \npastoral lease is a lease that:\n\n (a) permits the lessee to use the land or waters covered by the lease solely or primarily for:(i) maintaining or \nbreeding sheep, cattle or other animals; or\n\n (ii) any other pastoral purpose; or(b) contains a statement to the effect that it is solely or primarily a pastoral lease \nor that it is granted solely or primarily for pastoral purposes.  There is no dispute between the parties (subject to the \n\n\n\napplicant\u2019s submissions about s 24IC(1)(c)(iv)) that both the previous and the current leases fall within that \ndefinition.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s contentions in summary  The applicant puts forward two alternative bases on which the pastoral \nleases are invalid in terms of their effect on native title. They are:(a) s.24IC(1)(c)(iv) NTA is not satisfied; or \nalternatively\n\n (b) the State failed to renew or re-grant the pastoral leases in accordance with s.24ID(4), which is enlivened by \ns.24IC(4)(b).  The applicant submits the grant of the pastoral leases was clearly a future act within the meaning of \nthat phrase in s 233 of the NT Act, in the sense that the grant of each lease \u201caffects\u201d the native title of the claim \ngroup. They referred to evidence given by the claim group members in their submissions:Brett Lewis explained that \nhe feels a determination of native title will assist in dealing with a station owner in the Claimed Area, as this \nrelationship \u201ccauses a bit of problems ...\u201d Allan Ashwin, a pastoralist himself, gave evidence about the need to seek \npermission from station owners to shoot on their property. Edwin Beaman similarly described having to deal with a \npastoralist seeking to restrain the exercise of his right to hunt ... Kado Muir gave evidence as to having to assert his \nright to camp at Logan Springs against station owners in the 1990s ...\n\n Other witnesses attested to the impact that pastoral activities have upon their country. Douglas Bingham gave \nevidence about the damage done by cattle, including to rockholes ... Luxie Hogarth gave evidence as to pastoral \ninfrastructure being installed at a sacred site in the Claimed Area ... Kado Muir gave evidence about the efforts \nmade by Claimants to manage impacts from pastoral activities on the site of Pii and the surrounding country ...\n\n (References omitted.)  On their assumption that the grant of the current pastoral leases was within the definition of \nfuture act, the applicant contends the grant of the current pastoral leases was within the terms of s 24IC(1) of the \nNT Act. That section provides:(1) A future act is a permissible lease etc. renewal if:(a) it is:(i) the renewal; or\n\n (ii) the re-grant or re-making; or\n\n (iii) the extension of the term;\n\n of a lease, licence, permit or authority (the original lease etc.) that is valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); \nand(b) any of the following subparagraphs applies:(i) the original lease etc. was granted on or before 23 December \n1996;\n\n (ii) the grant of the original lease etc. was a permissible lease etc. renewal or a pre-existing right-based act;\n\n (iii) the original lease etc. was created by an act covered by section 24GB, 24GD, 24GE or 24HA (which deal with \ncertain acts in relation to primary production activities or involving management or regulation of water and \nairspace); and(c) the future act does not:(i) confer a right of exclusive possession over any of the land or waters \ncovered by the original lease etc.; or\n\n (ii) otherwise create a larger proprietary interest in the land or waters than was created by the original lease etc.; or\n\n (iii) create a proprietary interest over any of the land or waters covered by the original lease etc., where the original \nlease etc. created only a non-proprietary interest; or\n\n (iv) if the original lease etc. was a non-exclusive pastoral lease covering an area greater than 5,000 hectares and \nthe majority of the area covered was not required or permitted to be used for purposes other than pastoral \n\n\n\npurposes\u2013have the effect that the majority of the area covered by the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended \nlease is required or permitted to be used for purposes other than pastoral purposes; and(d) if the original lease etc. \ncontains, or is subject to, a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders\u2013\nthe renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease, licence, permit or authority contains, or is subject to, the same \nreservation or condition; and\n\n (e) if the original lease etc. did not permit mining\u2014the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease, licence, \npermit or authority does not permit mining.  In substance, the applicant accepts that the grant of these pastoral \nleases was within paras (1)(a) and (b) but was not within subpara (1)(c)(iv), although the remainder of para (c) was \nnot put in issue by the applicant. It can be seen that the prohibition in para (c) applies to each of subparas (i)-(iv) \u2013 \nthat is, the future act must not have any of the effects in those subpararaphs. As to subpara (1)(c)(iv), the \napplicant\u2019s contention is that the terms and conditions on which the grant of the current pastoral leases was made \nrequired or permitted the majority of the area to be used for purposes other than pastoral purposes.  This contention \nin turn rests on the construction of a provision in each of the current leases, to the following effect (this form is, on \nthe evidence, common to all the impugned pastoral leases \u2013 see exhibit PTG7 to exhibit R10):... on the terms and \nconditions set out in pastoral lease number [being the historical pastoral lease], also registered as Crown lease \nnumber [as relevant] under the Transfer of Land Act 1893, INCLUDING the reservations referred to in the Pastoral \nLease, BUT ONLY to the extent that any of those terms or conditions, or reservations are not inconsistent with the \nLA Act [being the Land Administration Act 1997 (WA)].\n\n (Emphasis added.)  The applicant\u2019s argument focusses on the operation of the Land Administration Act 1997 (WA) \n(LAA). They say the LAA permits the use of the majority of land on a pastoral lease for non-pastoral purposes, and \nthat this permission \u201cexpands and departs from\u201d the previous leases, which require that the majority of land on a \npastoral lease be used for pastoral purposes. Thus, contrary to s 24IC(1)(c)(iv), the current pastoral leases, through \nthe importation of the LAA into them (on the applicant\u2019s argument) do \u201crequire or permit\u201d \u2013 and permission is what \nthe applicant focuses on \u2013 a majority of the land under the lease to be used for non-pastoral purposes.  The \napplicant submitted that the consequence of the current pastoral leases falling outside the terms of s 24IC(1)(c)(iv) \nis that they are deprived of the validating effect of s 24ID(1).  The applicant\u2019s second and alternative argument is \nthat even if the current pastoral leases are future acts not prohibited by s 24IC(1)(c), the applicant submits the \ncurrent pastoral leases were renewed (or re-granted) for a \u201cterm\u201d longer than that for which the previous pastoral \nleases were granted. The change in the \u201cterm\u201d of the pastoral lease enlivens, so the applicant submits, the \nprocedural rights in s 24MD(6B), which were not complied with.\n\nThe State\u2019s response in summary  The State accepts that the historic grant of pastoral leases did not extinguish \nnative title over the land and waters within each lease, and that non-exclusive native title rights and interests could \ncontinue to exist in that land and those waters.  The State contends that the grant of the current pastoral leases \ncannot be a future act \u201caffecting\u201d native title because their grant is not wholly or partially inconsistent with the \ncontinued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the claim group members\u2019 native title rights. Without such \ninconsistency, the State reasons, the grant of the current pastoral leases cannot be said to \u201caffect\u201d native title.  If \nthis submission is not accepted, the State contends that the grant of the leases does not fall foul of s 24IC(1)(c)(iv), \nbecause if the previous pastoral leases are accepted (as appears to be the case) to have been \u201cpastoral leases\u201d \nwithin the meaning of that phrase in s 248, and the current leases were made on the same terms, the current \nleases must also be pastoral leases \u2013 the definition of which itself requires that the land or waters be used \u201csolely or \nprimarily\u201d for pastoral purposes. The State also submits the LAA does not have the effect for which the applicant \ncontends. Even if it did, the LAA would have had the same effect on the previous pastoral leases because the LAA \ncame into effect in 1997 and by its transitional provisions continued the previous pastoral leases in force, as if \ngranted under the LAA. This would mean, the State submits, there was no change of the kind which s 24IC(1)(c)(iv) \nis designed to address. Finally, the State contests the manner in which the applicant submits the LAA is picked up \nand introduced into the current pastoral leases.  As to s 24IC(4)(b), the State submits the applicant\u2019s construction of \nthe word \u201cterm\u201d in this paragraph is incorrect because this provision is not concerned with the date on which a \nlease came into effect, but the length of the period of the lease.\n\n\n\nThe responses of any other parties, where different to the State  Cameco submits that the grant of pastoral lease \n3114/620 (Yeelirrie Station Pastoral Lease) is a previous non-exclusive possession act that is attributable to the \nState and the effect on native title of the grant is set out in s 12M of the Titles (Validation) and Native Title (Effect of \nPast Acts) Act 1995 (WA). It submits that the principles about the extinguishing effect of pastoral leases on native \ntitle that are set out at [123]-[131] of Ward (HC) apply. It submits that the grant of pastoral lease 3114/620 had the \neffect of extinguishing any exclusive native title rights to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the subject land, including \nany right to control access. Finally, it submits that, to the extent pastoral lease 3114/620 has been the subject of \nrenewals in accordance with the terms of the Land Act 1933, those renewals are valid, and where relevant, are \npermissible lease renewals for the purposes of s 24IC of the NT Act.  BHP Billiton makes the same submissions as \nCameco, outlined in the paragraph directly above, in respect of the following pastoral leases:(f) 3114/899 (Leinster \nDowns Pastoral Lease)\n\n (g) 3114/549 (Mount Keith Pastoral Lease)\n\n (h) 3114/649 (Yakabindie Pastoral Lease)\n\n (i) 3114/737 (Albion Downs Pastoral Lease)  In other words, none of these submissions from the lessees grappled \nwith the detail of the applicant\u2019s arguments.\n\nMy conclusions\n\nFuture acts  The grant of the pastoral leases on 1 July 2015 were future acts within the meaning of s 233 of the NT \nAct. I am satisfied on the evidence the grants of those leases \u201caffected\u201d the native title of the claim group members. \nThe State submits that evidence such as that to which I have referred above is not evidence about the effects of \nthe grant of the current leases on 1 July 2015; rather it is evidence which relates to the previous leases as well. \nThat may be so, in the sense that the previous leases \u201caffected\u201d native title just as the current ones do. The legal \ndifference is that the previous leases were not future acts and therefore there was no legal consequence imposed \nby the NT Act for such an effect. That did not mean the effect was not real. However, without the re-grant or \nrenewal of the pastoral leases, those effects would have ceased on 30 June 2015. The re-grant or renewal meant \nthe effects continued. That is sufficient in my opinion for the re-grant or renewal of the pastoral leases to meet the \ndefinition of future act.  I accept the evidence to which the applicant refers, and I find that it does demonstrate, if \nactual proof were needed (which in my opinion it is not under Pt 2 Div 3) that the exercise and enjoyment of the \nclaim group members\u2019 native title rights is impaired (through difficulties with access) and diminished (through having \nto ask permission and perhaps be refused) by reason of the exercise of rights by lessees under the pastoral leases. \nI accept also that this evidence proves how activities consequential upon the grant of pastoral leases (such as cattle \ngrazing) can have an adverse physical impact on the claim group members\u2019 country and therefore on their \nobligations to care for and protect it. These are, in any events, the kind of consequences which might be expected \nto follow from the grant of a pastoral lease over land and waters in which native title subsists: they are the kinds of \nconsequences which would ordinarily be comprehended by the concept of an act \u201caffecting\u201d native title, in the sense \nI have discussed it at [1001] above.  In my opinion the State\u2019s submissions conflate the concept of inconsistency for \nthe purposes of extinguishment with the concept of acts \u201caffecting\u201d native title, when the two perform very different \nfunctions. The State carries forward into its contentions about future acts the concept of \u201cinconsistency\u201d, when the \nstatutory concept of acts affecting native title is much broader than that. Contrary to the State\u2019s submissions, that \nstatutory concept does not require that an act be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the exercise or enjoyment of native title rights. \nIt simply requires that it \u201caffect\u201d the exercise or enjoyment of those rights, and carries with it the notion that the \n\u201ceffect\u201d is unlikely to be a beneficial one (although beneficial effects are not expressly excluded and this issue can \nbe left for another day). The concept of \u201caffecting\u201d connotes an impact, perhaps an impairment, but it is much \nbroader than inconsistency. Where a witness such as Mr Allan Ashwin relates the need to negotiate with the holder \nof a pastoral lease to secure permission to go hunting on his country, and the source of the need is the authority \nconferred by the pastoral lease to exclude persons from the land, this is in my opinion a typical example of how the \ngrant of a lease has an impact on the native title right to take food resources from country. The native title holder \nmust seek the permission of a person who is a stranger to his country (from his perspective) and runs the risk of \n\n\n\nhaving permission refused; or having terms and conditions imposed on his access to his country to exercise his \nnative title right.\n\nSection 24IC(1)(c)  The parties appear to agree that the act of granting the current pastoral leases on 1 July 2015 \nwas within the terms of s 24IC(1)(a) as either a \u201crenewal\u201d (subpara (i)) or a \u201cre-grant or re-making\u201d (subpara (ii)). \nBoth parties rely on various observations in Trade Practices Commission (Cth) v Tooth & Co Limited [1979] HCA \n47; 142 CLR 397 about the difficulties of drawing any real distinction between a renewal and a re-grant.  In Tooth, \nGibbs J said (at 406-407):The distinction drawn between the grant and the renewal of a lease suggests that \u201cgrant\u201d \nis intended to refer to a case in which no lease is in existence and \u201crenew\u201d to the case in which there is an existing \nlease which the lessee seeks to have extended for a further period. Technically, the word \u201cgrant\u201d would have \ncovered both cases, since a renewal will involve a new grant ... Although, as I have indicated, if there has been a \nrefusal to grant a lease, there is in truth no party to the lease, what in my opinion is meant is a person who would \nhave been a party to the lease had it been granted. But even if this construction were wrong, I could not accept the \nview that the expression \u201cgrant or renew\u201d was intended to distinguish between the re-grant of an existing lease on \nnew terms and the re-grant of an existing lease on the same terms as before.\n\n The word \u201crenew\u201d can of course signify the grant of a new lease for the same period and on the same terms as \nthose of the old lease. However, that is not its invariable, or even its natural meaning; a lease can be renewed, in \nthe ordinary sense of the word, for a different period, and at a different rent, from those provided in the original \nlease.  Despite the difficulties in language to which Gibbs J refers, in the context of the NT Act, I see no particular \nconstruction issues as between the use of the term \u201crenewal\u201d and the use of the terms \u201cre-grant and re-making\u201d. I \nconsider it is likely that the term \u201crenewal\u201d is used in the sense described by Gibbs J: that is, the grant of a new \nlease for the same period and on the same terms. I consider it is likely that s 24IC uses the terms \u201cre-grant\u201d and \u201cre-\nmaking\u201d to signify the grant of a new lease to replace an expired lease, on different terms yet still with sufficient \nconnection to the expired lease that it can be said the lease is being granted again. To \u201cremake\u201d a lease may be \nsomething quite different, and may well be used in relation to leases whose terms have not expired but where a \nnew contractual arrangement, still with sufficient connection to the old lease, needs to be made.  Turning to s \n24IC(1)(c) itself, it is apparent that the purpose of the subsection is to ensure that the validating effects of the future \nact provisions concerning permissible leases are not conferred on leases renewed or re-granted where there are \nfundamental changes to the nature of the proprietary interests given by the new lease, or to the activities permitted \nby the lease. The provision recognises that the use of land principally for mining purposes is a substantial change \nfrom the use of land principally for pastoral purposes, and is capable of quite differently affecting native title rights \nand interests. That is why it is important that the applicant is able to demonstrate, for their s 24IC(1)(c)(iv) \nargument, that there has been a material change between the terms and conditions of the previous pastoral leases \nand the terms and conditions of the current pastoral leases.  The identified change \u2013 said to be that, by reason of \nthe provision in the current pastoral leases, the LAA will permit use of a majority of the land and waters for non-\npastoral purposes \u2013 is not in my opinion apparent from the terms of the current pastoral leases. To explain why that \nis so it is necessary to examine one of the 11 pastoral leases in more detail.  What was identified as being the \ncurrent pastoral leases were exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Paul Terrence Godden affirmed 20 October 2015. Prior \nto this, the State\u2019s tenure evidence did not include the current pastoral leases \u2013 unsurprisingly, since they were not \ngranted until 1 July 2015, only a few weeks before the on country connection hearing in this proceeding. I take the \ncurrent pastoral lease for Yakabindie station (N049476) as an example. The land is described as Lot 57 on \nDeposited Plan 220403 and Lot 568 on Deposited Plan 73751, subject to any exclusion or inclusions shown on \u201cthe \nSecond Schedule\u201d which I assume to be a schedule to the deposited plans, but which is not reproduced in the \nevidence. The parties are the State of Western Australia as lessor and BHP Billiton Yakabindie Nickel Pty Ltd as \nlessee. Several encumbrances and easements are noted on the lease which need not be referred to in detail. The \nterm of the lease is expressed to be 48 years, 1 month and 23 days, commencing on 1 July 2015. The annual rental \nis expressed to be $2,169.00 plus GST payable in advance, with various payment dates listed.  The grant is \nexpressed in the following language:Pursuant to section 143 of the LA Act, the MINISTER FOR LANDS, for and on \nbehalf of the STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, HEREBY GRANTS to the Lessee above (at Note 3), a lease of \nthe land described above (at Note 1), for the term specified above (at Note 4) and at the Rent specified above (at \nNote 5):\n\n\n\n (a) subject to the provisions of the LA Act, as amended from time to time; and\n\n (b) subject to the laws of the State of Western Australia as may apply from time to time BUT ONLY to the extent \nany such laws are not inconsistent with the LA Act; and\n\n (c) on the terms and conditions set out in the pastoral lease number LA3114/649 (\u201cPastoral Lease\u201d), also \nregistered as Crown lease number CL315/1967 under the Transfer of Land Act 1893, INCLUDING the reservations \nreferred to in the Pastoral Lease, BUT ONLY to the extent that any of those terms or conditions, or reservations are \nnot inconsistent with the LA Act.  The lease was executed on behalf of the State by the Minister for Lands, and \nexecuted by Cameco Australia Pty Ltd as lessee. The date of execution is expressed as 27 November 2014. On \none view, this would be the date of the future act (because that is when the grant is made, although it does not take \neffect until 1 July 2015), although the applicant made no submissions that this would have any invalidating effect. \nThe disconformity between the lessee as stated in the lease document and the lessee executing the lease is not \nexplained on the evidence.  Pastoral Lease LA3114/649 is in evidence. It is expressed to be made pursuant to the \nLand Act 1933 and for pastoral purposes.  The grant from the Yakabindie lease which I have just extracted \noperates on the terms and conditions imposed by Pastoral Lease LA3114/649. It is those terms and conditions (and \nreservations under the pastoral lease) which must not be inconsistent with anything contained in the LAA. The use \nof the words \u201cbut only\u201d signifies that, to the extent the terms and conditions contained in Pastoral Lease \nLA3114/649 are inconsistent with any provision of the LAA, they will have no force and effect as between the \nparties.  It is not correct to say, as the applicant\u2019s submissions do, that the effect of this is that the provisions of the \nLAA \u201chave primacy and can override any of the terms and conditions in the lease instrument\u201d. That is not the effect \nof the grant. The effect of the grant is to nullify any existing terms and conditions in Pastoral Lease LA3114/649 that \nare inconsistent with a provision in the LAA. The applicant does not point to any such provision in the LAA, and \nsimilarly does not link any provision of the LAA with a term or condition in Pastoral Lease LA3114/649 which they \nsubmit is affected by the LAA provision. Not only does the applicant not undertake this exercise at all, but of course \nit would need to be undertaken in relation to the term or condition in Pastoral Lease LA3114/649 (assuming there is \nsuch a term) which required the land and waters within the lease to be used predominantly or principally for pastoral \npurposes.  Rather, what the applicant points to are those provisions in the LAA (ss 118, 119, 120, 121 and 122) that \nthe applicant submits allow for non-pastoral activities on pastoral leases. I do not accept that is an accurate \ncharacterisation of all these provisions. For example, s 121 (tourism) refers to \u201cpastoral-based tourist activities\u201d. \nHowever, s 120 does provide an example of the applicant\u2019s argument. It provides:(1) The Board may, on an \napplication in writing from a pastoral lessee, issue a permit for the lessee to use specified land under the lease for \ncrop, fodder, horticultural or other specified kind of agricultural production if it is satisfied that the proposed use is \nreasonably related to the pastoral use of the land.\n\n (2) An application must specify the non-pastoral activity proposed and the areas of land proposed to be used for \nthe activity.\n\n (3) A permit under this section \u2013(a) may include a permit for the sale of any produce arising from an activity \npermitted; and\n\n (b) may be issued for any period and subject to any conditions the Board thinks fit.  It can be seen that s 120 \nrequires a written application and a permit, issued at the discretion of the Board. It is correct that on its face s 120 \nmay authorise a permit for the activities which it sets out that covers a majority of the land of the pastoral lease and \nso arguably then permits a majority of the land or waters to be used for a non-pastoral purpose.  A permit is \nnecessary for such activities because there is otherwise a prohibition in s 106 of the LAA from land on pastoral \nleases being used for non-pastoral purposes. Section 106 provides:(1) A pastoral lessee must not use land under \n\n\n\nthe pastoral lease for purposes other than pastoral purposes except in accordance with a permit issued under \nDivision 5.\n\n Penalty: $10,000.\n\n (2) A pastoral lessee must not sell any product of a non-pastoral use of the land except in accordance with a \npermit issued under section 119, 120, 122 or 122A.\n\n Penalty: $10,000.\n\n (3) An offence is not committed under subsection (1) by a pastoral lessee in respect of purposes referred to in \nparagraph (b) or (c) of the definition of pastoral purposes referred to in section 93 (an ancilliary purpose) if \u2013(a) a \npermit would otherwise be required in respect of that ancilliary purpose; and\n\n (b) a permit has been issued under Division 5; and\n\n (c) the pastoral lessee has acted in accordance with that permit.  One indication given by s 106 is that the clear \nintention of the LAA is to maintain the requirement for pastoral leases to be used for predominantly pastoral \npurposes. There is, by operation of the LAA on the current pastoral leases, no automatic displacement of the \nrequirement to use the land for pastoral purposes. Nor is any permission given by operation of the LAA itself. The \npermission comes through a discretionary permit regime, if at all. Although the applicant did not advance this \nargument, it might otherwise have been the case that the grant of the current pastoral leases \u201csubject to the \nprovisions of the LA Act\u201d could have had the effect which s 24IC(1)(c)(iv) of the NT Act prohibits if, by operation of \nthe LAA itself, some statutory permission was granted to use the majority of land under a pastoral lease for non-\npastoral purposes. However, that is not the case, given the presence of s 106, read with the permit provisions such \nas s 120.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that the future act in such a case (if the definition of future act \nwere met) would be the grant of the permit under the LAA, just as it would have been if the pastoral lessee had \nsought to undertake such an activity in 2014, under the terms of the previous pastoral lease (which was, because of \ns 143 of the LAA, also governed by the LAA). That is not to say the grant of such a permit fits obviously into any of \nthe Subdivisions in Div 3 of Pt 2. If it does not, it may be affected by s 24OA of the NT Act. That is not a matter \nwhich I need to decide in this proceeding, as there is no evidence any such permits under s 120 of the LAA have \nbeen issued in respect of pastoral leases within the claim area.\n\nSection 24IC(4)(b) and the \u201cterm\u201d of the lease  This alternative argument arises if, as I have found, there was no \nprohibition in s 24IC(1)(c) to the renewal of the leases falling within the validation provision.  The applicant submits \nthat the renewal of the pastoral leases was an act \u201ccovered by\u201d s 24IC(4)(b) for the purposes of the protective \nprovisions in s 24ID(4), which in turn led to the need for the State to follow the consultation procedures set out in s \n24MD(6B). It is common ground those procedures were not followed. The State submits it was not obliged to do so \nand, even if it was, Lardil is authority for the proposition that non-compliance with those procedures does not \ndeprive the grant of the current pastoral leases of their full force and effect against native title.  Despite accepting, \nas the State submits, that each of the current pastoral leases was granted for the same length of time as the \nprevious pastoral leases (or in some cases, minus one day) the applicant\u2019s argument turns on giving a different \nmeaning to the word \u201cterm\u201d in s 24IC(4)(b) to the one which might ordinarily be applied to the word in the context of \nleases: namely, the period of the lease between grant and expiry.  The purposive matters raised by the applicant \nhave some force. First, that it would be incompatible with the protective purposes of the NT Act for the procedural \nrights expressly conferred by the Act to be avoided by repeated renewals in the manner suggested by the State, \nespecially where s 24IC(4)(c) makes it clear that the grant of a perpetual lease triggers the procedural provisions in \ns 24MD(6B). The applicant is correct that, for all practical purposes, the State\u2019s approach and the manner in which \nthese pastoral leases were renewed, is capable of creating leases which are in substance perpetual, especially \ngiven the very long periods for which most of them are in effect \u2013 in excess of 40 years. The period of the previous \n\n\n\nleases and the periods of the current leases will operate over more than the average lifetime of any individual native \ntitle holder in the claim area, and these leases cover almost all of the claim area.  Second, the applicant is correct \nthat their construction is more consistent with the general structure and operation of the future act provisions in Pt 2 \nDiv 3, in the sense that acts which have a greater impact on native title generally attract a greater level of protection \nthrough procedural rights. The impact of the renewal of the pastoral leases for such long periods of time and \ncovering as they do the majority of the claim area will have a significant impact on the continued enjoyment and \nexercise of native title rights and interests by the claim group members. Although there is no evidence concerning \nwhy most of the renewed leases were granted on terms that were one day less than the previous lease, it is a \nclearly available inference that avoidance of triggering of the procedural rights in s 24MD(6B) may well have been a \nfactor, especially given these renewals were occurring while this proceeding was in its most active stage.  The \ndifficulty for the applicant is that their construction contorts the language of s 24IC(4)(b) too much. To read the \nphrase \u201cthe term of the old authority\u201d as meaning the date on which the old authority comes to an end will result in \nany renewal (putting to one side the applicant\u2019s somewhat creative arguments about re-grant or re-making) of a \nlease, licence or permit being caught by the procedural protections in s 24MD(6B) through s 24ID(4)(b).  Whereas \nthe structure of s 24IC suggests that subss (3) and (4) are dealing with specific subsets of circumstances in which \nleases are renewed, the applicant\u2019s argument gives them an operation not on a subset of renewals, but on all \nrenewals.  The applicant\u2019s argument also requires different meanings to be given to the word \u201cterms\u201d within the \nsame provision. The starting point in statutory construction, especially within a single provision, is that Parliament \nintends the same words to be given the same meaning: see Craig, Williamson Pty Ltd v Barrowcliff [1915] \nVicLawRp 66; [1915] VLR 450 at 452; Registrar of Titles (WA) v Franzon [1975] HCA 41; 132 CLR 611 at 618; \nMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZAYW [2005] FCAFC 154;145 FCR 523 at [14], \n[16]; Parmar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2011] FCA 760; 195 FCR 186 at[18]. In s 24IC(1)(a), one of \nthe categories of future acts which is expressly covered by s 24IC is \u201cthe extension of the term\u201d of a lease, licence, \npermit or authority: see subpara (iii). In this provision, it is plain that the \u201cterm\u201d which is being extended is the period \n(in days, months, years) over which the lease or licence has been granted: that is, from the commencement date to \nthe expiry date. To give it the kind of meaning for which the applicant contends would render subpara (iii) \nunworkable, or without real effect.  Despite the force of the purposive arguments made by the applicant, the text \nand context of s 24IC(4)(b) does not accommodate the meaning they seek to attribute to the word \u201cterm\u201d. The High \nCourt has cautioned against giving too much weight to the general purpose of legislation in the construction of \nparticular provisions within a scheme. In Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue[2009] \nHCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [51], Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said:Fixing upon the general legislative \npurpose of raising revenue carried with it the danger that the text did not receive the attention it deserves. This \ndanger was adverted to by Gleeson CJ in Carr v Western Australia when he said:\u201c[I]t may be said that the \nunderlying purpose of an Income Tax Assessment Act is to raise revenue for government. No one would seriously \nsuggest that s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act has the result that all federal income tax legislation is to be \nconstrued so as to advance that purpose. Interpretation of income tax legislation commonly raises questions as to \nhow far the legislation goes in pursuit of the purpose of raising revenue. In some cases, there may be found in the \ntext, or in relevant extrinsic materials, an indication of a more specific purpose which helps to answer the question. \nIn other cases, there may be no available indication of a more specific purpose. Ultimately, it is the text, construed \naccording to such principles of interpretation as provide rational assistance in the circumstances of the particular \ncase, that is controlling.\u201d  Accordingly, I do not accept the applicant\u2019s contentions about the need for the renewal of \nthe current pastoral leases to comply with the procedural provisions in s 24MD(6B) of the NT Act.  Both of the \napplicant\u2019s arguments concerning the pastoral leases are rejected. Each of the leases can therefore be given the \nfull force and effect which can be attributed to pastoral leases against the native title I have found to exist.\n\nMiscellaneous licences L53/161 and L53/177    Licence L53/161 is held by Cameco Australia Pty Ltd and is a \nlicence to search for groundwater. The licence commenced on 9 May 2013. It is located around the area of North \nBore, which is near Yeelirrie in the claim area.  Licence L53/177 appears to be held by GWR Group Limited and is a \nlicence to search for groundwater. It commenced on 16 October 2014. It is located in the northern part of the claim \narea, around the area of Tony Bore, which is near Community Bore.  Both licences were granted under s 91 of the \nMining Act 1978 (WA) and the applicant submits they are invalid future acts because they were granted without \ncompliance with the relevant parts of the NT Act. The applicant accepts the grant of the licences complied with s \n24HA of the NT Act (for example, in relation to the notification requirements in s 24HA(7)), but submits that is not \n\n\n\nthe applicable part of Pt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act which needed to be complied with. Rather, they submit the licences \ncreate a \u201cright to mine\u201d, so that the State should have complied with the \u201cright to negotiate\u201d provisions in Subdiv P of \nPt 2 Div 3 of the NT Act.  Section 91 of the Mining Act relevantly provides:(1) Subject to this Act, and in the case of \na miscellaneous licence for water to the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914, or any Act amending or replacing \nthe relevant provisions of that Act, the mining registrar or the warden, in accordance with section 42 (as read with \nsection 92), may, on the application of any person, grant in respect of any land a licence, to be known as a \nmiscellaneous licence, for any one or more of the purposes prescribed.\n\n (2) A person may be granted more than one miscellaneous licence.\n\n (3) A miscellaneous licence shall \u2013(a) be in the prescribed form; and\n\n (b) authorise the holder to do such matters and things as are specified in the licence.[(4), (5) deleted]\n\n (6) A miscellaneous licence shall not be granted unless the purpose for which it is granted is directly connected \nwith mining.  Subsections 24HA(1), (2) and (3) of the NT Act relevantly provide:Legislative acts\n\n (1) This section applies to a future act consisting of the making, amendment or repeal of legislation in relation to \nthe management or regulation of:(a) surface and subterranean water; or\n\n (b) living aquatic resources; or\n\n (c) airspace.\n\n In this subsection, water means water in all its forms and management or regulation of water includes granting \naccess to water, or taking water.Leases, licences etc.\n\n (2) This section also applies to a future act consisting of the grant of a lease, licence, permit or authority under \nlegislation that:(a) is valid (including because of this Act); and\n\n (b) relates to the management or regulation of:(i) surface and subterranean water; or\n\n (ii) living aquatic resources; or\n\n (iii) airspace.\n\n In this paragraph, water means water in all its forms andmanagement or regulation of water includes granting \naccess to water, or taking water.Validity of act\n\n (3) The act is valid.  Given it is agreed these licences were granted \u201cunder\u201d the Mining Act, the question for \ndetermination is whether the Mining Act is, relevantly, legislation that \u201crelates to the management or regulation of ... \nsurface and subterranean water\u201d within s 24HA(2)(b)(i).  There are three subject matters of s 24HA: \u201cairspace\u201d, \n\u201cliving aquatic resources\u201d and \u201csurface and subterranean water\u201d. None of these are defined Div 3 of Pt 2, nor in Pt 2 \ngenerally, nor in s 253. However an extended meaning is given to the phrase \u201cmanagement or regulation\u201d in both \nsubs (1) and subs (2) by including in that phrase granting access to water and taking water. Thus, if the legislation \nunder which a licence is granted \u201crelates to\u201d granting access to water, or \u201crelates to\u201d taking water, it will fall within s \n24HA.  The parties\u2019 submissions, and in particular those of the applicant, spent some time addressing the question \nwhether what these miscellaneous licences do is to create a \u201cright to mine.\u201d With respect, I do not consider that is \n\n\n\nthe correct question. The State and Cameco rely on the terms of s 24HA to render the future acts comprising the \ngrant of these licences valid. The sole question is whether s 24HA applied so as to have that effect.  The words \n\u201crelating to\u201d, when used in a statute and like similar connecting phrases such as \u201cwith respect to\u201d or \u201cin relation to\u201d, \nare generally construed as words of wide import, denoting simply a relationship between one subject matter and \nanother: see Nordland Papier AG v Anti-Dumping Authority [1999] FCA 10; 93 FCR 454 at [25] (Lehane J, dealing \nwith the phrase \u201cin respect of\u201d, but the authorities are clear that generally the phrases are given similar meanings). \nThat said (and unsurprisingly), the authorities emphasise that the nature of the relationship required by the statute \nbetween the two subject matters will always depend on the statutory context: Travelex Ltd v Commissioner of \nTaxation [2010] HCA 33; 241 CLR 510 at [25] (French CJ and Hayne J).  The present statutory context is one in \nwhich the Parliament is setting out, in a series of provisions in Pt 2Div 3, what are the prerequisites for future acts \naffecting native title to be valid. Division 3 introduces a binary classification, as the \u201cOverview\u201d in s 24AA makes \nclear. Section 24AA(2) provides:Validity of future acts\n\n (2) Basically, this Division provides that, to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered \nby certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not.  Some future acts require more for validity than others. In \nHarris v Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority [2000] FCA 603; 98 FCR 60 at [27], the scheme was described in \nthe following way:There is, in our opinion, a discernible legislative intent in these provisions of Div 3, to some of \nwhich we will refer in a little more detail later, that shows that, depending upon who is to do the future act and \ndepending on the impact the act will have on established native title rights or on native title rights that may possibly \nexist in the lands or waters affected by the act, persons with determined or possible native title interests in the land \nare to have carefully graded rights to be notified beforehand and are also to have carefully graded rights to have \nattention given by the decision-maker to their views about the doing of the act. These deliberately structured \ndifferences between the various entitlements to be notified of and to respond to proposals to do future acts are, to \nadopt words used in New Zealand Fishing Industry Association Inc v Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries [1988] 1 \nNZLR 544 at 551, more than mere semantic differences.  In Harris, the Full Court described the right in s 24HA in \nthe following terms (at [38]):The opportunity \u201cto comment\u201d on a proposed act provided for by s 24HA(7)(b) in terms \nsuggests that those with that right have only an entitlement to explain why, in their opinion, the act should not be \ndone at all or only on conditions and to draw to the attention of the decision-maker information which they possess \nand which they consider the decision-maker should know about before doing the act. The right under s 24HA(7)(b) \nis, we think, a right to proffer information and argument to the decision-maker that it can make such use of as it \nconsiders appropriate. The sub-section does not confer any greater right on the native title interests. It is not a right \nto participate in the decision whether to issue the permit or a right that entitles the recipients to seek information \nfrom the decision-maker necessary to satisfy those interests about matters of concern to them. That this is the \nnarrow scope of the right conferred by s 24HA(7)(b) is, we think, confirmed by comparing this right with the rights \nconferred on native title interests by some of the other provisions of Div 3.  The Full Court went on to contrast the \nscope of the right with that contained in Subdiv M, which is the Subdivision the applicant submits is applicable to the \ngrant of these two miscellaneous licences.  Section 24HA applies to both legislative and executive acts and a \nconnecting phrase is used in both subs (1) (\u201cin relation to\u201d) and subs (2) (\u201crelates to\u201d). Each of those connecting \nphrases should be given a consistent construction within the one provision, there being no reasons of text or \ncontext to do otherwise. Section 24HA(1) has a more straightforward application. There must be a relationship or \nconnection between:(1) on the one hand, the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and\n\n (2) on the other hand, the management/regulation of (relevantly) surface or subterranean water, recalling the \nextended meaning of \u201cmanagement\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d.  Taking the statutory words pertinent to the current issue in \nthis proceeding, the textual question arising from the structure of s 24HA(2) is whether the requisite connection \nmust be between the legislation under which the licence is granted and the management/regulation of surface and \nsubterranean water; or between the licence and the management/regulation of surface and subterranean water. If it \nis the former, the applicant\u2019s contentions may gain some support; if it is the latter, the State\u2019s contentions may be \nmore persuasive. That is because, on their face, these are licences to search for groundwater. There is an obvious \nconnection between the licence and surface and subterranean water.  Although the constructional choice is not \nstraightforward, in my opinion the construction which is most consistent with the text and context of s 24HA is that \n\n\n\nthe requisite connection must be between the legislation and the management/regulation of surface or \nsubterranean water. I take that view because this makes the most sense out of s 24HA(2)(a): the \u201cthat\u201d at the end of \nthe covering clause refers to legislation and connects the legislation with the requirements in paras (a) and (b). In \nother words, on the construction I prefer it is the legislation that must be valid, not the licence. In my opinion, this \nconstruction better links subs (1) with subs (2), because subs (1) concerns legislation. This in turn links with the \nbracketed words in subs 24HA(2)(a) \u2013 that is, the words \u201c(including because of this Act)\u201d. In my opinion that is a \nreference to legislation which is valid because of the operation of s 24HA(1).  The difference between subs (1) and \nsubs (2) is therefore that subs (1) is concerned with the legislative act of making, amendment or repeal of legislation \nitself; and subs (2) is concerned with the executive or administrative act of granting a licence under such legislation. \nIn both cases, it is the legislation that must \u201crelate to\u201d (relevantly) surface or subterranean water.  Is the Mining Act \nlegislation which \u201crelates to\u201d surface or subterranean water? That question should be answered in the negative. \nThat answer is supported by the plain text of s 91(6) of the Mining Act. Sections 91(1) and 92 \u2013 the authorising \nprovisions for the grant of a miscellaneous licence \u2013 are not concerned with surface or subterranean water at all. \nThey are concerned with the grant of licences for purposes which are prescribed. That is their subject matter. By s \n91(6) the purpose of the grant of the licence must be \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with mining. This provision reinforces the \nproposition that the subject matter of s 91 and s 92 is prescribed purposes directly connected with mining.  It is true \nthat as the regulations stood at the relevant time (accepting the State\u2019s submissions are accurate on that issue), \none of the prescribed purposes was \u201ca search for groundwater\u201d; and there were other prescribed purposes which \nreferred to water, such as a bore, or \u201ctaking water\u201d. This enabled the authorisation of conduct for purposes directly \nconnected with mining under the Mining Act, but in the same way that any other purposes directly connected with \nmining could also have been authorised, and which would have had nothing to do with the taking of water.  To the \nextent that the construction I have reached differs from that reached by the Native Title Tribunal in FMG Pilbara Pty \nLtd/NC (deceased) on behalf of the Yindjibarndi People/Western Australia [2012] NNTTA 103, I respectfully \ndisagree with the Tribunal\u2019s construction.  If the State\u2019s construction were correct, the character of the Mining Act \nwould alter depending on the content of the regulations: if the regulations did not prescribe, for the purposes of s \n91, a miscellaneous licence for the purpose of \u201ctaking water\u201d, then the character of the Mining Act would not fall \nwithin s 24HA. For so long as the executive decided to prescribe such a purpose, the Mining Act would fall within s \n24HA. I do not accept that s 24HA is intended to operate in such an ambulatory way, at the instigation of the \nexecutive. Section 24HA is concerned with legislation (and administrative or executive acts authorised by \nlegislation) having a connection with water (in its usual sense, as the State submits). It is not concerned with \nlegislation (and administrative or executive acts authorised by legislation) having a connection with mining.  \nWhether or not this locates the only validation provisions for these two miscellaneous licences in s 26(1)(c)(i) or s \n24MD(6B) (or elsewhere in Pt 2 Div 3) is not necessary to decide. For the reasons I have given at [1144] below I \ndoubt these licences fall within s 26(1)(c)(i), but they may well fall within s 24MD(6B). Section 24HA was the only \nprovision relied upon by the State and Cameco to validate what was accepted to be a future act. I have found that \nprovision does not apply.  Accordingly, the grants of licences L53/161 and L53/177 were invalid in the sense of \nhaving no force or effect in relation to the applicant\u2019s native title.\n\nVarious mining tenements as invalid future acts    There remain seven miscellaneous licences whose effect on \nnative title was not agreed at the time of trial. They are set out in Table 6 to the Schedule to the amended parties\u2019 \nagreed statement. In each case, the applicant contends the respondents have not discharged the onus of \nestablishing that these licences were validly granted in accordance with the NT Act, so as to avoid the \ncharacterisation of invalid future acts. Most are now the subject of concessions about non-compliance and the real \ndebate between the parties (including third parties) is the consequence of non-compliance with the future act \nprovisions. Licence L36/129 requires a decision between competing arguments to be made. Some are now also \nsubject to further concessions removing the dispute between the parties. Nevertheless, I have retained them in this \nsection.  A further licence (L36/110) is listed in the amended parties\u2019 agreed statement as \u201cin issue\u201d, but no party \nmakes submissions about it. The parties have agreed there are only seven miscellaneous licences in issue and the \nCourt proceeds on that basis. I do not consider L36/110 any further.\n\nL36/122 and L36/123  The State accepts that these two licences should not be listed on any determination as \n\u201cother interests\u201d. Mr David Crabtree, who is a deponent to an affidavit filed on behalf of the State in relation to \nextinguishment, deposed that between 15 and 16 October 2015, for each tenement listed in Table 6, he examined \n\n\n\nrelevant files held by the WA Department of Mines and Petroleum and identified documents relating to processes \nconnected with the future act regime under the NT Act. He then made a handwritten note against each tenement on \nTable 6, summarising what he had found for that tenement.  His notes against these two licences read \u201cwithdrawn \n13/06/2003\u201d and \u201cwithdrawn 25/09/2000\u201d respectively. The State conceded that neither tenement is \u201clive\u201d, because \nit was withdrawn on the date Mr Crabtree has recorded. Therefore, the State accepts neither tenement is an \u201cother \ninterest\u201d for the purposes of any determination.\n\nL36/129  This licence was held by BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd and was granted on 15 January 1999, for the \npurposes of a \u201cpowerline\u201d. I note that, while at the time of the hearing of this proceeding, that licence was valid, it \nwas surrendered on 4 April 2016 and accordingly is now a \u201cdead\u201d licence. That may render the parties\u2019 arguments \nmoot, as it has for L36/122 and L36/123. However, in an abundance of caution, I will determine the issue in any \nevent.  BHP and the State submit the licence was granted to BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd, with the intention of \n\u201cformalising\u201d the tenure of a powerline which was constructed some 20 years prior to its grant, in accordance with \napproved proposals under the Nickel (Agnew) Agreement Act 1974 (WA). BHP described the function of the \npowerline as transmitting electrical energy from the Leinster 33kv switch yard, situated within Mineral Lease 255SA, \nto the Leinster airport and town site. The source in the evidence for these submissions is an exhibit to Mr Crabtree\u2019s \naffidavit consisting of a memorandum from the Director-General of the Department of Mines to the Western \nAustralian Minister for Mines, dated 13 November 1998. That memorandum describes the licence application and \nthe author\u2019s views about which provisions of the NT Act might be attracted by the application, as well as recording \nthe legal views expressed by the WA Crown Solicitors office. The State has accepted that the statements of legal \nopinion in the memorandum are not admissible to prove the correctness of those opinions. The State and BHP \nsubmit that otherwise the contents of the memorandum are probative of the purpose of the grant of the licence, and \nits relationship to the Nickel (Agnew) Agreement Act. If that is so, they submit there is sufficient evidence for the \nCourt to find that s 24IB of the NT Act applied to the grant of the licence in 1999.  Mr Crabtree\u2019s handwritten \nnotation about this licence states \u201cGranted under sec 24IB\u201d. However, the State conceded Mr Crabtree\u2019s note could \nnot be admitted to prove the truth of that statement.  Section 24IB of the NT Act provides:A future act is a pre-\nexisting right-based act if it takes place:\n\n (a) in exercise of a legally enforceable right created by any act done on or before 23 December 1996 that is valid \n(including because of Division 2 or 2A); or\n\n (b) in good faith in giving effect to, or otherwise because of, an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking \nmade or given in good faith on or before 23 December 1996, and of which there is written evidence created at or \nabout the time the offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking was made.  There are two single judge decisions \nwhich deal with the meaning of the term \u201clegally enforceable right\u201d, although not necessarily in exactly the same \ncontext. In Daniel, RD Nicholson J considered the phrase\u2019s meaning in the context of s 228(3)(b)(i) of the NT Act. At \n[44] his Honour dealt with the question of the time at which the legally enforceable right had to arise, which does \nnot seem to be in dispute between the parties to this proceeding, but is nevertheless worth making clear. His \nHonour\u2019s reasoning applies, in my opinion, to s 24IB:Again it is the terms of the NT Act in its relevant section which \nmust determine this issue. Section 228(3) draws a distinction between the \u201cact\u201d which takes place on or after 1 \nJanuary 1994 (which may become the past act if it satisfies the statutory criteria) and the \u201clegally enforceable right\u201d \nin exercise of which the \u201cact\u201d takes place. The accommodation lease is not the \u201clegally enforceable right;\u201d rather it \nis the \u201cact\u201d resulting (if it does) from the \u201clegally enforceable right\u201d created in accordance with the section. It follows \nfrom the provisions of the section that it will be sufficient if the enactment sets out a mechanism providing a legally \nenforceable right which results in the application of the mechanism there provided on a later occasion to produce an \nact.  At [48], his Honour set out the terms of the agreement in issue to explain why he concluded that there was no \nrelevant discretion reposed in the Minister whether or not to grant the licence:It necessary to go to the terms of the \nAgreement. Clause 19(1) is expressed in mandatory terms. It requires the State to grant leases in accordance with \nthe Joint Venturers\u2019 approved proposals. It should be read with cl 8. That also is expressed in mandatory terms, \nnamely that the Minister shall approve of the said proposals either wholly or in part without qualification or \nreservation. The Minister\u2019s powers to intervene derives from his power to approve the proposals only in part; from \nhis power to defer consideration until other submissions are received; and from his power to require conditions \n\n\n\nprecedent: cl 8(1)(a), (b) and (c). If the Minister\u2019s decision is considered by the Joint Venturers to be unreasonable, \nthey may elect to refer the decision to arbitration: cl 8(4). Clause 8 applies to proposals to modify, expand or vary \nactivities substantially as a consequence of the application of cl 9. Clause 9 excludes cl 8(5) and cl 8(7) from \napplication to proposals for approval, so that those subclauses cannot be taken into account in determining the \nwidth of the Minister\u2019s discretion. It is not the case that the Minister may refuse a proposal or only grant it on very \ndifferent terms and conditions.  In Banjima (No 2) [2013] FCA 868; 305 ALR 1, Barker J (especially at [972]) made \nsimilar findings in relation to another State agreement, again focussing on whether, under the terms of the relevant \nagreement, the Minister had a discretion or an obligation to grant the licence proposed.  The Nickel (Agnew) \nAgreement is a schedule to the Nickel (Agnew) Agreement Act. The applicant conceded the Agreement is \u201cin \nrelevantly similar terms to the agreements in Daniel and Banjima\u201d. The relevant obligation is set out in cl 17(2):The \nState shall in accordance with the Joint Venturers\u2019 approved proposals grant to the Joint Venturers or arrange to \nhave the appropriate authority or other interested instrumentality of the State grant for such periods and on such \nterms and conditions (including renewal rights) as shall be reasonable having regard to the requirements of the \nJoint Venturers, leases and where applicable licences easements and rights of way for all or any of the purposes of \nthe Joint Venturers\u2019 operations hereunder including any of the following namely \u2014 townsites, private roads, railway \nsidings and spur lines, tailing areas, water pipelines, pumping installations and reservoirs, airport, power \ntransmission lines, stockpile areas and plant site areas (including concentrator areas and smelter areas).\n\n (Emphasis added.)  In other words, the applicant does not contend the Minister merely had a discretion whether to \ngrant the licence in question. What is missing, the applicant contends, is admissible evidence about the proposals \nsubmitted by BHP to the Minister, and without those the Court cannot ascertain if the licence granted fell within the \nterms of the proposals \u2013 if it did not, so the argument appears to go, there would be no legally enforceable right. \nThe applicant contends the memorandum is insufficient to prove these facts.  The State submits the record in the \nmemorandum that the powerline was constructed in accordance with \u201capproved proposals that formed part of the \nNickel (Agnew) Agreement Act\u201d is sufficient. I agree. In my opinion, the memorandum, as the State submits, formed \npart of the business records of the Department of Mines so that the hearsay character of what is said in it does not \npreclude the memorandum being probative of the truth of its contents. Where the Director-General informs the \nMinister the powerline was, 20 years ago, constructed in accordance with the proposals forming part of the Nickel \n(Agnew) Agreement Act, in my opinion that statement is sufficient to prove on the balance of probabilities that is \nwhat occurred. That being the case, BHP had a legally enforceable right under cl 17(2) of the Nickel (Agnew) \nAgreement to have the licence granted. This satisfies s 24IB(a).  Even if that conclusion is wrong, I am satisfied that \nthe grant of licence took place \u201cin good faith\u201d in giving effect to the arrangements in the Nickel (Agnew) Agreement, \nwhich was made before 23 December 1996, and the Agreement which is the schedule to the Act is \u201cwritten \nevidence\u201d of that arrangement. This satisfies s 24IB(b).  Whichever subsection of s 24IB is satisfied, none of the \nnotification or procedural rights contained in s 24ID(3) or (4) apply to a future act under s 24IB. Accordingly, the \ngrant of licence L36/129 had full force and effect in respect of the applicant\u2019s native title, although it is subject, as \nthe parties agree, to the non-extinguishment principle.\n\nL36/144, L36/148 and L36/152  Licence L36/144 is held by TEC Desert Pty Ltd and TEC Desert No. 2 Pty Ltd. This \nlicence is located in the southern part of the claim area, around the area of Agnew. Licence L36/148 is held by \nAustralian Nickel Investments Pty Ltd. It is located in the eastern part of the claim area, around the area of Sir \nSamuel. Licence L36/152 is held by TEC Desert Pty Ltd and TEC Desert No. 2 Pty Ltd. This licence is located in \nthe southern part of the claim area, approximately around the area of Agnew.  Mr Crabtree also made some notes \nagainst these three mining tenements. The notes against each read \u201cGranted under Ward policy see attached\u201d. \nWhat is attached are pieces of correspondence that deal with what the State described as the \u201cWard policy\u201d \nfollowing the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Ward (FC) [2000] FCA 191; 99 FCR 316. The effect of that \npolicy was, in accordance with the Full Court\u2019s decision, that certain mining tenements were granted without \nreference to the future act provisions of the NT Act, on the basis that the grants had extinguished native title rights \nand interests: see Ward (FC) at [329].  The Full Court\u2019s finding on which the \u201cWard policy\u201d was based was reversed \nby the High Court: see Ward (HC) at [181]-[186], [191]-[195].  Accordingly, the State appears to accept that each of \nthe grants of these three tenements was non-compliant with the future act provisions of the NT Act.  The applicant \nsubmits that, on the basis of the State\u2019s tenure DVD, L36/144 was granted on 4 October 2000 for the purpose of a \n\n\n\n\u201cPowerline\u201d; L36/148 was granted on 23 November 2000 for the purpose of a \u201cPowerline Road\u201d and L36/152 was \ngranted on 15 November 2000 for the purpose of a \u201cPipeline Road\u201d. The applicant further contends this means \neach of the licences was the creation of a \u201cright to mine\u201d for the sole purpose of an infrastructure facility of the kind \nreferred to in paras (a) and/or (d) and/or (g) of the definition of infrastructure facility in s 253 of the NT Act. \nAccordingly, the terms of s 24MD(6B) are said to have been applicable, but were not followed.  The State has not \nmade submissions about the nature of these licences or the applicable provisions of Pt 2 Div 3, given the \nincorrectness of its \u201cWard policy\u201d. Further, unlike the submissions it made with respect to the pastoral leases, the \nState did not submit that the Full Court\u2019s decision in Lardil has any application. However, even if that submission \nhad been made, I would have rejected it for the reasons I have set out at [989]-[1048] above.  As I apprehend it, the \napplicant\u2019s submission about this licence creating a \u201cright to mine\u201d may have been made in an attempt to bring the \ngrant of the licences within a provision that, on the obiter statements inLardil, created procedural rights capable of \naffecting the validity of the grant of a future act. That may explain, with respect, the contortions which have been \nundertaken to characterise the grant of a licence to erect a powerline, or to make a pipeline, as the grant of a \u201cright \nto mine\u201d within s 26(1)(c)(i) of the NT Act, attracting Subdiv P and the right to negotiate. I accept the State\u2019s \nsubmissions that, although \u201cright to mine\u201d is not a defined term in the NT Act, the verb \u201cmine\u201d is defined in s 253 \n(inclusively) as:mine includes:\n\n (a) explore or prospect for things that may be mined (including things covered by that expression because of \nparagraphs (b) and (c)); or\n\n (b) extract petroleum or gas from land or from the bed or subsoil under waters; or\n\n (c) quarry;\n\n but does not include extract, obtain or remove sand, gravel, rocks or soil from the natural surface of land, or of the \nbed beneath waters, for a purpose other than:\n\n (d) extracting, producing or refining minerals from the sand, gravel, rocks or soil; or\n\n (e) processing the sand, gravel, rocks or soil by non-mechanical means.  I do not consider that the construction of \na powerline or a pipeline, even if directly connected to mining activity, falls within the verb \u201cmine\u201d as defined in s \n253, nor within any extended meaning that might exist given the statutory definition is not exhaustive. A \u201cright\u201d to \n\u201cmine\u201d is, primarily, a lease, licence or other legal right granted to do one or more of the activities set out in the \ninclusive definition in s 253. Construction of powerlines and pipelines does not fall within that.  An alternative \nsubmission was that the grant of these licences was a future act within s 24MD(6B) as the creation of a \u201cright to \nmine for the sole purpose of the construction of an infrastructure facility associated with mining\u201d. The phrase \n\u201cinfrastructure facility\u201d is defined in s 253:infrastructure facility includes any of the following:\n\n (a) a road, railway, bridge or other transport facility;\n\n (b) a jetty or port;\n\n (c) an airport or landing strip;\n\n (d) an electricity generation, transmission or distribution facility;\n\n (e) a storage, distribution or gathering or other transmission facility for;(i) oil or gas; or\n\n\n\n (ii) derivatives of oil or gas;(f) a storage or transportation facility for coal, any other mineral or any mineral \nconcentrate;\n\n (g) a dam, pipeline, channel or other water management, distribution or reticulation facility;\n\n (h) a cable, antenna, tower or other communication facility;\n\n (i) any other thing that is similar to any or all of the things mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (h) and that the \nCommonwealth Minister determines, by legislative instrument, to be an infrastructure facility for the purposes of this \nparagraph.  Given what is expressly excluded from the inclusive definition of \u201cmine\u201d, it may be that the phrase in s \n24MD(6B) is an example covering activities broader than those in the inclusive definition. So much may be gleaned \nfrom the definition of infrastructure facility. Thus, if, for the sole purpose of mining operations, a dam needed to be \nconstructed, then a licence granting permission for that to occur might well fall within s 24MD(6B).  It is possible that \na licence to construct a pipeline could fall within s 24MD(6B), pipelines being one kind of infrastructure expressly \nmentioned in the definition of infrastructure facility in s 253. Powerlines are not expressly mentioned and it is more \ndoubtful whether they are intended to be brought within an \u201celectricity ... transmission ... facility\u201d, but it is possible.  If \ns 24MD(6B) did not apply, then s 24MD(6A) will have applied. On the evidence before me, there has been no \napparent compliance with that provision either.  Given the views I have expressed about non-compliance with any \nof the procedural requirements in these Subdivisions, it is not as critical whether the future act falls within (6A) or \n(6B): on the evidence, neither provision was complied with.  Therefore, these three licences are invalid in the sense \nof having no force or effect in relation to the applicant\u2019s native title.\n\nL53/109  This licence is held by BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd. It was granted under Div 5 of Pt IV of the Mining \nActon 18 November 1999, for the purpose of a \u201croad\u201d. It is located near North Deep Bore in the north-eastern part \nof the claim area.  Again, this tenement is the subject of a concession, properly made, by the State. The State\u2019s \nsubmissions explain that it had been understood, again on the basis of the \u201cWard policy\u201d, that the establishment of \nRoad Number 10439 had fully extinguished any native title rights and interests over that piece of land, and that \nexplains the non-compliance with the future act provisions.  I accept the applicant\u2019s submissions that this is an act \nto which s 24MD(6B) would apply, as the definition of an \u201cinfrastructure facility\u201d includes \u201ca road, railway, bridge or \nother transport facility\u201d.  The State appears to accept the establishment of this road was an invalid future act \nbecause it was granted without reference to Pt 2 Div 3.  Accordingly, this licence is invalid in the sense of having no \nforce or effect in relation to the applicant\u2019s native title.\n\nShould the invalid future acts be recorded in the Determination?    I accept the respondents\u2019 submissions that the \nlicences in issue are not impugned under the general law or as being invalid in the sense of having no legal effect \nat all.  Although I note there are different views on the question, in my opinion it may be prudent to have these \ninvalid future acts recorded in the Determination. That is a matter I will, in the first instance, leave for the parties to \nattempt to reach agreement about, based on these reasons for judgment.\n\nSECTION 47B    Section 47B of the NT Act provides:Vacant Crown land covered by claimant applications\n\nWhen section applies\n\n (1) This section applies if:(a) a claimant application is made in relation to an area; and\n\n (b) when the application is made, the area is not:(i) covered by a freehold estate or a lease; or\n\n (ii) covered by a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority, made or conferred by the \nCrown in any capacity, or by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation of the Commonwealth, a State or a \nTerritory, under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area is to be used for public purposes or for a \nparticular purpose; or\n\n\n\n (iii) subject to a resumption process (see paragraph (5)(b)); and(c) when the application is made, one or more \nmembers of the native title claim group occupy the area.Prior extinguishment to be disregarded\n\n (2) For all purposes under this Act in relation to the application, any extinguishment, of the native title rights and \ninterests in relation to the area that are claimed in the application, by the creation of any prior interest in relation to \nthe area must be disregarded.Note: The applicant will still need to show the existence of any connection with the \nland or waters concerned that may be required by the common law concept of native title.Effect of determination\n\n (3) If the determination on the application is that the native title claim group hold the native title rights and interests \nclaimed:(a) the determination does not affect:(i) the validity of the creation of any prior interest in relation to the \narea; or\n\n (ii) any interest of the Crown in any capacity, or of any statutory authority, in any public works on the land or waters \nconcerned; and(b) the non-extinguishment principle applies to the creation of any prior interest in relation to the \narea.Renewals and extensions of leases\n\n (4) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), if, after a lease covering an area expires or is terminated, the lease is \nbona fide renewed, or its term is bona fide extended, the area is taken to be covered by the lease during the period \nbetween the expiry or termination and the renewal or extension.\n\nDefined expressions\n\n (5) For the purposes of this section:(a) the creation of a prior interest in relation to an area does not include the \ncreation of an interest that confirms ownership of natural resources by, or confers ownership of natural resources \non, the Crown in any capacity; and\n\n (b) an area is subject to a resumption process at a particular time (the test time) if:(i) all interests last existing in \nrelation to the area before the test time were acquired, resumed or revoked by, or surrendered to, the Crown in any \ncapacity; and\n\n (ii) when that happened, the Crown had a bona fide intention of using the area for public purposes or for a \nparticular purpose; and\n\n (iii) the Crown still had a bona fide intention of that kind in relation to the area at the test time.  Section 47B directs \nattention to the current connection of claim group members with their country. The general approach to s 47B, and \nthe operation of the exclusions contained in s 47B(1)(b) (and subpara (ii) in particular), was set out by the Full Court \nin Banjima [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at [88], [91] and [97]-[98]:The construction of s 47B should be \napproached having regard to the Preamble to the NTA, which forms part of that Act (see s 13(2)(b) of the Acts \nInterpretation Act 1901(Cth)) which stated:where appropriate, the native title should not be extinguished but revive \nafter a validated act ceases to have effect....\n\n As Wilcox, French and Weinberg JJ held in Alyawarr at [187], the purpose of s 47B is beneficial. They explained \nthe reason for a narrow construction of s 47B(1)(b)(ii) of the identified purpose of an affectation to which the \nprovision applied as follows:The purpose of s 47B is beneficial. The qualification on its application in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) \nis no doubt intended to minimise the impact of native title determination applications on areas set aside by \nproclamation or otherwise under statutory authority for public or particular purposes. That limitation should not be \n\n\n\nconstrued more widely than is necessary to achieve its purpose. A proclamation for a broadly expressed purpose \nwhich encompasses a variety of potential but unascertained uses is not a proclamation for a particular purpose. \nThe term \u201cpublic purposes\u201d may arguably encompass a land use planning purpose which is met by establishing a \nframework or condition for the allocation of private rights such as the grant of residential or commercial leases in a \ntownship. Alternatively, it may be construed as referring to purposes of a public nature such as the creation of \nreserves for public works or recreation or environmental protection. A narrower construction accords with a \ncomprehensible policy that, in the public interest, prior extinguishment which might obviate public exposure to \ncompensation claims or a future act process should be continued in force. It is not necessary in aid of the narrower \nconstruction to define its outer limits here. It is sufficient to say that the mere proclamation of a townsite, which \nmight comprise largely private property holdings by lease or otherwise, does not define public purposes or a \nparticular purpose within the meaning of s 47B(1)(b)(ii).(Emphasis added.)\n\n ...\n\n The definition of a claimant application, which incorporates by reference the definition of native title determination \napplication under s 61(1) of the NTA, itself requires that it be made \u201cin relation to an area\u201d, so the additional words \nrepeating that expression in s 47B(1)(a) must be used to narrow the focus of each paragraph in s 47B(1)(b), and of \ns 47B(1)(c), to each particular parcel of land and waters individually covered by the claimant application and to \nwhich s 47B is alleged to apply. And, the use of the expression \u201cthe whole or a part of the land or waters in the \narea\u201d in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) reinforces the narrowing effect of \u201cin relation to an area\u201d in s 47B(1)(a).\n\n In other words, the exclusion from the beneficial operation of s 47B(2) effected by each paragraph in s 47B(1)(b) \nshould be given a narrow reading so that the exclusion will apply only in respect of each particular parcel of land or \nwaters that falls within the express words. Thus, native title will be treated, for the purposes of s 47B, as having \nbeen extinguished only in respect of each freehold or leasehold estate, and each particular part of land or waters \nsubject to an affectation referred to in s 47B(1)(b)(ii), and each set of interests referred to in s 47B(1)(b)(iii) and \n(5)(b), and s 47B(2) will not operate to affect that status.  The structure of s 47B is such that it is appropriate to \nconsider first whether any of the disapplying provisions in s 47B(1)(b) affect the parcels of land identified by the \napplicant. Having reached a conclusion on whether s 47B is applicable to each of the parcels of land identified, I will \nthen turn to consider the question of occupation for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c).\n\nAreas affected and the parties\u2019 contentions    There are eight areas in the claim area to which claims under s 47B \nattach. Most are relatively small, and occur broadly in a north\u2013south line in the eastern part of the claim area. The \nmost southerly is UCL 240, a small area south-west of Leinster. The most northerly in this eastern part of the claim \narea are UCL 14 and UCL 15, at Tjiwarl/Logan Spring. In the north-west of the claim area, in the region of Lake \nMason, are three parcels of land to which s 47B is said to apply, and together these cover a substantial area. They \nare UCL 239, UCL 245 and UCL 246.  The two relevant dates for the purposes of s 47B are 17 June 2011 (the \nlodgement of Tjiwarl #1) and 22 June 2015 (the lodgement of Tjiwarl #2).  In respect of UCL 239, UCL 245 and UCL \n246 (formerly H91295 and 3114/551), the applicant contends that one or more claim group members occupied this \narea on 17 June 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are agreed that this area was the subject of the following \nmining tenements:(a) UCL 239: E36/742 and E57/849\n\n (b) UCL 245: E53/1273, E53/1564 and E57/676\n\n (c) UCL 246: E53/1446, E53/1564, E57/608, E57/609, E57/739, E57/813, MC53/3927, MC53/3929, MC53/3931, \nL53/160 and TR70/6899  The applicant contends that those mining tenements do not render s 47B inapplicable.  In \nrespect of UCL 14 and UCL 15 (Tjiwarl/Logan Spring), the applicant contends that one or more claim group \nmembers occupied this area on 17 June 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are agreed that this area was the \nsubject of the following mining tenements: L36/120 and L36/60. Again, the applicant contends that those mining \ntenements do not render s 47B inapplicable.  In respect of part of UCL 11 (Yakabindie), the applicant contends that \none or more claim group members occupied this area on 17 June 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are \n\n\n\nagreed that this area was the subject of the following mining tenements: E36/717, L36/96 and L36/191. The \napplicant contends that those mining tenements do not render s 47B inapplicable.  In respect of parts of UCL 4, \nUCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10 (Sir Samuel), the applicant contends that one or more claim group members occupied \nthis area on 17 June 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are agreed that this area was the subject of the \nfollowing mining tenements:(a) UCL 4: E36/535, E36/752, E36/753 and L36/96\n\n (b) UCL 6: E36/535, E36/717, E36/752, E36/753, L36/96, L36/159, L36/191 and L36/175\n\n (c) UCL 10: L36/175 and L36/96  The applicant contends that those mining tenements do not render s 47B \ninapplicable.  In respect of UCL 240 (Vivien), the applicant contends that one or more claim group members \noccupied this area on 17 June 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are agreed that this area was the subject of \nthe following mining tenements: E36/617 and L36/49. The applicant contends that those mining tenements do not \nrender s 47B inapplicable.  In respect of Road 13, the applicant contends that this area was unallocated Crown land \nas at 22 June 2015 and that one or more claim group members occupied this area on 22 June 2015. It further \ncontends that \u201cany prior extinguishment in this area by reason of its status as Road 13 was because of the taking of \nnative title rights under the Public Works Act 1902 (WA) and Road Districts Act 1919 (WA) and there is no evidence \nof extinguishment by construction of a public work\u201d. The parties are agreed that this area was the subject of the \nfollowing mining tenements: E57/577-I and L36/137. The applicant contends that those mining tenements do not \nrender s 47B inapplicable.  In respect of UCL 247 (south of Mail Change Well) and UCL 8 (corner Leinster Downs \nand Booylgoo Spring), the applicant contends that one or more claim group members occupied this area on 17 \nJune 2011 and/or 22 June 2015. The parties are agreed that these areas are not subject to any mining tenements. \nThus, if occupation is proved, s 47B will apply to these areas.  In respect of parts of Closed Roads 21 and 23, the \napplicant originally contended that this area was unallocated Crown land on 17 June 2011 and that one or more \nclaim group members occupied this area on that date. It further contended that any prior extinguishment in this area \nshould be disregarded under s 47B of the NT Act. The respondents contended that the area was subject to the \nfollowing mining tenements: E36/545, E36/617, E36/622 and E36/713. The applicant contended that those mining \ntenements do not render s 47B inapplicable.\n\nDoes the statutory dedication of a public road fall within s 47B(1)(b)(ii)?    The only road left in issue between the \nparties in relation to s 47B is Road 13. In their final written submissions, the applicant stated they no longer contend \nthat s 47B applies to disregard extinguishment in Closed Roads 21 and 23.  Road 13 is situated in the south-west \ncorner of the claim area, and is shown on the tenure evidence as running through Depot Springs pastoral station. \nThe parties are agreed that it was designated as a road as at 2011, but that it was a UCL area as at 22 June 2015 \nwhen Tjiwarl #2 was lodged.  As I have mentioned above, the applicant identifies the possible extinguishing act in \nrelation to Road 13 as the resumption of the road for the purposes of public works, as defined in s 253 of the NT \nAct. By reason of ss 12I and 12J of the Titles (Validation) and Native Title (Effect of Past Acts) Act 1995 (WA), read \nwith s 23E of the NT Act, if an activity or the performance of a function falls within the definition of a public work, it \nwill be a previous exclusive possession act and will have extinguished native title.  Neither the applicant nor the \nState submit there is any part of s 47B(1)(b) that might be said to disapply the operation of s 47B(2). Rather, the \nState submits s 47B(2) cannot revive native title in the area comprising the Road 13 because the establishment of a \nroad is not the \u201ccreation of any prior interest\u201d within the terms of s 47B(2). It relies on the Full Court decision in \nErubam Le (Darnley Islanders) #1 v Queensland [2003] FCAFC 227; 134 FCR 155. At [90] of Erubam Le, the Full \nCourt said:... it cannot be said that the construction or establishment of the public works is properly to be \ncharacterised as \u201cthe creation of a prior interest\u201d in the land. It follows that s 47A(2)(b) does not apply so as to \ncompel the disregarding of the extinguishment brought about by the acts of constructing or establishing the public \nworks.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  Mansfield J applied that finding in Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia [2014] FCA 256 \nat [80].  The applicant does not contend Erubam Le was wrongly decided, but even if they did I would, as a single \njudge, be bound to follow it, as Mansfield J did in Griffiths. Rather, the applicant contends the decision is \ndistinguishable, because of the different kind of extinguishment involved in Erubam Le from the act of \n\n\n\nextinguishment in relation to Road 13. The applicant submits there was, for the purposes of s 47B, extinguishment \nby the creation of a \u201cprior interest\u201d within the terms of s 47B(2) in relation to Road 13.  I do not accept the \napplicant\u2019s submission, and I turn to explain why. The definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d in s 253 is:public work means:\n\n (a) any of the following that is constructed or established by or on behalf of the Crown, or a local government body \nor other statutory authority of the Crown, in any of its capacities:(i) a building, or other structure (including a \nmemorial), that is a fixture; or\n\n (ii) a road, railway or bridge; or\n\n (iia) where the expression is used in or for the purposes of Division 2 or 2A of Part 2\u2014a stock-route; or\n\n (iii) a well, or bore, for obtaining water; or\n\n (iv) any major earthworks; or(b) a building that is constructed with the authority of the Crown, other than on a \nlease.Note: In addition, section 251D deals with land or waters relating to public works.  Erubam Le was a s 47A \ncase, but it is not suggested that difference is material. It concerned a claim for native title over the island of Erub, \nin the Torres Strait. The matter came before a Full Court on a referral for the answers to separate questions stated \nby Drummond J. There were essentially two questions: first, whether the construction or establishment of specified \npublic works on the island would have extinguished native title rights and interests; second, if they did, whether for \nthe purposes of s 47A of the NT Act such extinguishment would be disregarded. The specified works were carried \nout at various times between 1977 and 2002 to build the following structures on the island: a windmill, a windmill-\ndriven pump, an earth dam storage, a fibreglass reservoir, reticulation pipes, a school, two residential houses, a \nsewerage system and a stadium. The parties were agreed these activities constituted \u201cpublic works\u201d for the \npurposes of the NT Act and the Queensland validating legislation. Whether the acts extinguished native title was \nanswered differently in relation to one group of acts (the pump, windmill, dam, reservoir, pipes, school and first \nresidential house) from the other group (the second residential house, sewerage system and stadium); the former \nwere held to have extinguished native title, while the latter were not. As to the former, the Court held (at [32]) they \nwere not within the exception to what constitutes an act of exclusive possession set out in s 23B(9) because (and \nthis is the point of relevance) in their building and construction, there was no \u201cgrant or vesting\u201d of title:Section \n23B(9) provides, in terms, that an act is not a previous exclusive possession act if it \u201cis\u201d the grant or vesting of any \nthing. It is straining language to say that the beneficial impact (assuming the impact to be beneficial) upon the \nphysical characteristics, value or utility of the land consequent upon the construction or establishment of public \nworks and the simultaneous operation of principles relating to fixtures, results in some unspecified way in the \nconstruction or establishment of the work being a grant or vesting. [Emphasis in original.] The public work is neither \n\u201cgranted\u201d nor \u201cvested.\u201d In truth, there is no change at all in the fee simple interest as such, even if the land \nbecomes, as a practical matter, more valuable or more useful.The correctness of this approach is confirmed when \nreference is made to other provisions within the same legislative framework, including other parts of the same \nsection, where a clear distinction is drawn between acts that are or \u201cconsist of a grant or vesting\u201d (which are dealt \nwith by s 23B(2), (9), (9A) and (9C)) and acts that \u201cconsist of the construction of [sic] establishment of any public \nwork\u201d (within s 23B(7)). [Emphasis added.]  The Court returned to this analysis when it came to look at s 47A. \nAlthough the text of s 47A(2) differs from the text of s 47B(2), s 47A(2)(b) nevertheless contains the words \u201cthe \ncreation of any other prior interest in relation to the area\u201d. At [83]-[84], the Full Court emphasised the need to \nidentify, with particularity, the extinguishing act:The disagreement between the parties is about the application of s \n47A(2) to the construction or establishment of the public works. The applicants contend, and the respondents deny, \nthat the section operates to save from extinguishment any native title rights and interests that might otherwise have \nbeen extinguished.\n\n It is important to note at the outset that s 47A(2) is concerned with the characterisation of \u201cacts\u201d that are to be \ndisregarded. In doing so, it characterises the act to be disregarded as a \u201cgrant or vesting\u201d, or a \u201cdoing of the thing \n\n\n\nthat resulted in the holding or reservation\u201d or a \u201ccreation of any other prior interest\u201d. The provision is tightly worded; \nit would, for example, have had a much broader potential application if the paragraphs were expressed to apply to \nextinguishing acts that \u201cinvolved\u201d a grant, a vesting or a creation of a prior interest. The provision requires, however, \nthat in the consideration of its application to any extinguishment otherwise effected by (relevantly here) the \nconstruction or establishment of the public works, it must first be determined what, as a matter of characterisation \nfor the purposes of s 47A(2), the act by which native title is extinguished actually is.\n\n (Emphasis in original.)  At [85], the Court decided the appropriate characterisation, consistently with the earlier \nparts of their reasons, was \u201cthe construction or establishment of [a] public work\u201d.  The Court noted the breadth of \nthe definition of \u201cinterest\u201d in s 253 of the NT Act, a matter to which the applicant in this proceeding also points.  \n\u201cInterest\u201d is defined for the purposes of the Act in s 253. The definition is very broad and reads as follows:interest, in \nrelation to land or waters, means:(a) a legal or equitable estate or interest in the land or waters; or\n\n (b) any other right (including a right under an option and a right of redemption), charge, power or privilege over, or \nin connection with:(i) the land or waters; or\n\n (ii) an estate or interest in the land or waters; or(c) a restriction on the use of the land or waters, whether or not \nannexed to other land or waters.  It was at this point that the Court expressed the opinion I have extracted at [1176] \nabove, on which the State relies, that the construction of a public work is not the creation of a \u201cprior interest\u201d.  The \napplicant contends this analysis in Erubam Le has no application to Road 13, because Road 13 was never \nconstructed. I interpolate here that another distinguishing feature is that a road, when constructed, is imprinted upon \nor occupies the land itself, rather than being in the nature of a fixture or structure upon it.  Instead, the applicant \nrelies, as the Full Court in Erubam Le emphasised was the correct approach, on the nature of the extinguishing act. \nIn relation to Road 13, the parties are agreed that Road 13 was resumed pursuant to s 17 of the Public Works Act \n1902 (WA). The effect of such a resumption was, at the relevant time, set out in s 18 of that Act:     WHENEVER \nany land is required for any public work, the Governor may, by notice published in the Government Gazette, declare \nthat the land has been set apart, taken, or resumed under this Act for the public purpose therein expressed, ...    18. \nUPON the publication of such notice in the Government Gazette \u2013(1) the land referred to in such notice shall, by \nforce of this Act, be vested in His Majesty, or the local authority, as the Governor may direct and the case require, \nfor an estate in fee simple in possession for the public work expressed in such notice, freed and discharged from all \ntrusts, mortgages, charges, obligations, estates, interests, rights-of-way, or other easements whatsoever; ...  The \napplicant submits in substance that a resumption of this kind in favour of the Crown can constitute the creation of a \n\u201cprior interest\u201d for the purposes of s 47B, bearing in mind the wide definition of \u201cinterest\u201d in s 253.  I do not accept \nthat argument. It is inconsistent with the approach taken by the Full Court in Fourmile v Selpam Pty Ltd [1998] FCA \n67; 80 FCR 151. Fourmile concerned a road that had been marked out on a survey plan but never constructed, and \nwas described as a \u201croad reserve\u201d. At 186-187 Cooper J said:The establishment of a public road does not create \nan easement in favour of a member of the public thereby investing that member with an estate or interest in the \nland which constitutes the road: Re Innes (1891) 12 LR (NSW) L 180 at 183.\n\n Ownership of land dedicated as a road does not pass at common law and the grantor retains all rights of \nownership not inconsistent with public user: City of Keilor v O\u2019Donohue at 369. Therefore, subject to any relevant \nstatutory enactment to the contrary, dedication of a road by the Crown does not disturb the Crown\u2019s ownership of \nthe land constituting the grant.\n\n ...\n\n The common law rights which are held by the owner of adjoining property [which Cooper J had described but I \nhave omitted] may not be taken away or interfered with, without express statutory authority: Bartzios v Leichhardt \n\n\n\nMunicipal Council [1978] 1 NSWLR 7 at 11; D\u2019Arcy v Municipal Council of Inverell [1925] NSWStRp 3; (1925) 25 SR \n(NSW) 102 at 107-108.\n\n ...\n\n The creation by the Crown of public rights of user through dedication of the road as an extension of Roberts Road \nto provide for public access to the lands abutting the road and to provide access to the lands west of Portion 25V, \ntogether with the creation of private rights in the owners from time to time of the adjoining lands, is consistent with \nthe Crown having exercised its sovereign power to appropriate to itself a plenary title to the land in order to use it for \na public purpose, namely to create public roads with their attendant public and private common law rights. \nAppropriation by the Crown of the land constituting the road and the creation of the rights of user are inconsistent \nwith the common law rights of native title claimed by Mr Fourmile and set out earlier in these reasons. Any native \ntitle rights which previously existed in the roadway, including the roadway the subject of the road closure application \nby Selpam, have been extinguished: Wik Peoples v Queensland (1996) 187 CLR 1 at 91-92.  At 169-170, \nDrummond J (with whom Burchett J agreed) reached a similar conclusion:The setting apart by the Crown, under \nlegislative authority, of the land in question for immediate use as a public road is, in my opinion, something quite \ndifferent, even if no carriageway is constructed on that land, so far as its impact on any native title that may have \nexisted in respect of that land is concerned, from what occurs where the Crown, acting under powers contained in \nprovisions such as s 95 of the Crown Lands Act and s 334 of the 1962 Act, reserves from future sale or lease \nunalienated Crown land which may be required for road purposes in the future. If the Crown merely reserves Crown \nland from further sale or lease for road purposes, it does not, as I have explained, create rights in third parties. Nor \nis the Crown\u2019s radical title to the land converted by such an act of reservation into full beneficial ownership: Wik \nPeoples, per Brennan CJ at 86.  Although a little later on, Drummond J does describe what occurs with a road \nreservation as the creation of an \u201cenforceable right\u201d of free passage in the members of the public, it is clear neither \nhis Honour nor Cooper J saw this as an interest in land in any sense. I do not consider it is the kind of \u201cinterest\u201d \nwith which s 47B(2) is concerned either.  Accordingly, I reject the applicant\u2019s submissions that there was, by the \nresumption of Road 13, a prior interest in that land created for the purposes of s 47B(2).  Based on the language of \nthe definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d, the applicant also submits that the word \u201cestablished\u201d in the phrase \u201cconstructed or \nestablished\u201d should be taken to refer only to stock routes. Despite the applicant\u2019s reference to some extrinsic \nmaterial, the text and context of s 253 do not support any construction which gives the word \u201cestablished\u201d a more \nrestricted application than the word \u201cconstructed\u201d. Further, as the State submitted in reply, Sundberg J\u2019s decision in \nNeowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 makes it clear that a road which has been dedicated is within the \nterms of \u201cpublic work\u201d in s 253: see Neowarra at [621]. I agree, with respect, with Barker J in Banjima (No 2) [2013] \nFCA 868;305 ALR 1 at [1417], where his Honour reached the same conclusion.\n\nDo the identified exploration licences render s 47B inapplicable: the meaning of \u201clease\u201d    In its reply submissions, \ngiven the findings of the Full Court in Banjima People v Western Australia (No 2)[2015] FCAFC 171; 328 ALR 637, \nthe State did not press its alternative submission under s 47B(1)(b)(ii) about the exploration licences.  That leaves \nits submissions that these licences fall within the meaning of \u201clease\u201d in s 47B(1)(b)(i). The State submits that the \ndefinition of \u201clease\u201d in s 242 of the NT Act includes licences and authorities to mine. Relying then on the definition of \n\u201cmine\u201d in s 253 of the NT Act, the State submits that a mining exploration licence is a \u201clease\u201d for the purposes of the \nNT Act, and therefore within s 47B(1)(b)(i).  Section 242 provides an inclusive but not exhaustive definition of the \nterm \u201clease\u201d:Lease\n\n (1) The expression lease includes:(a) a lease enforceable in equity; or\n\n (b) a contract that contains a statement to the effect that it is a lease; or\n\n (c) anything that, at or before the time of its creation, is, for any purpose, by a law of the Commonwealth, a State or \na Territory, declared to be or described as a lease.References to mining lease\n\n\n\n (2) In the case only of references to a mining lease, the expression lease also includes a licence issued, or an \nauthority given, by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.  The State relied on the effect of s \n242(2). Its submissions describe the addition of subs (2) to the original draft of the Native Title Bill 1993 (Cth) and \nrefer to the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum and to the explanatory material which related to the \ncorresponding expansion of the definition of \u201clessee\u201d in s 243(2). There is nothing in this explanatory material which \nassists the State\u2019s argument, as it simply repeats (as extrinsic material is wont to do) the terms of s 242(2).  The \nreal source of the State\u2019s submission is the definition of \u201cmine\u201d in s 253, which provides:mine includes:\n\n (a) explore or prospect for things that may be mined (including things covered by that expression because of \nparagraphs (b) and (c)); or\n\n (b) extract petroleum or gas from land or from the bed or subsoil under waters; or\n\n (c) quarry;\n\n but does not include extract, obtain or remove sand, gravel, rocks or soil from the natural surface of land, or of the \nbed beneath waters, for a purpose other than:\n\n (d) extracting, producing or refining minerals from the sand, gravel, rocks or soil; or\n\n (e) processing the sand, gravel, rocks or soil by non-mechanical means.  The terms of (a) indicate, the State \nsubmits, that if a \u201clicence\u201d falls within the definition of \u201clease\u201d then a licence to \u201cmine\u201d, as defined in s 253, must \ninclude an exploration licence. By this route, the State reaches the exclusion in s 47B(1)(b)(i).  I do not accept the \nState\u2019s submission, as it distorts the exclusion in s 47B(1)(b)(i), and does not give effect to the text of s 242(2).  \nSection 242(1) contains a general definition of \u201clease\u201d for the purpose of the NT Act. As I have noted, it is inclusive, \nnot exhaustive. However, the remainder of Div 3 of Pt 15 then goes on to identify, and make specific provision \nabout, a number of common lease types which might coexist on land over which native title is claimed. \nUnsurprisingly, one of the kinds of leases for which specific provision is made is a mining lease.  Section 245(1) \nprovides:A mining lease is a lease (other than an agricultural lease, a pastoral lease or a residential lease) that \npermits the lessee to use the land or waters covered by the lease solely or primarily for mining.  Agricultural, \npastoral and residential leases all have their own definitions: see ss 247, 248 and 249.  Division 3 of Pt 15 is, as s \n241 states, a definitional division. The purpose of s 242(1) is to indicate what kinds of transactions are to be \ncomprehended by the term \u201clease\u201d, and this will inform the meaning of the word in the more specific definitions \nwhich follow. So that, for example, a residential lease under s 249 will include a lease that is enforceable in equity.  \nThe purpose of s 242(2) is to give an extended operation to the term \u201clease\u201d only in the case of mining leases. The \neffect is that wherever the NT Act uses the term \u201cmining lease\u201d, that is to be taken as including a \u201cmining authority\u201d \nor a \u201cmining licence\u201d issued or given under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory.  Whatever kind of \nauthority or permission is given must still meet the definition of a \u201cmining lease\u201d in s 245, and whether it meets that \ndefinition will be determined by the activities it authorises. To fall within the extended definition of a mining \u201clease\u201d, \nthere must be permission for the lessee to \u201cuse the land or waters ... solely or primarily for mining\u201d.  Despite the \ndefinition given to the verb \u201cmine\u201d in s 253, in my opinion the NT Act defines a mining lease more narrowly, even \ntaking into account s 242(2). It looks to the use of the land, and requires that the land be used \u201csolely\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d \nfor mining. There is no evidence that the exploration licences in question permitted the licensee to use the land or \nwaters they covered \u201csolely\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d for mining.  Accordingly, I reject the State\u2019s submissions that the \nidentified exploration licences which cover all or parts of the parcels said by the applicant to be subject to s 47B fall \nwithin s 47B(1)(b)(i). The existence of the exploration licences does not render s 47B(2) inapplicable.  In Banjima \n(No 2) [2013] FCA 868; 305 ALR 1, the submissions put to Barker J by the State were that mining exploration \nlicences fell within s 47B(1)(b)(ii) and for that reason s 47B(2) could not apply to areas covered by such exploration \nlicences. After an examination of the authorities and, with respect, detailed consideration, Barker J rejected that \n\n\n\nargument: see [1208].  I infer the State did not press the same argument in this case because of Barker J\u2019s finding \nin Banjima (No 2), which was affirmed on appeal: see Banjima [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at [115]- [118].\n\nOther arguments by the applicant    The applicant also made submissions about the extent of any exclusion if the \nterms of s 47B(1)(b)(i)-(iii) were made out. I deal with this argument at [1215]-[1218] below.\n\nOccupation for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c): applicable principles    There are two matters which should be \naddressed. The first is the meaning of the word \u201carea\u201d in the phrase \u201coccupy the area\u201d in s 47B(1)(c). The second is \nwhat is meant by \u201coccupy\u201d in the same phrase.  On the first matter, the word \u201carea\u201d must be given a meaning which \nis consistent with the text, context and purpose of s 47B. To construe the word as meaning the whole claim area \nwould be inconsistent with those matters. In my opinion, in each instance the word \u201carea\u201d is used in s 47B, it refers \nto the area over which the claim of occupation is made. This is the interpretation which best advances the purposes \nof the provision, which is to permit the revival of native title in vacant Crown land, subject to the exclusions in s \n47B(1)(b)(i)-(iii). In Neowarra at [686], Sundberg J described the meaning of the word \u201carea\u201d in s 47A(1)(c) (and, at \n[721], his Honour applied it to s 47B(1)(c)). His Honour held the word had a more precise meaning than the entire \nclaim area, but recognised its ambulatory characteristics, depending on the content of the occupation claim:What is \n\u201cthe area\u201d of which s 47A(1)(c) speaks? The applicants submit it is the area the subject of the application \u2013 the \nclaim area. A reading of s 47A(1)(c) as a whole and in the context of the Act shows this submission to be unsound. \nWhen the legislature means to refer to the claim area it uses one of the descriptions \u201cthe area covered by the \napplication\u201d and \u201cland and waters covered by the application\u201d. See for example s 62. In s 47A(1)(c) \u201can area\u201d is not \nused in that sense. Rather it contemplates a particular area. That is made clear by par (b)(i) which refers to a \nfreehold estate existing over the area, or a lease existing over the area, or an area being vested in a person. The \narea in question may be the whole of the claim area, where for example the claim area consists of a freehold estate \ngranted under legislation of the kind in par (b)(i). Then one would ask whether, when the application was made, one \nor more members of the claim group occupied the claim area. That would be \u201cthe area\u201d under consideration for s \n47A purposes. Similarly where the claim area is held on trust expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal people. But \nwhere, as in a case such as the present, it is sought to apply s 47A to particular reserves and pastoral leases, it is \nthe area of the particular reserve or lease that must be assessed for occupancy.  This was the approach taken by \nMerkel J in Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at[69]- [72], and also by the Full Court in \nMoses v Western Australia [2007] FCAFC 78; 160 FCR 148 at [214]. More recently, the Full Court in Banjima took \nthe same approach: [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at [93]- [99].  The applicant accepts this construction, although \nthey made an additional submission that the operation of s 47B will only be \u201cdisapplied\u201d by the conduct referred to \nin s 47B(1)(b)(ii) in respect of the land or waters in fact affected by that conduct. Thus, if occupation is claimed over \nan \u201carea\u201d and only part of that area is affected by an exclusion in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) (or, it would seem, (i) or (iii) as \nwell), then the remainder of the area over which occupation is claimed should be subject to the beneficial effect of s \n47B, even if within the same \u201cparcel\u201d of land.  Therefore, the applicant\u2019s submissions continued, the relevant \u201carea\u201d \nfor the purposes of s 47B is so much of each individual UCL parcel in respect of which both:(a) the disapplying \nconditions in s 47B(1)(b) are not satisfied; and\n\n (b) the occupation condition in s 47B(1)(c) is satisfied.  The applicant submits, in substance, it is unnecessary to \nadhere to European cadastral boundaries in deciding s 47B claims.  On the evidence, I have not made any findings \nwhich render it necessary to engage with this additional submission. It is one of some general significance for the \noperation of s 47B and should await an appropriate case \u2013 where the issue is squarely raised on the evidence \u2013 to \nbe decided. However, a mirror of this contention arises in relation to Yakabindie and claim group occupation of the \nhomestead block: see [1270] below.  On the second matter, the principles concerning the meaning of \u201coccupy\u201d are \nwell-established, although that does not mean they are easy to apply to the evidence in any given circumstance. \nThe principles were set out in Moses at [215]:In considering the respective contentions, and in the light of the \nauthorities which have been discussed, we propose to apply the following general approach. It is largely a matter of \ncommon sense, but is founded upon the words of ss 47A and 47B in their context and as considered in the \nauthorities:(1) to \u201coccupy\u201d an area for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B of the NTA involves the exercise of some \nphysical activity or activities in relation to the area;\n\n\n\n (2) to \u201coccupy\u201d an area does not require the performance of an activity or activities on every part of the land;\n\n (3) to \u201coccupy\u201d an area does not necessarily involve consistently or repeatedly performing the activity or activities \nover part of the area;\n\n (4) to \u201coccupy\u201d an area does not require constant performance of the activity or activities over parts of the area; it \nis possible to conclude that an area is occupied where there are spasmodic or occasional physical activities carried \non over the area;\n\n (5) to occupy an area at a particular time does not necessarily require contemporaneous activity on that area at the \nparticular time; it is possible to conclude that an area of land is occupied in circumstances where at the time the \napplication is made there is no immediately contemporaneous activity being carried on in the area;\n\n (6) the fact of occupation does not necessarily entail a frequent physical presence in the area; for example, the \nstorage of sacred objects on the area or the holding, from time to time, of traditional ceremonies on the area may \nconstitute occupation for the purposes of the NTA: see, eg Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607; \n(2001) 112 FCR 409at [182];\n\n (7) evidence to establish occupation need not necessarily be confined to evidence of activities occurring on the \nparticular area; it may be possible to establish that a particular area is occupied by reference to occupation of a \nwider area which includes the particular area: Risk [2006] FCA 404 at 890;\n\n (8) occupation need not be \u201ctraditional\u201d: Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at[84];\n\n (9) whether occupation has been made out in a particular case is always a question of fact and degree.  In their \nsubmissions, the respondents identify other statements of principle of relevance to the determination of occupation \nclaims in this proceeding. They arise from Western Australia v Sebastian[2008] FCAFC 65; 173 FCR 1. In \nSebastian at [282], the Full Court referred to Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248; 97 FCR 32 at [162] with \napproval to observe that the requirement of occupation should be understood in the sense that Indigenous people \nhad traditionally occupied the land, rather than in the sense of occupation according to common law principles. Also \ndrawing from Hayes, their Honours said that use of country by claim group members in accordance with the way of \nlife, habits, customs and usages of the group is sufficient to indicate occupation. Their Honours contrasted this with \nwhat they described as \u201crandom\u201d or \u201ccoincidental\u201d use.  Another way to contrast the kind of use and presence which \nis sufficient for occupation is described by the Full Court in Moses at [216]:The word \u201coccupy\u201d is not defined in the \nNTA. It has a common meaning of being established in a place. In contemporary society, a person may occupy all \nof a house even though that person does not regularly enter every room and may never have entered a particular \nroom or a particular part of a room; a pastoralist may occupy all of the area of a pastoral lease even though that \nperson does not regularly visit every part of the area of the pastoral lease and may never have visited parts of it or \nhave used parts of it for pastoral purposes: see eg per Lord Denning in Newcastle City Council v Royal Newcastle \nHospital (1959) 100 CLR 1 at 4. In ss 47A and 47B, as the authorities point out, the context requires that the word \n\u201coccupy\u201d denotes some physical presence or activity by one or more members of the claim group from time to time, \nnot necessarily continuously, and a presence or activity in the area so that as a matter of practicality that presence \nor activity involves the assertion of being established over the area itself. The occupation must be \ncontemporaneous rather than historical. If the native title rights and interests over the area were exclusive, so there \nwas a right to control access to the area, the exercise of the right to exclude strangers from the area would indicate \nits occupation. To occupy an area under the NTA, given its purposes and context, involves the exercise of \npossessory rights over the area, but the exercise of those rights does not require their continuous exercise, or their \n\n\n\nexercise at the precise time of the application because the occupation of which ss 47A and 47B speak is a state of \naffairs which must exist rather than the precise activity which illustrates the existence of the state of affairs.  The \nconcept of \u201cbeing established in a place\u201d can be a useful approach.  The Full Court in Sebastian also emphasised \nat [282] that it was wrong to equate occupation with connection, while accepting that evidence given in relation to \nconnection may be relevant, and that traditional use may be more likely to amount to occupation than random or \ncoincidental use.  The State relies on a statement by the Full Court in Sebastian at [296] to the effect that walking \nacross an area will not establish occupation. I infer the State relies on statements of that kind in relation to the \nevidence in the current proceeding about the claim group members going to the s 47B areas for hunting, gathering \nemu eggs, visiting sites and the like. The Full Court\u2019s statement in Sebastian must be seen in the context of the \nevidence on the appeal in that case. It is instructive to look at the way the Full Court applied that observation, and \nthe general principles concerning occupation, to the evidence before it.  At [296] of Sebastian, the Full Court applied \nthe statement on which the State relies to six areas. It then went on to say that the evidence was \u201cmore substantial\u201d \nin relation to another two areas (without saying in what way), but did not disturb the trial judge\u2019s findings about \nthose areas. The Court then moved on (at [298]) to another area, Kennedy Hill. The Court, adopting some of the \nfindings of the trial judge, described the area in the following way (at [298]-[299]):The remaining areas are \ndescribed by the Yawuru claimants as small areas at Kennedy Hill. At [117], the primary judge described this land \nas 14 areas of walkways and drains in and around Broome. His Honour concluded that occupation had not been \nestablished:... The sparse evidence of usage relates to usage as a walkway by claim group members. It is not a \ntraditional usage and, more importantly, is not distinguishable from a likely similar usage by the public. Accordingly, \nthe requisite occupation has not been established.The Yawuru claimants argued that three of the fourteen areas \ndid not appear to be walkways or drains and that, although there was evidence that the claim group walked across \nthem, this did not reflect all of the evidence of occupation. They contended that these three areas are part of the \nKennedy Hill area, which is used by them because it is of particular significance.  The Full Court then referred to the \nevidence of four witnesses, the substance of which was that: Kennedy Hill was an important area for the Yawuru \npeople; Yawuru people had been going there for \u201cas long as [one witness could] remember\u201d; people camped in the \narea; and claim group members took tourists to Kennedy Hill, \u201c[took] care\u201d of the place, walked though it and came \n\u201cwhenever they please[d]\u201d. There was evidence that one witness\u2019s grandmother had lived at Kennedy Hill at some \nstage; that people went to the area to fish at the adjacent beach; that people may \u201cnap\u201d in the dunes behind; and \nthat on at least one occasion in the late 1980s or early 1990s, claim group members opposed the construction of a \nbuilding in the area. The Full Court then summarised the State\u2019s submission (at [304]):The State agreed that the \nevidence showed that the areas are considered important, that people drive and walk through them, that people \ncamp in them and that development of them was opposed but the State contended that this evidence was relevant \nto the issue of connection but did not establish occupation. The State argued that the primary judge took all the \nrelevant facts into account and determined the issue in accordance with the relevant principles.  The Full Court (at \n[305]) then rejected the State\u2019s submission and disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s finding:In our view, contrary to the \nview of the primary judge, the evidence established that the Yawuru claimants occupy the areas 2735, 2736 and \n2738 within the meaning of s 47B(1)(c). In accordance with the reasoning of the primary judge at [121], we infer that \nthey occupied the areas at the time of the application for a determination of native title in the same way as they \npresently occupy the areas.  In Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native \nTitle Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135; 145 FCR 442 at [193], the Full Court endorsed the following statement from \nthe Full Court in Ward (FC):The requirement of occupation in s 47A of the NT Act, which is the same as that in s \n47B, was considered by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FC 1. Their Honours considered that a broad view \nshould be taken of the word (at [449]):We think this requirement is met where a claimant member is one of many \npeople who share occupancy, and that the land may be relevantly occupied even though the person is rarely \npresent on the lands so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that \nperson wishes to do so.  As will be apparent from my findings below, I do not accept the State\u2019s submission that \nobservations such as that from Sebastian at [296] inevitably mean the rejection of the applicant\u2019s occupation claims \nin this proceeding.  As the authorities to which I have referred demonstrate, what will constitute, in any given factual \nsituation, claim group members \u201cbeing established in a place\u201d may include activities such as visiting, walking over \nthe area, and using the area. Activities of this kind may or may not be sufficient, depending on the facts. The sense \nof the authorities requires the Court to look at the evidence and decide whether, by their presence and use of it, \nclaim group members treated the land in question as their own.  Moreover, there is no reason in principle why use \nof the land for traditional activities cannot constitute occupation for the purposes of s 47B. In Banjima [2015] FCAFC \n\n\n\n84; 231 FCR 456 the Full Court said at [100]:Moore, North and Mansfield JJ in Moses at [207]-[208] approved \nOlney J\u2019s observation in Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248; (1999) 97 FCR 32 at [162] that the word \n\u201coccupy\u201d, as used in ss 47A and 47B, \u201cshould be understood in the sense that the indigenous people have \ntraditionally occupied land\u201d, that is in accordance with their traditional way of life, habits, customs and usages.  At \n[102], the Full Court emphasised the beneficial approach to be taken to s47B in the light of historical realities for \nAboriginal people:Often, indigenous people sought to maintain their connection to their country by working for \npastoralists or others who had come to hold the land and waters under land tenures granted pursuant to acts of the \nCrown after British sovereignty. In a real sense, the presence of those indigenous people and their families was \ncapable of being seen as occupation by them of their country or a part of it even though their presence, while \nlicensed by, say, the pastoralist, fell short of possession. In other cases, as history has demonstrated, pastoralists \nand others were prepared to allow, or involuntarily experienced, indigenous people passing over the land tenure \narea in their traditional ways. The historical activities of indigenous peoples maintaining their connection to their \ncountry have been varied and often necessarily adapted to sometimes hostile or difficult circumstances following \nEuropean settlement that restricted, or sought to restrict, both their access and their ability to access their country.\n\nUCL 239, UCL 245 and UCL 246 (north-west corner, formerly H91295 and 3114/551)    These parcels constitute \nwhat was previously Lake Mason station, held under pastoral leases H91295 and 3114/551. The pastoral leases \nwere surrendered between 2000 and 2003. UCL 245 includes the Mount Townsend and Mount Marion areas, and \nUCL 246 includes Granite Rock and Bungarra Rockhole. The on country hearing on Sunday, 2 August 2015 was \nheld in parts of UCL 246. The most southern parcel of the three is UCL 239, which includes Lake Mason and \nseveral other sites, including Snake Well.  The only witness to give evidence about UCL 239 was Mr Lewis. He is \nacknowledged by the claim group members as one of the people who can speak for the country in this area. It was \nhe who was responsible during the on country hearings for taking the Court to see the rock feature known as \u201cThe \nLady\u201d, and the area around it. That area is approximately 40 km south-east from UCL 239, on the Booylgoo Spring \npastoral lease. There was ample evidence from Mr Lewis about being in the area of The Lady, both for reasons \nrelated to looking after that area of country, and for hunting. None of those activities occurred in UCL 239 however. \nHe did give specific evidence about a trip to Snake Well, which is on UCL 239, on approximately 25 April 2015, with \nhis eldest son and two of his grandchildren. His evidence was he took them there camping and hunting. Two \nphotographs were in evidence showing his family hunting in the area of UCL 239 in 1988 and 1989.  Mr Lewis also \ngave evidence that in June or July 2015, not long before the on country hearing, he went hunting kangaroo in the \narea south-east of UCL 239:A couple of weeks ago I came hunting because when we was running around here I \nseen all the everlastings out, so I thought I\u2019d come and get some fat kangaroos from there, yes.  This, it seemed, \nwas something of an opportunistic visit, in the way Mr Lewis described it.  The State submits that the highest Mr \nLewis\u2019s evidence gets in relation to occupation at or around the relevant times (that is, either 17 June 2011 or 22 \nJune 2015) is that, on 25 April 2015, he camped and hunted on the area with his son and grandchildren. The State \ndescribes this as \u201cmere use or visitation\u201d, relying on Sebastian. The State also compares this evidence to the \nevidence before Barker J in Banjima (No 2) [2013] FCA 868; 305 ALR 1 (at [1272]) which the State submits his \nHonour described as \u201cpassing trips, visits and activities ... no doubt meaningful\u201d to the claim group members but \ninsufficient for \u201cbeing established\u201d over the area. I note that, at [1272], before the passage on which the State relies, \nBarker J made this finding:However, Mr Parker\u2019s evidence generally relates to various parts of the claim area, \nwhich over time, he has visited. Again, there is nothing wrong with that aspect of his evidence, as a Banjima man \nwith his extended family he has conducted activities on Banjima country. The difficulty is that it cannot easily be \ndrawn from the evidence exactly where and when those visitations or activities took place and the extent to which \nthose activities display a possessory nature.  The State appears to concede, in my opinion correctly, that Mr Lewis \ndemonstrated that, as a younger man, he spent time in and around the area of UCL 239. The State also correctly \nsubmits that Mr Lewis\u2019s evidence was not very clear on how frequent his historical use (in the 1960s, 1970s and \n1980s) was, and what use was made of UCL 239 in mid-2011 or mid-2015.  The State\u2019s submissions have force. \nThere is insufficient evidence to be satisfied that Mr Lewis\u2019s activities in UCL 239 meant that he was, as a claim \ngroup member, \u201cestablished\u201d in that area. I accept that when his father was alive, and he was a boy and a young \nman, the situation may have been different. Then, it seemed to me, the evidence was capable of demonstrating \nmuch more regular and extended presence in the area. But that was not the case in or around June 2011, nor June \n2015.  There was more evidence from the claim group members about UCL 245 and UCL 246 (the two more \nnorthern parcels) than there was about UCL 239. However, as the State\u2019s submissions identified, for the most part \n\n\n\nthat evidence amounted to a small number of visits, on a small number of occasions and, at least in some \ncircumstances, apparently in connection with this proceeding.  The evidence which fell into this category was the \nevidence of Mr Keith Narrier and Mr Bingham. Mr Keith Narrier visited the areas of UCL 245 and UCL 246 on 5 \nJune 2015 with his nephew Mr Richard Narrier, Jr. He described seeing emu tracks but did not go hunting. They \ndid look at the bush tucker around the area. He said:[W]e sat down and had a yarn about bush tucker and lit a fire \nand then we come back home. I told Richard where to light the fire, on a good bit of spinifex.\n\n ...\n\n We looked at the seeds from the grass where you grind him up and make a damper out of it. We looked at the \ntrees where you can get witchety grub, and where you dig them out from the ground; if you haven\u2019t got a crowbar \nthen you use a stick; that was the main thing they used in the old days.  As the State submits, Mr Narrier identified \nthis occasion as one on which \u201cwe were getting ready for the Judge\u201d, which was clearly a reference to preparation \nfor the on country hearing in this proceeding. That does not make his evidence irrelevant, but it does indicate that \nthe purpose he had to be in the area was a special one, rather than it being an ordinary visit to an area he was \naccustomed to going to.  Mr Bingham\u2019s evidence was that he had camped in the area at the Montague Mine. He \nrecalled the \u201cblack boy\u201d trees, and he said that this area was the \u201cthe only place in this country that you see them\u201d. \nHowever, as the State submits, he also said that this was on one occasion when he was at school, which most \nlikely would have placed his camping in the 1970s.  Mr Muir described three visits since approximately 2011. The \nearliest one involved what he described as taking a \u201cbus trip\u201d of people to the area in 2011 or 2012. In October \n2014, he was in the area on his way to visit family in Wiluna and Sandstone. He also described being in the area on \n21 June 2015 with his son, Karthi Muir, to visit Bungarra Rockhole, a site in UCL 246. Photos taken on that trip \nwere in evidence.  Mr Muir\u2019s evidence conveyed the impression of more regular presence by two pieces of \nevidence: first, that he did the trip down the Sandstone Wiluna Road approximately twice a year; and second, in the \nsame vein, his comment: \u201c[m]y family and I visit that country out near Montague Range quite regularly. It is one of \nthe back roads to Meekatharra and Sandstone so we travel through there\u201d.  It is correct that the Sandstone Wiluna \nRoad forms part of the western boundary of UCL 246, and the Meekatharra Yeelirrie road intersects that road to the \nnorth of the claim area, so that one way to get to Meekatharra would be to travel up the Sandstone Wiluna Road to \nthe north of the claim area, and then head west.  The State is correct to emphasise in its submissions that this \nevidence, together with Mr Muir\u2019s evidence about the bus trip, revealed that he travelled through the area. \nAccepting (as his evidence suggested) he may have stopped from time to time to do some bush food collection, \nhowever, he was travelling on public roads, and was doing so in order to reach other destinations. I do not consider \nthis constitutes any kind of real use of, or presence in, the area of the kind of which s 47B speaks.  As the \nauthorities have noted, frequency of presence on land claimed under s 47B is only one factor. If the evidence \nreveals that people go when they want to, then even if the presence is infrequent, that still may be enough for \noccupation, because it is the sense of possession and the assertion of it by presence when it suits people, or as \nthey consider it necessary or appropriate, which differentiates that situation from the situation of random or \ncoincidental visits, without a sense of purpose or entitlement.  This leaves the evidence of Mr Allan Ashwin and Mr \nVictor Ashwin. I focus on Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence, which in my opinion was more relevant. I consider the \nevidence that his son Mr Victor Ashwin gave was not inconsistent with his father\u2019s evidence, but it lacked sufficient \ndetail to be especially probative of occupation for the purposes of s 47B. Mr Allan Ashwin\u2019s evidence was, in my \nopinion, in a different category.  Mr Allan Ashwin worked all over the claim area, including at Lake Mason station. \nHe described Lake Mason in general terms as \u201cnot my country\u201d and, indeed, most of it is outside the claim area. It \nis clear Yeelirrie was one of the main places he identified with inside the claim area. Mr Ashwin spoke about the \nEmu Tjukurrpa back towards Meekatharra, and out near Youno Downs. He said: \u201c[t]hat thing from there goes right \nthrough inland ... right through this northern part of the area\u201d. The major activity Mr Ashwin associated with UCL \n245 and UCL 246 was the gathering of emu eggs. At [58] of his witness statement, he said:When I was young and I \nwas camping we would go out looking for emu eggs on weekends; out bush camping and that. In them days, old \nAunty Doris Foley used to have a horse and cart and we would go out and look around. We would go anywhere, \ntowards Altona or out towards Midnight bore or to Wiluna on the horse and cart, go along slowly looking for emu \neggs.  Heading to Altona or Midnight Bore would not have taken the family through UCL 245 or UCL 246, but \nheading to Wiluna may well have, depending on the route taken. As the State submits, at [64] of his witness \n\n\n\nstatement, Mr Ashwin describes looking for emu eggs in areas that do not go much west of Yeelirrie station. \nHowever, the Yeelirrie pastoral lease area borders UCL 246 (and UCL 239 below it), so it depends on how much \n\u201caround\u201d Yeelirrie Mr Ashwin was hunting.  Mr Ashwin spoke about visiting the north-west of the claim area, where \nthese UCL parcels are, for another purpose as well:You get sandalwood out there, in some parts of the country. \nOn 22 April 2015, I went to the north-west part of the Tjiwarl claim with my son Victor. We checked on some \nsandalwood there. The nuts you can use for sores, put them in the fire and crack them open and grind them into a \npaste. Or you can eat them, it\u2019s like a nut. The dry wood, you can burn it and it keeps the mosquitos away.  In his \noral evidence during the on country hearing held on UCL 246 \u2013 with Mount Townsend and Mount Marion in the \ndistance \u2013 Mr Ashwin was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:ALLAN ASHWIN: This is \ngood country for emu eggs.\n\n ...\n\n MR WRIGHT: So, is this \u2013 how do you get emu eggs in this sort of country?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Track \u2013 you follow the track and you know it\u2019s \u2013 you know, you track them and they\u2019ve got to go \n\u2013 either they\u2019ll go and feed and go to water and they\u2019ve always got to go back to the nest.\n\n ...\n\n MR WRIGHT: And what time of the year is a good time of year to get emu eggs?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: From \u2013 well, it depends, from March, April, it depends on the season, right up to about June, \nJuly, you know June, July, even late \u2013 late in August you can \u2013 the late ones are still laying.  As the State submits, \nMr Ashwin gave some evidence about looking for emu eggs around Yeelirrie, Albion Downs and Ullulla (the latter \nbeing outside the claim area to the north), with none of these areas being within UCL 245 or UCL 246. However, he \nwas specifically asked about these UCL parcels:MR WRIGHT: So, say in the last five years has this \u2013 how often \nwould you have done that, or have you done that sort of thing in the last five years?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Yes, I still do. Well, just last \u2013 I think it was last year I found down \u2013 from the crossroad down - \nfurther from down the crossroad we found the - not far off the road found the nest of emu egg. This was, you know \n\u2013 that was last year.\n\n MR WRIGHT: And how often do you think you\u2019ve come out in the last say, five years around this area, but where \nwe\u2019re sitting now?\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Well, we always come out, you know, and come out \u2013 well, it must be in the last five years I don\u2019t \nknow, plenty of times. It\u2019s nearly \u2013 nearly every \u2013 like every season, you know, like when the emu egg season we\u2019ll \nsort of go out in different ways, you know, and sometime come out here and check it all out, then go somewhere \nelse too, you know, to \u2013 like that.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Yes.\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: Yes, every year you go out \u2013 I go out and check out all the \u2013 you know, like where we \u2013 where \nwe always used to get emu eggs and that.\n\n MR WRIGHT: Yes.\n\n\n\n ALLAN ASHWIN: And go \u2013 every year go and check it all out, you know, check it out and see if we can find them.  \nIt is true, as the State submits, that it is unclear what might be the \u201ccrossroad\u201d to which Mr Ashwin referred. As I \nhave noted, just outside the claim area to north, close to Ullulla station and Ullulla community, there is a crossroad \nof the Sandstone Wiluna Road and the Meekatharra Yeelirrie Road. It seems probable, and I am prepared to infer, \nthis was the crossroad Mr Ashwin was referring to. When he says he found the emu eggs \u201cfurther down\u201d from the \ncrossroad, I am prepared to infer he meant to the south, which is heading towards the claim area and UCL 245 and \nUCL 246. As he said in his witness statement, and I have extracted elsewhere in these reasons, Mr Ashwin does \nnot speak by reference to (European) boundaries when he talks about his country, nor should he be expected to. \nHis evidence should also be considered in light of his written evidence that:At Yeelirrie they got a caretaker out \nthere, living at the homestead. Cameco Australia Pty Ltd owns it now. Most times you got to talk to them and give \nthem a ring or something like that if you want to go out. If you just stay on the main road then you don\u2019t worry about \nit, but if you\u2019re going off the main road then you should let them know about it; that you there.\n\n That\u2019s our country; we can go and do what we like there. We don\u2019t need to ask any other family groups. They \nwon\u2019t stop us, they know that it\u2019s right; that it\u2019s our country.  He also described, both in his written and oral \nevidence, how emu eggs are used and how, after eating the eggs, the shells are carved.  In my opinion, Mr \nAshwin\u2019s evidence shows that he has always considered \u2013 including in June 2011 and June 2015, being the \napplicable dates for s 47B \u2013 that he was entitled to go onto the areas in UCL 245 and UCL 246 to look for emu \neggs. His evidence was strong and clear about how regularly he went out looking for eggs in the season, which \nstretched out over almost half the year. The way he used that area was related to traditional activities, and was \nseasonal in nature. It is traditional occupation in the sense identified inBanjima [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at \n[100]: see [1231] above. I am satisfied that, even if Mr Ashwin and his family had full possessory rights over UCL \n245 and UCL 246 and had never lost them, they are likely to have used the land in the very same way as the \nevidence discloses. Those activities were by no means restricted to these UCL parcels, but in my opinion the \nauthorities do not suggest they need have been. They were also undertaken over the land covered by the Yeelirrie \npastoral lease, which abuts these UCL parcels. UCL 245 and UCL 246 are also close to, and associated with, the \nEmu Tjukurrpa that Mr Ashwin spoke of. I am satisfied that he felt entitled to go into these areas as and when he \npleased, that he considered them country he could go into, bearing in mind that it is only since 2000 when the Lake \nMason station closed that he would not have had to seek permission from those particular station owners.  Having \nhad the benefit of seeing Mr Ashwin and other claim group members in this area and how they used it, including for \nthe catching of kangaroos (as occurred during the on country hearing), it is my opinion that the claim group \nmembers do convey a sense of being established in this area. I also had the benefit of seeing how the senior men \nbehaved in this area during the restricted men\u2019s session.  To this, I would add the evidence of the other witnesses \nwhich, although it suffers from the weaknesses identified by the State in its submissions, confirms the importance of \nthe area as an area for hunting and bush tucker (especially emu eggs), which claim group members consider they \nare entitled to access as and when they wish to.  Viewed as a whole, in my opinion there is sufficient evidence for \nme to be satisfied that the claim group members, and especially Mr Allan Ashwin and his family, occupied the areas \nof UCL 245 and UCL 246 on 17 June 2011 and 22 June 2015, when the Tjiwarl #1 and #2 applications were \nrespectively lodged.\n\nUCL 14 and UCL 15 (Tjiwarl/Logan Spring)    These two UCL parcels cover the place of which this application \nbears the same name: Tjiwarl. The European name for this place is Logan Spring. This area also featured in the on \ncountry hearing, on 28 July 2015.  The evidence relied on by the applicant for occupation of these two UCL parcels \ncomes from Mr Muir, Mr Bingham, Ms Wonyabong and Mr James. Three of those witnesses gave evidence of visits \nto the area, sometimes on more than one occasion. Mr Muir\u2019s evidence was of a different nature and I consider it \nseparately. Mr Bingham described in his evidence how, although he had been to the location as a child and young \nperson, it was not until 24 April 2015 that he went there again. He recalled being shown the place by \u201cold blokes\u201d \nhe had been hunting with, and also by his sister. He described the area as being good for black goannas. In my \nopinion, his evidence is of little probative value, being a single visit shortly before this proceeding. The same can be \nsaid for Ms Wonyabong\u2019s evidence: although she described much more regular visits with the station owner of \nYakabindie, Mr Adamson, in the 1970s and 1980s, it is clear there was a long gap before she came back. I say that \nnot to suggest any diminution, for her or any other claim group members, in the significance of the site, but rather to \n\n\n\nobserve that she had not been able to physically return to the area for a long time. When she came in May and \nJune 2015 it was with CDNTS for the purposes of this proceeding. Visits of that kind cannot indicate occupation \nwithin the terms of s 47B.  Nor do I consider Mr James\u2019 evidence sufficient to establish occupation by him, although \nthe sincerity and depth of his connection to Tjiwarl was plain from his evidence. He described going to Tjiwarl \nfrequently around June 2011, when he was working for BHP Billiton. He worked for the company between 2009 and \n2012, and the nature of his role meant he was often out and about all over the claim area. This was his \nevidence:When I was working with BHP Nickel West I was on a roster and I was fully based at Mt Keith and my role \nmeant that I could go anywhere in this claim, wherever I needed to. Between 2009 and 2012, by reason of my \nposition at Nickel West as a social responsibility manager, I was actually one of the directors of a number of the \npastoral holdings in the claim area, including Albion, Yakabindie, Leinster Downs, Mt Keith and Weebo. When they \ndid surveys out on BHP Nickel West tenements, I would assist and support the coordination with the group and \nsometimes have the opportunity to go out on country with them as work allowed. It was a great opportunity to stay \nin touch with everybody.\n\n I left BHP Billiton at the end of 2012, I was permanently based there at that time and part of my role was in the \ncommunity relations sphere, so I often went out to Albion Downs to deal with the pastoralist at the time. I would try \nand go out to Logan Springs at least every day and sit on the granite rock and just relax there. That particular spot \nfor me is one of the most peaceful places I\u2019ve been to. I was working twelve hour days at that time and if I wanted to \nhave my lunch or something I would jump in the car and drive there because it was only a fifteen minute drive from \nthe mine site and go out there and sit on the rock for about thirty minutes. With modern technology, I could even \nbring my laptop there and answer my emails with my lunch while gazing off into the flats. It was the best working \nenvironment on the planet!  Mr James also described a plant found near Tjiwarl, which he would use:There are \nkarkula\u2019s there near Logan Springs, which I would have been eating in June 2011. There is also a particular plant \nthere that has a lemongrass smell and when I was growing up we would use it to crush it up and smell it, it was like \na natural deodorant and it can also be used for sores and other medical reasons. I would have been using that \nwhen I went to Logan Springs on my lunch breaks in June 2011. I used to take it back on the plane for my family, \nwhen I had to return to Perth.  Mr James then described a sign that had been erected at Tjiwarl by BHP Billiton, and \nhis attitude towards it:There\u2019s a sign there at Logan Springs that says, \u201cDo not enter\u201d but I just ignore that. People \nwouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting those places in the [Tjiwarl] claim. If they tried to, I would just ignore them, but it just \nnever happened. I don\u2019t feel threatened or challenged by anyone because I have as much right to be there as \nanyone, it\u2019s where I spent my childhood and where my father is from.  This evidence demonstrates that for a period \nof time coinciding with the lodgement of Tjiwarl #1, Mr James was a regular visitor to Tjiwarl, and that the area \nmeant a great deal to him. However, he was not going there for any reason that had to do with asserting or \nexercising any possessory rights over the area, and I contrast this with the evidence from Mr Allan Ashwin about \nUCL 245 and UCL 246 in particular. Rather, Mr James was revisiting a favourite place on his country to have his \nlunch, and get some peace and quiet. His evidence about the BHP sign made it clear he considered it did not apply \nto him, and that is some evidence of entitlement, I accept. Overall, I consider this kind of activity had an \nopportunistic character to it, which is insufficiently consistent with the concept of occupation under s 47B.  There \nwas some evidence and submissions about the \u201c[d]o not enter\u201d sign erected at Tjiwarl by BHP Billiton, and to whom \nit was directed: that is, whether to claim group members as well as to tourists or other locals. I consider that issue to \nbe marginal on the question of occupation for the purpose of s 47B. The evidence did not rise to the level of any \naction taken by BHP to keep people out and I do not consider, in the context of a native title claim, that the erection \nof a sign by a mining company is probative one way or the other of entitlements to land.  That leaves the evidence \nof Mr Muir, who described living in a caravan at Tjiwarl for eight months in the early 1990s. His evidence was that \nhe also went to Logan Spring on 20 May 2015 with an anthropologist and then again on 3 June 2015. While \nevidence of a claim group member having lived on the Tjiwarl site for a period of eight months may well have been \nevidence of the kind to satisfy s 47B(1)(c), the timing of Mr Muir\u2019s residence there is not consistent with the \nrequirements of the provision. If, since that time, he had maintained a regular presence or regularly gone to camp \nthere, or something of that nature, then in combination it may well have been enough. However, isolated to a period \nin the 1990s with only two subsequent visits for quite different purposes, it is insufficient for the applicant to \ndischarge their burden in relation to Tjiwarl under s 47B.\n\n\n\nUCL 247 (south of Mail Change Well)    This area is just south of what is known as Mail Change Well, which itself is \nnorth of Yakabindie station in the east of the claim area. Evidence in support of the occupation claim for this small \narea comes from Mr Bingham and Mr Muir. Each gives evidence of a single visit in April and May 2015 respectively. \nThis evidence is plainly insufficient for the purposes of s 47B.\n\nPart of UCL 11 (Yakabindie)    UCL 11 is the parcel of land on which the homestead of Yakabindie station is \nsituated. The Court held part of the on country hearing on this site on 29 July 2015. How the homestead block \ncame to be unallocated Crown land and not part of the pastoral lease was not explained in the evidence.  There \nare two key pieces of evidence about the occupation of this UCL.  The first comes from Ms Wonyabong, who \nmoved to a house at Yakabindie in 1976 or 1977. The Court saw her house, which is perhaps 50 m to one side of \nthe main homestead. Although she described the house as \u201ctoo old\u201d and full of white ants and so not really \nhabitable, in her oral evidence she claimed an ongoing entitlement to live in it nevertheless:Dominion wrote a letter, \nsaid I can stay here long as I like.  Other witnesses, such as Mr Edwin Beaman, described going to visit Ms \nWonyabong there. Ms Wonyabong moved out in the 1980s or 1990s. However, she gave evidence that, at the time \nof the on country hearing, another claim group member, Creamy Allison, lived on another house at Yakabindie \nstation and had done so for 20 years. Ms Narrier and Mr Muir confirmed this. Mr Allison\u2019s house, which is about 70 \nm away from the main homestead, on the other side of the homestead driveway, was pointed out to the Court \nduring the on country hearing.  The State relies on the findings of Merkel J in Rubibi (No 7) at [98], where his \nHonour rejected a claim for occupation of an area under s 47A, finding that residence in one of two houses on an \narea by a claim group member was not sufficient to establish occupation of the whole area. This finding was made \nin relation to an area in Broome called Walcott Street and identified as \u201cArea 354\u201d. It was a freehold block held by \nthe Mamabulanjin Aboriginal Corporation, and there were two houses on it, only one of which was occupied by a \nclaim group member. Merkel J found that occupation for the purposes of s 47A(2) had to apply to the whole area, \nand since only one of the two houses was occupied by a claim group member, that was insufficient.  There is no \ndoubt that Mr Allison, a claim group member, occupied part of UCL 11 at 17 June 2011 but whether also at 22 June \n2015 is unclear. Ms Narrier\u2019s evidence about him having to go to Geraldton and Meekatharra for \u201chis eyes\u201d was, as \nthe State submits, somewhat hard to follow, and it was second-hand hearsay, coming from one Malcolm Shay \nwhom Ms Narrier told the Court was currently living in the house. There is no evidence whether Mr Shay is a claim \ngroup member. Mr Muir also gave evidence about Mr Allison living in the house. On balance, I am prepared to find, \nin the applicant\u2019s favour, that Mr Allison still \u201coccupied\u201d the house in June 2015, even if from time to time for medical \nreasons he was absent, perhaps for long periods.  There is no doubt Ms Wonyabong had occupied another part of \nUCL 11 for a significant period of time until the 1980s or 1990s, and it may be the case (the State did not dispute \nher evidence) that she could, theoretically, move back into her house there if it were habitable, on the basis that the \nlessee of the Yakabindie pastoral lease had no objection (although, if the land is Crown land, it is difficult to see \nwhat role, other than a practical one, there was for the opinion of the pastoral lessee). The difficulty is that the main \nYakabindie homestead is very much occupied by those responsible for managing Yakabindie station. Their tenure \nwas also not explained in the evidence. It was clear from the on country hearing that the station managers use all \nthe sheds and other buildings in this UCL parcel. They do not appear to use Ms Wonyabong\u2019s house, but it is \nagreed to be basically unusable. They clearly give Mr Allison his space and privacy. Mr Allison\u2019s tenure was not \nexplained in the evidence either.  Therefore, the evidence is that, over what is a fairly small parcel of land, being \nessentially the homestead block for Yakabindie station, there were two claim group members who considered they \nhad, and whom others accepted had, possessory rights to part of that area. On the evidence neither asserted, or \nwas recognised as having, possessory rights over the whole of the homestead block. The State submits this is the \ndeterminative factor. There have been long-term non-Aboriginal occupants of this area of land: on the agreed facts, \nYakabindie was established by 1928 and I infer the homestead has been in existence for many decades.  If \nmembers of the native title claim group need to be \u201cestablished\u201d over the whole area of a UCL parcel, rather than \npart of it, then the occupation by Ms Wonyabong and Mr Allison \u2013 essentially coexisting with those non-Aboriginal \npeople who have occupied the Yakabindie homestead block \u2013 would be insufficient for the purposes of s 47B. \nHowever, the applicant appears to advance an argument that s 47B could apply to such parts of a UCL parcel.  As I \nnoted at [1216] above, in the context of the disapplying provisions in s 47B(1)(b), the applicant made a submission \nto the effect that if the Court found one of the permissions or authorities relied on by the State disapplied s 47B(2), \nthen the disapplying effect should only extend to so much of the land as the permission or authority covered. I noted \nthat it was not necessary for me to determine this argument because I had not accepted the State\u2019s arguments that \n\n\n\nany of the disapplying provisions in s 47B(1)(b) applied to the UCL parcels in contention under s 47B.  What I have \ndescribed as the \u2018mirror\u2019 of this point does arise for consideration in the context of the facts as I have found them in \nrelation to the occupation of UCL 11, the Yakabindie homestead block.  The applicant touched on this briefly in their \nextinguishment submissions:The Applicants submit that occupation has been established over the whole of each \nindividual 47B Area. However if the Court finds in respect of any individual 47B Area that occupation is established \nover part but not the whole of that 47B Area, then the Applicants submit that s.47B(2) applies to disregard prior \nextinguishment over that part of the individual 47B Area in respect of which occupation has been established. On \nthe other hand, what was said in previous cases, and referred to in Banjima FFC at [103], should not be taken as \nmeaning that s.47B(2) does not apply to disregard extinguishment in respect of any part of an individual 47B Area \nin circumstances where occupation has been established over some but not all of the 47B Area. Such an \ninterpretation would be inconsistent with the beneficial interpretation that should be given to s.47B (as referred to in \nBanjima FFC [88]-[92]), and with the fact that occupation by Aboriginal persons is unlikely to correspond to the \nprecise cadastral boundaries of the various non-native title interests that have been granted in the Claimed Area \nand which have resulted in the boundaries of the individual 47B Areas.  In my opinion, there is force in the \napplicant\u2019s submission. The use of the term \u201carea\u201d in s 47B is not suggestive of a meaning which ties the word \nrigidly to cadastral boundaries. That is re-enforced by the use of the verb \u201ccovered\u201d, which suggests there need not \nbe complete overlap between the \u201carea\u201d over which any reservation etc is made and the \u201carea\u201d that is occupied by \nmembers of a native title claim group. Clearly there must be some overlap, for the disapplying effect of s 47B(1)(b) \nto have work to do. However, as the terms of s 47B(1)(b)(ii) itself make clear, the reservation etc may apply to only \npart of the land. This point was also made by the Full Court in Banjima [2015] FCAFC 84; 231 FCR 456 at [99]:And, \nin the case of a parcel that is affected only in part, as contemplated in s 47B(1)(b)(ii), the exclusion affects only the \npart meeting the criterion, so that the balance of the land or waters in the area or parcel not within the satisfied \ncriterion, is still subject to the application of s 47B(2).  One can readily see how this argument could be applied to a \nparcel of land under one title which was of a considerable size. One can also readily see how it might apply to land \nused for pastoral purposes where there has been a claim group member living on a small part of that land. Here, \nthe circumstances are rather different. Two members of the native title claim group \u2013 separately, on different parts \nof the homestead block \u2013 have been coexisting. One has continued to do so (Mr Allison) and one (Ms Wonyabong) \ngave unchallenged evidence she had been recognised as entitled to continue to live there.  Nevertheless, to apply s \n47B(2), accepting it should be applied beneficially, appears to produce a result that is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s \napproach in Rubibi (No 7).  Since the matter was only briefly addressed by the parties, and not expressly in relation \nto the Yakabindie homestead block, I propose to give the parties an opportunity to make further submissions on this \nissue, in accordance with the findings of fact I have made.\n\nParts of UCL 4, UCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10 (Sir Samuel)    As the State submits, these parcels of land are physically \nseparated from UCL 11, being a short distance south of the Yakabindie homestead, and to the west of the \nGoldfields Highway. The town of Sir Samuel, now gone, was where these parcels of land are found and the State \nsubmits, and I accept, that these parcels formed part of the common surrounding the Sir Samuel town site. The \nReserve (number 8210) was cancelled in 1991.  Aside from the evidence in relation to UCL 11, which the applicant \nrelies on, Mr Muir gave evidence that he visited this land with an anthropologist on 20 May 2015.  I do not consider \nthat the evidence about UCL 11 demonstrates any establishment over these other UCL parcels. Mr Muir\u2019s evidence \ndoes not advance the applicant\u2019s case. The applicant has not made out occupation of these parcels.\n\nUCL 8 (Corner Leinster Downs and Booylgoo Spring)    This small area of land lies between three pastoral station \nboundaries (Yakabindie, Booylgoo Spring and Leinster Downs), to the west of Lake Miranda. Lake Miranda is itself \nsouth of Yakabindie and Sir Samuel. The only evidence relied upon for this area is the same evidence relied upon \nfor UCL 11 (Yakabindie) and UCL 4, UCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10 (the former Sir Samuel townsite). There being no \nspecific evidence at all about occupation of \u201cthe area\u201d for the purposes of s 47B (not even as part of a larger area), \nthis claim cannot succeed. Ms Wonyabong gave no specific evidence about this area, despite having lived very \nclose to it for a long period of time. Those witnesses who gave more general evidence about UCL 11 (such as Mr \nEdwin Beaman) gave no evidence about areas to the west of Yakabindie, but rather about areas to the east, such \nas Wanjarri Reserve, where Mr Beaman said he went emu egg collecting.\n\n\n\nUCL 240 (Vivien)    Vivien is an area very close to the southern boundary of the claim area, south-west of the \nmining town of Leinster. There is a site known as \u201cWorrunga\u201d which is close to this UCL. \u201cWorrunga\u201d (which is how \nit is spelt on the applicant\u2019s site map) is also spelt as \u201cWaranga\u201d in the claim group members\u2019 evidence. The Lewis \nfamily and the Hogarth family both lived for some considerable period of time at camps at Waranga and Vivien \nrespectively, which I understand the State does not dispute are on UCL 240, or at least include UCL 240.  This was \nMr Lewis\u2019s evidence:I also lived at Waranga camp, near the Vivien mine. In the 1980s, I lived there at an old camp. \nMy parents would camp around through there. I grew two kids up there, Leigth and Tara in the early 1980s, before \nmoving to town. We stopped out there while I was working shearing, until we got housing in town. I was about 23 or \n24 years old at the time. There was no water there in those days, so we spent a lot of time carting water. There was \nno running water, no electricity; it was like the stone age. My dad was there with us, at the time. My mum and dad \nwere old but they went bush all the time. We got lots of bush tucker, goanna and that.  Mr Lewis stated that there \nwere other people at another camp close by, but the only person he named was not from this country but from \naround Mullewa.  Mr Lewis gave evidence about taking his son and grandchildren back to the camp in April 2015 \nand making another trip there in June 2015, but otherwise he gave no evidence of having been back there since he \nleft in the 1980s.  Ms Narrier gave some evidence about visiting the Vivien camp in June 2015, and identified it as \n\u201cthe old camp for Mr and Mrs Lewis, Brett\u2019s mum and dad\u201d.  Ms Geraldine Hogarth\u2019s family also had a camp at \nVivien:I might have been about 15 or 16 years old when we were going out with Scotty Lewis around Agnew. That\u2019s \nwhen he took me to show where they were going to put the Leinster town. He showed me the two rockholes there \non that trip. We went everywhere around Agnew with pop Scotty Lewis. We\u2019d go south coming back towards \nLeonora. Or we\u2019d take a road through Poison Creek to cut through to get to Darlot.\n\nJamu Scotty also showed me Daisy Pool, not far from Vivien. We had a camp at Vivien. That\u2019s where Scotty lived; \nhe made a camp there. I used to go there on holidays and weekends, and my mum stayed there too. It was a big \nwater place at Daisy Pool, and people around there because there was water. He was taking me and other \nmembers of my family around places in the country there right up until I was in my twenties.\n\n When we were camping around in that country at Vivien, like from the 1980s, it was me, mum, my sisters, and the \nkids \u2013 my daughter and Leanne\u2019s children. We\u2019d go there on the weekends, or when I had time off from work. But \nmum stayed out there a lot, on and off. One time, Aunty Gladys Bingham was with us, and uncle Eddie Redmond \nwould pull in from time to time. Aunty Gay Harris and Aunty Cecily Harris [deceased] they would pull in and visit that \ncamp too.\n\n We still go out to that Tjiwarl claim area. We go out and check the country. We go to Vivien to check our camp. \nWhen we go to funerals in Wiluna, we also go to Pii. We show the kids that place. We want to show them the water \nplace because we want to show them how the water can still be found. We like to show the kids the rockholes and \ngnamma holes. I last went to Pii in 2014.  I have quoted this extract from Ms Hogarth\u2019s evidence at some length \nbecause the parties\u2019 submissions did not do it justice. Ms Hogarth\u2019s evidence made it clear that people from several \nfamily groups within the claim group used to camp at Vivien. Her evidence does not descend into detail about when \npeople stopped living (whether full-time or from time to time) at the camp, but I infer it was the late 1980s. Ms \nHogarth\u2019s evidence was that she and her family still went and \u201ccheck[ed]\u201d the camp, but she gave no detail about \nhow often this occurred, or when they last visited.  There is insufficient contemporary evidence of any member of \nthe claim group \u201cbeing established\u201d at Vivien, despite its obvious historical importance as a place where several \nclaim group families used to camp and live. The visits which have occurred in more recent times did not have any \npossessory characteristics to them; rather they were opportunities to show younger people where and how their \nelders had lived, or to \u201ccheck\u201d on the place, as Ms Hogarth put it, in the same way she described the responsibility \nto look after, and keep an eye on, other places in the claim area which were of importance to claim group members. \nHowever, discharging those care responsibilities is not the same thing as occupation for the purposes of s 47B. \nThis occupation claim is not made out.\n\n\n\nRoad 13    This road is in the south-west corner of the claim area. It runs from a place called O\u2019Hara\u2019s Well in a \nsouth-westerly direction towards the claim boundary and a place called Willow Well, very close to the southern \nclaim boundary. It appears to run through Depot Springs.  I have found at [1192] above that there was no prior \ninterest created in this UCL area, in a way which triggers the operation of s 47B(2), and I have rejected the \napplicant\u2019s claim under s 47B on that basis. Even if, contrary to my conclusion, the applicant were able to make a \nclaim under s 47B for this parcel of land, I do not consider the applicant has proven that a claim group member or \nmembers occupied the land in either 2011 or 2015.  It is correct, as the applicant submits, that Mr Lewis gave some \nevidence about going hunting in July 2015 in this region, which he described as \u201cback between O\u2019Hara\u2019s and \nLangford\u2019s back where we just came from and further up here, Belleview and Quartz where we\u2019re going\u201d. However, \nso far as the evidence discloses, I am unable to be satisfied (in contrast to my satisfaction about UCL 245 and UCL \n246) that the area he was talking about included the UCL Road 13, nor what use was made of the UCL area in \ntimes more approximate to the native title application, aside from one hunting trip.  The applicant relies on evidence \nfrom Ms Narrier about a place called Gums Well, which is on Road 13, being the location for the story for the white \ncockatoo. Mr Muir gave similar evidence, although his evidence appeared to place the story further to the west. I do \nnot consider this evidence assists in proving occupation of Road 13: rather, it indicates some knowledge of the \narea, but no more than that.\n\nFindings on s 47B for each UCL area  \n\nUCL 239, UCL 245 and UCL 246 (north-west corner)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration \nlicences which cover these areas disapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has proved occupation of \nUCL 245 and UCL 246, but not of UCL 239.\n\nUCL 14 and UCL 15 (Tjiwarl/Logan Spring)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration licences \nwhich cover these areas disapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has not proved occupation of UCL \n14 and UCL 15.\n\nUCL 247 (south of Mail Change Well)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration licences which \ncover this area disapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has not proved occupation of UCL 247.\n\nPart of UCL 11 (Yakabindie)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration licences which cover this \narea disapply the terms of s 47B. I have allowed the parties a further opportunity for submissions on the application \nof s 47B(2) to the relevant part of UCL 11.\n\nParts of UCL 4, UCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10 (Sir Samuel)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration \nlicences which cover these areas disapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has not proved occupation \nof parts of UCL 4, UCL 5, UCL 6 and UCL 10.\n\nUCL 8 (Corner Leinster Downs and Booylgoo Spring)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration \nlicences which cover this area disapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has not proved occupation of \nUCL 8.\n\nUCL 240 (Vivien)  I have found that none of the miscellaneous or exploration licences which cover this area \ndisapply the terms of s 47B. I have found the applicant has not proved occupation of UCL 240.\n\nRoad 13  I have found that s 47B(2) is not applicable to Road 13. If, contrary to my opinion, s 47B(2) is applicable, \nthen I have found that the applicant has not proved occupation of Road 13.\n\nOVERALL CONCLUSION AND APPROPRIATE ORDERS    The matter raised by the applicant in its addendum to \nits written submissions on the existence of native title contends that the form of any determination made should take \ninto account the multiple pathways through which Western Desert people may acquire rights and interests in land \nand waters. As I understand this contention, its effect would be not to limit the native title holding group to those \npeople who are descended from one or more of the named apical ancestors. This is a matter the parties should \nhave some time to consider and see if they can reach agreement, in light of the Court\u2019s reasons for judgment.  As I \nhave noted at [1285] above, I consider it appropriate to allow the parties a further opportunity for submissions on \nthe application of s 47B(2) to the Yakabindie homestead block, UCL 11, in light of my findings concerning \n\n\n\noccupation.  There will be directions to the effect that the parties confer and draw up proposed minutes of orders \nand a determination in accordance with the Court\u2019s reasons.\n\n                 \n\nI certify that the preceding one thousand, three hundred and twelve (1312) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of \nthe Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mortimer.         \n"}
