{"title": "Cuban Ballplayers Await Word on Visas", "body": "\nFour Cuban baseball players held at an immigrant center in the Bahamas awaited a formal invitation from Costa \nRica offering refuge.\n\nThe players hoped to receive word soon that Costa Rica had granted humanitarian visas, said associates of a \nMiami-based Cuban-American sports agent working to free the players. The four fled Communist-ruled Cuba on a \nsmall boat last week.\n\nOfficials at the detention center said Tuesday that more than 150 Cubans held there had gone on a hunger strike to \nprotest alleged preferential treatment given to the baseball players.\n"}
