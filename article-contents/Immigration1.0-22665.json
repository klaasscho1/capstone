The bias, she \nsaid, occurs in the United States.\n\nEconomics professor Shelley White-Means of the University of Tennessee at Memphis said the study adds to the \ngrowing body of evidence that there is a \"preference for whiteness\" in America that goes beyond race.\n\nConscious bias?\n\nHersch drew her data from a 2003 federal survey of almost 8,600 new immigrants. The survey used an 11-point \nscale for measuring skin tone, in which 0 represents an absence of color and 10 the darkest possible skin tone.\n\nFrom those nearly 8,600 participants, she focused on the more than 2,000 who were working and whose skin tone \nhad been recorded during face-to-face interviews.\n\nIt is not clear whether the bias is conscious or subconscious, said William Darity Jr., of the University of North \nCarolina,.\n\nHersch said her findings, which will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science next month in San Francisco, could support discrimination lawsuits based not on race, but \non color.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO\n\n PHOTO - Hersch \n"}
