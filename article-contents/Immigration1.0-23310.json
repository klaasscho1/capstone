{"title": "Cobb Opinions: TELL US: Share thoughts on border watch groups forming here", "body": "\nThe border-watching Minuteman Civil Defense Corps made its metro Atlanta debut Sunday at a Cobb pub. \nMinuteman organizer Todd Walker told 40 or so people that the influx of illegal immigrants is an invasion \nsponsored by Mexico.\n\n\"Our administration . . . is doing nothing to stop it. Actually, they're encouraging it,\" Walker said. (\"Minutemen march \nfar from border,\" AJC Metro News, Feb. 26).\n\nNamed for the militia that fought the British in the Revolutionary War, the Minutemen entered the national spotlight \ntwo years ago as a citizens group patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border and reporting illegal crossings.\n\nCelebrated by those who believe they exposed the U.S. Border Patrol's inadequacy, the Minutemen have also \nearned critics who say they fan anti-immigrant sentiments and use inflammatory language.\n\nThe North Atlanta chapter is the third Minuteman group to form in Georgia in the past two months, joining the \nNorthwest Georgia and Athens Area chapters.\n\nOrganizers say they are developing plans that could include surveillance of day labor pickup sites, protests at banks \ncatering to illegal immigrants and rallies at city council and county commission meetings.\n\nWhat do you think about the formation of such groups in metro Atlanta? Please explain. Send comments to \ncobbletters@ajc.com and include your full name, community and a daytime phone number.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: ELISSA EUBANKS / StaffEric Svenson awaits the start of the organizational meeting of the Minuteman \ngroup's North Atlanta chapter.</ImageData*\n"}
