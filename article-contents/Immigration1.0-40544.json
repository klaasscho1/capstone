{"title": "U.S. to revoke all Haitian visas", "body": "\nThe Clinton administration plans to revoke the U.S. visas of virtually all  Haitian passport holders in an attempt to \nfurther isolate Haiti's military  rulers and their wealthy supporters who regularly travel to and from the  United \nStates, according to senior diplomats.\n\nThe action, which could come as early as this week, would be the latest in  a series of U.S. economic and political \nsanctions targeted specifically  against those Haitians who have backed the military regime.\n\nBecause of their wealth and U.S. connections, Haiti's pro-army elite have  largely been immune from the \ninternational trade embargo that has hurt the  impoverished Caribbean nation's population.\nCompiled from Times WiresHAITI-SENATO\n\nHaiti's rich are frequent visitors to the United States, particularly South  Florida, where many have extensive \nfinancial holdings and real estate and  business connections.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday imposed an expanded freeze on the U.S.  assets of all Haitian citizens living in \nHaiti. Only the wealthiest Haitians  would be affected by the freeze, which was written to exclude Haitian exiles \n such as President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his supporters.\n\nThe new visa policy effectively would revoke the visas of any Haitians who  do not hold U.S. passports. No new \nvisas would be issued or honored except in  the case of asylum-seekers and a handful of exceptions, the diplomats \nsaid.\n\nThe visa freeze would put the finishing touches on the Clinton  administration's efforts to quarantine the Haitian \nmilitary officers who  ousted Aristide in a September 1991 coup and reneged on a promise to restore  him in \nOctober, the diplomats said. Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, is  living in exile in the United States.\n\nThe administration has been increasing international pressure on the  military rulers in hopes of forcing them to step \ndown and averting possible  U.S. military action to restore Aristide to office.\n\nThe steps include a worldwide trade embargo, a freeze on all Haitian assets  in the United States and a U.S.-led \nban on commercial air traffic to Haiti,  which takes effect Saturday.\n\nU.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said he could not comment on the  freeze on U.S. visas, which are \nheld by thousands of wealthy Haitians.\n\nSupporters of Aristide welcomed the latest U.S. steps.\n\n\n\"The embargo is finally serious,\" said Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul,  an Aristide ally who has long criticized the \ninternational sanctions for  hurting the poor and leaving loopholes for the rich. \"The psychological  pressure is very \nstrong. If they refuse to leave, the only means left to oust  them is military intervention.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Haiti banned Florida Sen. Bob Graham from entering the country  because of his call for U.S. military \nintervention there.\n\n\"He cannot come here and recommend military action against Haiti,\" a  government spokesman said.\n\nTwo U.S. journalists were detained briefly for visiting the coastal city of  Gonaives without authorization. Reporter \nJose de Cordoba of the Wall Street  Journal and freelance photographer Maggie Steber were arrested but later \n returned to their hotel in Port-au-Prince, the Journal said.\n"}
