{"title": "Immigrants Congest, and Improve, Our Towns", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWest Windsor, a township in central New Jersey, has many of the McMansions and immigrants that Paul Krugman \ndescribes in \"My Beautiful Mansionette\" (column, May 23). \n\n     We also have elected our first Chinese-American mayor, Shing-Fu Hsueh; he ran on a platform of controlling \ngrowth and preserving some of our natural environment. \n\n Land management and traffic flow are problems that require innovation. While immigrants may swell our towns, \nthey also add creativity and suggest novel solutions to our problems. \n\nAs in past generations, the diversity of America will be our strength.\n\nSANDRA SHAPIRO\n\nPrinceton Junction, N.J.\n\nMay 23, 2001\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
