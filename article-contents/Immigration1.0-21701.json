social media.\n\nLove Lamb Week (1-7 September) was created by Cumbrian sheep farmer Rachel Lumley in 2015 and has grown \ninto an industry-wide initiative involving the AHDB, the National Sheep Association, the NFU, Red Tractor, meat \npromotion body HCC in Wales, the Livestock and Meat Commission for Northern Ireland, and Quality Meat \nScotland.\n\nIt aims to increase awareness and sales of lamb among UK consumers and this year the focus is on the seasonality \nand sustainability of lamb production.\n\nSee also: Young sheep farmers share tips on year-round lamb marketing\n\nTo support the campaign, share your lamb and sheep farming pictures and stories online using #LoveLamb and \n#LoveLambWeek.\n\nWe\u2019ve picked some of the best Twitter posts as Love Lamb Week begins:\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nArla Group\u2019s board of directors has proposed paying out 2018\u2019s entire net profit to its European farmer owners \nfollowing the difficulties experienced by producers during this summer\u2019s drought.\n\nThe motion has been facilitated by a strong showing in Arla\u2019s half-year results, with Arla UK increasing net revenue \nby 2.3% in the first half of the year to \u00a3961m.\n\nSee also: Advice on winter feeding dairy animals amid forage shortages\n\n\u201cWe are proposing that extraordinary measures be taken in this situation, and the board is satisfied with the positive \ndevelopment of the company's balance sheet, which makes this proposal possible,\" said Arla Foods chairman Jan \nToft N\u00f8rgaard.\n\nA final decision on the proposals is expected in February 2019, and if approved would be paid out the following \nmonth in line with the regular supplementary payment in March.\n\n\nSize of proposal\n\nThe size of the proposal is predicted to be worth 2-2.2p/litre (2.3-2.5EURc/kg milk) to each of Arla\u2019s 12,000 \nEuropean dairy farmers, provided full-year profits of 285-310m (\u00a3256-279m) are achieved this year.\n\nArla usually appropriates some of its end of year profits into a 13th extra payment to producers, with the rest of the \nprofits reinvested into consolidation within the business.\n\nHowever, this motion proposes deviating from the company\u2019s usual proposal for one year in light of the difficult \nmarket conditions experienced by dairy farmers across Europe.  \n\nArla half-year results key points compared with H1 2017\n\nMilk price down 3% to 35.8EURc/kg (31p/litre)\n\nMilk volume no change at 7bn kg (6.8bn litres)\n\nProfit share for farmer-owners up 1 percentage point to 2.2% of revenue\n\nUK revenue up 3.3% to \u00a3961m\n\nEuropean revenue up 2% to 5.1bn (\u00a34.6bn)\n\n\"Our balance sheet has improved significantly over the last few years, and the strength of our balance sheet makes \nroom for this extraordinary initiative while still maintaining our investment plans for the continued future growth of \nthe company,\u201d said CEO of Arla Foods, Peder Tuborgh.\n\n\u201cIf the board's proposal is approved, our financial ratios are expected to remain within the target range, provided \nthere is a firm commitment by the BoR to return to the agreed retainment policy after 2018,\u201d he says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDespite having no background in computer software, farmer Matt Reimer, based in Manitoba, Canada, has \nmanaged to rig up an autosteer system that allows his 220hp John Deere 7930 and 24t grain cart to drive itself to \nand from the combine without anyone in the cab.\n\nThis nifty, labour-saving project is indicative of farmers\u2019 growing confidence to self-build GPS systems that are \nmuch cheaper than off-the-shelf options or can provide something that\u2019s not currently available on the market.\n\nBroad-acre autonomy of this type remains pretty sparse, not because it is difficult to develop but due to the civil \nliability associated with leaving high-horsepower machinery to operate without a driver.\n\nThat has left the door open to have-a-go farmers, many of whom are using open-source computer programmes as \ntheir starting point.\n\nThis free-to-use software provides basic GPS programming and, with very little altering, allows users to wire it to a \nGPS receiver to get basic guidance through a standard tablet computer.\n\nThe beauty of open source is that it can be adapted to all sorts of autonomous tasks and gave Mr Reimer the \nsoftware navigation algorithms he needed to make a start on his own driverless system.\n\nDuring the course of a winter he managed to merge GPS receivers, controllers and a mass of wiring loom that \nmade it possible to call the waiting tractor to his Claas Lexion 780 combine whenever he\u2019s ready to unload.\n\nSee also: Farmers build ultra-accurate GPS system on a budget\n\nGetting started\n\n\n\n\u201cGrain carting is one of the easiest places to get started with driverless tractors as there\u2019s no need for loads of \nsensors and it can always be monitored from the combine,\u201d says Mr Reimer.\n\nHis first attempt was a fairly Heath Robinson setup that used lots of little actuators to move the necessary controls.\n\nHowever, with a bit more fiddling he has been able to intervene between the tractor\u2019s switches/levers and its \nCanbus system, instead routing the information through his Pixhawk controller so that he can send his own signal to \nthe Canbus without having to touch any buttons in the tractor cab.\n\nThis saved him the laborious task of tapping into the tractor\u2019s management software and deciphering the data it \ncarries through a painstaking process of elimination, most of which he doesn\u2019t need to tamper with anyway.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe first part of the driverless puzzle is provided by an autopilot system typically found on remote control \naeroplanes. The run-of-the-mill hardware is built by a company called Pixhawk and, like most of the components \ninvolved, can be found pretty cheaply online or at electronic parts stores.\n\nThe Pixhawk controller takes information from an Arduino minicomputer to direct the tractor to particular GPS co-\nordinates. For this, Mr Reimer sets one position at the side of the field to meet the artic trailer and the other is \nprovided by the combine\u2019s constantly-updating guidance system.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what type of guidance system it\u2019s coupled with, provided the receiver sends its information in a \nform called NMEA, which is a pretty standard GPS positioning language.\n\n\u201cThe degree of accuracy simply comes down to the receiver used \u2013 RTK or Egnos are both fine \u2013 but both need to \nprovide the same correction signals, otherwise it gives goofy results,\u201d says Mr Reimer.\n\nObviously, grain carting is a pretty simple task, with two clear destinations (the combine and the waiting artic), so \nthe system doesn\u2019t need to process stacks of information and make particularly clever decisions on how to get \nthere.\n\nThe Pixhawk controller talks to a Cincoze tablet in the combine cab via long-range Wi-Fi and the information is \ndisplayed through a fairly simple app he developed. This allows him to call the tractor over and manually control its \nspeed on a sliding button from the combine.\n\nIt positions itself with the auger spout dangling directly above the middle of the trailer. The tractor can then be set to \nrun at a constant forward speed, allowing the combine driver to speed up or slow down to fill different parts of the \ntrailer.\n\nIn the field\n\nThe tractor lies waiting at the side of the field (engine on) until it is sent a signal from the combine driver to say that \nit\u2019s ready to unload.\n\nOnce given the nod, it sets off at creeping speed until it is told via the tablet computer in the combine cab that it can \nspeed up. This is pretty simple to manage as the tractor has a CVT gearbox and is near-impossible to stall \u2013 things \nget trickier where gear shifts are involved.\n\nOnce it gets close to the combine, the two machines run at the same speed. Mr Reimer then manually slows the \ntractor\u2019s speed slightly, giving him the flexibility to go faster/slower in the combine to get an even fill. It\u2019s also \npossible to nudge the tractor and trailer left or right by 50cm to help fill all the corners.\n\nIt then trundles back to the edge of the field, where the lorry driver has to hop into the tractor\u2019s cab to set the pto-\npowered offload auger going.\n\nWhat about safety?\n\n\n\nThe 7930 carries a flashing light and beeper on top of the cab to indicate that it's active and on the move, and all of \nthe team carry remote controls around their neck with a kill switch safety button. This stops any signals reaching the \nautopilot system and, in doing so, brings it to an immediate halt.\n\nSimilarly, if the radio in the tractor that connects it to the combine loses contact or goes out of its 2km range then \nthe tractor immediately stops, and there\u2019s a stop button on the controller app, too.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe system is pretty simple in that it doesn\u2019t interfere directly with the tractor\u2019s Canbus. That means it can\u2019t select a \ngear or do anything related to the tractor\u2019s hydraulics, though there are farmers in the US that have managed to \ndevelop similar arrangements that run on powershift tractors.\n\n\u201cThe only reason to get into the Canbus is to commercialise the project, which I\u2019m not interested in doing,\u201d says Mr \nReimer.\n\n\u201cHowever, the system taken from toy aeroplanes is now a bit outdated. New hardware is constantly being \ndeveloped and the latest stuff has a much greater capacity to store and process information.\u201d\n\nThis extra memory could be useful in providing the system with more intelligence, which is necessary if the corn \ncart has to communicate with several combines or pick a more complicated path across the field that avoids \nhazards such as water or telegraph poles.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to map hazards and areas where the combine hasn\u2019t gone to avoid it flattening the standing crop. \nMaybe a collision sensor on the front to detect any obstacles would be useful too, and a smartphone app so that the \ntruck driver can fire up the chaser bin\u2019s pto from his phone rather than getting in the cab.\u201d\n\nCan I build something similar?\n\nAnyone interested can make use of Mr Reimer\u2019s software as it\u2019s available free of charge \u2013 you can find it by \ngoogling Matt D Reimer Github where there\u2019s a rough step-by-step guide.\n\nThe seven-month project cost him up to CAD$15,000 (\u00a38,650) excluding the GPS, but a lot of that was lost in the \nresearch and development process \u2013 he reckons it could be replicated for closer to $8,000 (\u00a34,600) and in more \nlike two months.\n\nCommercial companies are also muscling in on the scene. Iowa-based SmartAg has its AutoCart close to \nproduction, which does a similar job to Mr Reimer\u2019s tractor, albeit with a few more features.\n\nThe geeky stuff\n\nCentral to Mr Reimer\u2019s system is the Pixhawk controller developed as a cheap autopilot for drones, cars and other \nrobotic platforms, which is powered off the tractor\u2019s 12V supply.\n\nThe 168MHz controller module has a dedicated processor and power supply with lots of different plug-ins to \ntransfer information between the tablet computer, Arduino mini-computers and the tractor\u2019s GPS and steering \nsystems.\n\nData from the tractor\u2019s GPS receiver is sent as a NMEA stream through a convertor into the Pixhawk.\n\nAt the same time, it collects information from the wheel angle sensors, which is sent via a steering controller, and is \nconnected to a relay that engages the flashing light and beeper on the top of the tractor.\n\nThe other source of information is the Arduino Pro minicomputer. This processes data relating to the tractor\u2019s speed \nand then sends signals to the Pixhawk controller as well as direct information to the steering valve to alter the \ntractor\u2019s direction.\n\n\n\nA safety pin in the Arduino unit means that unless there\u2019s a 5V power supply the tractor can be driven normally. If \n5V is supplied then Arduinos default to stopping the tractor or setting the speed to slow unless a different signal is \nsupplied from the Pixhawk \u2013 in that case the tractor drives and speed can be adjusted on the tablet.\n\nSetting up the tablet and Arduino minicomputer required Mr Reimer to write some software programming code. A \nfree online course taught him to write enough of his own code to make things work.\n\nThe hardware\n\nPixhawk controller \u2013 \u00a3150\n\nCincoze tablet computer, included with Pixhawk receiver \u2013 \u00a3585\n\nArduino minicomputer \u2013 \u00a310\n\nAssorted connectors, wires, tools \u2013 \u00a31,170\n\nAgOpenGPS\n\nFor anyone who wants to learn more about AgOpenGPS, there are extensive conversations on the North-American \nCombine Forum.\n\nCanadian farmer Brian Tischler, based in Mannville, Alberta, leads many of the discussions. He developed the \noriginal software and others, including Matt Reimer, have contributed.\n\nThe programme itself is hosted in an online repository called Github and is free for anyone to download and play \naround with to suit their needs.\n\nThe beauty of open source software is that it can be gradually tweaked and updated.\n\nThis software is primarily for home-builders \u2013 using it to develop commercial projects isn\u2019t considered to be in the \nspirit of sharing information and helping others.\n\nOther farmers we have featured in Farmers Weekly have used the software, including Charles Quick from Taunton, \nSomerset, with his RTK auto-steer system that cost just \u00a31,200 to build with no ongoing subscription fees.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe CLA has called on equivalent organisations across the EU to lobby their governments to ensure a sensible \nBrexit agreement that benefits all those in the agri-food supply chain.\n\nThe organisation, which represents about 30,000 farm landowners, farmers and rural businesses across England \nand Wales, has written to members of the European Landowners\u2019 Organisation analysing the trade implications for \nagriculture of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn his letter, CLA president Tim Breitmeyer sets out the trade implications if the UK crashes out of the EU without a \ndeal next March.\n\nSee also: Why Welsh sheep farmers are more vulnerable to Brexit fallout\n\nThis includes four points:\n\n1. The UK would have to trade under World Trade Organisation (WTO) Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status, with \nthe EU automatically applying its external common customs tariff on UK exports. There would be significant \nuncertainty in the market place, leading to negative economic consequences in the short to medium term.\n\n\n\n2. The imposition of customs controls would lead to increases in costs in the supply chain for both exports and \nimports with a probable tariff equivalent cost of more than 4%. Costs on goods such as meat would be substantially \nhigher at more than 10%.\n\n3. Continuing government policy for cheap food and retailers\u2019 desire to keep prices low could put significant \ndownward pressure on producer prices in certain sectors, most notably for lamb.\n\n4. Global factors suggesting a reduction in growth in China and South-East Asia in 2019 and the imposition of US \ntariffs on Chinese goods could lead to a global recession in 2020, thus exacerbating the adverse impacts of a no-\ndeal Brexit.\n\nFarmers need frictionless trade\n\nCommenting on his letter, Mr Breitmeyer said farmers and other rural businesses relied heavily on frictionless trade \nand movement of goods across EU borders.\n\n\u201cA future relationship which imposes barriers to trade or excludes agri-food would put at risk farming businesses \nboth here and in the EU and have a devastating impact across our wider rural economies,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI have written to farming colleagues across Europe encouraging them to put pressure on their own governments so \nthat the UK and EU can come to a sensible withdrawal deal. It must be in everyone\u2019s best interest to guarantee free \ntrade post Brexit, so that all involved in the agri-food supply chain can continue to benefit.\u201d\n\nBeef sector fears\n\nMeanwhile, the think tank The UK in a Changing Europe released a report on Monday (3 September) which \nconcluded that the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK agriculture would vary, depending on the sector.\n\nFor the beef sector, high tariffs could lead to a \u201ctotal collapse in trade between the UK and the EU\u201d since the UK is a \nlarge net importer of beef from the EU, it says.\n\nThe sheep sector, which exports large quantities to the EU, would be negatively affected as the application of \u201cmost \nfavoured nation\u201d tariffs would diminish its competitiveness, leading to a reduction of the volume exported, the report \nstates.\n\nBrexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Lords EU committee last week he was \u201cconfident that a deal is within our \nsights\u201d.\n\nBut the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he was \u201cstrongly\u201d opposed to parts of the UK\u2019s \ngovernment\u2019s Chequers plan, which analysts say has increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWTO option would not be a disaster, say Brexit campaigners\n\nThe cross-party Get Britain Out grassroots campaign group has rejected claims that a no-deal Brexit would be \ndisastrous for British agriculture.\n\nIts director Jayne Adye told Farmers Weekly that reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would give the \nUK agricultural industry opportunities to agree exciting new global trade deals.\n\nMs Adye said: \u201cUnder a WTO Brexit, the United Kingdom can tap into the growing demand worldwide for British \nagricultural goods. Countries with growing middle classes, such as India and China, are experiencing a surge in \ndemand for high-quality British products.\n\n\u201cLeaving under WTO terms will allow us to strike free trade deals, granting British farmers with countless new \nopportunities to export their farming goods around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nA WTO Brexit would guarantee that British farmers would no longer be constrained by the EU\u2019s Common \nAgricultural Policy, she said.\n\nInstead of relying on handouts from the EU, the government would be able to reward farmers for producing high-\nquality food and maintaining higher environmental standards.\n\n\u201cWe should be very proud of our high standards of animal welfare and environmental protection, and, with new \nopportunities, agriculture and rural businesses can play a crucial role in reshaping future farming policy to ensure \nthese standards do not fall,\u201d Ms Adye added.\n\n\u201cThe UK has serious leverage as we produce some of the best food in the world. Once we get Britain out of the EU, \nwe can be global leaders in agricultural standards.\"\n\nThe prospect of new, domestic supply chains taking shape was one which should enthuse British farming, she said.\n\n\u201cInstead of importing subsidised produce from Europe, food manufacturers will turn to the UK\u2019s domestic farming \nsector, and this will lead to a renewed appreciation of our hardworking farmers and British produce.\u201d\n\nFormer Defra secretary Owen Paterson, a Brexit supporter, added: \u201cUnder a clean Brexit with WTO rules (often \nreferred to erroneously as \u2018no deal\u2019), farmers can be free to embrace the latest technology enabling fertile areas to \ncontinue competing with the rest of the world. \n\n\u201cMore marginal areas can be supported with continued government funding in a way that is fully WTO-compliant.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA 72ha sheep and cattle farm in Cumbria is seeking a tenant for a 15-year agreement.\n\nThe National Trust\u2019s Penny Hill Farm in Eskdale is a traditional Lakeland fell farm with a five-bedroom farmhouse, \ntwo-bedroom holiday cottage and a range of modern and traditional farm buildings.\n\nA landlord\u2019s flock of 310 Herdwick sheep and a cattle enterprise are included, and must be kept on the farm under \nthe tenancy\u2019s conditions, which also includes fell grazing rights.\n\nSee also: Expert tips on how to apply for a farm tenancy\n\nPenny Hill is being offered on a farm business tenancy for 15 years and six months, starting on 25 March 2019.\n\nThe farm is part of three Higher Level Stewardship agreements, expiring between 2020 and 2023, and these \nschemes will be transferred to the new tenant.\n\nThe children's author Beatrix Potter owned the farm in the 1930s and bequeathed it to the trust in 1944.

A bit of rain does not wash the problems away.\u201d\n\nmailto:northwestlettings@nationaltrust.org.uk\n\n\nIt comes as results from a survey of over 600 NFU members on the impact of the drought show 71% have suffered \na negative impact from the weather.\n\nSome 78% of farmers using forage expect a shortfall in feed reserves this winter. And of the farmers growing spring \ncrops, 90% say they are growing poorer than expected.\n\nRelaxation sought\n\nDefra says it is negotiating with the European Commission on the issue \u2013 and seeking a \u201cfar more useful relaxation \nof EU laws for our farmers than other member states have sought\u201d.\n\nA Defra spokesman said: \u201cAllowing catch or cover crop grazing would, we expect, have limited benefit for our \nfarmers, given the limited crop types that can be grown under current rules in the areas concerned.\n\n\u201cWe expect further news next week on our negotiations with the European Commission to secure a much more \nbeneficial flexibility to increase the availability of fodder resources for livestock.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nRoot crop and spud kit specialist Dewulf has launched a stand-alone Field Loader that is able to process up to \n150t/hour.\n\nTipping trailers can unload directly into the transfer machine's 2.4m-wide bunker floor, before crop is sent through a \n10-roller cleaning unit.\n\nThe openings between rollers are electrically adjustable to reduce the amount of soil and waste in the load and \nthere is space for two people at the inspection table.\n\nSee also: Four-row planter and rotavator combo speeds up potato planting\n\nMaterial is then directed onto a four-piece discharge elevator, which pivots through 120deg and will reach up to \n6,187mm, or 5,630mm when at maximum height, so should be able to reach deep into a waiting truck.\n\nActive side plates and soft flights should help prevent product damage, says Dewulf, and if the discharge elevator is \nplaced at too steep an angle, the entire machine automatically switches off to prevent the product falling from \nheight.\n\nThere's also a 140deg pivot on the waste conveyor, which discharges sieved-out soil and other material to a central \nlocation alongside the machine.\n\nThe Field Loader also has the option of a built-in diesel generator that can be detached and used for other \npurposes, though for most tasks it can be connected to mains power.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStore cattle prices have largely recovered from the mid-summer blip, although mart averages are being held back \nby second-quality entries, showing the effects of a challenging summer.\n\nA deadweight beef price crash of 17p/kg in six weeks led to caution among finishers, although marts are now \nsuggesting that much of the drop has been recovered in August.\n\nSedgemoor\n\nThis is certainly the case at Sedgemoor, where Saturday\u2019s trade (1 September) was described by Greenslade \nTaylor Hunt\u2019s Robert Venner as \u201cmore like a first of April trade\u201d.\n\n\n\nA yarding of 763 cattle in Sedgemoor\u2019s 400kg+ ring saw another stronger sale, driven by a 20p/kg lift in the prime \nbeef ring over the last three weeks, which has seen strong cattle back up to 230p/kg and run-of-the-mill heifers at \n180p/kg.\n\nSee also: Prime beef staging recovery after 15p/kg drop\n\nHeifers sold to \u00a31,205 and averaged \u00a3775, while steers sold to \u00a31,330 and averaged \u00a3827, compared to the \nprevious week, when heifers topped at \u00a31,330 to average \u00a3748 and steers sold to \u00a31,300 and averaged \u00a3925.\n\nAll summer, Mr Venner has been advising farmers to supplement grazing, with the message now being to sell cattle \nsoon, rather than holding on to them for the sake of it.\n\n\u201cDewy September grass could see cattle go backwards,\u201d warned Mr Venner, adding that, while the western \ncounties have greened up, grass is low in dry matter values, effectively being \u201cgreen water\u201d. \n\nHe said there were some really good stores about, but that a significant number were, understandably, small for \ntheir age.\n\nCumbria\n\nPrices for strong, short-keep cattle are \u201cimproving all the time\u201d, but Mark Richardson, livestock manager and \nauctioneer for Harrison and Hetherington at Kirkby Stephen, said the stronger trade of late is only for the right \ncattle.\n\nAlong with his colleagues at Carlisle, they have observed a \u201ctwo-tier trade\u201d open up, with longer-keep cattle \nrequiring more forage well adrift of the better end.\n\n\u201cForage stocks are a little tighter and some finishers have the option of selling their grain for more money this year,\u201d \nsaid Mr Richardson.\n\n\u201cLooking forward, people are predicting cattle are going to be short, so that should send the price the right way.\u201d \n\nForward stores sold to \u00a31,420 twice at Carlisle last week (29 August), with Limousins hitting the top money of \n\u00a31,370 (x2), \u00a31,290 (x2) and \u00a31,280. British Blues hit \u00a31,190, with several around \u00a31,045-\u00a31,1140 and Angus sold \nto \u00a31,030-\u00a31,100.\n\nMr Richardson added that the ever-increasing scrutiny of cattle health and vaccination programmes was evident at \nsales, particularly from Scottish buyers, owing to BVD rules.\n\n\u201cWithout BVD accreditation you cut Scottish buyers out,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is because some of our better store \nheifers go for breeding, adding hundreds to the price tag.\n\n\u201cOur catalogues have more and more vendors registering with BVDFree England or marketing their stock as being \ntested and vaccinated.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBuilding a successful farm business doesn\u2019t happen overnight \u2013 it takes great ideas, passion, determination and \nyears of hard work to see it through.\n\nIt is a critical time for the farming industry, which faces many new challenges and opportunities over the coming \nmonths with the looming fallout from Brexit.\n\nWith the phased withdrawal of direct support, farmers will have to increase innovation and restructure their \nbusinesses to be profitable.\n\nSee also: Meet the 2018 Farmers Weekly Awards finalists\n\n\n\nAhead of the 2018 Farmers Weekly Awards, we have returned to previous winners of the overall accolade and \nasked them to share the secrets of their success.\n\nEach farmer was asked four questions on the keys to running a successful farm business (see below). The results \nhave revealed some common traits, but also some surprises.\n\nThe questions\n\nWhat are your top three business tips for a successful farm business?\n\nWhat\u2019s the best business decision you have ever made?\n\nWhat will you never do again in business?\n\nWhat would be your key piece of advice to a new entrant?\n\nRobert Neill, Upper Nisbet Farm, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire\n\n1. Manage your business through data recording \u2013 if you don\u2019t monitor it, you cannot measure it. Set yourself \ntargets and benchmark yourself against yourself year on year. Don\u2019t be frightened to take risks and borrow money.\n\n2. The best decision for my beast enterprise was buying a set of weigh bars. Only 20% of beef farmers in Scotland \nhave got weigh bars. But I can now weigh cattle, monitor the data and look at what it means.\n\n3. Always run your business with your head, not your heart. A prime example in a cattle or beef enterprise would \nbe: go to the end of the supply chain and work backwards. Look what customers you\u2019re going to supply, what they \nwant, condition, grade of stock. Then decide who you\u2019re going to supply and go from there.\n\n4. Seek advice from peers and industry experts and look for a mentor who is well respected in your field, especially \nif you are a first generation farmer.\n\nPoul Hovesen, Salle Farms Company, Holkham Estate, Norfolk\n\n1. Understand your farm potential, climate, crops and markets. Follow a long-term strategy. Develop a technically \ncapable and skilled workforce that understands your objectives.\n\n2. Developing and following a long-term strategy using the best science and technology available.\n\n3. Short term actions, follower of fashion.\n\n4. Ask yourself if you are capable of being in the top 5%? Build business resilience, giving thought to long-term \nplanning and attention to detail.\n\nPeter and Di Wastenage, Wastenage Farms, Budleigh Salterton, Devon\n\n1. Go with your gut instinct and never be afraid to do something different. Invest as much as possible in \nappreciating assets and as little as possible in depreciating assets. Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes, just learn from \nthem and move on.\n\n2. Employing others to do the important bits of the business you don\u2019t enjoy, thus ensuring these jobs not only get \ndone, but get done well! \n\n3. We now try to take the opportunities as they present themselves, rather than wait for the right time.\n\n4. Fast track your career by learning from others in the Industry. The openness of the agricultural industry and \nthe opportunity to share knowledge i.e. within discussion groups and through other farming businesses, is second \nto none.\n\n\n\nGuy Poskitt, Kellington, Goole, East Yorkshire\n\n1. Embrace technology, understand your customer and build a team that embrace and understand the business \u2013 \ngive them their identity and ownership of their responsibility \n\n2. Working with retailers. They are the biggest customers of UK horticulture and it is important to work with them, \nnot against them.\n\n3. Have a joint venture / partnership with other businesses.\n\n4. Understand the market. Have a clear strategy both long and short term.\n\nLord Robert Newborough, Rhug Estate, Corwen, Denbighshire\n\n1. First, believe in what you do \u2013 that brings the passion on. Think what the customer really wants and not so much \nwhat you want to do yourself. Ask yourself what is your niche selling point, where your market is going and how you \nare going to supply these markets?\n\n2. Going organic. By being in a niche, you have something special to sell and to take to your marketplace. I am one \nof a few, rather than one of many. I also entered a market at a time when organics were in their infancy. It\u2019s \nsomething I believe in. I felt I could go out and sell with confidence.\n\n3. Previously when we have come up with a good idea we have delayed and found it\u2019s too late and someone else \nhas done in. Now we don\u2019t hang around and implement fresh ideas.\n\n4. If you want to do something, get sound advice. But don\u2019t ask everyone as your mind can get muddied and you \nstart to doubt yourself.\n\nNick Padwick, farms and estate director, Peterborough\n\n1. Understand the businesses finances, year-on-year benchmarking enables informed decision-making. Follow \nthrough your ideas; if you don\u2019t try you\u2019ll never know. Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of having a good team \n(support mechanisms) around you.\n\n2. While we were working in Leicestershire for Farmcare, my wife Michelle and I developed a \u201cfarm to fork\u201d initiative \nto show children (and teachers) how food is grown and where it comes from. The program ran for nearly 10 years \nand affected the lives of nearly 100,000 children.\n\n3. Not listen or stand back and reflect on business strategies.\n\n4. Explore mentorships as throughout your career you will need support and guidance.\n\nAdrian Ivory, Strathisla Farms, Moolies, Meigle, Perthshire\n\n1. Produce what your customer wants not what you like to look at. Challenge yourself and take yourself out of your \ncomfort zone. Don\u2019t go all in on a new idea, as if it fails you have left a big hole.\n\n2. In cattle terms, building the cattle handling system. In cereal terms, going down the precision farming route in \nterms of yield mapping measuring organic matter and purchasing a fertiliser spreader, which applies what you need \nand where rather than a general spread.\n\n3. I used to budget for the year ahead which could result in making some costly, silly decisions.\n\n4. If you are thinking of buying land, ask yourself is it really value for money? Can you make a return on what you \nhave bought? \u00a310,000 per acre with a repayment of 4% is a \u00a3400 an acre profit before you break even. Everything \nthat goes up, normally comes down and land will do the same.\n\n\n\nJohn Geldard, Low Foulshaw Farm, Levens, Kendal, Cumbria\n\n1. Make sure whatever you are producing is closely aligned to consumer demand. Don\u2019t fight against fashion. If the \nfashion is to eat meat with a bit of marbling, don\u2019t produce lean meat. Big isn\u2019t always best. Finally, make sure you \nhave the right margin.\n\n2. My biggest, best and bravest decision was to buy Low Foulshaw Farm in 1988, having been a National Trust \ntenant for the previous 13 years\n\n3. Grow potatoes. In 1988, we thought this was a way to get further cashflow into the farm. But we gained \nknowledge, rather than profit. Leave these things to the experts.\n\n4. Do your own research and back your own judgment. If you have got an idea, completed the research and the \nresults are bad, don\u2019t do it. But if the research is good and your gut reaction is right, back your judgement to be \nright.\n\nRobert Law, Thrift Farm, Royston, Hertfordshire\n\n1. Think outside the box. Work with nature, not against it. Utilise every asset you have got and explore every \nopportunity and every potential market.\n\n2. I\u2019m a first generation farmer, so in my case the best business decision I made was to embark on a career in \nfarming.\n\n3. I will no longer invest in something I don\u2019t have control over, or don\u2019t know a lot about. Stick to what you know \nbest.\n\n4. Don\u2019t fall out with anybody. You never know when you might need them.\n\nAndy Guy, farm consultant\n\n1. Do really thorough research and planning. Keep an open mind about every idea. Have a contingency plan (and \nbuild it into your business plan).\n\n2. I am confident that time invested in training and gaining experience in a strategic way was an important factor in \nmy success.\n\n3. In the early days, I was probably not as safety conscious as I would be now. There were one or two near misses \nwhich come to mind and might have ended in a more serious way than they did.\n\n4. Always seek the advice of those with more experience than yourself. Consider their wise words and how you can \napply their thinking in your situation but, if they tell you that there is no route into the industry for you, as some said \nto me, set out to prove them wrong. With ingenuity, enthusiasm, hard work and determination, there will always be \nopportunities.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPrimary and secondary cultivations are virtually complete. With the early start to harvest I set myself a target to get \nas much done before the end of August as possible.\n\nThe large proportion of spring cropping combined with late drilling delivered fantastic blackgrass control, so I \ndecided to get the work done early so the ground can be left undisturbed for a minimum of six weeks before drilling.\n\nHopefully this will get some seed that has been buried from previous years to germinate.\n\nSee also: OSR growers advised not to rush into drilling\n\n\n\nOilseed rape drilling was delayed until the beginning of September due to the dry conditions and the hope that later \ndrilling will give some help to flea beetle control like it has in the past.\n\nBacklash\n\nA couple of weeks ago Hertfordshire Police posted on social media about some checks they carried out on farm \nmachinery on roads.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t great \u2013 two tractors had to be escorted off the road to have their issues addressed immediately, \nand most of the others had a fault of some kind.\n\nUnfortunately they didn\u2019t receive a good response from farmers, with many questioning why they were doing it, and \nclaiming it was a waste of police resources.\n\nSome even went as far as to say that because the police haven\u2019t caught farm thieves or hare coursers then they \nshouldn\u2019t stop tractors on the road.\n\nI make no apologies for saying that if you questioned, or claimed the police were wrong to check farm machinery for \nroadworthiness, then it is you who is wrong.\n\nWith farming needing to make a vast improvement to its health and safety record, increasingly busy roads, and the \nfact that it is the law to have functioning lights, brakes and a visible number plate, it is about time the industry sorted \nitself out.\n\nIf everything is up to scratch and road legal, there is nothing to worry about \u2013 if it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it on the road. The \ncost to make it roadworthy isn\u2019t an excuse \u2013 even if you only go a few miles, it could be deadly.\n\nMatt Redman operates a farming and agricultural contracting business specialising in crop spraying, Avadex \napplication and direct drilling in Bedfordshire. He also grows cereals on a small area of tenancy land and was Farm \nSprayer Operator of the Year in 2014.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOver the past couple of weeks there has been a lot of discussion on what the implications for the pig industry would \nbe should we reach a \"no deal\" Brexit scenario. \n\nBy default, both imports and exports would be subject to tariffs, meaning trade could be reduced somewhat, which \ncould cause problems as we are only 50% self-sufficient in pigmeat. \n\nThe government could choose to reduce tariffs unilaterally, but as this cannot be done for specific countries (other \nthan under free-trade agreements), we could be opening the gates to everything.\n\nSee also: How a pig farmer has lowered production costs by 3.8p/kg\n\nLooking at it from a positive stance, a \"no deal\" could lead to some good opportunities to grow our own market. \nHowever, farmers need more certainty over the future to invest and expand.\n\nIn terms of exports, the EU is still the UK\u2019s biggest market with 157,000 tonnes of pork, worth \u00a3208m, being \nexported in 2017. This is clearly something we do not want to lose, never mind all of the extra requirements around \nexport certification.\n\nBy the same merit, the EU would suffer as it has been predicted that pigmeat exports to the UK could reduce by \nalmost 50%, taking 2.3bn (\u00a32bn) off the EU pigmeat market. For Denmark, which exports 80% of its bacon to the \nUK, establishing an agreement is pretty important.\n\nBack on farm, we are now almost fully covered for our raw material feed requirements across both the pigs and the \npoultry, but it\u2019s certainly making me wince seeing the delivered prices continue to rise. \n\n\n\nAccounting for all costs to the business, the last quarter saw a jump of \u00a318/t (as fed) on the previous quarter, with a \nsmaller increase for the current period September to November.\n\nWe are now paying \u00a330/t more for our feed (as fed) compared with the same period in 2017. We buy approximately \n56t/week so this equates to an extra cost of \u00a387,360 per year on the pig business, or \u00a39 a pig sold and \napproximately 10-11p/kg deadweight.\n\nAs well as this added cost, the pig market price is down 15p/kg on this time last year, so many producers who are \nnot on cost-of-production related contracts such as ourselves are likely to be significantly worse off.\n\nLet\u2019s hope there is some positive clarity over Brexit soon!\n\nSophie Hope is a Farmer Focus writer from near Cheltenham. Read her biography\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nI can\u2019t work out if winter is finished or yet to arrive. We have beautiful warm days with crop development and \npasture growth racing away.\n\nI have to keep reminding myself that we haven\u2019t even started lambing yet. We have had virtually no rain since we \nreturned from the UK in mid-June.\n\nOn the occasion that winter doesn\u2019t seem to arrive on time, it normally doesn\u2019t end well, either wet and cold in \nSeptember or with a spring drought.\n\nSee also: Read more from our Farmer Focus writers\n\nEither way we are making the most of this and pushing on with our spring work. The last of the wheat was drilled in \nmid-July and spring barley is now all planted, just leaving two crops of peas, a seed line of hybrid oilseed rape, \nfodder beet and tatties.\n\nTop price\n\nA combination of a poor 2018 harvest in Canterbury, a strong dairy price and the devastating drought in Australia \nhas given us good selling opportunities.\n\nI have sold the majority of the last harvest of both wheat and barley in the last couple of weeks at $425/t (\u00a3220) \u201con \nfarm\u201d. It's a good result financially that will help to fill in the pothole left by last year\u2019s drought-affected yields.\n\nWith a benign winter and plentiful feed, our store lambs are growing well. Of the 10,300 we will finish this year, \napproximately 3,000 have already gone for export processing, with the remainder gone by the end of October when \nwe close the grass seed crops.\n\nOur lamb schedule has hit just over $8/kg (\u00a34.20), which is a once in a decade pricing level for us.\n\nThe availability of spring crop options has been very good, giving us flexibility in our rotation.\n\nAll in all things are ticking along well here, but I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence in the durability of the global economy \nand we are yet to have a winter, so I am cracking on to lock in the good pricing that is currently on offer.\n\nDavid Clark runs a 463ha fully irrigated mixed farm with his wife Jayne at Valetta, on the Canterbury Plains of New \nZealand\u2019s south island.

It was the first time we have cut oilseed rape at 6% moisture and cereals at 10%, the first \ntime we have cut wheat with Hagbergs of nearly 400, the first time I have grown a crop in two and a half months \n(spring oats) and the first time we have finished so early in my farming time.\n\nSome crops were surprisingly good, others unsurprisingly poor, but harvesting with a backdrop of prices \ncomfortably ahead of budget made things easier.\n\nA lot more straw has been baled locally, which you would hope will help those with livestock, but this endeavour has \nbeen dogged by many fires, some bad luck but many malicious.\n\nSee also: Kent grower sees top rapeseed yields without using insecticides\n\nWe\u2019ve also used our new Dale Eco drill for the first time to plant oilseed rape. Some we are companion cropping \nwith beans and some with clovers, some is Clearfield (Phoenix), some Turnip Yellows Virus resistant (Architect) \nand some entirely conventional and cheaper (Campus).\n\nExploring conservation agriculture\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the Architect has any advantage in the absence of insecticides; its predecessor Amalie \nnever did for us.\n\nWe will have another 30 varieties growing here as well, in the form of the local NIAB trials.\n\nWe\u2019ve just planted our first trial area in a new five-year Conservation Agriculture (CA) and Sustainable Farming \nproject run Europe-wide by Syngenta, in conjunction here with NIAB and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, \nwho already have a site up and running at Loddington.\n\nIt consists of three 0.5ha strips of OSR established after ploughing, shallow cultivations and direct drilling.\n\nWe will also have similar areas going into wheat, spring barley and spring beans with preceding cover crops in the \nmin-till and direct drilled plots.\n\nThe aim, as I understand it, is to develop a more robust view of the opportunities of CA to increase farm profitability, \nbiodiversity and soil health.

Read his biography.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGood riddance to a terrible summer. \n\nAugust is supposed to be the hottest, driest month of the year for us at temperatures of around 40C for days on end \nand no rain. \n\nAugust 2017 to August 2018 was one of the driest years on record. We got a third of our average rainfall and \nscorching temperatures. \n\nWe\u2019ve been battening down the hatches to survive. We early weaned all of our spring calves \u2013 some as young as \n110 days. \n\nThe neighbours\u2019 corn crops were all complete failures so we harvested it as 7,000t of silage for the cows. Never \nbefore have we fed silage \u2013 we feed hay \u2013 but this year is different.\n\nSee also: Worst drought in living memory decimates Australian farms\n\nThe average yield was 0.86t/ha. Our hay prices have more than doubled so we were happy to have it. \n\nThen it rained. We have had 11.5cm of moisture and the average temperature has been about 4C below normal. \n\nGrass has come to life and is greener than it has been in a year \u2013 such strange weather but welcome for sure! \n\nThe drought and low commodity prices we are experiencing have started to transform the land. We have marginal \nclay ground and unpredictable weather so arable has never been this area\u2019s strong point. \n\nCurrent conditions have made it impossible for most to continue. One neighbour told me that he had total costs of \n\u00a3385/ha in his soybean fields this year. \n\nCurrently, US soy is trading around \u00a378/tonne below the world market because of the Chinese tariffs \u2013 next year my \nneighbour will grow alfalfa. \n\nAnother farmer is planting gamagrass (the queen of grasses) instead of arable, and ground that had the maize and \nbeans we just silaged is going into grass.\n\nI\u2019m sure the big companies don\u2019t really care about what happens in our little part of the world \u2013 it doesn\u2019t break my \nheart that we are cutting them out of our production models either.  \n\n\n\nIt's easier to be profitable without a $300,000 combine sitting around 11 months of the year depreciating.\n\nRain has made me wonder if maybe we all panicked and things will change.

The stack \ncatches and the farmer makes a claim for \u00a350,000. \n\nTherefore, the original policy was for just 50% of the actual value. When the insurance provider chooses to 'apply \naverage' the payout will be 50% of the sum insured \u2013 \u00a325,000.  \n\n\u201cThis summer has been a challenging one. The adverse weather resulted in low crop yields, which has inevitably \npushed up prices and affected market values, said Lycetts director, William Nicholl.  \n\n\u201cWith so much to deal with, insurance may be the last thing on farmers\u2019 minds but it is even more imperative that \nfarmers are adequately covered, given the trying times. \n\n\u201cSome farmers may not be aware that the increase in wheat values, for example, means that their grain store is \nholding a higher value of wheat than in previous years, which would have an impact on the policy limit.\n\n\u201cAnd if a fire ripped through under-insured haystacks farmers could face losing thousands of pounds on a claim \u2013 \nwith an even keener blow being felt if the farmer had to buy in or supplement the crop in question, due to poor \nharvests.\u201d\n\nMr Nicholl added that he was particularly concerned about livestock farmers carrying large stacks of hay and straw \nfor large headages of cattle, the value of which has boomed in recent months.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nArable farmers across England are reporting severe infestations of cabbage stem flea beetle on emerging oilseed \nrape crops.\n\n\n\nThe recent hot weather has triggered an explosion in flea beetle numbers and there are widespread reports of early \ncrop losses.\n\nArable and beef farmer Joe Stanley has never had problems with flea beetle attacking rape on his Leicestershire \nfarm until this year.\n\nSee also: Tips on beating beetles in OSR\n\nMr Stanley, a Farmers Weekly columnist, said 95% of his emerging rape plants had \u201cshot holes\u201d caused by the flea \nbeetle, which can wipe out vast swathes of OSR. \n\nThe ban on the use of neonicotinoid seed dressings has meant that he, like many other farmers, has had to resort \nto using pyrethroids in a bid to control the pests.\n\nBut Mr Stanley said this older, \u201cdirtier\u201d chemistry was far less effective and more harmful to wildlife, and resistance \nwas building among the target pests.\n\n\u201cFarmers have had a targeted insecticide [neonicotinoids] taken out of their armoury and are having to resort to \nusing a broad spectrum, foliar spray [pyrethroids],\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to run an efficient, productive farm business. But it\u2019s like trying to farm with one arm tied behind your \nback.\u201d\n\nTwitter pics\n\nMr Stanley said it had cost him \u00a3250/ha to establish his oilseed rape crop. He does not want to spray pyrethroids \nbecause of the problems with increasing resistance, but feels he has no choice.\n\n\u201cOilseed rape is the most profitable break crop. But if I lose my 52ha this year, it will certainly make me think twice \nabout growing it again,\u201d he added.\n\nFarmers as far north as North Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have been posting pictures on Twitter of flea beetle \ndamage to emerging OSR plants. Some have reported re-drilling fields.\n\nSamuel Clarke, an independent crop consultant, farm manager and livestock farmer based in Oxfordshire, tweeted \non Saturday (1 September): \u201cJust starting to see flea beetle pressure rising, some crops getting hammered further \nsouth, forecast looks like flea beetle preferred weather next week.\u201d\n\nAICC chairman and independent agronomist Sean Sparling told Farmers Weekly there was real concern in \nLincolnshire about widespread damage caused to rape crops by flea beetle.\n\nMr Sparling said he walked fields of emerging rape crops around the Lincoln area last Wednesday (29 August) and \nthere was minimal damage on the cotyledons. But by Friday (31 August) crops were \u201cbeing hammered\u201d by the \npests and growers had resorted to spraying them with pyrethroids.\n\n\u201cWe have significant flea beetle activity up here at the moment. There seems to be an awful lot of pressure this \nyear,\u201d Mr Sparling said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating that no access to neonics seed treatments means farmers are spraying pyrethroids because \nthey have no other choice.\u201d\n\n\nNFU: 'Mad house economics'\n\nNFU deputy president Guy Smith said: \u201cOver the last few years as we\u2019ve lobbied for the use of neonics we\u2019ve \nfrequently been accused by the anti-pesticide lobby of exaggeration when it comes to flea beetle damage.\n\n\u201cJudging by the reports we are getting in from many members about damage to emerging rape crops, with growers \nalready writing crops off, it looks like 2018 could turn into a bad year for flea beetle damage.\n\n\u201cThis really brings home the importance of insecticides when it comes to growing healthy crops, but what it also \nreminds us that one key result of the EU/UK neonicotinoid ban is that it simply sucks in more protein imports from \nparts of the world such as North and South America where there is no political appetite to ban neonics. It\u2019s the \neconomics of the mad-house.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers and other industry representatives are being asked to give their views on the future of the Agriculture and \nHorticulture Development Board (AHDB).\n\nThe AHDB is a statutory levy board funded by farmers, growers and others in the supply chain.\n\nIts purpose is to make agriculture and horticulture industries more competitive and sustainable through factual, \nevidence-based advice, information and activity.\n\nSee also: AHDB campaign draws millennials back to dairy\n\nThe AHDB collects around \u00a360m a year in statutory levy from farmers and growers and currently uses that money \nfor a range of purposes to support these sectors.\n\nDefra says after the UK leaves the EU, there is an opportunity to ensure that the sectors that the AHDB covers \u2013 \nAHDB Horticulture, AHDB Beef and Lamb, AHDB Cereals and Oilseeds, AHDB Dairy and AHDB Pork \u2013 are as \ncompetitive as possible.\n\nThe review will look at the AHDB\u2019s purpose and priorities, its strengths and where improvements need to be made.\n\n10-week consultation\n\nThis is a joint 10-week exercise covering England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

It gives them a sense of responsibility and belonging, and means they can get to know customers and \nhelp build relationships that might benefit the business in the long term.\n\nThey also take great pride in the machinery, which is always looking at its best and reflects the company\u2019s \nprofessional approach to work.\n\nWestover is in the unusual position of having a waiting list of potential staff, and a network of local farmers and \nworkers means Robert can quickly bolster his ranks during busy periods.\n\nSeasonal staff come from all over the world and the family farm house becomes their home for the summer, \nincluding home-cooked meals every evening and the use of a car on days off. Robert has also helped staff with \nother accommodation, purchasing vehicles and organising work abroad, based on the mantra that happy staff and \ntheir families benefit the business.\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nWith up to 20 tractors buzzing around during silage season, Robert works hard to minimise disruption to the local \ncommunity. He maps out one-way systems for the gang to reduce congestion and tries to keep out of towns and \nheavily trafficked areas where possible.\n\nThe company takes a stand at the local ploughing match \u2013 a major event in the island\u2019s farming calendar \u2013 which \ngives the team the chance to meet existing and new customers, as well as supporting agriculture in the area.\n\nRobert is also keen to encourage the next generation to take an interest in agriculture. He invites visits from \nschools, scouts and Young Farmers groups, and takes an active role with the grain co-operative, which has a \nstrong farming voice on the island.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nKeen eye for second-hand bargains keeps costs down\n\n\n\nKit kept in great condition and well looked after by staff\n\nRapidly growing business that shows little sign of slowing down\n\nCan-do attitude to work keeps customers happy\n\nThe judges say\n\n\u201cRobert\u2019s fast-growing business is built on a can-do attitude to meet his customers\u2019 needs. He takes a close interest \nin machinery purchases, which has helped him get the most from his investments.\u201d\n\nCarl and Natalie Martins\n\nMornios Contract Herdcare, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire\n\nThere can be few greater responsibilities in farming than to be left with an unfamiliar herd of dairy cows while the \nmanager or owner takes time off for holidays.\n\nBut for Carl and Natalie Martins, this is now a regular occurrence, and the husband-and-wife team have more than \n130 customers from the top of Scotland to the tip of Cornwall, Jersey, Northern Ireland and everywhere in between.\n\nIn doing so, they have developed their skills to the point where they can slot into any dairy system, whether it be \nabreast parlours, rotaries or robots.\n\nTheir 36 years of herd management experience also means they\u2019re employed by farms to train new staff in the \ndifferent systems, as well as helping larger block-calving herds at peak times and providing relief herdcare for \nrobotic units.\n\nFarm facts\n\nDairy herdcare service provided across the UK\n\nCan be employed for a week\u2019s holiday cover or long-term leave\n\nOffers a training service for farms employing new staff members\n\nLow-cost system\n\nThe Mornios business is based on very low operational costs. Farms usually provide Carl and Natalie with \naccommodation and they do without a permanent office, instead managing their work on the road and from the \ndifferent sites they work at.\n\nLaptops, smartphones and cloud-based software allow them to access clients' data from the boot of a car and helps \nthem to seamlessly slot in once they arrive on the farm, embracing the roles and responsibilities of the regular \nherdsman.\n\nThe low-cost, high-profit system relies on a serious dose of hard work and a willingness to spend extended periods \nof time away from home, but costs are also kept in check by price checking, bulk buying, negotiating and avoiding \ncarrying too much stock.\n\nInvoicing is prompt \u2013 twice a month \u2013 and deposits are taken from customers prior to work commencing. Work is \ncharged by the hour and self-employed contractors are called in at peak time to avoid carrying excess labour when \nit\u2019s not needed.\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nMornios\u2019 customer base is particularly diverse and all have different needs, from small, family-run herds to huge \ncommercial enterprices.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s aim is to provide work priced to compete with a relief milking agency, yet offer extra services such \nas foot-trimming and artificial insemination. Given their qualifications and skills, Carl and Natalie are also able to \nspot sick, lame or bulling cows, which are often missed by relief staff.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual in that the partners in the business actually do the work on farms and know their clients well, which \nhelps develop particularly strong relationship.\n\nThey take the time to note important events for each of their customers \u2013 such as birthdays or school holidays \u2013 \nand can make sure they\u2019re on hand to fill gaps when herdspeople are to take time off.\n\nStaff training is particularly high on the agenda. Knowledge of first aid, personal protective equipment and manual \nhandling, as well as ATV and telehandler licenses, are a necessity, and a clause in the terms and conditions of \neach contract states that if any procedure breaches health and safety rules then it won\u2019t be performed.\n\nFarming champions\n\nCarl and Natalie are keen to take on ambassadorial roles for farming. They document their work through social \nmedia, showing different milking methods, robotics and farming systems employed across the variety of farms they \nwork on.\n\nThey undertake milking demonstrations at local shows and take time to explain the intricacies of dairy farming to \ninterested visitors.\n\nThey also provide training on different aspects of dairy cow husbandry to farms and are looking to expand their \nservice to colleges, universities and Young Farmers clubs. Carl is also an alumni mentor at Nottingham Trent \nUniversity, where he shares his passion for UK agriculture.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nHigh standards of work have earned a huge amount of trust from customers\n\nOffers training support to new employees on farms across the country\n\nHeavily involved in mentoring young people\n\nWillingness to learn more and develop skills wherever possible\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\u201cCarl and Natalie Martins are comfortable working in any dairy system and set exceptionally high standards in the \nherdcare of cows, which has helped them secure work across the length and breadth of the UK.\u201d\n\nMagnus Sinclair\n\nSinclair Contractors, Kinknockie Farm, Udny, Ellon, Aberdeenshire\n\nConstantly adding to a varied list of services has helped Magnus Sinclair\u2019s Aberdeen-based contracting business \novercome the challenge of rising machinery costs and competition from one-man bands.\n\nAs well as starting one of the first AD plants in the area, he runs a waste haulage operation \u2013 a gang of eight \nwagons deal with the permits, stockpiling and spreading of 190,000t of liquid waste a year \u2013 plus Christmas tree \nharvesting and farm machinery sales alongside the mainstream agricultural contracting outfit.\n\nThis helps spread the risk, but also keeps his machinery and team of 27 full-time staff \u2013 and up to 40 part-time \nduring peak periods \u2013 busy year-round.\n\nFarm facts\n\n\n\nOffers agricultural contracting, waste haulage and renewable energy services across northern Scotland\n\nMain customer base is arable, dairy and AD plants\n\nWork includes forage harvesting, mowing, baling, muck/slurry/digestate spreading\n\nRecordkeeping\n\nAt the heart of his business is John Deere\u2019s MyJobs documentation system, which helps track the exact cost of \neach job completed, including fuel used, time, tonnage or bale count.\n\nEmploying such a system means every job can be costed accurately and information can be recorded quickly and \neasily in the office and sent to customers.\n\nIt also ensures staff members make notes about a job\u2019s key details, which speeds up the process, from assigning \nthe work to sending out the invoice.\n\nCoupled to JD Link, it allows Magnus to monitor different jobs on his iPad, including up-to-date yield maps, engine \nspeeds and data from the manure-sensing system fitted to the tankers.\n\nMachinery\n\nPrior to 2004, Sinclair Contracting ran a mixed-brand fleet. However, the switch to a John Deere-only outfit has \nbrought stacks of benefits, making life easier for operators that need only to be familiar with a single system, \nspeeding up servicing and workshop jobs, simplifying spare parts storage and building a very close relationship \nwith the local dealer.\n\nThe other big perk is staff only have to be trained once on the various Deere computer systems, which is a major \ntime saver for Magnus. The local dealer provides training on the use of guidance, as well as Deere\u2019s other software \nprogrammes, including Harvest Lab, Manure Sensing and the MyJobs documentation system.\n\nThe close relationship with JD naturally delivers reliable back-up, but Magnus also gets involved in trialling new \nequipment prior to its global releases.\n\nUnusually, the business runs its tractors to well beyond 15,000 hours before trading them in, despite only taking a \none-year warranty. The secret to their longevity is monthly health checks and in-house servicing.\n\nIt also helps manage the rising capital costs of machinery that are affecting contractors across the country. By \nbuying new, maintaining tractors well, keeping them for longer and putting more hours on them, their costs are \nreduced and the business can stay profitable.\n\nSharing knowledge\n\nMagnus has built a reputation for providing a quality service and sets himself apart from others by offering \nspecialised knowledge and technology to provide the best service for specific jobs.\n\nHe also attends local school presentations on machinery development for young children to demonstrate the \nchanges in farm equipment and the new technology that is influencing modern farming methods. He has also been \ndirector of the Royal Northern Agricultural Society, where he helped organise shows introducing the general public \nto farming.\n\nHe hosts farm tours on a regular basis, where he takes Young Farmers' Clubs and agricultural discussion groups \naround the site to talk about farming and his AD plant.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nTakes an interest in the contracting sector and open to new business opportunities to spread risk\n\n\n\nKeeps close eye on costs and excellent record management\n\nLong machinery replacement policy and monthly servicing\n\nInvolved with the local YFC and invites schools to visit\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\"A diverse range of services is central to the success of Sinclair Contractors and Magnus' willingness to embrace \nnew technology and explore new opportunities sets him above many of his rivals.\"\n\nSponsor's message\n\n\u201cAll three finalists demonstrated a tremendous focus for delivering a first-class service to their customers, which has \nbecome central to the success of their flourishing contracting businesses.\u201d\n\nRichard Miller, Fendt business support manager\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFirst Milk is raising its milk price from 1 September by 0.5p/litre, taking its standard litre liquid price to 28.5p/litre (4% \nbutterfat, 3.3% protein).\n\nThe increase takes the co-op\u2019s manufacturing standard litre (4.2% butterfat and 3.4% protein) to 29.47p/litre.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the additional costs that members are experiencing due to the adverse weather conditions,\u201d said \nJim Baird, farmer director and vice chairman.\n\nSee also: Free range poultry meat growth offers diversification opportunity\n\n\u201cWhilst there continues to be conflicting messages on the overall market direction, we remain focused on growing \nour business and passing the benefits of this back to members,\u201d added Mr Baird.\n\nThe market is very difficult to read \u2013 UK production is growing slowly but on the back of much winter feed already \nbeing fed. It remains to be seen whether the rise can be sustained at current higher feed prices and into the winter. \n \n\nThe next price announcement will be from Muller by the end of tomorrow (31 August), giving one month\u2019s notice of \nits October price.\n\nDairy market analysis from Peter Meehan, INTL FCStone\n\nVolatility remained high in global dairy markets over the past week.\n\nWhile European spot skim milk powder (SMP) and butter prices edged higher again last week, futures price activity \nwas more mixed on favourable weather across much of Europe, easing concerns over milk supplies.\n\nOn the spot market, European SMP gained a further 4% last week, climbing to \u00a31,457/t. European spot butter \nprices saw more moderate gains, increasing by 0.5% to \u00a34,990/t.\n\nFutures markets have been more mixed, with EEX butter futures\u2019 September to March contracts down sharply, \nfalling by 5.6%. SMP futures meanwhile saw prices for October to December move down by 1% and January-\nMarch 2019 up 0.9%.\n\nDespite the modest milk production numbers for July coming out of the Netherlands (-1.2%) and the US (+0.4%) \nover the past week and very strong export numbers out of New Zealand for July, futures prices struggled to find \nsupport.\n\n\n\nLast week\u2019s GDT auction also did little to support market prices as it saw its fifth move lower in six events and 10th \nmove lower in the last 13, events with the overall index dropping by 3.6%.

After many years in the undergrowth, with only \nrabbits, mice and the odd confused Japanese infantryman for company, it found itself being hauled out into the \nlight.\n\nWhen it first arrived here in the 1980s, it was the star of the farmyard. I seem to remember straw burning had just \nfinished, and it was hailed as the wonder-tool of the day for incorporating thick mats of straw.\n\n\u201cThe secret is speed \u2013 more speed\u201d cried the salesman. This clashed somewhat with Dad\u2019s favourite saying: \u201cMore \nhaste, less speed.\u201d\n\nSee also: Read more from Charlie Flindt\n\nAnyway, over the years, it fell into disuse. Some people still swear by them, and the design is now available on a \ndozen different marques, but we found a simple set of mounted 3m discs is better preparation for today\u2019s drills.\n\nOut from the saplings it came, rear roller spinning freely as if it had been greased yesterday, and with enough \nmetalwork to cover a good few acres before we\u2019d have to find new wings or feet.\n\nAs it happened, we\u2019ve got a healthy pile of spares. They\u2019ve been sitting in a heap waiting to go back to the dealer; \nsome bright spark had hard-faced the underside, which is a fat lot of good. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve forgotten which \ndealer I got them from.\n\nRecreational cultivation\n\nThe little Lemken must have thought Christmas had come as we set off to White Hill to hit the wheat stubbles. But \nafter a turn or two, it got confusing again.\n\nInitially, the job had been perfect \u2013 nice and smooth and regular. But I kept jumping out and dropping the rear \nlevelling discs lower and lower, and only once I\u2019d ended up with nice loose ground interspersed with quite deep \ntrenches did I feel satisfied.\n\nSo what has caused this outbreak of deliberately poor soil preparation? And, bearing in mind that White Hill is \npencilled in for spring barley, why am I suddenly so keen on what might be described as \"recreational cultivation\"?\n\nAfter all, my soil guru at university was the legendary Professor Alan Reece. \u201cTractors are brilliant things,\u201d he would \nexplain, bouncing round the lecture room in a dull redbrick block in Newcastle upon Tyne. \u201cBut the worst thing you \ncan do with one is drive it across a field.\u201d\n\n(I once accidentally handed in some work to the mad Prof with a betting slip left between the pages. It came back \nwith a note scribbled on it: \u201cI\u2019ve checked \u2013 you didn\u2019t win. Otherwise I\u2019d have cashed it.\u201d)\n\nThe depressing truth is that all that diesel, time and wrongly hard-faced metal is being used up on a completely \nnon-agricultural mission.\n\nMy last resort\n\nThe hare coursing season has started, and among the half dozen or so cars that paused to watch my masterclass \nin deliberately incompetent seed-bed preparation was a Transit, convincingly decked out with orange beacon and \ntipper bed. Yes, it was the \"rural criminals\", checking out one of their favourite coursing sites.\n\n\n\nAnd there is nothing that stops these \"rural criminals\" (and was there ever a more lame euphemism for these \npeople?

But why should innocent landowners bear the burden of this disgraceful \ncrime?\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Walsall Council is considering extending its opening hours at its tips and introducing a free skip \ncollection service every Saturday for bulky household items, in a bid to tackle fly-tipping, which cost its taxpayers in \nexcess of \u00a3426,000 last year.\n\nDefra view\n\nIn April, Defra environment minister Dr Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said that any evidence linking councils charging to receive \ncertain types of waste with an increase in fly-tipping was \u201cinconclusive\u201d.\n\nLast year, a Farmers Weekly campaign to raise awareness of fly-tipping in the countryside, in association with the \nCLA, urged the government to change current legislation, which places the responsibility of clearing fly-tipped waste \non farmland on private landowners.\n\nBut Dr Coffey said allowing fly-tipped waste dumped on private land to be cleared without charge at household \nwaste recycling centres would \u201cnot provide the right incentive to deter fly-tipping\u201d or encourage people to \u201csecure \ntheir land more\u201d.\n\nCouncil aids prosecutions for fly-tipping on private land\n\n\n\nDumping of waste on private land in Buckinghamshire must still be cleaned up by the landowner, but council \nofficers do investigate private land fly-tip cases\n\nWhere the evidence allows prosecution, Buckinghamshire County Council (representing the Waste Partnership), \nseeks clean-up compensation on behalf of the landowner at court\n\nMore than 10% of cases \u2013 71 out of 672 between 2004 and 2018 \u2013 have been where the waste was fly-tipped on \nprivately owned land\n\nThere is no charge to the landowner for investigation work or for legal fees in these cases;

Yields have averaged 8.6t/ha, with feed wheat specific weights between 74kg/hl and 80kg/hl and \nmoistures no higher than 17.5%. \u201cEverything has been unseasonably dry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to see how well things have generally done it terms of yields,\u201d he said. Although crops had \nbeen about 10-15% down on the average, this was better than had been expected earlier in the summer.\n\n\u201cThe worst crop regardless of land type has been oilseed rape,\u201d he said.\n\nSpring barley, oats and bean harvesting had mostly begun, with crops beginning to come into store.\n\nHe said oats had been a bit disappointing in terms of yield, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the Armageddon we expected\u201d.\n\n\n\nEast Anglia\n\nIn Norfolk, harvest had a second coming as the coastal strip of crops ripened after most inland fields had been \ncombined, said Andrew Dewing, chief executive at Dewing Grain.\n\n\u201cHarvest had finished inland, as the weather had been fantastic and dry, but then it rained on and off. Then as of \nSaturday (1 September), it dried off and people were able to get into their coastal crops.\u201d\n\nAlthough quality had been good, yields were disappointing on the inland crops, but the coastal strip had benefited \nfrom light winds and sea fret, Mr Dewing explained.\n\nThis meant that while temperatures soared into the 30s inland, it remained a balmy 18C on the coast, with crops \ngetting moisture from the sea mist.\n\n\u201cThis has meant very pleasing yields in the crop,\u201d he said. Yields of wheat inland were 10-20% down on the \naverage, but were about 5% up on the coastal strip. \u201cIt\u2019s been very pleasing on the East coast.\u201d\n\nKelso\n\nHarvest has finished for John Jeffrey at Caverton Mill Farm near Kelso. \u201cThe great thing is almost everything came \nin dry,\" he said. \"The drying costs were minimal.\u201d\n\nHowever, yields are down and the straw is minimal, which is frustrating for Mr Jeffrey. \u201cEveryone is desperate for \nstraw this year.\u201d\n\nHis 141ha of Lili, Barrel, Skyfall and Revelation wheat averaged 7.4t/ha, performing better on heavier land in \ncomparison with the light land, which suffered in the dry weather, said Mr Jeffrey.\n\nHe was pleasantly surprised by his 90ha of Palmedor high erucic acid (Hear) oilseed rape which achieved 4.2t/ha.\n\nHowever, the Talisman and Pearl winter barley yields are slightly back on last year, averaging 6.6t/ha. \n\nHarvest progress\n\nScottish harvest is 80-90% finished\n\nWheat harvest was at least 90% complete around Tyne and Wear\n\nCutting restarted in East Anglia in coastal areas\n\nCoastal crops yielding well\n\nStill deciding which winter wheat and barley varieties to grow based on this season performance?

Apart from the size, the biggest difference to UK shows is having to dodge the UTVs tearing around \nthe showground, ferrying people from stand to stand or to the demo areas.\n\nWe've picked out a few of the best bits from the huge event.\n\nPrecision Planting\n\n\u2018Helping farmers to produce more\u2019 is the drive for Precision Planting, which supplies a range of high tech equipment \nto farmers and manufacturers to improve the uniformity of drilling.\n\nThe jewel in the crown of the firm's offering is the Smart Firmer, which is a small, angled leg \u2013 similar to a hockey \nstick \u2013 that attaches behind the drill coulter to apply light pressure. This forces the seed into the furrow, helping to \nachieve better seed-to-soil contact and consistent emergence.\n\nIt also has a bank of sensors on its foot, relaying information directly to the 20/20 monitor in the cab for the operator \nto make on-the-go decisions.\n\nIn front of the coulter and disc unit is the Clean Sweep, which clears trash and debris to prevent it contaminating the \ndrilling area. The sensors on the foot can detect if there are unwanted objects or plants getting into the furrow and \nwill notify the operator as a percentage readout.\n\nAlong with keeping the seed trench clean, another sensor measures soil moisture and provides a second \npercentage reading. This creates a map indicating how even it is across the field, highlighting areas that may be \nslower to emerge due to moisture deficiency before the seed has even had the chance to chit.\n\nSoil temperature is also fed back to the operator, along with a fourth sensor located in the same leg, which \nmeasures the organic matter in the soil by relating the shade of brown back to the temperature. This allows the \noperator to raise or lower the seed population depending on the organic matter present in certain areas.\n\nUsing this information means more seed is drilled in the areas when the soil has the potential for greater yield. \nConversely, seed isn\u2019t wasted in low-yielding parts of the field. The sensors send over 1,000 measurements per \nsecond back to the operator and map the field constantly.\n\nAlong with the Smart Firmer, the company has technology for liquid fertiliser application around corners and seed \ndepth control linked to the depth wheel \u2013 rather than using a constant pressure \u2013 which can drop seeds to different \ndepths if soils are wetter.\n\nPrecision Planting sells into America, Canada, Brazil and most recently France, so don\u2019t be surprised to see this \ntechnology creeping into the UK soon.  However, its preferred route to market would be to allow customers to spec \nits technology onto drills at manufacturing stage, without invalidating warranties and avoiding retrofit complications.\n\nAg Synergy\n\nJust like the UK, farmers in the US are realising that not all soils appreciate cultivation activity and zero till is \nbecoming an increasingly popular establishment technique.\n\nKansas-based Ag Synergy has been making drills and related products since 2010 and on its stand in Iowa this \nyear was a mini tracked coulter unit. Designed for use in light, low-moisture soils or drilling straight into heavy cover \ncrops, the track units lift up and down in the same way a standard toolbar would.\n\n\n\nThe tracks are made up of two separate rubbers with space in the middle for the disc and coulter. The tracks are \nunpowered and are driven by friction so require a minimum of 20hp per unit to pull.\n\nOnce lowered, the Genesis TRX can apply a huge 540kg of pressure to keep the coulter in the ground, which the \nfirm says is the biggest challenge to stop the units bouncing around as they are individual and free to roam over \nground contours.\n\nThese units are specifically for unmoved soil as cultivated land would bung up the track units and create a smearing \neffect. The straight disc helps to move minimal soil when drilling and the units have lateral movement of 5\u00b0 to help \nwith headland bends.\n\nA 9m drill with track coulters costs around $86,566 (\u00a367,200).\n\n360 Yield Centre\n\nWith its own demo area, 360 Yield Centre was showing growers how they can maximise returns from crops with \nnifty machine modifications. \n\nAlong with a large John Deere R4050i self-propelled sprayer with dribble bars capable of accurately applying \nnitrogen to the base of a maize plant by dropping it through the canopy, there was a JD Gator with a long rod \nsticking out from its nose.\n\nOn the rear sits a 1,100-litre tank on the 360 Sprint Gator that was filled with liquid fertiliser and acts as a refuelling \nvessel to keep the maize drill running in the field.\n\nDriving up to the rear coupling on one side of the drill, the 360 Sprint has powerful electromagnets that snap into \naction and lock the hose to the drill. The 2in supply can unload the 1,100 litres in under 2 minutes, with the power \ncoming from an onboard Honda engine on the Gator.\n\nThe Gator has received an extra axle and some beefed-up supports to accommodate the large tank, but it can still \nbe returned to its original mode as there are no mods to the chassis.\n\nThis helps to keep the drill in the field and can also reduce weight as it doesn\u2019t have to run brim-full with fertiliser, \nthus reducing compaction and offering up to 30% increase in output.\n\nSalford fertiliser spreader\n\nSpreading granular fertiliser accurately to 36m is as much dependent on the quality of fertiliser as the machine that \nis scattering it.\n\nBut Ontario-based Salford says it has done extensive testing with a variety of different granules from across the US \nprior to the launch of its new trailed spreader and is confident that most grades of fertiliser will be hurled to a 36m \nwidth.\n\nCleverly, it has 12 sections for auto shut-off managed through a TeeJet rate controller, which monitors the weight in \nthe hopper against the material spread and adjusts the rate as speed varies.\n\nA pan test kit is sold with every machine for farmers to calibrate their own equipment and the spreader is capable of \nspinning to reduced widths of 24m, with the 12 sections proportionally scaled down to fit the smaller spread.\n\nThere is only a PTO connection needed from the tractor because an inbuilt 132-litre hydraulic system powers the \nspreader, so a tug of 150hp could easily power the spreader on flat ground.\n\nThe new spreader starts at around $70,000 (\u00a353,000).\n\nUnverferth Equalizer track\n\n\n\nIt was hard to miss the enormous Unverferth Equalizer tracks, which provide the footwear for the firm's monster \nchaser bin capable of holding 54m cu.\n\nMeasuring a whopping 42in wide and 148in long, the new tracks are claimed to be the biggest in North America and \neach one provides 4,410sq inches in touch with the ground.\n\nThe new Equalizer system offers the standard front-to-back pivot of 20\u00b0 but also has a camber oscillation of 8\u00b0, so \nthere is still full contact from the track and minimal digging in from one edge when working on sloped ground or \ndriving along humped roads.\n\nThe tracks, in a slightly smaller format, were also on a trailed sprayer unit, with the firm saying these are gaining \nincreased popularity with farmers wishing to tread more lightly \u2013 the track replacements can apparently halve the \ncompaction compared with a wheel.\n\nOne of the smallest machines on the Unverferth stand was an ATV-towed twin-axle sprayer with 18m booms and a \n750-litre tank that had no connection to the quad \u2013 instead it uses a static Honda GX 160 engine to power the \nTeeJet plumbing system.\n\nCrary Draper header\n\nDraper belt headers might be a rare sight in the UK, but they are still hugely popular in the US. Still, they suffer \nsimilar issue with losses along the knife sections as the reel shatters grains from pods before the table catches \nthem.\n\nUS manufacturer Crary has developed an air system that has angled tubes that hug the outside of the reel to force \nwind onto the knife section, thus blowing loose seed onto the belts behind to be ferried into the combine.\n\nThe 8in fan runs from a PTO drive on the opposite side of the feeder house to where a normal header connection \nattaches.\n\nIt was being shown on a 30ft John Deere header and the system, along with air supply tubes, lifts up and down with \nthe reel and doesn\u2019t impact on the workings of the header. The company claims it can offer a saving of up to \n0.1t/ac.\n\nVermeer ZR5 1200\n\nFarmers Weekly first covered the self-propelled round baler from Vermeer back in October 2017 when it was in the \nprototype stage, but it seems the firm\u2019s dreams are now reality and the SP baler has made it into full scale \nproduction.\n\nThe first five units are due on farms this August, with further models planned for next harvest. Many features remain \nunchanged from the prototype including the front axle suspension, Claas cab and the Cummins powerplant.\n\nCleverly, the baler unit can be removed in around 10 minutes for essential maintenance, with the pickup reel \nremaining in place for fingers to be changed easily, rather than crawling around on the floor. This also means the \nbaler unit can be replaced and a new one can slot into the space without changing the tractor unit as well.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of it ever coming to the UK or even Europe is a long way off due to the 3.6m road width and \n5ft bale chamber. The company says it would be a hefty redesign in order to fit the European systems, and with no \nUK Vermeer dealers, it seems distribution would be an issue too.\n\nMahindra buggy\n\nIndian giant Mahindra is slowly adding to its repertoire of products destined for the ag market and the latest item to \nhit the US dealers is a 1-litre farm buggy.\n\n\n\nMahindra has been selling its UTVs in the States for three years and the new model comes in either petrol or diesel \nvariants and can have a second row of seats if required.\n\nThe buggy has some standard features that its competitors charge for, including an electric tipping body and tilting \nsteering wheel.\n\nPumping out 83hp from the TGB engine, the 1000 model can reach 60mph and tow 1,100kg, with a payload of \n544kg.\n\nA carrot for any potential buyer will be the standard three-year warranty, which knocks spots off the competition and \nis unheard of on the buggy market.\n\nThe 1000 retails in the US for 17,210 USD (\u00a313,370).\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmer and entrepreneur David Shelton is nearing the end of building an entire beef and arable unit from scratch on \na greenfield site in Leicestershire.\n\nThe site at Saxelbye Top Farm extends to about 283ha of pasture and arable land and Mr Shelton aims to grow \ncrops and finish about 900-1,000 continental crosses once the mammoth engineering project has been completed.\n\nThe farmland had been sitting idle after the National Coal Board ceased operations there a few years ago, explains \nMr Shelton.\n\nSee also: What's In Your Livestock Shed visits high-tech beef and sheep business\n\nNow though, it has undergone a transformation, with three roundhouse buildings, almost four miles of concrete \ntrack installed, 2.4ha of concrete laid, huge silage and feed clamps constructed and a range of other storage bins \nand buildings put in place.\n\nThe project\n\nOne 45m roundhouse\n\nTwo 30m roundhouses\n\n2.4ha (6 acres) of concrete hard standing\n\nAlmost four miles of concrete track\n\nMachinery store\n\n5,000t grain store\n\n3m deep reception pits\n\nAttenuation storage tanks\n\nTwo balancing ponds\n\nMiddens\n\nFeed bunkers\n\nOffice\n\nControl room\n\n\n\nStraw barn\n\nThe beef housing\n\nAt the heart of the operation are three enormous circular beef sheds in what is the largest single installation ever \nundertaken by framed building designer Simpson and Allison (S&A), which produces the roundhouse.\n\nTwo 30m and one 45m diameter roundhouse cattle sheds are nearing completion and dominate the central area of \nthe farmstead.\n\nThe first beef cattle will be brought in from grazing in early October, says Mr Shelton, who is from a farming family \nbut amassed a fortune selling cars.\n\nAfter a career building up the Motorpoint Group, Mr Shelton was able to come back to agriculture and bought a farm \nadjoining the new site in 2012.\n\nIt was here that he first used a 30m roundhouse to finish continental cross cattle bought in at about 12 months old.\n\nThe conventional pole buildings were run down and a roundhouse offered a ready solution to the problem, he \nexplains.\n\n \u201cWe moved cattle into the roundhouse and straight away started to see benefits \u2013 the cattle were calmer, disease \nlevels were minimal and growth rates rose above 1.5kg a day.\n\n\u201cWe were selling the cattle within 12 months over 700kg, killing out at 380-400kg and hitting R4 to U grades.\u201d\n\nStocking capacity\n\nThe improved performance in the cattle is the reason why Mr Shelton has opted for three of the circular houses at \nSaxelbye Top Farm, which he bought after the Motorpoint Group was floated on the stock exchange.\n\nThe aim is to increase the herd from 750 to 900 head grazed on about 500 acres.\n\nThe farm's arable area will produce some of the feed, while newly-constructed storage bins will hold maize, waste \npotatoes, brewers\u2019 grains, sugar beet and wheat straw. This will be put through a Keenan mixer wagon and fed \nthrough the winter after housing.\n\nEach 30m roundhouse will hold 120-150 cattle, while the 45m version will take 240 to 300 animals.\n\nThis allows 4.7 sq m for each animal and provides a 60cm of feed space/head at the troughs, which run around the \ncircumference of the circle.\n\nBuilding design\n\nEven at the higher stocking rates, the air in a roundhouse is fresher than the conventional building, even on still, \nmild foggy autumn days, Mr Shelton says.\n\nCompany founder and managing director of S&A, Geoff Simpson explains that this is due to the shape of the \nroundhouse, which aids natural ventilation.\n\nThe design means the whole building acts like a chimney.\n\nAs the cattle\u2019s body heat warms the air in the open space under the roof, it rises, travelling, uninterrupted along the \nunderside of the curved inner surface.\n\nThe warmed air exits the building through the hole around the centre pole at the top of the dome. The air exiting at \nthe top is then replaced by cooler, fresh air drawn in through the open sides and this helps to reduce respiratory \ndisease levels and boosting production.\n\n\n\nThe improved performance seen on Mr Shelton\u2019s existing unit is in-line with expectations of a 15% uplift, Mr \nSimpson says.\n\nA further reason for the improvement in performance could be due to the design\u2019s effect on stress levels.\n\nFarmers who bought units have noted that stock were calmer and that new stock quickly settled down.\n\nMr Simpson suggests this is due to the high-visibility open span and visual contact with the rest of the animals \nunder the roof.\n\n\u201cIt is also due to the wide open space around the whole circumference of the construction. Cattle can see all around \nthem, mimicking a situation where a herd rests at grass,\u201d he says.\n\nConstruction and cost\n\nConstruction\n\nIn summary, this is a 15-month build project inspired by the client David Shelton together with S&A, and grain \ndrying specialist JW Installations, explains Mr Simpson.\n\nDespite the long timespan for the project, the roundhouses have taken the least amount of time to construct and \ncan typically be erected in as little as four days, he adds.\n\nThe 1t PVC-coated polyester roof is constructed on the ground and attached to the lattice rafters. The steel \ncolumns, located on the outer edge, are also attached during this phase.\n\nThen the roof is slowly raised up on hydraulic rams and the outer supports swing in underneath it as the roof \nreaches the final height.\n\nThe sheer amount of concrete at the unit has caused additional hurdles. The Environment Agency has insisted that \ntwo large balancing ponds and attenuated storage were installed to ensure run-off from the large concrete areas is \ncontained.\n\nIn all there is around 2.4ha of concrete under the roundhouses, clamps and storage bins along with an additional \nfour miles of newly-laid concrete farm tracks.\n\nCost\n\nWith the excavation bill to create drainage, balancing ponds and storage tanks for run-off higher than originally \nenvisaged, the projected final total cost will be more than \u00a33m, says Mr Shelton.\n\nThe bill for concrete is about \u00a3100,000/acre, while the total for feed clamps, grain drying and grain storage facility \nwill break the \u00a31m mark.\n\nThe above-ground cost of the roundhouse is \u00a360,000 for the 30m units and \u00a3130,000 for the larger 45m set-up.\n\nTimeline: from bare land to fully-functioning farm\n\n2017\n\nJune Planning application lodged\n\nNovember Site clearance starts\n\nDecember Foundations and steel erection for machinery store\n\n2018\n\n\n\nMarch Machinery store complete\n\nJanuary Foundations laid for 5,000 tonne grain store\n\nApril Major construction of 3m deep reception pit begins\n\nMay Steel erection of the plant tower and grain store starts\n\nJune Roundhouse construction underway\n\nBalancing pond and attenuation storage created\n\nMiddens and feed bunkers begun.\n\nAugust Office and control room begins with September completion date\n\nStraw shed work starts with September target for completion.\n\nSeptember Drying equipment installation starts\n\nGrain store floor concreting\n\nFinal Roundhouse nearing completion\n\nOctober First cattle to be housed  \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAgricultural trials play a crucial role in testing a huge range of farm inputs or practices, including seeds, fertilisers \nand pesticides.\n\nThese products or practices need to be tested in a variety of locations and conditions to tease out the merits of \neach and provide farmers with the best knowledge and advice on which to use and how to maximise performance.\n\nFarmers Weekly asked Sarah-Jane Osborne to give readers an insight into her role as field trials manager at \nAHDB, which plays a key role in assessing crop varieties for the UK's arable growers.\n\nSee also: Job profile: What it's like to be a plant breeder\n\nName: Sarah-Jane Osborne\n\nJob title: Field trials manager\n\nCompany: AHDB\n\nAge: 28\n\nHow would you sum up your job?\n\nI\u2019m part of the team that organises the trials behind the AHDB Recommended Lists for cereals and oilseeds.\n\nThe lists help farmers decide what to grow by providing information on yield and quality performance, agronomic \nfeatures and the market options open to different varieties.\n\nWhat does this involve day-to-day?\n\nEverything from planning the \"protocols\" (we have to plan and record exactly how a crop is grown and treated so \nwe can draw the most informative conclusions) and sourcing the seed to managing the initial tender process for \ntrials which are carried out by external contractors, and inspecting the sites during the year.\n\n\n\nWhat do you enjoy most?\n\nIn academia, some of the data that\u2019s produced ends up sitting on a computer and never really gets used. This is a \nreally practical role and you feel like you\u2019re making a real difference.\n\nThe results and conclusions we come up with are relevant to farmers and it\u2019s exciting to see the potential of new \nvarieties and breeding methods that are boosting agricultural productivity and increasing choice for different end-\nuses.\n\nWhat\u2019s the downside?\n\nThe job is very seasonal and involves long hours in the summer, with a lot of travel. We need to inspect about 500 \ntrials across the whole of the UK \u2013 so that means a lot of overnight stays away from home.\n\nWhat percentage of your job is office-based?\n\nI spend roughly 60% of my time in the office, the rest I am out in the field inspecting trials and demonstrating at \nvariety open days.\n\nWhat skills and qualifications are essential to do the job?\n\nUltimately, you don\u2019t need to be a maths genius or a statistician to do this \u2013 but you do need to be able to analyse \ndata and interpret results. Attention to detail is important as there is a lot of information \u2013 you need to keep detailed \nand accurate records.\n\nGood communication skills are also useful in my role as I\u2019m interacting with lots of different people \u2013 whether that\u2019s \nfarmers, external trial operators or plant breeders.\n\nA driving licence is essential and agronomy qualifications, such as the Basis certificate in Crop Protection and \npesticide application qualifications, can be extremely helpful for more practical roles.\n\nWhat experience did you have before you started?\n\nSome people come to jobs like this from a science background; others from a straight agriculture background. I \nstudied Biology at the University of Nottingham, focusing on Plant Science for my Masters.\n\nI then went on to study a PhD in Crop Pathology at Rothamsted Research, where I managed field trials. I loved the \napplied aspect of my research and I wanted to move into a role where I could help provide growers with practical, \ntechnical information.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone wanting a similar role?\n\nIt\u2019s a very enjoyable job. You need to be able to multi-task and prioritise, though, as you\u2019ll have a number of \nprojects on the go. It is also important to stay independent as we deliver objective recommendations to AHDB\u2019s levy \npayers. Work such as this has to be thorough and rigorous, so farmers can rely on the information we generate.\n\nGive us an idea of salaries\n\nThey vary \u2013 but manager level roles could be between \u00a328,000 and \u00a335,000 depending on experience and can \ninclude benefits such as private healthcare and a car.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nJohn Deere has unveiled a new track system for its big S700 combines and T550, T560 and T570 straw walker \nmachines.\n\n\n\nThe company first launched a rubber belt option for its flagship S-series back in 2011 when it built the units in-\nhouse at a Hungarian factory and they have proved popular, with up to 60% of S-badged machines sold in the UK \nnow fitted with them.\n\nHowever, that operation has since been sidelined, with Deere instead choosing to partner with Canadian track \nspecialist Soucy, which also supplies units for the likes of New Holland and Case-IH.\n\nThe change has added an extra width option \u2013 30-inchers join the existing 24in design \u2013 and all new tracked \nmachines can be ordered with either a 30kph or 40kph speed limit. Opting for the faster set-up, which requires \nminor tweaks to the hydrostatic transmission software, costs \u00a32,493.\n\nThere are also 36in tracks, but they take machine width out to 4.55m, which rules them out on UK roads.\n\nSee also: Laverda dealer finds exotic homes for old combines\n\nDesign\n\nThe company has stuck with the same triangular layout that uses a positive drive through a central spoked wheel \nand internal track lugs.\n\nCentral to the combine-only design is a five-pivot-point arrangement that should avoid the peak loads associated \nwith more rigid track layouts. Two of the pivot pins allow the rollers to split, helping to climb out of dips.\n\nIdler rollers have up to 180mm of vertical movement \u2013 an improvement of 50mm over old models \u2013 which has seen \na 20% reduction in vibrations at the driver\u2019s seat and, says Deere, a 50% improvement in durability.\n\nThe new tracks are particularly long, which helps provide a footprint roughly a third larger than what went before, \nwhile still keeping under 3.5m wide on the road (on 24in tracks). There\u2019s also a deeper tread profile and an extra \nlayer of steel cord in the rubber, which should make them last a bit longer.\n\nOther details to note include enclosed gearboxes and bearings don\u2019t need regular greasing, self-lubricating rollers \nand a 500-hour oil service interval.\n\nThe track option costs \u00a356,858, on top of the track-ready price of a T560 combine (\u00a3300,376) or S770 (\u00a3343,028).\n\nW-series\n\nDeere has also announced a few small changes to the W-series, which is made in Finland by Sampo.\n\nThe firm\u2019s smallest machines now have a bigger cab, increased unloading speeds and a new control layout with a \ncolour touchscreen, which stores basic threshing settings.\n\nThe W330 PTC, which will carry a maximum of a 16ft header, now has the option of lateral tilt on the header to help \nfollow ground contours and a quick coupling system for hooking up the header.\n\nW- and T-series straw walker machines have also been given a few internal tweaks to the cleaning shoe and \nseparator drum that have improved throughput in most crops.\n\nTractors\n\nOn the tractor front, Deere has rolled out its CommandPro joystick to the full range of 6R machines, after originally \nlaunching it on the 6230R and 6250R at the end of 2016.\n\nIt works in similar fashion to a Fendt joystick to control forward speed and includes 11 programmable buttons for the \nlikes of the linkage, pto, spools and guidance.\n\n\n\nThe tractors also get JD\u2019s 8.4in Command Centre 4200 display, which is 20% bigger than the 4100 and can be \nused to control guidance, section control, data documentation and Isobus-ready machines.\n\nLower down the horsepower ranks, the 90-125hp 5R range can now be specced AutoTrac-ready from the factory, \nrather than fitting a steering wheel motor.\n\nOther new features include an extendable pickup hitch with hydraulic push-back via one of the spools and variable-\nratio steering, which reduces the number of turns of the wheel from lock to lock.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nKramer has continued the expansion of its telehandler range in the UK with two new machines.\n\nSince exiting from a manufacturing agreement with Claas, the German company has reached an agreement for its \nmachines to be sold through John Deere dealers. There are no immediate plans to paint the loaders in Deere's \nlivery, however.\n\nThe KT407, one of two new ag-spec machines, is powered by a 136hp Deutz four-cylinder engine running through \na three-speed hydrostatic transmission.\n\nThe only significant changes from the older KT357 are in the lifting department \u2013 it is specced to lift 4t and reach to \n7m, which has been achieved by bolting a bigger counterweight to the back end.\n\nThe second new model is the 4.2t lift, 9m reach KT429, designed for straw contractors. In simple terms, it's a tuned-\ndown version of the firm\u2019s 5.5t telehandler, carrying a smaller engine, lighter transmission and axles, and no \ncounterweight.\n\nSee also: Video: On test \u2013 Kramer's KT357 telehandler\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe UK government should be actively encouraged to invest in lab-grown meat to secure a more sustainable food \nsource for the nation, according to a report from the Adam Smith Institute.\n\nResearcher Jamie Hollywood and Adam Smith Institute president Madsen Pirie argue that lab-grown meat offers a \n\u201ccleaner, healthier, cheaper\u201d alternative to traditional meat, and is also less harmful to the environment.\n\nTheir report, Don\u2019t Have a Cow Man: The Prospects for Lab Grown Meat, predicts that the commercialisation of lab-\ngrown meat is likely to happen within five years as the cost of producing a \u201ccultured meat\u201d burger has fallen to \naround \u00a38 per piece.\n\nSee also: 3 high-tech solutions coming to improve UK farm productivity\n\n\u201cWith an ever-growing global demand for meat and the mounting environmental concerns around sustaining \nagricultural practices, cultured meat is a welcome and positive innovation that can (and no doubt will) revolutionise \nthe food industry,\u201d says the report.\n\nIt explains that lab-grown meat is produced by extracting stem cells from animals, such as a cow, and then growing \nand multiplying them in a lab to create an edible meat.\n\nThe report concedes that scientists have not yet fully mastered how to grow lab-grown cells to form the same \ntexture as \u201cactual\u201d meat. But once these obstacles are overcome, cultured meat production \u201ccould create meat \nwhich is identical to traditionally grown meat\u201d.\n\nTake our poll: Is lab-based meat the next food revolution?\n\nGreen opposition\n\n\n\nBut researchers say that the production and consumption of lab-grown meat will be opposed by farmers and some \nenvironmental campaigners \u201con the grounds that it is not natural\u201d.\n\nIndeed, on Tuesday (28 August) Missouri became the first US state to pass a bill banning the use of the word \n\u201cmeat\u201d to describe \u201clab-grown meat\u201d. Under the ruling, food manufacturers in the state are now banned from \nmarketing products from lab-grown meat or meat substitutes as \u201cmeat\u201d.\n\nThe bill was passed following a petition filed to the US government by the US Cattlemen\u2019s Association, over the \nlegal definition of terms such as \u201cmeat\u201d and \u201cbeef\u201d. The association argues that the legal definition of meat must be \nreserved for foods produced only from a living, reared and exercised animal.\n\nAHDB report\n\nIn the UK, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) published a report in July exploring the rise \nof plant-based products and the implications for meat and dairy. This includes a section on cultured meat (grown \nfrom cells).\n\nThe AHDB report says: \u201cProponents argue it is a largely cruelty-free and more environmentally sustainable method \nof producing proteins.\n\n\u201cThus far, the process has been successful in growing a mince-type substance that could limit the applications. \nHowever, plans are in place to develop this more widely.\u201d\n\nThe report explains that Tyson Foods, one of the largest food processors in the US, has funded Future Meat \nTechnologies to invest in research in cultured meat. But the AHDB says the \u201cbigger limitation\u201d is that \u201cit is not yet \neconomic to produce, with costs per kilo in the thousands of dollars\u201d.\n\n\u201cFuture Meat Technologies has claimed it can bring prices down from around $800/kg to as little as $8/kg for its \ncell-cultured meat in six to eight months,\u201d adds the AHDB report.\n\nSeven key claims from the Adam Smith Institute report\n\n1. By the end of 2050, it is estimated that the demand for meat and drink will increase by 70%\n\n2. Lab-grown (or cultured) meat could mean a cut in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions of 78-96% while using \n99% less land\n\n3. Five years ago the cost of a burger made with meat grown in a lab stood at $250,000, but now the price tag has \ndropped to just \u00a38\n\n4. With farming using up to 70% of antibiotics critical to medical use in humans, cultured meat has the potential to \nsolve the looming antibiotic resistance crisis\n\n5. Cultured meat also will reduce cases of food poisoning, such as campylobacter from chicken, as unlike on farms, \ngrowth takes place under controlled conditions\n\n6. Cultured meat would help lower the risk of zoonotic infection (infection transmitted to humans via animals)\n\n7. Some animals currently endangered or deemed \u201cat risk\u201d could have meat generated from their cells to provide \nup-market diners with more exotic dishes\n\nVote in our poll\n\n(function(d,s,id){var \njs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(d.getElementById(id))return;js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src='https://e\nmbed.playbuzz.com/sdk.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}(document,'script','playbuzz-sdk'));\n\n\n \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe US Farm Progress Show is the place to see all the latest in farm machinery developments, including GPS kits.\n\nThese range from top-grade, super-accurate RTK setups to those designed as a cheap way to get into farm \nguidance equipment.\n\nFarmer Edge\n\nHiding away in a yellow tent was tech company Farmer Edge, displaying its range of telematics and satellite \nimagery options.\n\nThe latter use the company's Dove satellites to take photos of a farmer\u2019s field, with a resolution down to 3.1m, every \n2.7 days during the growing season, sending normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images back to the \nfarmer.\n\nThese colour-coded maps can show the early onset of a disease outbreak or the beginning of a pest attack for a \ncost of $1.50/ac. Catching outbreaks early means that rather than a blanket approach, pesticides can be used only \non the affected areas.\n\nEmploying a team of 75 developers has also allowed Farmer Edge to build a Canbus hack for any colour of \nmachine, allowing yield maps to be shared from one machine to another.\n\nSee also: High-tech drilling kit unveiled at US Farm Progress Show\n\nThe company openly admits that it probably isn\u2019t popular with the mainstream tractor makers, as its tech  allows \ngrowers who run multiple-branded fleets to be able to process information from the machine.\n\nThe option for a Fendt sprayer to take yield data and guidance lines from a John Deere combine and use it to apply \nvariable-rate chemical, without the need for an unlock code, is something farmers are very keen to have, the \ncompany says.\n\nOnce the system is fitted \u2013 which takes less than an hour \u2013 the farmer can see exactly where each machine is via \nthe company\u2019s web-based Farm Command platform.\n\nHere, each machine displays everything from live fuel levels and current rpm to combine yield data, viewable from \nanywhere with an internet connection.\n\nThe option to see live locations and previous paths is also possible \u2013 ideal if you need to check how the harvest \nteam is getting on.\n\nThe company has equipped most major machines but says adding new ones is not an issue, as the device will \nlisten to the new machine and send data back to the engineers, so they can interpret the signals and write this into \nthe code for future installs.\n\nThis costs about $3/ac but quickly gets around the headache of not having machines talking to one another.\n\nWheelman offers GPS for any machine\n\nSelf-steering GPS might seem a pipedream for many small farmers, but for $3,495 (\u00a32,700) you can have a bolt-on \nkit that offers accuracy to about 10cm and can be fitted to a combine, sprayer or tractor.\n\nDeveloped by AgJunction, the kit can be ordered online, then fitted and calibrated by the farmer in less than an \nhour, with the main job being to remove the steering wheel to mount the new one.\n\n\n\nOnce the device is fitted and connected to a live power source, a smartphone or tablet is used to calibrate the \nsteering. The app is available on both iOS and Android platforms and the three-step process needs to be done only \nonce, on the initial install.\n\nThe only other installation job is mounting a small antenna dome on the vehicle's roof and running the wire back to \nthe steering wheel unit.\n\nCrucially this needs to be sited on the centre line of the machine to achieve the necessary accuracy. On a combine \nit would be mounted at the front of the cab, whereas on a tractor it would need to be closer to the rear.\n\nAgJunction gave farmers visiting FPS the chance to try fitting the unit to a 45-year old John Deere 4230, proving \nthat it can be used on any tractor.\n\nCrucially, the unit can run without the need to be within range of a phone signal. There is also no dealer costs or \nongoing subscriptions and there is a 24-hour call centre to sort any issues, which can connect straight to the device.\n\nThe company says that payback should be around 90ha and the software allows various implements and machine \nwidths to be stored in memory, so switching between a sprayer and cultivator can be done at the touch of a button.\n\nCurrently, there is only the option of straight-line guidance but future developments will include contours and curved \nline steering.\n\nThese will be updated on to existing units automatically, along with Wheelman Flex, which will allow easily \nswitching of the unit between machines.\n\nOutback Guidance\n\nSome UK users will be familiar with Outback's GPS products, which include a range of auto-steer units from \nreplacement steering wheels to full RTK systems.\n\nIn particular, the American company has been supplying Claas with all its steering software for the past 15 years, \nalthough the German giant rebrands every unit with its own logo.\n\nPride of place on the stand was the Claas S10 equivalent screen, which retails for $11,995 (\u00a39,314) and offers \naccuracy to 2.5cm.\n\nIt uses proportional controls, rather than the hydraulic ram versions on less accurate models.\n\nThe S7 screen has about 15-20cm accuracy and costs an appealing $5,995 (\u00a34,655), with the system able to be \ninstalled by the farmer. All the hydraulic hoses are colour coded for plug-and-play set-up, too.\n\nOutback GPS has 150 dealers in North America and is direct competitor for Trimble, GreenStar and Topcon. \nHowever, due to the Claas tie-up we are unlikely to see Outback-branded GPS gear in the UK.\n\nDigi Farm\n\nDigiFarm reckons it can offer a cheaper route to an RTK-accurate GPS signal using its multiple base stations \nacross the United States.  \n\nOnce online, the system uses its real base stations to create a virtual base station close to where you are working, \nso the signal is strong and lines are repeatable year on year.\n\nThe signal can work through any RTK system available on the market today, including GreenStar, Trimble and \nTopcon, for an annual cost of $900 (\u00a3698) per unit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nMartin Button cut all his winter barley in June this year, which was the earliest in living memory, even for him, on \nlight sandy soils on the edge of the New Forest.\n\nCereal crops mature early in this southwestern corner of Hampshire and he has a strategy of early drilling and high \nseed rates to prepare for the dry spring which he knows will come.\n\nAdd in early nitrogen fertiliser in February and direct drilling, then it is clear that all his focus is on getting crops well \nestablished before the spring winds funnel up the River Avon valley and dry out his soils.\n\nMany growers have suffered in this summer's heatwave with crops wilting, but he is used to droughts and focuses \non crops suited to light land, such as rye, soya and millet, as well as wheat and barley.\n\n\u201cEverything is aimed at getting crops growing quickly and conserving moisture before dry weather comes to stress \nthe plants from May onwards,\u201d he tells Farmers Weekly.\n\nSee also: Cover crops help give structure to light Norfolk soils\n\nToo light to grow wheat\n\nHe has spent the past 32 years on the 1,600ha Bisterne Farms estate, latterly as arable and environmental \nmanager, covering a range of soil types from land too light to grow wheat down to rich river meadows in \nenvironmental schemes.\n\nCereal crops are all autumn-sown so they can get well established to cope with the spring drought, while break \ncrops of maize, fodder beet, linseed and soya are spring-sown, with the emphasis always on quality rather than \nquantity.\n\n\u201cWe are never going to get barn-busting yields on these light soils so we look to win premiums for the crops we \ngrow,\u201d he says.\n\nThat means Skyfall milling wheat, winter rye grown for Ryvita and winter barley for seed, and all are drilled early to \nget good establishment and good rooting before the winter months.\n\nWinter barley drilling starts in the second week of September on the estate where he is in charge of managing \n320ha of arable land just south of Ringwood, and some six miles from the coast at Christchurch where the River \nAvon enters the sea.\n\nNo blackgrass\n\nAll winter cereals are drilled by the end of the September, and he readily admits that the early drilling regime \nrequires the absence of blackgrass on his light well-drained land, but he still needs to hand rogue any wild oats \nwhich creep into his fields.\n\nDrilling seed rates are pushed up to encourage more tillering and improve their survival rate, with winter wheat \ndrilled at 188kg/ha and winter barley at 150kg/ha.\n\nThe next move in the strategy to lessen the effects of drought came three years ago with a switch to direct drilling, \nand a 4m-wide John Deere 750a drill was bought as part of the farm\u2019s conservation tillage approach to retain \nmoisture in the soil.\n\n\u201cCrops look better in the winter as they establish quicker and show better rooting, and we have not seen any yield \ndip from the changeover,\u201d he says.\n\nOnly plough when absolutely necessary\n\nPloughing is now used only when absolutely necessary to correct severe problems, as he has seen the no-tillage \napproach adding organic matter to the top 10cm of the farm's soil.\n\n\n\nThe one downside of no-tillage is that slugs have become a problem, and a stubble rake has to be employed before \ndrilling and slug pellets after drilling.\n\n\u201cBut the soils have improved as they are more friable, with more organic matter and more earthworms,\u201d he says.\n\nNitrogen rates are a conservative 200kg/ha on winter wheat and 170-180kg/ha on barley, and he is keen to get on \nas early as possible in February with a 30-40kg/ha dose to get crops growing.\n\nHe started cutting his 44ha of Tower winter barley on 27 June this summer, about two weeks earlier than normal for \nthe farm, with a respectable yield of 6-7t/ha for such a dry year. The farm\u2019s medium-term average is just over 8t/ha.\n\n\u201dThe start to harvest was the earliest in my time on the estate, whereas we would normally start around my birthday \non the 12 July,\u201d he says.\n\nGood specific weight\n\nThe barley was harvested very dry at 12% moisture, but despite the dry weather and the barley grain appearing a \nbit pinched it produced a good specific weight of 70kg/hl.\n\nSome 60ha of Skyfall wheat yielded 6.9t/ha when the farm\u2019s average is a touch under 8.5t/ha, and the 60ha of \nwinter rye was a bit lower than the farm\u2019s five-year average of 7.5t/ha.\n\nLooking back, it was tough growing year with waterlogging in the early spring and then nine weeks without rain \nwhich saw small patches of crops became very dry and dying off, he says.\n\nWith little moisture around at the grain filling stage, he saw a lot of blank grain sites in the wheat at harvest and \ngenerally small heads in the barley.\n\nFor the future, the estate is looking to rotate grassland which is used for a 520-strong dairy herd across the arable \narea to improve soil fertility, and this will start soon with new leys planned and old leys ploughed up for growing \nwinter wheat.\n\nAll the cows are cross-bred and include Friesian, Jersey and Norwegian Red blood. They can be kept outside for \nmost of the year which fits in with the estate\u2019s philosophy of improving its light soils with grazing livestock.\n\n\u201cWe are looking after the soil for the future, and we are also using plenty of compost and farmyard manure where \nwe can,\u201d he adds.\n\nHalf the straw from the estate is usually chopped each year, but this harvest virtually all was baled and sold due to \nthe high prices and demand from livestock farmers further west.\n\nWinter barley at Bisterne Farms \n\nVariety \n\nTower\n\nDrilling date \n\nSecond week of September\n\nSeed rate\n\n150kg/ha\n\nSpring nitrogen\n\n170-180kg/ha\n\n\n\nHarvest date \n\n27 July 2018\n\nYield \n\n6-7t/ha\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWith maize being cut or close to harvest in many parts of the country, growers need to focus on the clamp, believes \nNeil Groom, technical director at Grainseed.\n\nMinimising clamp losses will be even more important this year, with low forage stocks due to the summer drought.\n\n\u201cWe have foragers with high chopping capacities enabling large areas to be quickly cleared but it\u2019s important to load \nthe clamp well to get efficient fermentation and reduce losses,\u201d said Mr Groom.\n\nSee also: Poor growing conditions could see reduced maize starch yield and lodging\n\nClamping best practice\n\n\u201cThe MGA [Maize Growers Association] rule of thumb is that you need 25% of the crop weight arriving in the clamp \nevery hour in steel weight rolling the clamp.\n\n\u201cSo, if every 10 minutes there is a 15-tonne trailer arriving, that\u2019s 90 tonnes of maize an hour and so you need \naround 25 tonnes of tractors rolling the clamp \u2013 that\u2019s a buckrake and an extra rolling tractor,\u201d Mr Groom advised.\n\n\u201cWith larger clamps we have seen the use of compactor rings, piste bashers and even vibrating rollers consolidating \nthe silage. All of these require shallow layers of maize to be pushed up by the buckrake because you cannot \ncompact deeper than 6in per layer.\u201d\n\nMr Groom has advised farmers to:\n\nPay particular attention to the shoulders of the clamp and the clamp walls, which should always be lined with a \nplastic sheet to prevent clamp acids eating into the concrete\n\nKeep rolling the top of the clamp once it is filled to get really good consolidation in the top metre of the clamp where \nheating can occur\n\nSheet with an oxygen barrier film, a bird net and weight down with gravel bags or mats to keep the sheet in close \ncontact with the silage\n\nKeep the clamp sealed for four-six weeks to ensure perfect fermentation and allow time for the starch grains to \nsoften ensuring cows can digest all the starch in the rumen during feeding\n\nIf you wish to open the clamp sooner, consider making a small clamp for feeding first or using a modern silage \nadditive which can remove oxygen from the clamp and ensure a faster fermentation\n\nFarmers Weekly sampling sites\n\nSampling for Farmers Weekly in Harleston, Norfolk, Toby Tibbenham has predicted he will be harvesting next \nweek.\n\n\u201cLast week\u2019s dry matter surprised us and we have had a careful look around all our crops this week,\u201d said Mr \nTibbenham.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want some really high energy maize for next winter\u2019s ration and so I think cutting next week will be perfect and \nthis will allow us to get the fields cultivated and drilled into wheat in good conditions.\u201d\n\nThe crops on Farmers Weekly sampling sites in Devon, Carmarthenshire and Derbyshire are also maturing nicely \n(see below).\n\nIf good weather continues, maize will be ready to chop in September in most areas of the country, predicted Mr \nGroom.\n\nMaturity on six sampling sites\n\nSite\n\nDrill date\n\nHeight above sea level (m)\n\nCrop dry matter 29 August\n\nIncrease from last week\n\nPetworth, Sussex\n\n2 May\n\n50\n\nHarvested\n\n \n\nHarleston, Norfolk\n\n6 May\n\n30\n\n31.5\n\n+0.6\n\nCrediton, Devon\n\n1 May\n\n118\n\n29.4\n\n+3.3\n\nTicknall, Derbyshire\n\n4 May\n\n67\n\n28.7\n\n\n\n+2.0\n\nLlandeilo, Carmarthenshire*\n\n6 May\n\n32\n\n26.3\n\n+3.6\n\nSRUC, Dumfries, Scotland PLASTIC\n\n30 April\n\n45\n\n21.2\n\n+0.9\n\n * Variety Es Picker, all other sites are Es Ballade.

the market.\n\nMuller has held its liquid standard litre with a constituent content of 4% butterfat and 3.3% protein at 29.5p/litre for \nnext month.\n\nSee also: Cross-bred cows v Holstein: How they compare\n\nThe processor, which does not announce price holds publicly, will pay its 650 direct suppliers the same price as for \nSeptember, following a 1.5p/litre price rise for that month.\n\nMeanwhile, cheese processor Barber\u2019s has held its manufacturing litre with a constituent content of 4.2% butterfat \nand 3.4% protein for its 150 producers at 30.68p/litre for the same month.\n\nThe cheese manufacturer said that the price hold came after some of its producers had been severely affected by \nthe drought, which had added 2-3p/litre to costs of production.\n\n\u201cPeople look at national production and think it is business as usual,\u201d said Barber\u2019s milk supply manager, Michael \nMasters.\n\n\u201cBut the reality is production changes are localised and our producers are located in a geographically small area \nand will likely be below forecast come the winter.\n\n\u201cFarmers have supported national production by feeding extra silage, whole crop and concentrates, which have \npushed their costs up.\u201d\n\nMr Masters added that one Barber\u2019s producer had doubled the amount of cake he fed each cow from one to two \ntonnes a year \u2013 highlighting the pressure on producers' bottom lines.\n\n\nHowever, the current customer and retail market was extremely challenging, with imported cheese and butter as \ncompetitive as ever, said Mr Masters. \n\nDairy markets\n\nThe latest UK dairy wholesale prices saw average values for butter, cheese and cream all climb in August off the \nback of slow trade across the continent.\n\nUK milk production dropped by 0.4% for the week ending 25 August \u2013 equal to 100,000 litres of milk, according to \nAHDB Dairy.\n\nThe levy board said that if production continued in this vein until the end of the month, it would be 1% ahead of \nforecast at 1,011m litres, and 8m litres behind its level for August last year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe poultry industry must renew efforts to market entire chickens to British consumers, as opposed to breast meat \nalone, if it is to make the most of an increasingly likely \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.\n\nIn the UK chicken breast is by far the preference for shoppers, with thighs and wings largely exported to European \nand third countries.\n\nThe value in a whole chicken is made up of the breast meat sold at a premium to the domestic market, plus \nadditional revenue from exporting unwanted parts.\n\nSee also: How to review your farm business to prepare for Brexit\n\nBut if Britain leaves Europe with no trading agreement in place this setup will be fundamentally disrupted, a new \nreport has found.\n\nA paper written by the think tank ResPublica and funded by the British Poultry Council warns that crashing out of \nthe European single market is the worst possible outcome for the British poultrymeat sector, which has an annual \nturnover of \u00a37.2bn and employs nearly 90,000 people.\n\nIt suggests the price of chicken \u2013 which accounts for nearly half of the meat eaten in the UK each year by volume \u2013 \nwill rise, and the door to cheaper imports produced to a lower standard may open.\n\nAs a result, a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d market could emerge, with poorer consumers forced to buy imported chicken while more \naffluent shoppers enjoy fresh British poultry that \u201chas some of the highest health, environmental and welfare \nstandards in the world\u201d.\n\nLabour compromised\n\nIn addition, the report found that labour availability within the sector had already been compromised by the vote to \nleave Europe.\n\nWith 60% of the workforce coming from Europe, its cost had already risen by 25%, it suggested.\n\nFinally, the standards of production could slip if the EU\u2019s framework for environmental controls, such as ammonia \nregulation, are not adopted rapidly by an independent British government.\n\nBut it argues against pushing for 100% self-sufficiency in poultry production, saying: \u201cGenuine food security is \nachieved through diversifying supply and diversifying the transport network through which food is brought to the \nUK\u201d. \n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAn investigation has been launched by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland after a man died while \nbaling silage.\n\nCaldwell Moore, a 67-year-old

\nand is investigating the circumstances.\n\n\u201cOur sympathy is with the man\u2019s family at this most difficult time.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAs agricultural vehicles go, the Ariel Nomad might seem like a pretty extreme choice. OK, so it's not a proper \nworkhorse, but it could be the perfect way to unwind, and with genuine off-road ability, sharp handling and explosive \nperformance, it promises to be as much fun on a dirt track as it is on the race track.\n\nIt comes from Ariel Motor Company, a family-run business based in Somerset that\u2019s backed up by some seriously \nheavyweight engineering talent.\n\nBoss Simon Saunders worked for Porsche and Aston Martin before setting up his own business and reviving the \nhistoric Ariel name in 1999. Since then, Ariel cars have gained a reputation for top-notch build quality and supercar-\nslaying pace.\n\nThe Nomad draws heavily from the track-focused Ariel Atom, with the same mid-engined rear-wheel drive layout \nand exoskeleton construction.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s far more to it than simply an Atom with raised suspension \u2013 every single piece of the chassis is \ndifferent and there are only a handful of components shared between the two cars.\n\nSee also: Land Rover Defender gets \u00a380,000 Twisted treatment\n\nDesign\n\nThe heart of the Nomad is a 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine taken from the US-market Honda Civic Type S.\n\nEven in regular form it produces a very healthy 235bhp, but this example has been fitted with the optional \nsupercharger kit, which takes it up to 300bhp and 300Nm of torque.\n\nCombined with a kerb weight of just 680kg, this gives the Nomad a better power-to-weight ratio than a Ferrari 458. \nIt\u2019s quicker off the line too, with a 0-60mph time of just 3.2 seconds.\n\nAriel builds each car to order and there is a faintly bewildering array of options.\n\nChief among these are three different suspension packages (loosely equating to road, off-road and track) plus a \nchoice of six different wheel and tyre combinations.\n\nThere\u2019s also an on-road pack that includes lights, switch gear and an IVA test.\n\n\n\nFurther down the list you\u2019ll find a variety of performance upgrades, including a big brake kit, a lowered final drive \nratio and, of course, that supercharger.\n\nOn road\n\nIt goes without saying that the Nomad is seriously fast, but what\u2019s more impressive is the way the performance is \ndelivered.\n\nIt\u2019s an intensely visceral experience, with the road close enough to touch through exposed chassis tubes and the \nspine-tingling howl of the supercharger just behind.\n\nBut it\u2019s also surprisingly well-mannered. On dry tarmac there\u2019s loads of traction, while the unassisted steering \nchatters with feedback and the chassis seems to pivot directly around the driver's hips.\n\nThe Nomad is quite unlike anything else on the road. Despite its generous ground clearance, the seat is mounted \nso low and the suspension is so well controlled that you\u2019re never really aware of being in an off-roader.\n\nIt\u2019s closer in character to lightweight sports cars such as the Caterham Seven or the Ariel Atom, but it feels different \nto those as well. The sense of occasion as you thread yourself \u2013 Dukes of Hazzard style \u2013 through the roll cage is \npriceless. \n\nThe details are brilliantly engineered too. Somehow the Honda gearbox feels even better in the Nomad than it does \nin the Civic Type R, while the pedals are perfectly set up for heel-and-toe.\n\nLikewise, the unservoed brakes offer plenty of stopping power and good pedal feel. The only real downsides are \nlimited rear visibility and the fact that it\u2019s difficult to lean forward at junctions when you\u2019re strapped into the four-point \nharness.\n\nOff road\n\nThe quality that most defines the Nomad is its versatility. It\u2019s an immensely rewarding car to drive on the road; \ncapable of keeping up with just about anything on four wheels, but you can also drive it straight on to a field or a \nfarm track. And that\u2019s where the real fun begins.\n\nIt\u2019s predictably easy to overwhelm the road-biased all-terrain tyres when you\u2019ve got 300bhp at your disposal, but \nthere is a reasonable amount of grip, aided by the standard-equipment limited-slip differential.\n\nThe options list includes proper mud terrain tyres, which would obviously improve things further. What\u2019s more, you \ncan specify features such as a raised air intake, Fox dampers with hydraulic bump stops and even a winch.\n\nWith the adjustable suspension in its off-road configuration, the Nomad has 300mm of ground clearance \u2013 \ncomfortably more than a Land Rover Discovery \u2013 not to mention an approach angle of 71 degrees and a departure \nangle of 82 degrees. And at the end of the day, the cockpit is designed to be hosed out.\n\nOur verdict\n\nNothing else matches the Nomad\u2019s combination of on- and off-road ability. It\u2019s as exciting to drive as supercars \ncosting 10 times as much. And while it\u2019s designed primarily for fun, that\u2019s not quite the end of the story.\n\nOur test car came with a tow hitch (said to be capable of pulling about 600kg, although it\u2019s not officially rated for \nroad use). One Nomad owner apparently uses theirs to tow a mower, while another is said to have hitched up a \nslug pellet spreader.\n\nAnd that got us thinking: maybe it does classify as an agricultural vehicle after all\n\n \n\n\n\nSpecs: Ariel Nomad\n\nEngine 2.4-litre, inline four-cylinder petrol (with optional supercharger)\n\nTransmission six-speed manual with limited slip differential\n\nPower 300bhp @7,200rpm\n\nTorque 300Nm @4,300rpm\n\nTop speed 136mph\n\nFuel consumption 25mpg (est)\n\nKerb weight 680kg\n\nPayload 1,100kg including fuel and passengers\n\nTowing capacity 600kg (see text)\n\nGround clearance 300mm\n\nApproach angle 71 degrees\n\nDeparture angle 82 degrees\n\nPrice \u00a328,330 (basic price excluding road pack, supercharger kit or VAT)\n\nPrice (as tested) \u00a337,292 (inc supercharger kit, RFL and registration)\n\nPrice (as tested, inc VAT) \u00a344,689\n\nServicing 4,500 miles or 12 months\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIt\u2019s a year ago now since I went to bed with the local primary school teacher and woke up the next morning lying \nnext to one of the local sheep farmers.\n\nIn some circles, this might sound like one hell of a night out, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing that happens very often in \nrural Wigtownshire.\n\nI should explain that it\u2019s been exactly 12 months since Mrs McQ gave up her job as a schoolteacher to become a \nfarmer.\n\nSee also: Why we need good health and good role models\n\nI have to be honest and admit that I wasn\u2019t sure if she was doing the right thing at the time. I was fairly certain that \nonce she stopped bringing in her regular wage we would still be very happy \u2013 but stony broke until the end of time.\n\nHowever, Mrs McQ was more positive about our future than I was. She was confident that, once she started to \ndevote all of her time to the farm, our income would start to go up. This, in turn, would more than compensate for \nthe loss of her regular pay cheque.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long into the experiment before it became obvious that she was right about things on the farm starting to \ngo up, but it wasn\u2019t our income.\n\nOur feed bills have been on an amazing upward trend during the past 12 months. Our vet and medicine expenses \nhave also spiralled in an upwards direction. \n\n\n\nMrs McQ had obviously not allowed for 10 months of winter and two months of drought when she did her forward \nplanning last year.\n\nThen there was the misguided notion that we would be able to enjoy more time together now she was working at \nhome. The truth is, I see less of her now than I did when she went to school every day. \n\nShe disappears in the morning (with my sheepdog) and I never know when she\u2019ll turn up next. You\u2019ve no idea how \nannoying it is when she comes in after dark and tells me everything that she\u2019s done that day. Even worse, she \nrarely ever asks me what I think she should be doing next.\n\nWith our costs all up on the year and a steady decline in the price of prime lambs, my earlier predictions of a cash \nflow crisis this autumn seemed almost inevitable.\n\nI was just building myself up to having the \"I told you this would never work and if you keep on going this way we\u2019ll \nbe ruined\" conversation with her, when we took our Beltex rams to the auction mart at Carlisle last month.\n\nDammit, our rams have never looked better and many people in the auction mart were very quick and kind enough \nto tell us that.\n\nOur rams just looked as if someone had been taking good care of them every day. They had never been allowed to \ngo lame and they had received all their wormers, vaccines and vitamin drenches when they were supposed to \nduring the previous 12 months.\n\nAs a result, we achieved great prices in the market for our rams this year and our income will undoubtedly be up.\n\nOh, I just hate it when she\u2019s right. The expression \"every day\u2019s a school day\" has taken on a whole new meaning \nfor me.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFor most people, it is far from an easy conversation to have, but with World Suicide Prevention Day approaching \nthis Monday (10 September), it is really important to talk about an issue that has plagued the farming community for \nmany years, and continues to do so today.\n\nFarming consistently has one of the highest rates of suicide amongst all occupations. Despite a greater awareness \nof mental health within the industry, the sad truth is that more than one farmer a week takes his or her own life in \nthe UK.\n\nSee also: Suicide \u2013 investigating a farming taboo\n\nIn wider society, it is thought that any one suicide has a significant impact on eight other people. Within farming, \nbecause of the close-knit nature of our working and social lives, the impact goes far wider, devastating whole \ncommunities.\n\nThankfully, the topic of mental health does not carry the stigma that it once did in the farming community. As \nawareness is raised, the \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d mentality that has been entrenched in farming for generations is slowly \ndiminishing.\n\nPeople are beginning to open up and talk about how they are really feeling. But the fact that the number taking their \nown life is not decreasing shows that much more needs to be done to tackle this issue.\n\nFarmers have to overcome multiple issues on a daily basis, some of which are beyond control: fluctuating market \nprices, animal disease, the weather, lack of fodder, the potential impact of Brexit and rural crime to name but a few.\n\nCombine these stressors with the isolation and the pressure to make the farm business a success, and it is hardly \nsurprising that so many within the farming community struggle with poor mental health.\n\n\n\nEasy to underestimate\n\nWhen it comes to farming, it is very easy to underestimate just how important the mind is. Along with the body, it is, \nwithout doubt, the most important bit of kit a farmer can have. If the mind is not well maintained, the consequences \ncan be disastrous \u2013 not just to the farmer, but to the farm business and the farm household too.\n\nThere are several signals which, if seen over a prolonged period, may indicate poor mental health and all within the \nfarming community should look out for. These include eating more or less than normal, mood swings, lack of \nconcentration, feeling tense or useless, poor sleep patterns, fatigue and forgetfulness.\n\nPoor mental health can also lead to physical symptoms such as back pain, indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, \npsoriasis and migraines.\n\nHelp is at hand\n\nIf you have identified any of these signals and they are not normal behaviour, the next step is to talk to someone. \nYou can talk to your friends and family, other farmers, your neighbour or your GP. Or, if you are worried about \ntalking to those closest to you, for fear of becoming a burden, you can talk to FCN.\n\nOur confidential national helpline is open every day of the year from 7am-11pm and the majority of our volunteers \nare from a farming background. They can help farmers find the support they need and \u201cwalk with them\u201d on their \njourney to a more positive place in their lives.\n\nOn World Suicide Prevention Day, I would encourage all within the farming community to take a step back, look at \nthemselves and those closest to them and think about whether they might need help. Who knows \u2013 you may end up \nsaving someone\u2019s life.\n\nSee more information on The Farming Community Network website\n\nIf you are experiencing suicidal feelings or have been bereaved by suicide, call the FCN helpline on 03000 111999 \nor email help@fcn.org.uk\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis month, I\u2019ve been honoured with an invitation to speak at the fourth Women in Dairy Conference.\n\nThey might regret this, as I\u2019ll have a nine-week-old baby in tow who I\u2019m hoping will sleep during my presentation. \nMost farmers are used to juggling children with work, so hopefully they will understand.\n\nWomen in Dairy was set up by the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers and AHDB Dairy in 2015. In some \nways it is surprising that such an initiative hadn\u2019t been set up sooner. Ladies in Pigs has been around for over 20 \nyears, and Ladies in Beef since 2011.\n\nSee also: Fairer sex brings a touch of class to upland sheep farm\n\nHowever, both organisations focus on promoting the product to consumers. Women in Dairy is different, in that its \ngroups across the country are designed to develop the people rather than the market, with the aim to \u201cconnect, \nshare and inspire\u201d.\n\nI have been regularly attending discussion groups since I started farming five years ago, so I was surprised when I \nwent to my first Women in Dairy meeting to find that there were people there who had never been to anything like it.\n\nLack of provision\n\nThis seemed to be partly an issue of confidence, but also lack of provision. Other events are male-dominated, \ndespite Defra stats which show that the number of women running farms jumped by nearly 10% to more than \n25,000 between 2010 and 2013, not including female workers and farmers\u2019 wives/partners. \n\nmailto:help@fcn.org.uk\n\n\nIt\u2019s something of a clich\u00e9 that women are better at jobs like calf rearing because they have better attention to detail \nand are more nurturing than men. But that does a disservice to the other things they excel at, from driving \nmachinery to managing staff, financial planning and more.\n\nI\u2019ve reared calves successfully on our farm, but I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as a natural (my kitchen would look like a \nbombsite without my cleaner), and I must admit I\u2019m more comfortable at my laptop.\n\nI\u2019m lucky that farming gives me the opportunity to do both. As farms get bigger, the range of roles required becomes \neven more diverse, and there is more room than ever before for women to showcase their talents. It\u2019s therefore \nrefreshing that Women in Dairy meetings cover a wide range of topics from on-farm practical areas to strategic \nbusiness skills.\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nThe theme of this years\u2019 conference is \u201cbreaking barriers\u201d, something that really resonates with me as a new entrant \nwithout a farming background. The biggest barrier I have faced is finding opportunities to invest and grow a \nbusiness rather than just be an employee, but this affects men and women equally.\n\nIronically, I would probably have faced more barriers in my previous career in publishing, where most of the \nworkforce is female, but a disproportionate number of commissioning editors and directors are men.\n\nI may have been entitled to maternity leave and pay, but I wouldn\u2019t have had anywhere near the flexibility my life on \nthe farm gives me to be available for my children whilst retaining an important role in the business \u2013 all while living \nin a beautiful part of the countryside rather than a dingy flat in London.\n\nDespite the masculine image of farming, there are more opportunities than ever for women, which is why Women in \nDairy is such an important initiative.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA must-attend for the Buckinghamshire farming community, Bucks County Show is a one-day event that attracts \nthousands of visitors from the area.\n\nThis year the sun shone on the show, based just outside Aylesbury, which blends family fun and big main ring \nattractions with a focus on farming and rural life.\n\nThere was music in the main ring from the ever-impressive Royal Artillery Band.\n\nSee also: Top 5 must sees at UK Dairy Day\n\nWith around 100 cattle and sheep classes, there was an outstanding display of livestock. 29-month-old Dinmore \nmacaroon won the Limousin breed championship and overall continental title.

That gives a \nfalse impression of UK pig production, which is unique among the major pig-producing countries in its diversity of \nsystems.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis complaint was also upheld by the ASA, which said Viva! had not substantiated the claim and the ad was likely \nto mislead.\n\nAdvert ban\n\nThe third issue stated the ad contained content that was likely to cause distress without justifiable reason, but this \ncomplaint was not upheld by the ASA.\n\nThe authority concluded that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of, and Viva! must ensure its ads \ndo not mislead about, for example, how animals would be accommodated in intensive farming environments.\n\nDr Davies added: \u201cWe hope this ruling will discourage others from attempting this kind of dishonest campaigning in \nfuture\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe latest estimates put average pig production costs at 150p/kg for April to June, just 1p behind the EU-spec \nAverage Pigs Price for the quarter, according to AHDB Pork.\n\nThe rising cost of feed as a result this summer\u2019s drought has pushed up production costs by 9p/kg compared with \nthe the same quarter last year, while pig prices have fallen by 12p/kg over the same period.\n\nSee also: 5 steps to reduce antibiotics use in your pig herd \n\nDespite prices picking up by 2p/kg compared with the first quarter of 2018, a 5p/kg increase in production costs has \nmore than wiped out any benefit to producers' bottom lines.\n\nFeed accounts for about 60% of pig production costs, with higher finishing feed costs in this quarter making a \nparticular difference.\n\nAs a result, many producers have chosen not to use as much finishing feed in the 12 months to June 2018, with the \nknock-on effect being lower daily liveweight gains, according to the levy board.\n\nThe latest Agrosoft (pig software) data for the 12 months to June this year shows that feeder pigs have been fed \nmore and taken to higher weights, leading to a longer spell in the rearing unit.\n\nThese longer times have led to a reduction in the number of pigs that can pass through a unit in a year, further \nincreasing costs per pig.\n\nAs a consequence, the average daily liveweight gain and feed conversion ratio for the UK rearing herd have both \nworsened.\n\nThese factors, combined with a high post-weaning mortality rate as a result of the prolonged wet winter, have put a \nfurther burden on production costs.\n\nOutlook\n\nFeed prices are expected to continue to rise, making it less likely that the average business will stay in the black.\n\nThe levy board did not anticipate any major gains in the pig price as global production levels have marched \nupwards.\n\nGlobal markets remained volatile as the Sino-US trade war escalates and African Swine Flu spreads across China.\n\n\nProducers can expect losses in the coming months as margins are already so narrow, according to AHDB Pork, but \nit stresses that this comes on the back of almost 60% of operators being profitable over the past decade.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nRural housing opportunities could expand through some of the measures in the government\u2019s National Planning \nPolicy Framework (NPPF), released earlier this summer, says Ros Trotman, associate solicitor at Thrings. \n\nAs well as enabling more small and medium-scale housing developments, the NPPF includes a new planning \nexception for the creation of an isolated new dwelling in [RT1] countryside, where this is created by the subdivision \nof an existing dwelling, such as a large farmhouse.\n\nSee also: How mediation can help resolve farm planning disputes\n\nThe document does not specify the number of new dwellings allowed by subdivision. However, conditions could be \nattached to the permission, for example tying the new dwelling to the farm in planning terms, so that it cannot be \nsold away from the holding.\n\nOther planning exceptions for new houses on farms under the old national policy persist, including where:\n\nThere is an essential need for a rural worker dwelling (including those taking a majority control of a farm business)\n\nThe new dwelling can be shown to be the most viable use of a heritage asset or would be appropriate enabling \ndevelopment to secure the future of heritage assets\n\nA redundant or disused building is used for housing and would enhance the immediate setting\n\nThe design is of exceptional quality\n\nThe NPPF also requires local authorities to ensure that 10% of all their housing allocations are on sites of one \nhectare or less. One hectare would accommodate around 30 new dwellings.\n\nPlanning authorities must also continue to support small affordable housing developments in rural locations where \nhousing would not normally be permitted (usually up to 10 new dwellings), with discretion to include some homes \nfor open-market sale on such sites.\n\nAffordable housing is managed by a local authority or housing association and is available to people eligible for \nhousing assistance and who have a connection to the local area.\n\nThe NPPF also introduces new entry-level exception sites, aimed at first-time buyers and tenants. These will be \nadjacent to existing settlements and must be no larger than one hectare and represent no more than 5% of the size \nof the existing settlement.\n\nPlanning conference\n\nRos Trotman and other planning experts will be speaking at the British Institute of Agricultural Consultants\u2019 rural \nplanning conference on 11 October at the Royal Berkshire Conference Centre, Reading.\n\nFor more information and to book for Delivering Rural Development in a Complex and Ever-changing Planning \nSystem, visit the British Institute of Agricultural Consultants\u2019 website.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPolice officers from across central and eastern England are joining forces to tackle the seasonal blight of illegal \nhare coursing on farms.\n\n\n\nWith harvest now complete, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex police forces \nare working in partnership with the NFU, Natural England and the CLA to tackle this criminal activity.\n\nHare coursing, which has been banned for more than a decade, sees greyhounds and other \u201csight\u201d hounds, such \nas lurchers, chasing a hare by sight, not scent.\n\nSee also: Hare coursing \u2013 what you need to know if your farm is targeted\n\nGroups of up to 50 people exchange large bets on the outcome, which is determined by the first dog to catch and \n\u201cturn\u201d the hare, or kill it.\n\nOperation Galileo is targeting hare coursing throughout the east of England.

Each row needs about 4hp, so an eight-pronged header draws just 32hp, far less \nthan the 200hp needed for a 6m wide mulching machine.\n\nCutting height\n\nPneumatic pressure cylinders help keep a constant cutting height maintained across the field regardless of ground \nconditions. Kemper says it tried using compression springs, but found that they pressed too deep in sandy soils and \nwere too weak to make an impact on a clay land.\n\nThe advantage of pneumatic cylinders is that the pressure can be controlled. And, when the forage harvester goes \nin reverse, the cylinders collapse and the trailing soil sampling units are lifted so that they don\u2019t bury into the ground \nand get damaged.\n\nContractors also have the option of raising the Stalkbuster out of work if customers don\u2019t want the stubble chopped \nto save costs.\n\n\n\nAvailability\n\nSeveral customers have been testing the Stalkbuster this year, with production set to start properly for next season. \nOnly an eight-row version is available initially, which is married to the 6m 460 Plus corn head with large drums.\n\nA standard 460 Plus corn header costs about \u00a371,000, and the Stalkbuster adds roughly \u00a320,000.\n\nAlthough that is a significant investment, Kemper says it avoids the need for a secondary pass with a mulcher after \nthe forager and so cuts out extra diesel and labour costs associated with mulching.\n\nMaize header specs\n\nMake Kemper\n\nModel 460 Plus (8 rows)\n\nWorking width 6m\n\nWeight 3,100 kg (incl. 350kg Stalkbuster)\n\nPrice \u00a371,000 (approx)\n\nStalkbuster power requirement 32hp\n\nStalkbuster price \u00a318,000 to \u00a322,000 (approx)\n\nWhat is a corn stalk borer?\n\nThe corn spear borer or common stalk borer lays its eggs on the maize plant at the end of June. After 10 days the \neggs are released and the caterpillars chew their way down the stem, causing the plant to become severely \nweakened and all but stopping cob production.\n\nThe plant can also buckle and cause fungal infestations in the cob. A heavily affected crop can give a yield loss of \nup to 40%. The caterpillar then overwinters in the chopped stalk pipe just above the ground, after which it pupates \ninto a butterfly in the spring and the cycle repeats itself.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA \u201cbarbaric\u201d attack on a farm in Cambridgeshire has left three fallow deer dead and a large stack of straw \ndestroyed.\n\nCharlie Rand was alerted to the fire in his field in Fowlmere in a phone call from his brother at about 3am on \nSunday (2 September).\n\nWhen Mr Rand went to investigate, he found his biggest straw stack, approximately 1500t, was well alight.

Ferric phosphate \nwas already being applied to the metaldehyde-free buffer zones 10m from the field boundary.\n\nWhen comparing performance of metaldehyde and ferric phosphate \u2013 he has seen no difference.\n\nIntegrated approach\n\nMr McCowan takes an integrated approach, using cultural controls and only using pellets on his wheat, rape and \npotato crops when needed.\n\nThe cultural measures include cultivating early to help encourage slug eggs to dry out and good straw \nmanagement. For example, he chops and spreads rape straw to minimise areas harbouring slugs.\n\nHe also rolls fields after drilling, as slugs don\u2019t like firm seed-beds.\n\nTop tips for getting the most from ferric phosphate\n\nGeoffrey Bastard, Certis\u2019 regional technical specialist, outlines his top six tips for those looking to maximise their \nferric phosphate applications.\n\n1 Field history\n\nStart by thinking about the field history, the previous crop, soil type and weather conditions.\n\nThese all need considering on a field-by-field basis before doing anything else.\n\nFor example, this year\u2019s dry and warm conditions mean that on very light ground slug populations may be non-\nexistent, but on heavier land that\u2019s had rainfall, slug populations will be active.\n\nBe aware that slugs can quickly repopulate and thrive at the first onset of rainfall.\n\nTaking a total field perspective will help to develop a holistic approach and maximise slug control.\n\n2 Assess slug pressure\n\nFerric phosphate should always be used as part of an integrated pest management approach and monitoring for \nslug pressure before application is vital.\n\nTo make sure you get the most out of applications and apply at the right time, monitor slug numbers using a slug \nmat or a simple piece of plastic with layers mash underneath. Place traps overnight and check early in the morning \nwhen slugs are usually active.\n\nFor oilseed rape crops, the treatment threshold is four or more slugs to justify slug pellet applications.\n\n3 Pellet choice\n\nIt\u2019s important to choose a high-quality ferric phosphate pellet that spreads well and is durable.\n\nThe four main characteristics that come together to form a good pellet include size, which should be between 2mm \nand 3mm, uniform shape, crush strength over 3kg and a density over 0.7kg/litre.\n\n\n\nThe aim is to have a pellet that is uniform, durable, rainfast and has anti-moulding properties. This all means the \npellet will spread well and survive in the field without leaching, even after rainfall.\n\n4 Calibration\n\nEnsure that pelleters are calibrated for ferric phosphate pellets with a maximum width of 24m to ensure good \ncoverage.\n\nIf using both ferric phosphate and metaldehyde on-farm, ensure that both the setting for spread pattern and rate are \ncorrectly adjusted between the two products.\n\nTo achieve this, carry out a calibration test on both products and ensure that the operator is trained in the different \nspread patterns, dose rates and how to adjust settings accordingly.\n\nFinally ensure that baiting points and pellet dose rate are relevant to the slug pressure in each individual field.\n\n5 Application\n\nApplication of ferric phosphate should only occur once thresholds have been reached.\n\nThe active can be used on all arable crops and should be applied with a maximum dose of 7kg/ha. In high-pressure \ncases, up to four applications of can be made as long as the maximum total dose does not exceed 28kg/ha/crop.\n\n6 Be aware of the mode of action\n\nAlthough both ferric phosphate and metaldehyde essentially do the same thing, kill slugs, their mode of action \ndiffers.\n\nWith metaldehyde, growers are used to seeing dead slugs and slime trails on the surface, but with ferric phosphate \nslugs migrate underground to die.\n\nTherefore, when assessing treatment efficacy of ferric phosphate, monitor the crop for damage rather than looking \nfor dead slugs.\n\nHow the Severn Trent Farm to Tap scheme works\n\nFarmers in certain catchments are eligible to join the scheme, which offers farmers payments to reduce \nmetaldehyde levels in water by switching to ferric phosphate.\n\nIn the scheme, farmers can earn up to \u00a38/ha hectare and there is a further bonus if water levels are less than \n0.1ppb, with water tested fortnightly from September to early December.\n\nDoug McCowan is about to go into his third autumn in the scheme and last year, his water levels were below \n0.1ppb, triggering the bonus.\n\n \u201cAll in all, it was just over \u00a31,000, which covered the cost of 1.5 applications,\u201d he says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBuyers of UK land are used to having a house and buildings included on the sales particulars.\n\nA hotel or beach, however, is less common \u2013 but it does happen.\n\nFarmers Weekly has been looking at some of the more unusual offerings that have recently sold or are currently on \nthe market.\n\nSee also: Summer land launches feed much-needed supply in Scotland\n\n\n\nAgents often speak of a \u201cflight to quality\u201d when describing buyers who invest in best-in-class.\n\nIt takes on a different meaning in the case of Langar Lodge in Leicestershire, which offers a World War II airfield as \npart of the sale.  \n\nNo actual flights will be landing however.

American ranchers are \nexpected to put pressure on the Trump administration to push for improved access to UK beef markets as part of \nthose talks, and they will be encouraged by Monday\u2019s promise of better access to the EU.\n\nAt present, US beef exports to Europe are limited by a 45,000-tonne quota for grain-fed, hormone-free beef.

Weekly\n\n\n\nLandowners who have a listed farmhouse on their property should consider seeking professional advice before \nmodifying nearby old farm buildings, to avoid breaking the law.\n\nFarm buildings that pre-date July 1948 may be subject to the same rules and regulations that govern the \nmodification of listed buildings, meaning owners require consent from their local planning authority before \nmodification.\n\nThese are referred to as \u201ccurtilage listed\u201d, which simply means that they are within the vicinity of the listed building.\n\nSee also: 5 tips to speed up planning applications\n\nFailure to seek formal approval from the local planning authority before maintaining or altering them is a criminal \noffence, and it is also illegal to allow their condition to deteriorate into a state of disrepair.\n\nThe maximum penalty for carrying out illegal works or causing them to be carried out (for example, by instructing a \nbuilder) is two years\u2019 imprisonment or an unlimited fine.\n\nIf minor changes are being made then listed building consent will be required, but if significant interventions are \nbeing proposed then both listed building consent and planning permission will be needed.\n\nIf either is refused then the project cannot proceed until another application is made that addresses the concerns of \nthe planning officer.\n\nWhich buildings fall under the criteria?\n\nDefining exactly which buildings are curtilage listed is decided by the local planning authority, which relies on \nguidance from Historic England or its devolved equivalent, says Rob Jones-Davies, business development \nmanager with diversification advice specialist Rural Solutions.\n\nHe says that as a rule of thumb, it is likely that buildings within 50m of a listed farmhouse will be affected, but as it is \ndecided on a case-by-case basis it is vital to clarify the status of the buildings before proceeding with a project.\n\nFinding that adjacent buildings are subject to additional restrictions will cause many landowners some dismay, \nparticularly when they are looking to make significant farmyard changes as part of a modernisation or diversification \nprogramme.\n\nPlanning authorities 'open-minded'\n\nBut Mr Jones-Davies says planning authorities are not blind to this difficulty and acknowledge that maintaining such \nbuildings can often cost significant sums of money.\n\nIf landowners can come up with a credible business proposal that preserves the features that are of interest, \nplanning officers are likely to be open-minded about sympathetic modifications.\n\nFor example, if the features that need to be preserved are mostly external, they may be amenable to sensitive \nchanges being made to the interior of the building, including a change of use.\n\nThis will be particularly likely if it can be demonstrated that the changes will unlock a new income stream, such as a \ndiversification, which will provide the funds required to keep the building in a good state of repair (see below).\n\nWhat is the law that applies?\n\nSection 1(5) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that any listed building also \nincludes any ancillary object or structure within the curtilage of the buildings, which forms part of the land and has \ndone so since before 1 July 1948.\n\n\n\nAs complying with listed building regulations often adds costs to building projects, and the law is deliberately vague \non what the curtilage definition is, the matter has come frequently before the courts as applicants have sought to \nhave listings overturned.\n\nThere is therefore a significant body of case law on the subject, which has generated three key factors that are \ntaken into account when assessing if a building is curtilage listed:\n\nThe physical layout of the listed buildings and their structure.\n\nTheir ownership, both historically and at the date of listing.\n\nThe use or function of the relevant buildings, again both historically and at the date of listing.\n\nA further summary of the legal position on curtilage can be found on the Historic England website. \n\nWhere to find out more\n\nHistoric England  is the body that keeps records of listed buildings in England and to which applications must be \nmade to add or remove buildings from the list.\n\nSimilar organisations exist in each of the devolved regions and a search of their databases can be made to find out \nthe listed buildings in your area in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\nHow a Gloucestershire family turned their curtilage listed buildings into a positive\n\nWhen John and Rosemary Barnes bought 202ha Whalley Farm, near Cheltenham, in 2016, they took on \nresponsibility for a Grade II listed farmhouse, a separately listed Grade II listed traditional Costwold stone barn, and \na curtilage listed tin-roofed calf shed.\n\nWith their son Henry and his wife Jo, they had been uprooted from their former farm near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, \nas the HS2 train line will go straight through their farmyard.\n\nThe 2011 Farmers Weekly Diversification Farmers of the Year decided to turn the costly upkeep of the buildings \ninto an opportunity by making them the centrepiece of a fresh diversification scheme.\n\nThey had initially set out to replicate the years of experience they had in running an on-farm wedding venue at their \nprevious farm, but local opposition to the perceived increase in traffic prompted a rethink.\n\nSwitch to holiday accommodation\n\nInstead they have now received approval for a 10-bedroom self-catering accommodation venue, which will be \naimed at large family getaways.\n\nTo make their destination extra attractive they will be building a swimming pool complex and stabling.\n\nA proportion of the accommodation will be in the traditional barn, which had previously been unsympathetically \nconverted into a three-storey office before before being listed in the 1980s.\n\nAided by Rural Solutions, they put together a proposal that highlighted the additional cashflow the diversification \nwould generate for the farming business, and enable a significant investment in the restoration of the listed and \ncurtilage listed buildings.\n\nUpkeep made easier\n\nFinding the resources to maintain the buildings would have been much more difficult had planning authorities \ninsisted that no modification was allowed, said John Barnes, forcing them to be left in their existing, uneconomical \nstate.\n\n\n\nHowever, Rob Jones-Davies warns that the changes will have to preserve the features the building is notable for, \nand planning officers will have clear \u201cred lines\u201d.\n\nHe says the Barnes family were fortunate that the previous conversion to the barn had been unsympathetic and \ntherefore planners were willing to look kindly on changes that would improve its standing.\n\nGiven that they were putting an offer on the table that would improve the listed buildings, it also improved the \nchances of the whole project, including new buildings, gaining approval, Mr Jones-Davies says.\n\nWhat to do if you want to make changes to a farm building that you suspect may be curtilage listed\n\nUse the listed building search on the appropriate website for the country you are in to check what information is \nalready available.\n\nIf doubts persist speak to a consultant who deals with planning matters \u2013 they may be able to help or put you in \ntouch with a specialist heritage consultant.\n\nIf the building is curtilage listed, file a listed building consent form with or without a planning permission application, \ndepending on the scale of the changes.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nUnsurprisingly, the family that run Shearwell Data, one of the major UK players in the tag and software world, are \nkeen on using technology to

We completely \nstripped out the lambing shed, which is 53 metres by 35, when we bought the farm. \n\nWe had to drill into the ground to create a clean feed face for the Keenan diet feeder, and to make a passage wide \nenough to drive down. That cost \u00a31,200 to drill the holes.\n\nAll the water pipes were in the roof and they would freeze, so we completely redid the water system so that all \nlambing pens have a water supply.\n\nIt\u2019s been a lot of work. We gutted everything apart from one run on the back wall, which we use to run sheep along \nto footbath. Footrot is the biggest problem we have because of the weather, although we have reduced it by 50% \nthrough vaccination.\n\nSam It makes it a lot easier because all the ewes are in one place, so there\u2019s less need for the stock box and quad \ntrailer. The ewes will be in bays of 80 and we can move a bay at a time.\n\nThere are 150 lambing pens at full capacity \u2013 we tend to have five foot square pens for the triplets and four foot \nsquare pens for everything else.\n\nJames We can build the pens as needed with the lambing pen sides.

This has made feeding a lot easier. \nBefore we had it, we were feeding bales, shear grab silage and chucking barley around.\n\nEverything apart from finishing lambs is now on a total mixed ration (TMR) and we have separate rations for the \ncalving cows, dry cows, fat stock and ewes.\n\n\n\nEmma and I looked at the numbers the other day and two years ago, before TMR, the stores were averaging 0.7kg \ndaily liveweight gain. This year, it is 0.99kg a day. We have had to raise the roof in some of the sheds, but it is \nworth it to have a bigger feeder.\n\nJames Feeding and bedding with the straw chopper can now be done by one bloke by lunchtime, but if there are \ntwo of us, we can be done by 10 or 11am, whereas it used to take a lot longer.\n\nWhat is the best invention on farm?\n\nJames The Jimny has got to be up there. The buggy we had before was costing us a lot each year in maintenance \nso we bought a 2008 Suzuki Jimny last autumn for \u00a32,000 and adapted it, in total costing around \u00a35,000.\n\nSam It\u2019s great \u2013 it has heating, air con, radio. It\u2019s got a rear-locking diff, we changed the wheels on it and the back \nbox tips up.\n\nWhat has been a real bargain buy?\n\nJames The Pottinger forage wagon was a bargain. It had done 500 acres and we bought it for \u00a338,000 when it \nwould have been \u00a365,000 new.\n\nWhat couldn\u2019t you live without?\n\nRichard The radios. Everybody has a radio because mobile phone signal is so bad around here. The system cost \naround \u00a310,000, but it\u2019s the best investment we\u2019ve made in some years.\n\nJames They have a \u2018man down\u2019 feature, which sends an alarm if the radio is lying down for a certain amount of \ntime. It can be annoying if you put your radio on the dashboard, but it\u2019s good to have if you have someone working \non their own.\n\nHow have your shed adaptations helped with labour?\n\nRichard It\u2019s as much about safety as labour-saving. In each of the calving sheds there are 10 calving pens, which \nare mainly 10ft. They have a self-locking yoke and gate, which can be used to steer cattle and can be adapted to \nallow for caesareans or calf suckling.\n\nAll the pens have a back door for safety, which is really important as people are often working alone. If you\u2019ve got \ncontrol of the animal, it makes all the difference.\n\nAll the pens have individual adjustable drinkers, so we don\u2019t have to take buckets in. We try to design everything to \nbe as easy as possible to use.\n\nSam The fat lambs on slats are fed through an automatic feeder. The Portequip feeder is piped into the bulk feed \ntank through an auger system and has a sensor which triggers a refill when the lamb creep feed falls to a certain \nlevel.\n\nWhat other handy tools do you use in the lambing shed?\n\nRichard The warming box has earned its keep. It\u2019s powered by a fan, with four compartments \u2013 it\u2019s actually big \nenough to put a calf in. You can use one end to keep milk warm and then you can put weak lambs in it to get them \ngoing.\n\nJames We have one whiteboard on the small hut in the middle of the lambing shed and we work a collar system. \nDifferent colour collars are put through the hand hole on the pen sides \u2013 each colour means something different \nand the key is on the whiteboard.\n\n\n\nFor example, this year a green collar on the pen meant there was a weak lamb. This makes it easy for people to \nknow what\u2019s going on because there are usually five or six of us around the shed, moving ewes and lambs. The \nmilk bar for the orphan lambs has helped save time feeding them too.\n\nRichard We fit a temporary ramp in our sheep race to prevent backing up. Sheep run over it and jump down it, but \ncan\u2019t get back up it when reversing, so it keeps them flowing well.\n\nHow do you use all the data you\u2019re collecting in the sheds?\n\nSam When you\u2019re weighing cattle in the new crush, you can see their current daily liveweight gain as well as three \nprevious weights, so you can see instantly if one animal is going backwards or if they all are, they might need \nworming or something.\n\nIt\u2019s a vet crush, so has a safe area at the back of the animal for AI or anything else.\n\nRichard We can use the weight data to make instant decisions, so we can get shot of lambs if they\u2019re fit or if they\u2019re \nnot doing well, so we don\u2019t waste time feeding them or get price deductions for going overweight.\n\nAnd I use the data to look at the financial performance of the whole flock, so I can see which ewes are making the \nmost money. I ran a report on all the mule ewes we bought in and found that the top three all came from the same \nflock.\n\nSam We can also see which fields are producing the better daily liveweight gains and compare performance \nbetween groups. It might be because of red clover, for example.\n\nWho does all the building work?\n\nSam Most of the building is done in-house. We built the pens for the lambing shed and the calving pens. We\u2019re \nlucky that we can borrow labour from Shearwell.\n\nAnd where do the design ideas come from?\n\nJames We design everything ourselves, mainly because of cost and lead time. A lot of the ideas come from \noverseas as we travel a lot, particularly to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWhat is next on the wish list?\n\nSam We\u2019re investing in machinery so that we can do more with one person because we\u2019re always dividing our time \nbetween the farm and Shearwell. A feed-pushing robot is next on my list. We spend a lot of time when the sheep \nare in pushing up feed.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make it up the slopes in the yard, so it\u2019ll be limited to certain buildings, but we can \nuse it in the cattle sheds before the ewes come in. It\u2019s not cheap, but hopefully we will be able to get some grant \nfunding on the next round to help with 40% of it.\n\nAnd I want to get more cow brushes. The store cattle love the one in their shed \u2013 they didn\u2019t know what to make of \nit when it first went in, but after two hours, they were queueing for it. It gets the straw off their backs too and gives \nthem a nice shine, which is good for market. See the cow brushes in action in this clip.\n\nWe could also do with a bigger tractor for foraging. We have a John Deere 6930 chipped to 200hp at the moment, \nbut it struggles up the steep hills.\n\nRichard I\u2019d like them to stop spending money!\n\nJames He says that, but he\u2019s always the one spending!\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nSet on the fringes of Lexington, the University of Kentucky\u2019s Coldstream Dairy unit is a fount of research for dairy \nhealth efficiencies.\n\nIn the pursuit of cow comfort, the university erected a purpose-built shed in 2016. Housing 124 cows, the building is \ndesigned to optimise production and herd health.\n\nEach of the 130 pedigree Holsteins is fitted with a number of recording devices which measure everything from \ntemperature and activity to rumination.\n\nSee also: What\u2019s In Your Livestock Shed: \u00a35k sheep shed transformation\n\nHerd manager Joey Clark has been at the centre of the new build and has seen the dramatic difference it has \nmade.\n\nFarm facts\n\nCows milked twice daily\n\nThe herd of 130 averages 11,566 litres a cow a year at 3.9% butterfat and 3% protein\n\nAll-year-round calving\n\nAbout 121ha of crop and pasture\n\nLactating cows kept indoors, and replacements and youngstock both grazed and indoors\n\nLactating cow TMR is 55% forage/45% concentrates: corn silage, alfalfa, haylage, whole crop and processed feed \nmix to provide 25kg of dry matter per cow per day\n\nHow much did it cost and did it come in on budget?\n\nThe budget was \u00a3390,000 and we spent the entire budget.\n\nThere were additional costs associated with research-related items and part of those were donated or discounted. \nThese costs would have been an additional \u00a3156,000.\n\nWe would like to have made further investments, including an automatic scraping system and a concreted walkway \nto the parlour.\n\nWhat are the shed specifications?\n\nThe 150ft x 150ft (2,136sq m) shed is set up as loose housing, with two pens at either side of the barn that can be \nroped into three sections to divide up cows for management and research purposes.\n\nIt was designed for 124 cows, allowing for 100-110sq ft per cow.\n\nA central lane allows tractor access to deliver feed, while two other alleys, floored with rubber matting, give the \ncows access to feed, water, sprinklers and cow brushes away from the bedded area. The surface means these can \nbe scraped out easily.\n\nThe shed has an open ridge vent along the apex for ventilation and it has been positioned to catch the wind for \nnatural ventilation.\n\nThe sides of the shed are open but have automatically adjustable curtains to protect the cows from the weather, \nwith five temperature sensors around the barn.\n\n\nWhat devices have you installed to improve cow comfort?\n\nThe barn has six Big Ass Powerfoil X3.0 fans installed overhead, which are integrated into the automatic \ntemperature and humidity sensor system that monitors conditions for maximum cow comfort.\n\nThe three central alleys have overhead Yellow Jacket fans which work with a misting system to cool the cows. The \nnew barn has helped quite a bit for us in terms of heat stress in the lactating cows.\n\nThe whole barn is lit with Big Ass Light Washdown LEDs, which are wet-rated fixtures that can be hosed off when \nthey get dirty.\n\nThere are also six grooming brushes, three in each of the two cow alleys.\n\nWhat did you have in mind when designing the shed?\n\nThough cow comfort was a top priority, planning for the future meant location was also very important when \ndesigning the shed. We planned it so that when we build a new parlour, access will be easy.\n\nMaking sure the shed would work with research projects was also important. Not only can each pen be split into \nthree, the alleys can be split via gates, with access to a water trough, feed and brushes in each section.\n\nYou\u2019ve also installed green bedding. Tell us more.\n\nThe cows were moved into the shed on 21 April 2016, but before that they were in free stalls with either water \nmattresses or rubber cow mats. The unit is now using sawdust and cow manure for bedding.\n\nOne of the main reasons behind this was the high level of phosphorus on the university\u2019s land, which means we \ncannot always apply slurry directly. Instead, we were paying someone to take it away. Now the composting binds \nthe phosphorus and makes the manure more usable.\n\nThe bedding is tilled twice a day \u2013 taking about 25 minutes each side of the barn \u2013to incorporate air and to keep \nmoisture levels managed, with a target of 50-55% dry matter.\n\nIn the winter we have to be more diligent about keeping the moisture level down. Though this takes around the \nsame time as the previous system with free stalls, which had to be hand-raked to redistribute the sawdust, the work \ncan now be done on a tractor.\n\nThere\u2019s no smell from the bedding and even when temperatures are just above freezing, it continues to compost, \nwhich is all down to the ventilation of the barn.\n\nWhat difference has the shed made?\n\nAs well as drastically improving cow comfort, moving to the new shed has boosted milk production.\n\nWe were averaging 32-33 litres a cow a day, but now it\u2019s around 36 litres. And we\u2019re no longer getting a drastic \ndrop in production during the summer months. In our old shed we would lose 3.6-4.5 litres a day.\n\nThe increase in yield is also helped by better access to feed, which is pushed up to the central feeding alley by a \nrobot. The sprinklers also encourage the cows to eat more on a hot day.\n\nOn top of this, the somatic cell count (SCC) has more than halved, from 250,000-300,000 cells/ml to about 110,000, \nmeaning the unit now gets a quality bonus on its milk cheque.\n\nIn addition, there have been no hock abrasions over the past two summers and although hoof growth hasn\u2019t altered, \nwe have seen a big reduction in digital dermatitis.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite feature?\n\n\n\nThe cows love the shed, especially the green bedding. If I come out at night, they are all lying down. The cows are \neasier to manage, and it was definitely a worthwhile investment.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCompound feed prices are expected to rise by between \u00a325/t and \u00a340/t for winter deliveries between November \nand April.\n\nThis would put an 18% protein high-energy dairy ration in the \u00a3240-\u00a3250/t range for bulk full loads for an average \n150-cow herd.\n\nEnergy feed costs have risen the most, with barley worth just \u00a35/t less than wheat.\n\nSee also: Tax and finance advice when expanding your farm business\n\nHowever, with some northern and Scottish barleys looking like they might not make malting grade, feed barley \nprices could lose some ground in future, widening that gap again, suggested Thomas Baines-Sizeland, feed \nbusiness manager at AF Group.\n\nMost feed ingredients are available but not plentiful.\n\nThe protein market has seen prices reduce slightly in the past few days (midweek), with HiPro soya at \u00a3320/t-\u00a3325/t \ndelivered spot and no increase for October.\n\nThe US soya harvest is set to rise to a record 366m tonnes and US-China trade issues are putting pressure on \nprices. Having said that, the weak pound is adding price pressure for feed buyers here.\n\nRapemeal, by contrast, at \u00a3240-\u00a3245/t spot looks expensive against soya.\n\nThe price and supply squeeze is turning farmers\u2019 attention to alternative feeds such as co- and by-products \u2013 but \nthese are increasingly being sent to in-house AD plants by their producers, for example by Scottish distillers and \npotato processors.\n\nBrewers draff grains are costing \u00a343/t-50/t, also in a tight market and about \u00a310/t up on a year ago.\n\nBritish Sugar this week released its first limited allocation of beet pulp feed which was snapped up almost \nimmediately and looks like being priced at about \u00a3220/t-\u00a3224/t on to farm from November, about \u00a340/t more than a \nyear earlier.\n\nThere is uncertainty about the supply of distillers' dry and wet feed from the northern bioethanol plants, with one of \nthese widely rumoured for a maintenance shutdown in the next few months. This would disrupt supply of a valuable \nalternative feed.\n\nAF Group supplies feed nationally and Mr Baines-Sizelands has seen a trend to more farmers using unmineralised \nblends supplemented on farm with bought-in minerals, saving on compounding costs.\n\nThe use of molasses with straw is also increasing, although Mr Baines-Sizelands cautioned against high-protein \nmolasses for sheep.\n\nHe also said the high price of raw material and the market volatility meant some compounders were unwilling to \nquote prices beyond January.\n\nFarmers could book tonnage with the price to be agreed later, but not many were taking up this option.\n\n\u201cMost are holding back from committing to winter tonnage at present,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAnother feed supplier, based in the north-west, said that as well as high raw material prices, compounders were \nseeing big increases in fuel bills and other running costs, while driver availability was a real issue in some areas. \nThis was all adding to feed costs.\n\nFeed market factors\n\nHigh wheat, barley and maize prices are keeping energy feed costs up:\n\nBarley-wheat price gap could open up again as the extent of barley malting quality potential becomes known.\n\nRecord world soya harvest predicted \u2013 366m tonnes \u2013 helping to keep a lid on protein price rises.\n\nWeakening pound raising prices further for imported raw materials.\n\nRecord world maize production \u2013 but increased production will be outweighed by a bigger increase in consumption.\n\nAD plants taking an increasing tonnage of material such as distillers grains and vegetable waste which in the past \nwould go into livestock feed.\n\nRapemeal looks an expensive protein source compared with soya.\n\nUS-China trade issues weigh on market, in general depressing soya prices but also giving potential volatility.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers in Wales have six weeks to apply for up to \u00a350,000 of grant funding to tackle on-farm pollution.\n\nThe Sustainable Production Grant (SPG) expression of interest window opened on Monday (September 3) with a \nfunding pot of \u00a36m.\n\nGrant money will be available for 40% of a project costing between \u00a330,000 and \u00a3125,000 in total, meaning farmers \nwill be able to claim between \u00a312,000 and \u00a350,000.\n\nSee also: How to reduce pressure on slurry stores and build new ones\n\nAs pressure grows on the farming industry to tackle pollution, the Welsh government has put the issue firmly at the \ncentre of this new round of SPG grant aid.\n\nThe scheme was last open in 2016 when it was massively over-subscribed.

However, done \nbadly, tubers can spoil or even rot in stores with losses rapidly mounting up. \n\nSee also: Midlands potato grower develops time-saving chitting system\n\nTo help get things right, the AHDB has updated its Potato Store Managers\u2019 Guide to provide the most recent and \ncomprehensive advice for potato store managers.\n\nAdrian Cunnington, the guide's author and the head of Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research, highlights the key \nupdates that will help improve storage practices for the upcoming season and beyond.\n\n1. Airflow\n\n\n\nVentilation is the fundamental aspect of potato storage, helping to dry and cool the crop when it is brought into store \nand remove respiration heat throughout the desired storage period.\n\nA well-designed potato store will have positive and uniform airflow, ensuring there are no hotspots which can lead \nto condensation build-up and increased risk of bacterial or fungal tuber disease and sprouting.\n\nGood airflow is easiest to achieve in bulk stores, as they are mostly ventilated under the stack.\n\nAir distribution is trickier in box stores. In fact, recent research has identified that in the poorest performing \noverhead throw systems, as little as 15% of the air discharged over the crop makes it to the end of the building.\n\nThis is because the delivery and return air will always take the path of least resistance, creating shortcuts and a \nsubsequent failure to ventilate the store evenly.\n\nAdvances in computer fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling can help farmers design new stores as well as upgrade \nexisting ones to improve airflow. For box stores, farmers are urged to invest in a divider curtain or plenum to \nseparate delivery and return air.\n\nThis alone has been shown to provide at least a twofold increase in air reaching the far end of the store.\n\n2. Leakage\n\nAir leakage has been identified as a major problem in commercial stores and can scupper the aim of potato storage \n\u2013 to create a controlled environment that keeps tubers in optimum saleable condition.\n\nLeakage from wind-induced ventilation leads to loss of control of the store environment and possible problems \ninclude condensation and sprouting.\n\nCombatting these issues through extra ventilation or refrigeration, without fixing the source of the problem, leads to \nincreased running costs and higher tuber weight loss.\n\nA leakage test for stores has been developed, which uses fans to subject the building to a pressure differential of 50 \npascals. An AP50 value is generated, expressed in cubic metres of air lost per hour per square metre of building.\n\nAn acceptable standard for brand new buildings is  3cu m/h/sq m. Older buildings, even if well maintained, are \nunlikely to achieve this, so  10 cu m/h/sq m is a more realistic target.\n\n3. Respiration\n\nIn a recently completed project, Sutton Bridge researcher Glyn Harper has revisited work carried out in the 1950s \non respiration rates in store, where the living tubers use sugars to respire, using oxygen and releasing carbon \ndioxide and heat.\n\nThe old data gave a snapshot in time, but his new research aimed to monitor respiration rates over long-term \nstorage periods and it was found that respiration rates stabilised, particularly at lower temperatures.\n\nFor store managers, this means that after the initial curing and temperature pull down, longer-term stored crops \nmight not need the same level of ventilation as first thought, leading to potential efficiency and energy savings.\n\n4. Sprout suppression\n\nIt is well documented that the potato industry is in the \u201cBe CIPC Compliant\u201d era, with the industry stewardship \ncampaign of that name promoting responsible use of the sprout suppressant chlorpropham to help maintain its \navailability amid concerns over residue.\n\nMr Cunnington stresses the increased importance of improving management and control of stores in order to apply \nsuppressants correctly and evenly for maximum efficacy and lower residues.\n\n\n\nHe adds that taking steps to minimise the need for sprout suppressants is worth considering, such as growing \nvarieties with long tuber dormancy and low-temperature tolerance (for example VR808 and Russet Burbank).\n\nThat's because lower temperatures can reduce sprouting, but can lead to quality issues in less tolerant varieties.\n\nWhere feasible, varieties should also be segregated by inherent dormancy into different stores, ensuring that only \nthe tubers requiring sprout suppression are treated.\n\nWith continuing concern over the long term availability of CIPC, alternatives should also be considered. Ethylene, \nmaleic hydrazide and spearmint oil are all cleared for use in the UK, but always check market acceptability before \napplication.\n\nThis may be particularly useful in 2018, after the hot summer has seen accumulated heat in tubers, causing \nsprouting in the ridges. This growth can be quickly checked with spearmint oil, for example.\n\n5. Disease identification\n\nOne key factor for store managers is to correctly identify the wide range of storage diseases and defects seen on \ntubers. \n\nTwo skin blemishes that are commonly confused are sliver scurf and black dot, which both affect saleability of \npotatoes for the fresh market.\n\nBlack dot is an infection only picked up in the field and not spread in the store, whereas silver scurf can be seed-\nborne, picked up in the soil or spread in store, so correct identification will help target management.\n\nIdentifying silver scurf by its characteristic silvery sheen is not reliable, so a 10x hand lens should be used to look at \nthe surface of the tuber. If short black thread-like conidiophores are seen, it is silver scurf. These are easily washed \noff.\n\nAlso at 10x magnification, black dot conidia appear as small, dispersed black dots, sometimes as small as a skin \ncell, and they are not removed by washing.\n\nFor silver scurf, warm and damp conditions encourage spread in store, so keeping temperature cool and minimising \ncondensation will reduce the risk of exacerbating the problem.\n\nBlack dot should be controlled in the field using longer rotations, clean seed, weed host and potato volunteer \ncontrol, and fungicides, with azoxystrobin offering a delay in disease development. Varietal susceptibility also \nvaries.\n\nAlthough black dot doesn\u2019t spread in store, it can worsen on the surface of affected tubers. Rapid pull-down to the \ntarget storage temperature will help slow development.\n\nMr Cunnington also highlights pink rot and watery wound rot as increasing problems and where these are identified \nat significant levels, infected crops should be removed from store and sold before the rots spread and break down.\n\n6. Temperature and condensation control\n\nAchieving and maintaining the correct storage temperature is crucial for preventing several issues, most notably \ncondensation in store. A condensation period of just one hour can allow a blemish disease to develop or rotting to \nbegin.\n\nEnsuring moisture does not appear in store is important and Mr Cunnington says a key parameter that managers \nneed to get to grips with is in-store temperature fluctuation.\n\nCondensation will occur when warm, moist air comes in to contact with cold surfaces. In store, this most commonly \nappears on poorly insulated building fabric and this moisture can drip on to the crop.\n\n\n\nHowever, condensation can occur on the crop itself when the air surrounding the potatoes is warmer than the \npotatoes themselves, or the potatoes\u2019 surface temperature is below the dew-point temperature of the air.\n\nTo avoid this, growers must have accurate control of temperature in store \u2013 ideally having fluctuations of +/- 1C or \nbelow \u2013 and Mr Cunnington stresses the importance of upgrading old stores to achieve this.\n\nFor those with long-term plans, consider investing in new, state-of-the-art stores with automatic control systems.\n\n7. Pull-down rates\n\nPotatoes can suffer bruising or other physical damage during the harvesting and handling process and these \n\u201cwounds\u201d need to be healed to minimise fungi and bacteria getting into tubers and causing storage problems.\n\nPotatoes have a natural defence mechanism whereby suberin forms between and below damaged cells, building a \nbarrier to infection. The rate of this wound healing or \u201ccuring\u201d is influenced by temperature.\n\nPrevious wisdom advised growers to carry out drying and curing and \u201cpull down\u201d to storage target temperature as \nseparate processes, but it is widely accepted that these are now carried out simultaneously.\n\nResearch has shown that a process called dry curing \u2013 where ambient air is used immediately on crops entering \nthe store to dry, cool and cure at the same time \u2013 significantly slows tuber disease development.\n\n8. Carbon dioxide management\n\nTuber respiration in store produces carbon dioxide, which accumulates in the atmosphere. Allowing this to occur \nwithout flushing the store with fresh air can compromise optimum fry colour in processing potatoes, as sugar levels \nare increased in the stored tubers.\n\nMr Cunnington says increased awareness of carbon dioxide levels in store is required and store managers should \naim to keep levels below 2,500ppm.\n\nModern automated systems use sensors to monitor levels and purge the gas out of stores when a threshold is \nbreached.\n\nIn older stores, simply fitting and running small extractor fans or ventilating the store to allow ambient air in for a \nshort period each day can help reduce the impact of the gas.\n\nHowever, store managers should be careful that this does not create a condensation problem.\n\n9. Health and safety\n\nAgriculture continues to hit the headlines regarding work-based accidents, and potato stores are a place where \nthere are many risks.

UK trade associations are being forced to back Brexit\n\n2. Senior UK trade officials don't understand Brexit basics\n\n3. Nothing is happening in Whitehall\n\n4. The UK is way behind on regulatory divergence\n\n5. FTA is the UK\u2019s best-case scenario\n\n6. New Zealand, Australia and the US are queuing to take up EU slack\n\n7. Lack of Brexit dialogue in the UK is baffling\n\n8. Russia ban will look like a picnic compared with Brexit\n\n9. Most EU dairy representatives don\u2019t care\n\n1. UK trade associations are being forced to back Brexit\n\nTrade associations representing UK agriculture, food and drink have approached DII to ask it to bring to light \nparticular issues, as they themselves are being prevented from criticising Brexit.\n\n\u201cUK trade associations know [Brexit] is a mess from a business perspective,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThey have been told from the highest levels of British government if you come and undermine Brexit, you are going \nto be cut out.\u201d\n\n\nMr Mulvihill told Farmers Weekly that trade associations were being threatened with a loss of influence or access if \nthey publicly expressed negative Brexit opinions.\n\n2. Senior UK trade officials don't understand Brexit basics\n\nSenior figures at the Department for International Trade thought the UK would be able to adopt existing EU free-\ntrade agreements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been into the Department of Trade and had a conversation with someone very, very senior and it dawned on \nme half way through the conversation that they did not know that they were going to lose the 53 existing free-trade \nagreements that the EU have.\u201d\n\nMr Mulvihill alleges that the senior figure thought the UK would just transpose the existing EU deals with the like of \nIndia, the United States, Japan and South Korea.\n\n\u201cI said, 'You\u2019re out, guys. You are back to zero'.\n\n\u201cI found that really scary when I saw officials who were supposed to be specialists that didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he added.\n\n3. Nothing is happening in Whitehall\n\nThere is virtually no Brexit planning going on in Whitehall when he goes to visit in his capacity as director of DII, \naccording to Mr Mulvihill.\n\n\u201cThere is a Tory party internal war that is taking up all political headspace,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any planning. I see a couple of papers on a no-deal Brexit. We\u2019ve seen a white paper which is welcome \nbut goes nowhere near giving businesses clarity as to what to do.\"\n\nMr Mulvihill said the EU faced a situation where the UK, the world's largest importer of cheese, could be off the \ncoast of mainland Europe with no deal in place in just six months. \n\n\u201cFrom a business or a political perspective, we are in a new era,\u201d he said.\n\n4. The UK is way behind on regulatory divergence\n\nWith just six months before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, Mr Mulvihill says work on regulatory divergence, \nessential for UK products to enter the EU post-Brexit, did not exist and planning was only just starting now.\n\n\u201cThere is no plan. There is a lot of saying, 'We will do our own labelling, we will do our own nutrition,' but since \nBrexit has been announced there has been 700 new EU laws affecting agri-food that need to be transposed in UK \nlaw.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018lift-and-shift\u2019 solution put forward by the UK has been made redundant already,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Mulvihill added that there was no body able to monitor or resolve UK/EU trade disputes either.\n\n5. FTA is the UK\u2019s best-case scenario\n\nThe best result for the UK would be a free-trade agreement with the EU, he said. However Mr Mulvihill pointed out \nthat sellers who had tried to export cheese to Canada under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement \n(a free-trade agreement between Canada and the European Union) or products to South Korea would know that \nthis sort of deal is not the same as access to the single market.\n\nHe added that the current from powerful elements in UK politics, suggesting that a no-deal outcome for the UK dairy \nindustry would be a good thing, would lead to untold damage to both the UK, Ireland and the EU.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom a trading and derivatives perspective a no deal is not a good outcome \u2013 the damage this potentially has to all \nof our industry is astronomical.\u201d\n\n6. New Zealand, Australia and the US are queuing to take up EU slack\n\nCheddar and butter tariffs under a World Trade Organisation (WTO) deal would wipe out the competitiveness of \nIrish and EU dairy exports into the UK.\n\n\u201cThe cost to Irish cheesemakers would equate to an extra 21.5c/litre (22p/litre). Best of luck fobbing a 50% price \nrise on the British consumer,\u201d said Mr Mulvihill.\n\nHe added that higher tariffs would lead to a 90% reduction in French and Irish cheese exports into the UK.\n\n\u201cThe British government will be looking to their friends the Kiwis and will have to do a damned bad [free trade] deal \n[for the UK] to make sure there are no price increases.\n\n\u201cI assure you, from being in Whitehall myself, people from New Zealand, Australia and the States are already \nbuzzing around waiting to take on that slack.\u201d\n\n7. Lack of Brexit dialogue in the UK is baffling\n\nMr Mulvihill said he was in disbelief after listening to Michael Gove\u2019s speech to 2,000 British dairy farmers at the \nNFU convention in Birmingham in March.\n\n\u201cMichael Gove delivered an absolutely fantastic speech to these farmers and he got a huge ovation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn March it was just 350 days until Brexit. What was Michael Gove\u2019s main topic within that? Fly tipping in the \nEnglish countryside.\n\n\u201cHe mentioned Brexit just once or twice in passing to 2,000 dairy farmers who don\u2019t know where their product is \ngoing to go or what trading arrangements they\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nMr Mulvihill said he found the whole situation \u201ccrazy\u201d and ended up dropping his speech on Irish dairy\u2019s work to \ncombat climate change, instead attempting to pick apart what Brexit might mean \u2013 which he admits \u201cwent down like \na lead balloon\u201d.\n\n8. Russia ban will look like a picnic compared with Brexit\n\nIt is important to remember the lessons learnt from the export ban to Russia implemented in August 2014.\n\n\u201cNo one figured on displacement of trade. The Finns, the Poles and the Irish couldn\u2019t export to Russia and all the \ntrade bounced back to the single market.\"\n\nMr Mulvihill said the ban resulted in a drop in Irish exports of 30%, despite just 1.5% of dairy shipments actually \ngoing direct to Russia.\n\n\u201cIf that scenario comes out again, I assure you a hard Brexit will make Russia look like a picnic,\u201d he said. \n\n9. Most EU dairy representatives don\u2019t care\n\nThe Irish dairy board director said the perspectives for Ireland and Britain varied substantially from what dairy \nindustry insiders thought on the continent.\n\n\u201cI seem to be one of the few voices [in the EU dairy association] who is even bringing up Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe attitude from the rest of Europe is: Bad decision. Sorry you\u2019re leaving but don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way \nout.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThe rest of Europe has moved on. They don\u2019t want to talk about [Brexit].\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGovernment plans to abolish farm subsidies and introduce a new system of environmental payments fall short of \nthe support needed for the sector, say industry leaders.\n\nThe government's long-awaited Agriculture Bill has met a mixed reception from farmers and environmental groups \n\u2013 with some praising its ambition and others voicing dismay.\n\nUnder the policy, direct payments will be phased out over seven years and disappear completely after 2027, to be \nreplaced by a new system of \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d.\n\nLegislation to deliver a new policy for agriculture after the UK leaves the European Union is being introduced into \nParliament on Wednesday (12 September).\n\nSee also: Agriculture Bill \u2013 Direct payments to be phased out by 2027\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove says his flagship Bill will reward farmers who protect the environment and enhance \nthe countryside for future generations.\n\nBut NFU president Minette Batters said the government must put the business of food and farming as well as the \nenvironment at the heart of its new legislation.\n\n\u201cThe NFU, alongside the whole food supply chain, has been absolutely clear about the essential ingredients for a \nprogressive, profitable and sustainable food and farming sector post Brexit.\n\n\u201cThese include comprehensive measures to improve the environment and productivity and tackle volatility alongside \nfree and frictionless trade and access to a competent and reliable workforce.\n\n\u201cThe Bill, as described in the announcement, falls short of our aspirations in these regards.\u201d\n\nThe Bill is being launched on Back British Farming day \u2013 the annual day when the NFU calls on politicians to \nunderline their commitment to agriculture.\n\n'Damaging for everyone'\n\nMs Batters said: \u201cIt is vital that in the future British farmers can continue to meet the food needs of a growing \npopulation.\n\n\u201cA future agricultural policy that ignores food production will be damaging for farmers and the public alike.\n\n\u201cThe public demand and deserve safe, high-quality, traceable, affordable food, whatever their income. And \nmoreover, they want British farms to supply that food.\u201d\n\nTenant Farmers Association chief executive George Dunn said at first sight the Bill fell \u201cmassively short\u201d of his \nmembers' expectations.\n\n\u201cIt fails to provide a comprehensive strategy for ensuring the sustainability and resilience of our domestic agriculture \nand the environment it supports.\u201d\n\n\"Focusing almost exclusively on public payments for public goods without having any clear plan for increasing \nproductivity is short-sighted and flawed.\u201d\n\nHaving nothing on improving fairness within supply chains or protecting standards in trade will leave domestic \nproducers in a highly vulnerable position, said Mr Dunn.\n\n'Seminal moment'\n\n\n\nBut the Country Land and Business Association was more positive.\n\nCLA president Tim Breitmeyer said: \u201cThe development of a new post-Brexit UK agriculture policy is a seminal \nmoment for the future of our countryside.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the government\u2019s ambition for a future where farming and food production go hand-in-hand with a \nhealthy environment.\u201d\n\nPlans to introduce an environmental land management scheme for farmers recognised the full range of public \nbenefits that farmers and land managers could deliver, said Mr Breitmeyer.\n\nA seven-year transition period \u2013 as outlined by the government \u2013 should be sufficient time to adjust to the new \nsystem, he added.\n\n\u201cProposals to reduce payments in manageable increments, spread across the farming industry, will enable \nbusinesses to avoid the risk of rapid change with no time to prepare.\n\n\u201cThe government must now ensure that further cuts align with the introduction of the new environmental land \nmanagement contracts to avoid any cliff edges for farm businesses.\u201d\n\nQuestion of funding\n\nEnvironmental groups have also welcomed the legislation.\n\nRSPB conservation director Martin Harper said the announcement offered a \u201cpositive outline statement of intent\u201d \nabout its ambition for agriculture and the countryside.\n\n\u201cThis feels like an important step forward \u2013 improving the sustainability of farming is key to realising the UK \ngovernment\u2019s ambitions to restore nature in a generation.\u201d\n\nThe big unresolved issue was funding, said Mr Harper.\n\nAs expected, there was no clarity on how the government intend to fund its policy beyond an existing commitment \nto maintain current levels of expenditure to 2022.\n\nSecuring funding beyond that date would be a priority, said Mr Harper \u2013 and something the RSPB should be able to \nstrike common cause with all farming unions.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe resources made available to back up the new policy will ultimately be the key test as to whether this \nBill is a success or failure.\"\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers will be able to use direct payments as a \u201cgolden handshake\u201d to retire from the industry under plans \ncontained in the government's Agriculture Bill.\n\nTo help new entrants get into the sector and give farmers flexibility to plan for the future, direct payments will be \n\u201cdelinked\u201d from the requirement to farm the land.\n\nSee also: Direct payments to be phased out by 2027\n\nThis will give farmers much greater freedom over how they use the money they receive until direct payments are \nphased out completely in 2027.\n\nThe government is also looking to give farmers the option of taking a one-off lump sum in place of all their annual \npayments over a number of years.\n\nRetirement fund\n\n\n\nSome farmers could use the money to invest in their business or diversify without having to worry about the \npaperwork that accompanies the basic payment scheme.\n\nBut others may choose to take the money as a lump sum to stop farming altogether and use the payment to \ncontribute to their retirement fund.\n\nDefra says this should make it easier for new extrants to get into the industry \u2013 and for existing farmers to expand \nby acquiring land.\n\nIt says allowing farmers to take payments this way meets a widespread desire for simplification.\n\nGood practice\n\nDe-linking will also remove the requirement to follow existing EU rules \u2013 as well as the system of payment \ndeductions that enforces them.\n\nThe change in the last remaining years until direct payments are finally abolished could help improve some of their \nmore onerous requirements.\n\nBut the government says all farmers will still have to comply with good land management and husbandry standards.\n\nIt says alternative enforcement mechanisms will be introduced before payments are delinked to ensure that good \nagricultural and environmental practice is maintained.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe AHDB has released an update to its drought impact report, examining the effects of the prolonged dry weather \nthis summer on each farm sector.\n\nThe levy board added that although the weather has since changed, many of the implications of one of the driest \nsummers on record were still being felt.\n\nSee also: Why growers must reduce reliance on pesticides\n\nCereals & oilseeds\n\nDairy\n\nPotatoes\n\nRed meat\n\nPigs\n\nCereals and oilseeds\n\nRain in the autumn and spring planting windows led to a poor start for crops.\n\nMay\u2019s dry weather helped growth above ground, but meant some spring crops\u2019 root structures suffered.\n\nDrought conditions peaked during yield-formation time, leading to concerns over yields and quality.\n\nThe dry weather allowed harvest to start up to two weeks earlier than averaged over the past five years.\n\nYields varied depending on region and soil type. Crops on heavier land generally performed better and were not far \noff the average. Crops on lighter soil suffered the most, with the effect on yield and quality varying greatly.\n\n\nWheat quality has been generally good, despite yields dropping back slightly on the five year average.\n\nBarley has seen variability in screening and higher levels of nitrogen than desired by maltsters.\n\nOilseed rape yields have been down. Reports have come in of growers harvesting early in the morning to guarantee \nadequate moisture levels.\n\nThe European drought, alongside weather concerns in the Black Sea region, have supported global prices.\n\nHigher domestic demand have helped physical prices, with some livestock-dense regions showing more movement.\n\nDairy\n\nMilk production dropped during the summer and was behind last year, but remains in line with AHDB Dairy \nestimates.\n\nMilk yields have held up relatively well, often at the expense of farmers\u2019 silage stocks and bought-in feed.\n\nConcerns about how reduced silage stocks and rising feed prices will hit milk production this winter.\n\nMilk-to-feed-price ratio has improved in the past few months, but is still running behind the five-year average. This \nmeans feed is less affordable and will put pressure on yields. If feed prices increase later in the year, producers will \nrequire farmgate price rises to prevent a fall in milk production.\n\nHigher GB slaughterings of dairy cows were recorded in the summer, but the resultant effect on volumes has been \nsmall.\n\nThe effects of heath stress on fertility rates will only become clear when calving figures are published.\n\nPotatoes\n\nPlanted area was negatively affected by the adverse weather \u2013 delaying planting and affecting growing conditions \nof the early crop.\n\nAHDB data from 2017 showed only half of the planted area had irrigation available \u2013 figures unlikely to have \nchanged this year.\n\nGrowers able to irrigate were largely able to mitigate the dry conditions, while adding costs and extra time to the \nprocess.\n\nGrowers without irrigation have seen yields negatively affected and more prevalent instances of skin freshness \nissues. Recent rain will have caused secondary growth for some.\n\nNew-crop prices have begun well this season, with the first free-buy WAPS price for 2018 far higher than in recent \nyears. The overall WAPS price has fallen back since then, but remains insulated by limited supply.\n\nMany are holding off lifting until crops bulk out.\n\nRed meat\n\nScant evident that beef and veal production has been affected in a large way.\n\nCow slaughter was already high, but increased during the drought\n\nThroughputs remained stable due to restrained demand, despite more slaughter animals being available.\n\n\nSupplies were withdrawn when grass growth began picking up.\n\nCarcass weights overall showed little change.\n\nEffect of drought is likely to be delayed until housing as most cattle were fed first-cut silage and grazed second-cut \nland.\n\nPigs\n\nAverage pork production between May and July was above year-earlier levels, with the prior winter conditions \noffering more of a problem for producers than the drought.\n\nAverage carcass weights across the period were above year-earlier level.\n\nThere are fears heat stress will affect fertility in pigs, affecting production in early 2019.\n\nConcerns remain for all livestock producers over winter feed supplies and costs.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe government\u2019s Agriculture Bill represents the biggest overhaul of UK farm policy since the end of the Second \nWorld War \u2013 and heralds the end of public support for food production, which has been in place since before that.\n\nThe 62-page document sets out plans to abolish direct payments to farmers in England and replace them with a \nnew system of public money for public goods \u2013 rewarding farmers who undertake environmental measures rather \nthan those who produce food. Other UK nations are expected to implement similar policies.\n\nSee also: Direct payments to be phased out by 2027\n\nCentral to the new policy will be an Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme. It will build on existing \nstewardship schemes familiar to many farmers, although the government says it will be less onerous and involve \nless bureaucracy.\n\nThe new system will be phased in over seven years, with the last direct payments to farmers made in 2027. The \nELM scheme will be piloted and honed over the same period and will be fully in place by the time direct payments \nend.\n\nGove\u2019s \u2018Green Brexit\u2019\n\nWidely anticipated following the government\u2019s Health and Harmony consultation earlier this year, the Agriculture Bill \nhas been welcomed by environmental groups keen to hold Defra secretary Michael Gove to his pledge to deliver a \n\u201cGreen Brexit\u201d.\n\nBut the document\u2019s emphasis on environmental measures has come as a bitter blow to farm leaders. They say the \nbill\u2019s failure to focus on the importance of food production threatens to undermine the agricultural sector at a crucial \ntime as the UK leaves the EU.\n\nPublic goods supported in future will include improvements in soil, air and water quality, protecting and enhancing \nwildlife habitats, providing public access to the countryside, protecting the rural environment, flood-risk mitigation \nand carbon reduction.\n\nHowever, the NFU says a future agricultural policy that ignores food production will be damaging to farmers and \nconsumers. Growers and livestock farmers need the right financial and policy framework if they are to compete in a \nvolatile global marketplace, it warns.\n\n\n\nThe government argues that there will be grants to support agricultural productivity. And it has promised to help \ncreate a viable futures market for agricultural commodities. It has also reserved the right to intervene if there is a \ncrisis in the marketplace \u2013 much as the EU does now.\n\nBut these measures are likely to be limited in their scope. The Agriculture Bill suggests such support is likely to last \nonly until 2028 or 2029. There is also a big question over the budget for the new policy, with no guarantee it will \nmatch current public expenditure on agriculture.\n\nFor many farmers, the coming decade will be a time to shape up or ship out. Direct payments make up more than \nhalf the income on many farms. Those unable to adjust to life without them are already being advised to consider \nthe offer of a lump sum to leave the industry.\n\nUsing a final financial incentive to encourage the older generation to retire is likely to go down well with younger and \nambitious farmers keen to get on. But others will see it as an insult and a threat to a cherished way of life that has \nlasted generations.\n\nMichael Gove clearly wants farming to be more of a meritocracy \u2013 standing on its own two feet rather than being \npropped up by subsidies. But it is important that the transition is properly managed and farmers are given a chance \nto thrive after public support is withdrawn.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBadger culling, which aims to prevent the spread of bovine TB, has started across England for a sixth consecutive \nyear, Farmers Weekly understands.\n\nAn industry source close to Defra said the badger cull had restarted on Monday, 10 September across many of the \nexisting 21 zones.\n\nThe source told Farmers Weekly that Natural England was set to announce the approval of culling licences for 10 \nnew zones.\n\nSee also: Analysis \u2013 is the badger cull in England working?\n\nThese include Avon, Berkshire, Derbyshire, Oxfordshire, Hampshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire as \nwell as parts of Wiltshire and Devon, two counties where culling licences are already in place.\n\n\u201cProgress has been really good,\u201d said the source. \u201cWe are getting to the stage where the boundaries are being \ncovered and we are starting to get successful control of badger numbers.\n\n\u201cThe results are tremendous. We have seen a big reduction in the numbers of new herd outbreaks, but also an \neven bigger reduction in the number of reactors being taken.\u201d\n\nNew culling licences\n\nDefra is expected to confirm later this week on its website that the government had granted new culling licences for \n2018.\n\nA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB is a slow moving, insidious disease which presents many challenges.\n\n\u201cThere is no single measure that will provide an easy answer and that is why we are pursuing a wide range of \ninterventions from cattle testing and movement controls to improving farm biosecurity, and a cull of badgers where \nthey are linked with herd breakdowns.\u201d\n\nThe government says bovine TB is the \u201cgreatest animal health threat to the UK\u201d.

Once the crop is at mature yield, the company says the grower can earn in the region of \u00a3900/ha \nnet margin.\n\nThe discounted pricing strategy is as follows (per ha):\n\n\u00a31,275 = 0-19ha\n\n\u00a31,250 = 20-39ha\n\n\u00a31,225 = 40-79ha\n\n\u00a31,200 = 80-99ha\n\n\u00a31,150 = 100ha+\n\nThe current base price is \u00a31,350/ha.\n\nSee also: How to unlock profits from marginal fields with miscanthus\n\nThe price includes the rhizomes (piece of an existing plant\u2019s root, from which a new plant can grow) and their \ndelivery, loan of planter, a planting tutorial and consultancy services.\n\nThe grower must cultivate the land to achieve a 10-15cm depth seed bed, provide a tractor to pull the planter, and \nprovide labour to operate the tractor and planter.\n\nAutumn muck spreading and ploughing is recommended before generating a fine tilth as close to planting as \npossible. The better the seed bed, the quicker the miscanthus will establish.\n\nGrowing opportunity\n\nMiscanthus provides a good opportunity for arable growers with unprofitable fields that are difficult to crop, because \nit will grow on virtually any soil type up to 120m above sea level.\n\n\n\nTerravesta claims there are numerous markets for the crop, which include long-term supply contracts with Brigg \nand Snetterton power stations, backed by 25-year agreements with the UK government.\n\nIt has also recently launched a domestic fuel range which is being trialled by Waitrose.\n\nHowever, miscanthus involves a two-year wait for a significant return following a costly establishment, and has had \na turbulent history.\n\nCompanies that dealt in the crop have in the past got into financial difficulty, huge player power station Drax \ncancelled its order and the government ended its support for the Energy Crops Scheme.\n\nTo get involved with Terravesta\u2019s discounted pricing structure, the company needs a signed term contract and \nestablishment contract, a 5% deposit and a sustainability data return by 30 September 2018.\n\nFor more information contact Jacob Duce on 01522 731 873 or email him jacobd@terravesta.com\n\nMiscanthus facts\n\nLow-maintenance crops with reliable returns\n\nGrows on virtually any soil type up to 120m above sea level\n\nTypically does not give full yield until third harvest\n\nHigher oil content than straw and generates less ash, so competitive as a fuel\n\nCan be grown independently as fuel for biomass boiler\n\nGrowers can opt to have it baled like straw or processed into pellets\n\nGrown from a rhizome (piece of an existing plant\u2019s root, from which a new plant can grow) rather than a seed\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA high-input strategy for crop protection products is generally essential in order to hit top yields in high-disease-\npressure situations, but one grower has set out to prove this does not have to be the case.\n\nThis season, disillusioned with this high-input, high-output strategy, Cornish grower Nick Dymond trialled growing a \ncrop of winter wheat with zero chemicals, and achieved 9.2t/ha \u2013 just shy of the yield \u201cceiling\u201d in the area due to \nseptoria pressure.\n\nEncouraged by the results, Mr Dymond is now scrapping his full chemical programme in favour of a low input \napproach, instead focussing on nutrition.\n\nSee also: How one farmer slashed his fertiliser and fungicide use in wheat\n\nTrailblazer\n\nName Nick Dymond\n\nProblem being solved Growers in high disease areas are not seeing the yields to justify the high fungicide spend, \nand want to try alternative methods of combating disease.\n\nApproach Completely cutting out fungicides in favour of completely meeting the nutritional needs of a crop so it is \nmore able to withstand disease.\n\nInconsistent yields\n\nmailto:jacobd@terravesta.com\n\n\nMr Dymond contract farms 406ha near Truro, of which 162ha is combinable cropping and the rest is in maize, grass \nand brassicas.\n\nBeing in the wetter West, where septoria and mildew are prevalent, Mr Dymond\u2019s total chemical spend is \ntraditionally between \u00a3250-\u00a3270/ha, but top yields of 10t/ha were only being achieved one year in six or seven.\n\n\u201cYields of 7-8t/ha is breakeven around here; 10t/ha provides a margin, but it\u2019s too difficult to consistently hit,\u201d he \nsays.\n\nBut static yields and the struggle to stay profitable are only part of the issue. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about profitability. As I get \nolder. my goals have changed \u2013 I\u2019m increasingly disappointed with the state of human health.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is probably degrading soils and there is the increasing amount of active ingredients being \nused, which is not far beyond the realms of reason to fear that it is causing a negative impact on human health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not organic, I\u2019m very much a conventional farmer, but like so many non-organic growers, I feel this route is \nunsustainable.\u201d\n\nFarm facts\n\n406ha pig and arable farm near Truro, Cornwall\n\n162ha in combinable crops, growing winter wheat and winter barley\n\nMin-till for eight years, typically using a McConnel Discaerator and a KRM cultivator drill. Looking to reduce tillage \nfurther, but no-till is not an option\n\nInstead, Mr Dymond has teamed up with independent agronomist Will Iliffe to trial an alternative approach based on \nthe work of Australian agronomist Graeme Sait, using plant nutrition to combat disease.\n\nRather than firefighting with chemistry and routinely applying one or two nutritional elements, more money is spent \non conducting comprehensive soil tests and addressing any issues before planting.\n\nThroughout the growing season, leaf sap testing reveals the nutritional needs of the crop, allowing specific nutrients \nto be applied before deficiencies weaken the plant.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to keep them robust, the theory being disease will pass over a stronger crop in favour of a weaker one.\u201d\n\nThis means total spend for the trial was only reduced to a minimum of \u00a3200/ha, generating a margin of \u00a350-\u00a375/ha.\n\nBut Mr Dymond says the aim of the trial is not really to improve margins and increase profitability.\n\n\u201cThe more I read about people who concentrate on soil health, the more I realise that profitability takes care of itself.\n\n\u201cIf you do what feels right, providing that is working with nature, then profitability falls into place.\n\n\u201cThe theory of profitability centres around cashflow anyway, but as soon as you start farming around the \nenvironment and making long-term decisions and investments in the land, then there often is no hard-and-fast \nfigures to put on a spreadsheet for what that is worth. It is hard to quantify.\u201d\n\nThe trial\n\nThree different approaches were trialled across 12ha using feed wheat variety Graham, which has a high resistance \nscore to septoria.\n\n1. Full chemical approach\n\n2. Reduced chemistry plus full nutrition\n\n\n\n3. Zero chemistry plus full nutrition\n\nWith the use of just one pre-emergence herbicide the zero-chemistry approach crop yielded 9.2t/ha, leaving the full \nchemical approach trailing at 8.7t/ha and smashing the original target of 5t/ha.\n\nWhile the unusually dry and hot weather this summer meant the septoria risk was undoubtedly lower overall, Mr \nIliffe says it did peak at two points; early on in the season before the weather dried up and again in early June.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know where this was going to go. Early on I was concerned about the level of septoria, but we got that \nunder control,\u201d Mr Iliffe says. \u201cIm absolutely over the moon with the results.\u201d\n\nNutrients\n\nBam Lactic acid bacteria and purple non-sulphur bacteria plus beneficial yeasts and microbial exudates\n\nManganese\n\nDia Life Diatomaceous earth\n\nFast Folvic \u2013 fulvic acid\n\nTrio Calcium, boron, magnesium + nitrogen, potassium\n\nPhoto Finish Potassium silicate\n\nTriple 10 Complex mix of NPK + sulphur, iron, zinc, manganese, calcium, boron, selenium, copper, molybdenum\n\nTri Kelp Mix of three growth-promoting seaweed species \u2013 laminaria, sargassum and ascophyllum nodosum\n\nThe yield is even more impressive, he explains, as the reduced and full chemical trials were carried out on 9ha and \n10ha, respectively, compared with just an 0.8ha field for the zero-chemical approach, so should have yielded more \nthrough the sheer size of the field and less headland.\n\nThe zero-chemical approach also produced 25% more straw in the absence of plant growth regulators, but despite \nthis increased height, the crop didn\u2019t suffer any lodging, which Mr Dymond believes is down to the correct nutrition.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about everything. Nobody had ever done something like this and we warned the owners it \ncould have produced 2-3t/ha \u2013 it could have been a complete disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nNext season\n\nMr Dymond is so impressed with the results from just one year he plans to drop the full chemical approach for next \nseason and instead run the trial across his full 200ha of wheat, split equally between zero-chemical and reduced \nchemical approaches.\n\n\u201cIt might be, but I don\u2019t think it was a fluke. Either way I don\u2019t want to keep using that much chemical,\u201d he says.\n\nThe trial has sparked a huge amount of interest among local farmers, many of whom have been to see the trial and \nnow plan to conduct their own.\n\nMr Dymond plans to continue with the reduced-chemistry and full-nutrition approaches, despite this providing \nslightly less margin than the zero-chemical approach, as most farmers in high-disease areas feel they have to use \nsome chemicals.\n\n\u201cThere is huge interest down here in trying to use organic ideas without having to sacrifice output and without the \ntransition period.\u201d\n\n\nThe duo also plan to reduce the amount of nitrogen applied in the trial this coming season by 20-25% to instead \nfocus on micronutrients.\n\nMr Iliffe says this will have the added benefit of making the crop more weather resistant, as nitrogen increases \nwater uptake by the plant and can leave it vulnerable.\n\nAre you a Trailblazer?\n\nThis new series aims to

warned to keep written partnership agreements to minimise the risk of expensive and stressful \nwill disputes.\n\nIt follows a court case involving two dairy farming brothers from Derbyshire, who disagreed about what assets were \npart of the farming partnership following the death of their father.\n\nThe court heard that Ben Wild died in 2003 and the farming partnership continued between his two sons, Malcolm \nand Gregory Wild, until 2016, when relations broke down between them.\n\nSee also: Family court disputes highlight inheritance issues\n\nGregory Wild believed the farm and bungalow to be a part of the farming partnership, therefore said it should be \nsubject to the partnership\u2019s winding-down proceedings.\n\nHowever, his brother Malcolm Wild, his wife Abigail and his mother Jean argued the farm and bungalow had \npassed to Jean as specified in Ben Wild\u2019s will and were not part of the assets of the partnership.\n\nThey argued that the late Mr Wild owned them in his own right before entering into a farming partnership with his \nson and that he did not bring them into the partnership.\n\nMalcolm and Abigail had also invested significantly in the bungalow\u2019s renovation, which during the case was valued \nat \u00a3285,000.\n\nHowever, another point of contention was how much of the renovation\u2019s budget had come from the farming \npartnership, which Gregory argued was a majority.\n\nAccounts for the partnership and mentions of the farm and bungalow were patchy as records had been lost or never \nkept.\n\nHigh Court\n\nAfter High Court hearings in July and August 2018, Judge Eyre QC ruled that the \u00a31.65m farm and bungalow were \nto be included in the deceased\u2019s estate rather than part of a farming business.\n\nHeather Roberts, an associate in the will, trust and estate disputes team at Irwin Mitchell Private Wealth said: \u201cThis \nwas a complex dispute that involved deciding whether the farm, and by extension the bungalow that defendants \nMalcolm and Abigail Wild lived in, was a part of the farming partnership or part of the deceased\u2019s estate.\n\nmailto:richard.allison@reedbusiness.com\n\n\n\u201cIt was a good outcome for the defendants as the judge ruled the farm and bungalow were indeed belonging to their \nmother Jean Wild and that they had a proprietary estoppel claim against the bungalow, which has been their home \nfor decades.\n\n\u201cHowever, the dispute could have been avoided had the family made sure that all assets were clearly accounted for \neither in a will or a formal partnership agreement decades earlier.\u201d\n\nMs Roberts said farming families and businesses should always have partnership agreements and assets \nformalised.\n\n\u201cOther families that have a family business and have an understanding that it may pass to them upon the death of \ntheir parents should look into drawing up a formal agreement to avoid this situation \u2013 the more complex a

That harvest, yields were down by as much as 2t/ha, so something had \nto change and I went drill shopping.\n\nSky Easy Drill\n\nYear 2016\n\nWidth 6m\n\nSpacing 16.6cm\n\nCoulters Disc\n\n\n\nMax coulter pressure 250kg\n\nHopper 2,450 litres, 1,650/800 litres when split\n\nMetering RDS\n\nPower 250hp\n\nDrilling speed 10kph\n\nOutput 40ha per day\n\nPrice paid \u00a380,000\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere are three metering units \u2013 two for the split main hopper and one for the micro granules. From the two \ndistribution heads, I can switch off each row individually for wider spacing or change individual coulters to drill \ndifferent products.\n\nEach notched disc has two coulter outlets for the different products. That means that when I drill cover crops, the \nmain hopper will have spring beans applied at 40kg/ha, the rear hopper has arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi blended \nwith buckwheat at 16kg/ha and, in the micro hopper, is a phacelia and berseem clover blend at 5kg/ha.\n\nThe coulters work in pairs that can operate at different depths to their neighbours. Depth is adjusted manually from \nthe front press, while the rear steel press wheels are angled to close the slot and pressures are tweaked \nhydraulically.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nLast autumn I drilled a companion crop of clover and phacelia with the oilseed rape, as well as laying down some \nfertiliser at the same time. I didn't have to spray a drop of insecticide during the autumn and the pigeons have \nstayed away, too.\n\nThe phacelia acted as a shield for the OSR before being killed off by the frosts, which left room for the crop to get \ngrowing.\n\nThe clover remains in the ground after harvest, acting as a weed suppressant and living mulch before I drill winter \nwheat straight into it. In the long term, this should hopefully minimise the number of herbicide sprays on stubbles.\n\nThe calibration is great as guide settings are pre-loaded into the cab box to give a rough idea of the settings for \neach crop. It\u2019s still a manual bag-holding process under the hopper to fine-tune it, though.\n\nI drilled 145ha of oilseed rape and a companion crop last year. There was only around 500kg of companion crop \nseed at the start and, by the end of the job, I was left with less than a teacup full in the hopper.\n\nThe drill has covered over 1,800ha so far and I haven\u2019t had to purchase any wearing metal. However, Sky \nrecognised a problem with the original discs and have replaced them for larger 415mm ones.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nThere aren\u2019t many bad points, but the standing area around the hopper is tight \u2013 especially as the micro granule \nhopper is mounted up there \u2013 and the steps are very steep, which makes coming down awkward.\n\nOn the box, the on/off switch is far too easy to hit \u2013 early on I did this a few times and the shut the drill off. It was a \nchallenge to know where I stopped but there\u2019s now some tape over the switch to prevent this happening.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve also installed a couple of cheap cameras in the main tank to keep an eye on the seed level. The readout on the \ndrill screen in pretty accurate, but I would like to see it compatible with John Deere\u2019s AMS.\n\nIf I was being really critical then the depth control could all be hydraulic, but that\u2019s me being lazy rather than a \ngenuine bugbear.\n\nThe only other catch is that Sky doesn\u2019t make a 9m model. It would fit with my CTF system and one has been \ntalked about.

It looked poor to start with, but ended up being one of our best crops.\n\nThat\u2019s when we decided to give no-till a go.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t justify the price of the Cross Slot and the power needed to pull it so after a bit of shopping around we \ndecided to try a Weaving GD.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe coulter assembly is has a double disc mounted at a 25deg angle that cuts a slot and plants the seed. The \nwhole unit pivots so it\u2019s got a bit of give for going round slight corners \u2013 we reverse into most though.\n\nThe larger outer disc cuts the main slice in the soil, while the smaller inner disc forms an opening for the seed to be \nplaced. Finally, the soil is firmed down onto the seed by a single press wheel.\n\nDrilling depth is controlled by the rear press wheel and is adjusted using a pin-and-hole arrangement. There\u2019s also \na hydraulic pressure system for each coulter.\n\nWeaving GD 4800T\n\nYear 2016\n\nWidth 4.8m\n\nSpacing 167 cm\n\nCoulters Angled disc\n\nMax coulter pressure 200kg\n\nHopper 2,500-litre\n\nMetering control RDS\n\nPower used 335hp\n\nDrilling speed 8 to 12kph\n\nOutput 40ha per day\n\nPrice \u00a356,600\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nWe\u2019ve drilled about 800ha so far and its performance has been excellent. We\u2019ve got some pretty heavy clay ground \nin places and it\u2019s actually given some of its best results on these.\n\nBeans were the only crop that really struggled with the system, probably as the ground was too hard for them to get \ntheir roots down properly.\n\nOne big bonus is the fact it gets the crop in the ground much more quickly and cheaply than we could with the \nVaderstad Rapid.\n\n\n\nAt the moment we're still using the same 330hp Case Magnum 335 \u2013 which is far more powerful than we need \u2013 \nbut because we\u2019re only running it at 1,200rpm, fuel use is down to 2.3 to 3-litres/ha.\n\nThe drill is also allowing us to experiment with growing cover crops and catch crops, which are helping us to build \nfertility and reduce blackgrass pressure.\n\nOn top of that, we\u2019re planning to put some tillage radish in to lift some of the compacted areas without deep \nloosening.\n\nWe\u2019ve had very few problems with it mechanically, other than a faulty alarm on the RDS control box and a ram seal \non the coulter pressure ram.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nOne of the worst things is how it handles on the road. It\u2019s got a sort of numb feel to it and it transfers weight on and \noff the rear of the tractor so you end up bouncing along like a nodding donkey.\n\nNext year we might get around the problem by fitting a Scharmuller ball-and-spoon hitch so there\u2019s a bit more \narticulation.\n\nIt also tends to hang down when going across slopes, and although you can push the wheels out wider to \ncounteract this, it\u2019s not particularly effective.\n\nWe also don\u2019t like the fact that it dribbles seed when you lift out on the headland. This is largely due to the fact that \nthe coulters are so much further back than the metering unit. \n\nPreventing the press wheels from getting punctures would be another improvement.

We\u2019d previously had a Sim-Tech tine drill, but wanted a \nmachine that caused less soil disturbance at establishment.\n\nI first saw the Ma/Ag at Cereals and, after researching all the other direct disc drill options, we were the first in the \nUK to buy one.\n\nA 4m version was delivered in 2013 and we had the latest 6m delivered last spring. It\u2019s pulled by a Challenger \nMT765B \u2013 not for the horsepower requirement, but its lighter footprint on tracks.\n\nMa/Ag SSP 60 TRC specs\n\nYear 2017\n\nWidth 6m\n\nSpacing 182mm\n\nCoulters Disc\n\nMax coulter pressure 250kg\n\nHopper 2,500 litres\n\nMetering RDS electronic\n\nPower requirement 200hp+\n\nDrilling speed 8-16kph\n\nOutput 40ha per day\n\nOn-farm price \u00a378,000\n\nWhy did you change to a no-till drill?\n\nThe farm used a plough-based system for many years, but it was very expensive in diesel, metal and general wear \nand tear on the machinery, so we decided to move to minimum tillage in 2009.\n\nOnce our soil structure had improved, we gradually moved into a low-disturbance drilling system. We now use a \nTilso Rake & Roll after harvest to spread the straw evenly and encourage a weed chit.\n\nThis is followed by a low disturbance Tilso subsoiler, before spraying off with glyphosate just ahead of drilling.\n\nI don\u2019t believe there are many soils that truly self-structure, so the subsoiler lifts any compaction without moving \nmuch soil and gives us peace of mind that water will get away over the winter.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, there was also an environmental case by improving soil health, and it has helped us get \non top of the blackgrass. We have seen soil biology improve, with worm counts going up and residue broken down \nmuch faster.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\n\nThe drill has a vertical 450mm serrated opening disc, which works about 25mm lower than the smaller diameter \nseeding disc that follows. Seed is placed in the side of the slot by a second angled disc and fertiliser goes in \nbeneath the seed.\n\nThere are three pressure settings on the 33 coulters, with up to 250kg available from the springs. Depth control is \non individual self-cleaning 150mm-wide rubber press wheels, which close and firm up the slot.\n\nThe drill has RDS electronic metering, which has the capability to run variable-rate seeding, but I don\u2019t use that at \npresent. I know where our blackgrass patches are and increase or decrease seed rates manually on the control box \nwhen required.\n\nThe tank takes about 1t of seed and 0.5t of fertiliser and we\u2019re putting a starter fertiliser mix down the spout with \nmost of the spring crops.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nThe fact that the leading disc works below where the seed is placed means there is some drainage away from the \nseed, which is an advantage if wet conditions arrive soon after drilling.\n\nHaving 250kg coulter pressure and simple depth control were some of the features that attracted us to the drill. The \ntransport wheels also lift right off the ground to put all the drill\u2019s weight on the coulters.\n\nWe have fields that are very heavy at one end and light at the other, so accurate seed placement can be difficult \nacross soil types and the drill places the seed exactly where you want it to be. I can\u2019t stress the importance of \ngetting it at the right depth for even emergence.\n\nIt also disturbs very little soil, so you get minimal germination of blackgrass. Combined with later drilling in the \nautumn and spring, and the fact the 6m machine lets us drill everything quickly and wait for the right moment to go, \nit\u2019s helping us beat blackgrass.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nWe have worked with Ma/Ag since 2013 when our first drill arrived and, since then, several changes have been \nmade. The initial angle of the hopper was too shallow, so treated seed wouldn\u2019t run out the corners well, but that \nhas now been rectified.\n\nFertiliser placement was also added and the bout markers have been strengthened.\n\nThe only issue I have now is that due to the length of the drill \u2013 the two rows of discs being separated either side of \nthe transport wheels to the front and back \u2013 is that there\u2019s a noticeable delay on the back row when moving into \nwork out of corners.\n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\nConsistent seed depth across soil types\n\nEasy adjustment of depth control\n\nVery low soil disturbance\n\nSelf-cleaning coulters and press wheels\n\nGripes\n\nLength of machine\n\n\n\nTransport wheels could be wider for travelling on headlands\n\nSeed and fertiliser hopper could be bigger\n\nFertiliser hopper difficult to clean out due to tight access\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLeicestershire farmer Steve Heard imported and assembled his own John Deere no-till drill \u2013 he gives us his verdict \non how it has performed, what he most likes about it and what he would improve.\n\nFarm facts\n\nThree Gates Farming, Kibworth Road, Three Gates, Leicestershire\n\nAcreage and soil type 1,450ha of predominantly clay loam\n\nCrops grown Winter wheat, oilseed rape, spring oats and spring beans\n\nWhat drill are you using?\n\nOur drill is custom-built, 9m wide and based on an American-spec John Deere 1890. However, it has the same \ncoulter assembly as the 750A, which has been in the UK (at a maximum width of 6m) for quite a while.\n\nWe shipped it over from the States, before I dismantled and rebuilt it to fit within UK road limits and with a working \nwidth of 9m. It wasn\u2019t an easy job, as the original drill was 5m wide folded and had different row spacings.\n\nThe other issue was that the Americans run the coulter bar as a trailed unit and I wanted the 6,000kg hoppers to sit \non top to provide extra downforce. In the end, I had to fit a couple of rams and nitrogen accumulators that transfer \nthe weight on to the drilling rig once the coulter bar is unfolded.\n\nWe seem to keep finding ways to modify it \u2013 most recently we added the spoked wheels and a little scraper to \nprevent the wheels clogging in wet ground.\n\nSee also: Lionel Shaw's Horsch Avatar\n\nJohn Deere 750a (US 1890 conversion)\n\nYear 2014\n\nWidth 9m\n\nSpacing 16.6cm\n\nCoulters Disc\n\nMax coulter pressure 260kg\n\nHopper 6,000kg \u2013 split 3,500kg/2,500kg\n\nMetering Wheeled with variable rate transmission\n\nPower 300hp\n\nDrilling speed 12kph\n\nOutput 50-60ha per day\n\nPrice paid \u00a356,000 plus many hours designing and building\n\n\n\nWhy did you change to a no-till drill?\n\nWe used to plough roughly 70% of the farm annually and drill with a 9m Vaderstad Rapid, but in 2008 we stopped \nploughing and bought a brace of Sumo Trios to improve the soil structure and reduce establishment costs.\n\nIt was part of a 10-year strategy to get rid of the Vaderstad and move to direct drilling, but in 2012 our hand was \nforced \u2013 the blackgrass was taking hold, so I started shopping around for a direct disc drill.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe front discs are at an 11deg angle, with seed and fert coming down one pipe from the two hoppers via separate \nmetering units so we can apply two products at different rates.\n\nThe depth wheel next to the disc is spoked so it doesn\u2019t bung in wet conditions and is fitted with RID (reduced \ninside diameter) tapered tyres to avoid compacting the side of the seed trench.\n\nA custom slim rubber wheel forces the seed down into the soil and gives decent seed contact. We tried running the \ndrill without these, but germination was much slower and the blackgrass got a head start.\n\nThe closing spiked wheels have been modified from US versions and we have perfected these in-house to give the \nbest slot closure possible.\n\nWhen the drill lifts out of work on the headland it puts the weight on the 14 wheels that surround the frame to limit \ncompaction, leaving the two large wheels almost in the air.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nIts workload has gradually been ramped up since arriving in 2014 \u2013 it has now covered about 2,600ha and recently \nhad its first replacement metal.\n\nWe aren\u2019t totally no-till and do often scratch the top with a Vaderstad Carrier to get a chit. We've tried growing some \ncatch crops after the oilseed rape to help with weed control, but found these held on to the moisture too well and \ncaused slug issues.\n\nWe\u2019ve also used it to drill crop trials with and without fertiliser and there has definitely been a reduction in \nblackgrass since the drill arrived.\n\nAt 16.6cm centres, Deere's system keeps soil movement to a minimum, gives an even drilling depth and allows us \nto drill into any condition and into any surface, so we can be flexible about our approach to each field.\n\nWhat are the bad points?\n\nWe do have to travel a bit slower \u2013 the Vaderstad used to rattle along at up to 18kph, whereas we find the Deere's \ncoulters start to bounce beyond 14kph.\n\nIn some of the smaller fields with snake-like headlands we've found that the closing wheels don\u2019t follow the slot very \nwell on the tighter bends and can leave it exposed.\n\nFor a while we kept getting a clutch error, which turned out to be the variable-rate motor not engaging properly. We \nthen found the fault in the wiring of a plug and haven\u2019t had an issue since.\n\nAs for spares, our local Deere dealer \u2013 Sharmans \u2013 has been helpful in sourcing parts from America if needed, \nusually in 48 hours.\n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\n\n\nLow disturbance\n\nEven sowing depth across 9m\n\nDrills into any conditions\n\nHuge hopper capacity\n\nGripes\n\nLower speeds than the Vaderstad\n\nStruggles to close slot when very wet\n\nClosers don\u2019t follow around corners\n\nManual depth adjustment\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSwithin Waterer of Halstead, Essex, explains why he opted to go no-till with a Sly Boss drill.

I drill using the Starfire GPS on my \nJohn Deere 6210R \u2013 there is a tramlining kit on board, but I usually drill at about 30 deg to my tramlines, which stay \nin the same place each year.\n\nSee also: Edward Davison's Sky Easy Drill\n\nWhy did you change to a no-till drill?\n\nUp until last year I\u2019d been farming 280ha with a neighbour and planting it with a 3m Mzuri strip-till drill. However, we \nthen teamed up with another neighbour, upping the area to 400ha.\n\nThat was too much for us to cover comfortably, so we went in search of a wider one-pass machine. The Mzuri acts \nas a pretty good transition drill so it was a fairly easy and logical step to go to no-till.\n\nWe also hoped it would help us get on top of blackgrass by reducing soil disturbance and preventing the stuff \ngerminating. We looked at a few different machines, including the John Deere 750A, Weaving GD and Sky Easy \nDrill, but when I saw the Boss coulter at Lamma in 2017 I was convinced it was the way to go.\n\nSly Boss\n\n\n\nYear 2017\n\nWidth 6m\n\nSpacing 16.7cm\n\nCoulters Angled disc\n\nMax coulter pressure 240kg\n\nHopper 1,200-litre\n\nMetering RDS\n\nPower used 210hp\n\nDrilling speed 11kph\n\nOutput Spot rates up to 60ha per day\n\nPrice paid \u00a377,500\n\nPrice now \u00a385,000\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe coulter assembly has a large-diameter angled disc at the front that cuts the slot and lifts the soil for the seed to \nbe planted via a boot mounted on the side.\n\nSlightly behind the disc is a larger-diameter sprung rubber wheel that, as well as cleaning the disc, puts the lifted \nsoil back down on top of the seed.\n\nThere\u2019s then an angled press wheel at the rear, which finally consolidates the seed bed and acts as the seed depth \ncontrol.\n\nOn the Australian version, depth and press wheel angle adjustment require a couple of spanners, but thankfully Sly \nhas modified them to be tool-free and it\u2019s a five-minute job now.\n\nHow has is performed?\n\nWe\u2019ve been impressed so far. We got it in autumn 2017 and most of the 400ha we\u2019ve planted with it has \nestablished well. Yields haven\u2019t been that great this year, but that\u2019s more to do with the season than the drill.\n\nPulling a 6m machine at 11kph means we can cover the ground quickly and our John Deere 6210R handles it \neasily. I reckon we\u2019re only burning about 7 litres/ha drilling cereals, going up to about 9 litres/ha on hilly ground or \nwhen we push it in deep for planting beans.\n\nBecause the discs are angled, we haven\u2019t had any problems with hair pinning of straw into the slot and the coulters \ndon\u2019t seem to block up when it gets a bit sticky on the top.\n\nI\u2019m not a purist no-tiller and I will continue subsoiling every five years or so. I also sometimes use a Kockerling \ncultivator pre-drilling at very shallow depth to encourage a blackgrass chit.\n\nHow could it be improved?\n\nWe\u2019ve had a few little teething problems that needed ironing out. Early on we found the wings would creep up as we \nwere working, which was a complete pain, and we\u2019ve had a bit of trouble with the electronics talking to the metering \nsystem.\n\n\n\nThis has caused some delays in the switching of seed delivery, leaving us with a few Skylark plots at the start of \nruns and some seed dribbling out on the headland at the ends.\n\nBut every time we\u2019ve had problem, Sly has come out promptly, and these things are to be expected with a brand-\nnew machine and concept.\n\nWe\u2019ve also found that the open vents at the top of the cyclones (which allow the air to escape so the seed falls \nrather than getting blasted into the slot) can block with soil flicking off the rear press wheels in the wet.\n\nOne solution would be to put a bend on the top or a mesh guard, but it could be a sign that we shouldn\u2019t be going in \nthose conditions.\n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\nExcellent seed placement\n\nMinimal soil disturbance\n\nNo hair pinning of trash\n\nBuilt to last\n\nGripes\n\nCyclones can block with debris\n\nDribbles out seed on headland\n\nMinor electronic niggles\n\nBeans bridging in coulter\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSuffolk grower David Bird gives his verdict on the performance of the Primewest Cross Slot no-till drill.

It was a pretty dependable approach but we wanted to try and move away from \nchemical reliance and start looking more closely at improving our soil health.\n\nOne thing that has become really apparent is how important earthworms are as soil improvers and indicators of \nhealth, so if we\u2019ve got good populations then generally it means we\u2019ll get reasonable yields.\n\nPart of the process of moving towards lower chemical usage has included looking at cover and companion crops as \na means of retaining nutrients and out-competing weeds, so we needed a drill that was capable of working reliably \nright through the year in all conditions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe inverted T-shape slot formed by the Cross Slot disc and knife opener will nearly always get crops off to a \ndecent start.\n\nBecause the seed is placed on a shelf above a shallow trench where the fertiliser goes, it doesn\u2019t get any scorch \nand when it\u2019s dry it has plenty of humid air around it in the slot. In the wet it doesn\u2019t tend to get water-logged, either.\n\nThe sheer weight of the drill \u2013 about 9.5t \u2013 means it will penetrate our Suffolk clays when drilling cover crops in mid-\nsummer. However, we also went for Cross Slot\u2019s optional auto-downforce system to ensure even seed placement\n\nA load cell on the rear row of coulters monitors downforce on the depth/closing wheels and alters the hydraulic \npressure in the coulter carriage rams accordingly, so the discs cut into the ground at a consistent depth.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nWe're always confident that the Cross Slot will put the seed in at the right depth and covered over with clean, trash-\nfree soil.\n\n\n\nThe only other way to establish crops as reliably would be with a plough and power-harrow drill but that goes \nagainst everything we\u2019re striving to achieve.\n\nOur crop establishment costs are now somewhere around \u00a365/ha, excluding rolling, whereas the previous system \ncame in closer to \u00a3150/ha. That makes it significantly cheaper, despite the huge capital cost of the drill.\n\nAs for fuel, we\u2019re generally burning something around 13.5-litres/ha, which is about a quarter of what we were \nusing.\n\nThat figure would be even smaller if we were using a lower-draft drill like a John Deere 750A and it would have \nbeen cheaper to buy, too. But we\u2019ve ended up with the Rolls-Royce of machines which can reliably establish crops \nin the broadest range of conditions, in my opinion.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nThe big downside of the Cross Slot is the amount of horsepower and the weight of the tractor needed to pull it.\n\nThe knock-on impact is the amount of diesel we burn, but it\u2019s still just a fraction of what we were using previously.\n\nDue to the 450mm of vertical travel in the openers the seed pipes have to have a lot of movement in them.\n\nThis, coupled with retrofitted blockage sensors, means that some of the pipes have a tendency to sag and block.\n\nThe seed pipe routing could do with a bit of revision. At certain points where the drill folds the pipes get crimped and \nthey don\u2019t all run downhill so there is a tendency for certain pipes to block.\n\nThat\u2019s not helped that in places the blockage sensors get knocked when you fold the drill up.\n\nIn an ideal world I would have load cells on every coulter and individual downforce adjustment but with 25 openers \nthat would probably be prohibitively expensive.\n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\nSeed placed at a consistent depth without hair-pinning\n\nT-shaped slot provides ideal growing conditions\n\nReliable establistment in wet and dry soil\n\nMinimal weed seed disturbance \u2013 blackgrass only grows in crop row\n\nGripes\n\nRequires a high-horsepower, heavy tractor\n\nHigh capital cost\n\nSeed pipes get crimped where the drill folds\n\nBlockage sensors can get knocked when folding\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLionel Shaw runs a Horsch Avatar at Manor Farm, Luton, and explains his why he changed to a no-till drill, how it \nworks and gives us his verdict on the machine.\n\nFarm facts\n\n\n\nCH Shaw & Sons, Manor Farm, Butterfield Green Road, Luton\n\nAcreage and soil type 440ha of clay flint to chalk, plus 360ha contracted\n\nCrops grown Winter wheat, winter oats, winter beans, spring barley\n\nWhat drill are you using?\n\nWe have a Horsch Avatar 6.16 SD with additional micro-granular hopper, which can be used for starter fertiliser and \nslug pellets. We also have a 2005 6m Horsch Sprinter grain and fertiliser tine drill.\n\nWe didn\u2019t opt for the additional 1,400kg weight on the Avatar because if the going is hard then we\u2019ll wait for it to \nsoften or use the Sprinter with Dutch openers.\n\nSee also: John Mair's Ma/Ag 6m drill\n\nWhy did you change to a no-till drill?\n\nWe were putting too much effort into a plough or min-till system and needed to find a way of reducing our \ncultivations, so I joined a no-till group called Base.\n\nThere are so many people there to share experiences and you can take different ideas, understand how they work, \nand pick what is best for your farm.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried a lot of drills over the years. We had a Dale tine drill, but it was too early in its development and suffered \nwith plugging. We also had a John Deere disc drill, but it struggled for soil penetration \u2013 one year it would work well, \nthe next it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nI always liked the Deere and think it\u2019s the best coulter you can get. The only reason we didn\u2019t keep it was because it \ncan't apply fertiliser with the seed. You can have a liquid system fitted, but it takes a lot of remedial work to get the \ntank on.\n\nWe then moved to a disc/press min-till system with our 6m Horsch Sprinter, but the tines were too big and too much \nlike a blunt instrument for direct drilling.\n\nWe didn\u2019t sell it, but bought a 6m Claydon to get back on the direct drilling route and although I\u2019ve got nothing \nagainst the Claydon drill, it moved too much soil for us.\n\nMy son Edward and I found the Horsch Avatar at the Sima show. It has an opener about as close to the John Deere \nas possible, but the Horsch also has a very good metering mechanism and the ability to place grain and fertiliser. \nLast autumn we decided to go for one and got a Leader grant to help fund it.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Avatar has 36 single-disc coulters spaced at 16.7cm and each 20in disc sits at a 7deg angle to open a slot.\n\nA small seed boot beside the disc drops the seed \u2013 and fertiliser if in use \u2013 into the slot and a small rubber catching \nwheel prevents seed bounce. Finally, an angled wheel closes the slot.\n\nDepth is controlled on each individual coulter by a gauge wheel, adjusted on a winding handle held tight by a nut \nand bolt mechanism.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nWe drilled all the spring barley with it this year and were really pleased with the results. We put it in with an NPKS \ncompound fertiliser (24-8-8-8) and it paid dividends this spring with the later drilling.\n\n\n\nThe drill sails through residue without any noticeable hair-pinning. The coulters are the main thing \u2013 they don\u2019t \nmove a lot of soil and blackgrass germination is much lower compared with a tine drill.\n\nSeeding depth is also extremely consistent, emergence is uniform and the metering system seems accurate and \neasy to calibrate.\n\nIt helps that we have a 12m Rite-Way straw rake, which I bought after a trip to Canada \u2013 everyone has one over \nthere. It came in bits and our farm engineer Philip put it all together.\n\nIf we are in a situation where there is too much wet residue, we always have the Sprinter with the Dutch openers to \nfall back on.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nThe worst part is emptying the hopper. It\u2019s OK if you have a clean floor space and a small amount of seed or \nfertiliser left over, as you can let it drop out, but large quantities aren\u2019t easy.\n\nThe access between the bottom of the hopper and the coulters below is poor and it\u2019s difficult to get a bag in there.\n\nAnother issue is the individual depth adjustment. A nut and bolt requires slackening on each of the 36 coulters and \nit's time consuming, whereas the John Deere is just a pull-and-twist mechanism.\n\nThe walkway mesh used on the hopper platform gives good access but has a very aggressive pattern and is painful \nto kneel on if you need to do any work on it.\n\nI\u2019d like to see Horsch add a liquid fertiliser system option, too. The advantage is that you could apply liquid fertiliser \nor fill it with water for ballast when the ground is hard.\n\nHorsch Avatar 6.16 SD\n\nYear 2017\n\nWidth 6m\n\nSpacing 16.7cm\n\nCoulters 36x Disc\n\nMax coulter pressure 250kg\n\nHopper 5,000 litres (40/60 split) plus 200-litre micro-granular unit\n\nMetering Horsch electronic\n\nPower 210hp+\n\nDrilling speed 6-15kph\n\nOutput 40ha per day\n\nPrice paid \u00a395,000\n\n \n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\nLow-disturbance coulters\n\n\n\nConsistent seed depth\n\nVery accurate metering\n\nStability in transport mode\n\nGripes\n\nHopper is tough to empty\n\nTime consuming depth adjustment\n\nAggressive walkway mesh on platform\n\nLack of liquid fertiliser kit option\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLincolnshire farmer Tom Hounsfield gives us his verdict on the adapted Sumo DD no-till drill he bought in 2015.

Sumo only makes a mounted version of the DD up \nto 3m, but we asked for a wider model and they made it.\n\nWhat we\u2019d seen from our previous Versadrill, and other trailed machines that pick up on two transport wheels, is \nthat you get compaction in the corners and on headlands. We wanted a machine that could be lifted on our Claas \nArion 650\u2019s dual wheels to try to reduce that problem.\n\nSee also: Driver\u2019s view: Swithin Waterer\u2019s Sly Boss drill\n\nSumo DD\n\nYear: 2015\n\nWidth: 4m mounted\n\nSpacing: 200mm\n\nCoulters: 20x disc\n\nMax coulter pressure: 150kg (200kg with weight transfer system)\n\nHoppers: 1,900 litres plus 1,900-litre front-mounted tank\n\nMetering: ORGA (Sumo design)\n\nPower requirement: 150hp +\n\nDrilling speed: 10kph\n\n\n\nOutput: 40ha per day\n\nPrice: Bespoke model cost about \u00a350,000 including front hopper. A 3m mounted version starts at \u00a340,434. DD drills \nof 4m+ are trailed\n\nWhy did you change to a no-till drill?\n\nOur soils have relatively low organic matter and the structure wasn\u2019t particularly good at the time. The farm used to \nplough and combination-drill everything, but we realised it was just too much for our land and a waste of time and \nmoney.\n\nWe are trying to improve structure with no-till and cover crops, get organic matter into the soils and save money, \ntoo.\n\nWe've been gradually working up to no-till, first establishing oilseed rape direct with a Sumo Trio, so a moving to a \nVersadrill in 2010 seemed like the obvious transition.\n\nThe Versadrill is essentially a set of loosening tines with a Moore disc drill behind. For the first two years we used \nthe tines, then without for another two. Four years ago, we changed it for the DD we have now, which has a flatter \ncoulter, so closes the slot better and can deal with higher levels of trash.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe openers sit on a parallelogram and are pressurised by springs. For additional pressure, there is a hydraulic \nweight transfer system on the front of the drill that pushes against the bottom of the link arms to help keep it in the \nground.\n\nEach individual opener sits on its own gauge wheel. A flat serrated disc at a slight angle opens a slot for the seed, \nwhich is dropped in, and a seed tab drags just behind to prevent seed bounce. An angled steel firming wheel then \nfollows behind and breaks through the side wall of the slot, closing it up and giving better seed-to-soil contact.\n\nHow has it performed?\n\nThe better the soil, the better the drill's performance and, although people say it\u2019s difficult to no-till peas, once the \nstructure is there it\u2019s possible and we\u2019ve had success with the DD.\n\nAdding in fertiliser has also improved the system. The oilseed rape and spring barley rocket away with a starter \nfertiliser and we\u2019ve seen good emergence and establishment. It also gives us the flexibility to drill spring barley a bit \nlater, towards the end of March and into April.\n\nI like the way it copes with our high stone content. We had several drills on demo that looked good in theory, such \nas the Great Plains with its a vertical disc, but most just popped out every time the disc hit a stone. The Sumo\u2019s is at \na slight angle, so it pushes straight through.\n\nThe modification that clears residue out the way of the disc coulter to prevent hair-pinning in the seed slot is also \ngood. We had problems with the Versadrill in oilseed rape where fast establishment is required to get away from \nproblems such as flea beetle, so it needed addressing.\n\nIt's also very low disturbance, closes the slot well and rides contours, unlike tine drills.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nThe strength of the front attachments for clearing out residue isn\u2019t good, particularly in high straw when drilling \noilseed rape after spring barley. We strengthened the attachments ourselves and they worked much better in spring \nbarley this year.\n\nThe first seed tabs also kept snapping, but Sumo has strengthened those and they haven\u2019t caused a problem since.\n\n\n\nWe are putting DAP down the spout with the oilseed rape and spring barley and initially had the fertiliser in the back \nhopper and seed in the front, but the operator noticed drill misses and realised there was a delay in seed reaching \nthe coulters. We\u2019ve now switched the seed to the back and fertiliser in the front, which has stopped any gaps.\n\nThe only other improvement I would make is something we\u2019ve already done ourselves \u2013 safety stands fixed either \nside for getting underneath when it\u2019s in the air.\n\nLikes and gripes\n\nLikes\n\nCopes with high stone content\n\nLow soil disturbance\n\nGood seed slot closure\n\nNo hair-pinning\n\nGripes\n\nWeak clearing wheels\n\nLack of safety stands for working underneath\n\nMechanical individual coulter depth adjustment is awkward\n\nRadiator to warm air for improved fertiliser flow performs poorly\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLower global milk production is expected to drive European farmgate milk prices to a peak in November 2018, \nprovided that fears around a global dairy demand slump are not realised.\n\nSeasonal lulls in production in the northern hemisphere and extreme weather events in Europe and Australia have \nsupported global milk prices, according to INTL FCStone director of dairy market insight, Nate Donnay.\n\nHowever, dairy commodity traders said that higher prices could be masking a worldwide reduction in demand for \ndairy products, during the EU Dairy Outlook conference in Dublin last week.\n\nSee also: 9 stark revelations on Brexit from Irish dairy leader\n\nPopulation and GDP growth \u2013 good indicators of a nation's medium-term appetite for dairy products \u2013 were \nexpected to decline between 2018 and 2019 in seven of the nine largest dairy importing nations, including China, \nthe US, Japan, Vietnam and Malaysia, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data.\n\nThe outlook for these nations' GDP growth was negative, with fears over escalating trade wars meaning the IMF \nwas likely to downgrade forecasts further.\n\nJust a 1% increase in population and GDP leads to an 8% change in dairy market prices.\n\nFears over waning demand would be put to the test at the end of the year and start of 2019 when production \ntypically increases and higher holiday demand falls away.\n\nThe positive indicator was that the bulk of developing nations, bundled together, had seen positive growth of both \nindicators for the past three years with further increases expected in 2019.\n\n\n\u201cWe have a demand issue that is helping to push Oceania prices down right now,\u201d said Mr Donnay.\n\n\u201cMy general expectation is relatively decent pricing as we move through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter \n[2019].\u201d\n\nMr Donnay warned that if global demand did not improve in late November and December, when the holiday buying \nwas over and US and EU milk production began its seasonal increase, EU pricing would have to reset to Oceania \nlevels.\n\nManufacturing milk prices with a constituent content of 4% butterfat, 3.4% protein, in Oceania have fallen by 15% \nsince June 2018, to average $345/t (27p/litre).\n\nPositive outlook for EU farmers\n\n\u201cMy expectation is farmgate prices will keep moving up to until October and November,\u201d said Mr Donnay.\n\nThe dairy market expert said he expected the November peak to be at \"decent but not record levels\".\n\n\u201cFarmers should be doing OK relative to milk production,\u201d he added.\n\nMilk prices across the EU-28 member states should be good enough to drive expansion across the Continent, \nproviding the average European dairy farmer with a margin over purchased feed of at least 20/100kg (17.4p/litre).\n\nMr Donnay added that higher farmgate milk prices would not filter through to EU milk production until March or April \n2019.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that we are going to be running below year-ago levels by 0.5-1% by September through \nDecember.\n\n\u201cEU milk production will be relatively constrained for the next six months or so, but then we begin a rebound in \ngrowth in early 2019 unless we have some type of weather disturbance,\u201d he added.\n\nInternational outlook\n\nUSA: Production predicted to be down 1-1.5% compared with fourth quarter of 2017. Production growth of 1-1.5% \nexpected in the next six months, split 50:50 between domestic growth and exports.\n\nNew Zealand: Short-term driver will be the weather. Production increase of 2.5% predicted for the next six months, \nbut if weather is good during peak production, the increase could be as much as 4-5%, while a drought would lead \nto a 1-2% fall. Production changes of 3% lead to price changes of 8-10%.\n\nIndia: India will begin paying subsidies for countries exporting SMP to world markets. However, this will be mainly to \nbottom end of dairy markets and should not impact EU prices.\n\nChina: Dairy imports have flattened out in recent months following growth of 1.7% in 2017. Famously unreliable \nChinese domestic milk production figures were indicating a 2-4% production growth in the nation in 2018, which \ncould account for the lack of import activity.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFeed accounts for around 70% of costs on pig farms but producers could trim this if they tackled wastage from \ninefficiencies and poor feed management. \n\nAn AHDB Pork study estimates that 5-20% of pig feed can be wasted on farm.\n\n\nPig nutritionist Dr Phil Baynes says waste from faulty feed bins and troughs and vermin contamination are major \ncontributors to costs on pig units but these are avoidable.\n\nSee also: Guide to biosecurity measures to keep pigs disease-free\n\nPoor feed conversion ratios also represent a waste of feed, through inefficiency. \n\nDr Baynes calculates that at current prices, an increase of just 0.1 in Feed Conversion Rate (FCR) leads to a 10% \nrise in feed cost. \u201cImproving FCR by reducing waste is critical in the rearing herd,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHere are his top tips for reducing waste.\n\nFix leaky hoppers\n\nProblem: Wastage is higher when feeders are in a poor state of repair.\n\nAction required: \n\nExamine feeders between batches \u2013 if there is a hole, fix it, or replace the feeder.\n\nExamine downpipes and feed systems because holes can be hidden.\n\nConsider replacing older or inefficient feeders with well-designed, efficient feeders that optimise feed inputs while \nmaximising performance.\n\nPut lids on feeders\n\nProblem: \n\nWithout lids, feeders are a feasting ground for vermin. Not only will birds and rodents consume expensive feed but \nthey will also contaminate it so there is a doubling of wastage.\n\nOn average, bird feed intake can be 24g/bird/day.\n\nAction required: \n\nAll feeders should be covered\n\nIf the stockperson needs to examine the feed level, ensure the feeder has a see-through area where this can be \nassessed.\n\nDon\u2019t allow feeders to over-run\n\nProblem: \n\nWhen this happens, feed can be reduced to powder and pigs won\u2019t eat it\n\nIt will also increase dust contamination and respiratory problems\n\nFeed efficiency can be maximised when pigs have to work for their feed.\n\nAction required: \n\nPlace less feed in the feeder by lowering the downpipe into the feeder to reduce wastage, although the feed auger \nmay need to run more often.\n\nEvery stockperson on the unit should understand how to adjust feed availability.\n\nA standard rule is about 50% of self-feeder trough bottom should be visible.\n\n\n\nTrough bottoms that are completely covered with feed are probably wasteful.\n\nFeed the right rations\n\nProblem: \n\nMaintaining expensive early diets for longer than needed increases costs.\n\nIf you use the wrong feed it is bad for performance or you over-supply nutrients that pigs can\u2019t physically use and \ntherefore waste.\n\nAction required: \n\nPigs should move progressively to lower density, and therefore less expensive diets in accordance with their stage \nof maturity and legal requirement.\n\nRegular feed budget audits will ensure feed intakes are appropriate for the stage of production.\n\nFormulate diets based on input requirements. Lysine, for example, must be appropriate to the stage of production \nand other amino acids provided in the correct balance. If these are not given in the right ratio it will impact on \nmuscle development, as well as other metabolic functions. These ingredients are expensive so if you are feeding \ntoo much it is wasteful because it will just be deaminated and expelled in the urine.\n\nPrepare feed correctly\n\nProblem: \n\nIf grains are not prepared correctly it can result in waste because they will be undigested and passed out whole.\n\nAction required: \n\nFeed must be correctly ground or rolled, although the final grist size will depend on the feeding system. For \ninstance, a smaller grist is favourable in wet feed systems.\n\nPosition feeders and drinkers in the right place\n\nProblem: \n\nPigs like to drink shortly after feeding \u2013 if drinkers are more than two metres from the feeder they will walk between \nthe feeder and drinker.\n\nFood carried in their mouths will then drop on the floor and bedding. \n\nAction required: \n\nEnsure pigs don\u2019t have to cross the sleeping area to get from the feeder to the drinker.\n\nAvoid mycotoxin contamination\n\nProblem: \n\nMycotoxins can cause significant health and performance problems.\n\nFungal infestation is influenced mainly by moisture level, temperature and availability of oxygen.\n\nAction required: \n\nEnsure feed is stored correctly and monitor for contamination.\n\n\n\nAvoid grain that is damaged, immature, drought-stricken or otherwise stressed, as it will be more susceptible to \nmould growth. \n\nAvoid overcrowding in pens\n\nProblem: \n\nOvercrowding is likely to reduce daily feed intake, especially if there is competition for feeders, decreasing growth \nrates and impacting on the FCR.\n\nThere is a direct linear relationship between stocking density and growth rates, as reported in many scientific \nstudies. Having only one or two pigs more per pen can result in more than 50g/day reduction in growth rates. This \ncan be addressed partially by an increase in nutrient density of the feed and supply of another water access point.\n\nThe wastage therefore comes from either under- or over-providing energy. Too little and the growth rate slows \ndown, days to slaughter increase and there is a cost to subsequent additional maintenance days.\n\nToo much energy relative to digestible amino acids can lead to pigs not meeting the grading requirements. Money \nis then lost from excess expensive energy being spent on the diet, coupled with a loss of revenue from a less-than \nideal carcase.\n\nAction required: \n\nCalculate the ideal stocking density per department to avoid a bottleneck.\n\nEither consider revising the size of the breeding herd or look to sell some younger pigs to meet the stocking density \nin the rearing accommodation.\n\nCheck water flow rates\n\nProblem: \n\nDepending on the weight of the pig, the water flow rate should be 0.5 to 2 litres/minute to encourage higher feed \nintakes.\n\nOften flow rates can be less than this because of water quality issues or obstruction from mineral and grit build-up.\n\nThe relationship is around 2.5 to 2.75 water to feed intake. By restricting water access, feed intakes subsequently \nsuffer and this increases time to slaughter and reducing feed efficiency.\n\nAction required: \n\nCheck that flow rates are consistent with requirements.\n\nIf they are not, consider changing the delivery system or cleaning the lines with either a dairy cleaner or appropriate \norganic acid blend.\n\nEnsure good hygiene\n\nProblem: \n\nDirty pens increase the antigen challenge for pigs.\n\nAs with stocking density, this can easily lead to a reduction in growth rates by 50g/day or more as the immune \nsystem uses protein and energy to mount a response, rather than using these nutrients for growth.\n\nAction required: \n\n\n\nClean, disinfect and dry pens between batches.\n\nIf using straw, use the cleanest straw possible to avoid potential problems with mycotoxins.  If this is not possible, \nadd a good quality mycotoxin binder in the feed.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmcare, the former Co-operative Group farming business, has withdrawn from active farming, instead forming 12 \npartnerships with contractors and other farmers.\n\nThe business was sold to the Wellcome Trust for \u00a3249m in 2014, in the largest farming business sale for many \nyears.

Read his biography\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA sheep farmer has appealed to dog owners to act more responsibly in the countryside after 29 of his sheep were \nkilled following a terrifying attack.\n\nAngus Baird said his sheep were \u201cdropping like flies\u201d following the attack in Merstone on the Isle of Wight.\n\nAn out of control dog or dogs is believed to be responsible for the incident, which happened some time between \n7pm on Tuesday (4 September) and 7am on Wednesday (5 September).\n\nSee also: The law on shooting dogs \u2013 critical facts farmers should know\n\nA neighbour raised the alarm after he spotted three sheep lying dead in a field in Merstone on Wednesday morning.\n\nMr Baird went to the field to check his flock of 330 sheep, mainly Romney Aberdale, and he found 21 dead sheep.\n\nAt first he thought the animals may have died from poisoning after drinking water from the reservoir.\n\nBut on closer inspection, Mr Baird discovered bite marks and signs of distress on the sheep, which suggested they \nhad been chased for some time.\n\n\u201cOne sheep had drowned after being chased in the reservoir, another dead one had a broken leg and bite marks on \nits other leg after it had been chased and there were 19 other dead sheep scattered around the field,\u201d he said.\n\nFrothed at the mouth\n\nThe sheep were checked and moved into the next field. A further eight sheep have since died. They were all found \nsat down and frothed at the mouth.\n\nThe dead stock were taken back to the farmyard in a wagon and a vet was called to carry out a post-mortem \nexamination on two of the sheep.\n\n\u201cThere was no sign of any poison or anything unusual in the rumen,\u201d said Mr Baird.\n\n\u201cThe sheep looked quite healthy, but when the vet cut in by the heart she found 4-5 litres of fluid and concluded that \nthe sheep had died of a heart attack brought on by the stress of dog worrying.\u201d\n\nMr Baird said he planned to put the sheep to the ram in about a month\u2019s time He had lost about 10% of his flock \nand would need to buy replacement ewes.\n\n\u00a36,000 bill\n\nHe estimated that the incident would cost him up to \u00a36,000, including vets bills and disposal costs. However, he \nhopes his insurance policy will enable him to recover the costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated,\u201d said Mr Baird. \u201cDog owners have got to be more aware.\n\n\u201cIf your dog is chasing sheep around, it may look like it\u2019s having fun, but it\u2019s the implications of what might happen in \nthe ensuing hours. This is pure dog worrying.\u201d\n\nBarry Isaacson from Jervis Court Equine, a fallen stock disposal service operating on the island, was called to \ncollect and dispose of the dead sheep.\n\nKeep dogs on leads\n\nHe said: \u201cA lot of farmers are turning people off their land if they find them with dogs off their leads. The general \nfeeling among owners is that their loose dogs are playing with the sheep, but they don\u2019t recognise it being a \nproblem.\n\n\u201cThis is happening all the time in the countryside. People from towns are buying homes in the countryside, but they \nare not brought up here and don\u2019t understand the rules and the need to keep dogs on leads at all times around \nlivestock.\n\n\u201cOn this occasion, the sheep are not ripped to pieces, but many were exhausted after being chased by a dog or \ndogs that got tired and went home.\u201d\n\nMr Baird has reported the incident to Hampshire Constabulary. He has appealed to anyone with information to \ncontact police on 101.  \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Hampshire arable farmer found an empty cash machine stolen in a ram raid on a petrol station while combining \nhis crop of oilseed rape.\n\nThe farmer, whose identity we have chosen not to reveal, told Farmers Weekly that he discovered the damaged \nATM hidden under a coat in a hedge on a farm near Basingstoke.\n\nHe alerted officers from Hampshire Constabulary, who attended the farm within two hours.\n\nSee also: Farm security advice to combat rural crime\n\nPolice confirmed to the farmer that the cash machine had been ripped off the wall a few days earlier by thieves, \nwho ram-raided a Mace store at a Texaco petrol station in Dunley\u2019s Hill, Odiham, on 14 July.\n\n\u201cWe were out combining some oilseed rape in our Claas Lexion 660 and when we moved the header around, we \nnoticed a huge piece of steel in the hedge. It was covered by a coat,\u201d said the farmer.\n\n\u201cThe thieves stole a big track digger from a construction site, drove it 200m up the hill through a field on to a road \nand straight through a petrol station forecourt. The raid happened in the early hours of the morning but they were \npretty ballsy.\n\n\u201cThe cash machine contained \u00a356,000 and they used an angle grinder to break through its steel casing. There was \nnothing left in it when I found it except an old pair of gloves.\u201d\n\nAngle grinder disc recovered\n\nThe farmer said he found a discarded disc from an angle grinder believed to have been used in the theft on another \npart of the farm a couple of days before he discovered the cash machine. It is believed the thieves took the cash \nmachine to an isolated part of the farm to cut open the safe.\n\nThe farmer said officers told him the ram raid in Odiham is being linked to a number of similar cash machine thefts \nacross the county.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thieves appear to be targeting a specific type of cash machine. It\u2019s clear they know how to open it,\u201d added the \nfarmer.\n\nPolice have urged farmers and landowners to take steps to prevent the theft of farm machinery that could be used \nin cash machine ram raids.\n\nPC Andy Reid, area beat commander for Basingstoke Rural South, said: \u201cWe are experiencing big problems with \nthieves stealing Manitou telehandlers and tractors with front loaders and using them against cash machines.\n\n\u201cWe would urge every farmer and landowner to take steps to prevent the theft of farm machinery, which is then \nused by gangs to commit crimes.\u201d\n\nSpate of ATM thefts\n\nSince February, there have been at least 14 cash machine ram raids carried out across north-east Hampshire and \nSurrey, including petrol stations, banks and convenience stores in Farnham, Banstead, Farnborough, Guildford, \nHaslemere and Woking.\n\nAnyone with information on the theft in Odiham or other cash machine thefts is urged to contact police on 101.\n\nTheft of telehanders \u201cin vogue\u2019, warns rural insurer\n\nRural crooks are stealing telehandlers from farms either to sell on or use to commit further crimes with increasing \nregularity, according to rural insurer NFU Mutual.\n\nClive Harris, NFU Mutual's agricultural vehicle specialist, said the theft of Manitou and JCB telehandlers is \u201cvery \nmuch in vogue with the criminal fraternity\u201d at the moment.\n\n\u201cThey are being stolen for resale, export and cloning,\u201d added Mr Harris.\n\nHe urged farmers to consider \u201clayers of security\u201d to prevent the theft of telehandlers, tractors and other farm \nmachinery.\n\n\u201cJCBs use the Cesar marking scheme, unique keys and an asset management system that doubles up as a \ntracking system,\u201d said Mr Harris.\n\n\u201cManitous have immobilisation devices with a four-digit PIN. You can also buy retrofit tracking systems and \nimmobilisation devices after market.\u201d\n\nMr Harris also offered five more tips to prevent thefts of telehandlers from farms:\n\nKeep telehandlers out of sight; don\u2019t leave them on show in fields or in the farmyard\n\nConsider lighting or alarm systems in the farmyard\n\nSecure property with properly fitted CCTV\n\nPerimeter fencing and warning signs\n\nLocked gates and barriers\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe theme of the past weeks has definitely been \u201cless is more\u201d. A lot less hours worked than is usual for August \nbecause so much of harvest was completed in July, and much less in the way of cultivations due to the dry \nconditions.\n\n\n\nWe had intended to pull the mole plough through several fields, but Hew became exasperated with the rate of wear \nof the metal, and when the bullet for the mole wore out to breaking point after just 4ha, we decided that 2018 was \nnot the year for it.\n\nIt has also not been a year for early cultivations. With blackgrass dormancy so low, we listened to the agronomist, \nwho said the grassweed seed is best left undisturbed.\n\nSee also: How, why and when to mole drain\n\nSure enough, after useful rains stubbles are now greening up nicely. We won\u2019t be too eager to spray off these \nstubbles with glyphosate just yet either.\n\nBetter to spray just once before drilling than encourage glyphosate resistance with multiple applications.\n\nNew sheep\n\nWe are now the proud owners of 50 Exlana ewe lambs purchased from local breeder Ian Metson.\n\nThese will be grazed on short-term leys rotated round the arable area in a bid to improve soils and reduce \ngrassweeds.\n\nThis is an exciting venture back into sheep for us after a 15-year gap. The wool-shedding Exlanas are a world apart \nfrom the indoor-lambing Suffolk-cross ewes we used to keep.\n\nI am so impressed with the work a group of West Country farmers have done to develop a breed fit for modern \nfarming.\n\nThese sheep not only shed their wool naturally, avoiding all the work, welfare issues and hassle that goes with \nwool, but are extremely good on their feet, have been developed for high weight gains from grass and have been \nselected for worm resistance too.\n\nBrenda, our bookkeeper, and I breathed a sigh of relief to get our VAT inspection out of the way this week. It is a bit \nlike being followed down the road by a police car - even if you feel you haven\u2019t done anything badly wrong, it is still \ngreat not to get pulled up.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAlthough we didn\u2019t manage a bank holiday finish to harvest, we did manage an end-of-August one, which was a \nmonth earlier than last year.\n\nWe had little to dry this year. Quality and quantity were markedly improved from last year, which will make the \nmarketing of grain a decidedly more pleasurable activity than it was last year.\n\nThe lift in grain prices for this harvest compared with those received for 2016 and 2017 seems to have created \ngreater optimism in the industry.\n\nSee also: Read more from our Farmer Focus writers\n\nOne sign of this has been that machinery dealers have reported being very busy with demonstrations and getting \nquotes out on farm.\n\nThis renewed optimism isn\u2019t only confined to the arable sector, as trips to livestock markets recently has seen \nprices for store sheep and cattle at similar levels to last year.\n\nLife goes on\n\n\n\nA interview for a TV news programme about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit had the interviewer asking me \nwhether I would have any grain or livestock left unsold on the farm at the end of March 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, here on the farm we continue to plan for 2019. We have bought our replacement sheep, and the rams \nare out with ewes for a January lambing.\n\nWe have planted more than 240ha of stubble turnips and have started to buy store lambs. On the arable front, \ndespite temptations we haven\u2019t gone back into seed oilseed rape and seed turnip production after our withdrawal \ntwo years ago, and the recent warm and dry weather has brought the flea beetles out again in force.\n\nAn invitation requesting my presence on the rugby field this weekend will have to be resisted.\n\nI have recently discovered a like-minded group of frustrated ex-rugby players who have invited me to play \nbasketball on a Friday evening, so this could satisfy my penchant for team sport.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHarvest is behind us now. We, like most, had an early start and made swift progress through the first three-\nquarters. The weather then turned a little catchier, making the tail end more frustrating.\n\nOverall, results have been reasonable, with quality generally good. Yields appear to be down about 15%, which is \nnot as bad as I originally thought given that the majority of our land is towards the lighter end of the spectrum.\n\nThe exception is the spring beans \u2013 the less said about that the better.\n\nSee also: Top tips on tackling pests when establishing OSR\n\nThe kind conditions means all our oilseed rape has been drilled into decent seed-beds with a bit of moisture.\n\nWe can now spend the next month walking it every couple of days, making sure it is still there and the various \nassorted pests are controlled as best we can.\n\nI have also taken the opportunity to drill an increased area of stubble turnips to try to fill our forage shortfall.\n\nPotato problems\n\nThe start of a new season also means a new placement student. We recently said goodbye to Katie, who put in a \nsterling performance over the past year, and have welcomed Kim in her place.\n\nPotato harvest is now our key concern. We are seeing many problems associated with the hot weather and lack of \nrainfall.\n\nYields are proving highly variable depending on location and availability of water through irrigation and soil type.\n\nThe unirrigated early crops have proved to be particularly disappointing, but the maincrop varieties look to have \nmore potential.\n\nSecondary growth \u2013 something we have not seen a lot of for a long time \u2013 is also proving to be a concern that will \nneed careful storage planning and management.\n\nTo a man, all my customers appear to accept that lower yields are going to mean higher prices. The problem is that \nthey don\u2019t want to be the one in the chain standing it.\n\nPrice inflation when it is beyond our control needs to be shared between the processor, retailer and consumer.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nAugust has brought about such a change. We have gone from being short of forage to having a surplus after taking \na fourth cut in the final days of August. \n\nThe fourth cut ended up being nearly 40ha more than we would normally cut due to the extreme growth, with high \nsoil temperatures and some form of rain most days during the previous two weeks.\n\nWith the regular rain we have taken the decision to house the milking herd because the animals were starting to \nmake a big mess, especially around gateways.\n\nAnd now we have the fourth cut, we are comfortable with our forage stocks for winter. Having the milkers all housed \nshould look after condition on the cows a bit more and we will look to drive fat and protein without the variability of \nwet grass causing a reduction in the solids.\n\nSee also: Cross-bred cows v Holstein: How they compare\n\nFollowing on from last month\u2019s issues with a different milk powder, the original powder has continued to perform \nwell and the calves are weaning nicely at 70 days, having averaged a daily liveweight gain of 0.97kg, with us aiming \nfor a minimum of 0.85kg/day.\n\nWe are pushing well past that to have the heifers at bulling weight from 13 months, as we continue to pull our \ncalving age down to average 24 months.\n\nWe have gathered the fell and weaned the lambs a couple of weeks later than we would have liked, but we wanted \nto ensure plenty of grass for them to come in to.\n\nThe ewes have lost a little more condition than we hoped, achieving a body condition score of about 2, but hopefully \nnow with a copper bolus, mineral drench and the lambs weaned off, the ewes will recover nicely for tupping in \nNovember.  \n\nThe lambs look well and have been put onto some old permanent pasture with plenty of grass to get them used to \nthe higher-quality feed compared with the fell.\n\nIf we don\u2019t do this, it causes the lambs to stall for too long when they go straight onto silage aftermath or reseed \nwithout rougher pasture to help their rumens adapt. \n\nPatrick Morris-Eyton is a new Farmer Focus writer. Read his biography.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIt\u2019s the time of year again when we have to make sure we have enough teasers before tupping, so we are \nvasectomising a few more rams. I am considering going up the race myself and having it done.\n\nOur youngster George (now two months old) seems to think that sleep isn\u2019t needed as much as we do. Funny \nenough, the vets thought I was joking when I booked in five rams and a farmer no longer fit for breeding.\n\nPip has been pushing for us to sort out all our life/critical illness insurance and our wills in case of the worst \nhappening.\n\nRead more from all our livestock Farmer Focus writers\n\nI think it is something all too often ignored, which can leave a mess behind for others to sort out or fight over. It is \npeace of mind to know that everything is in black and white for our children.\n\nOn a happy note, the grass has made a nice comeback after the dry summer and it is looking promising that we will \ngo into winter with more than enough feed.\n\nWe have also been able to put in a few green crops to strip graze, both for the deer and sheep.\n\n\n\nWe have started to sort things out for an AI programme for the deer, which is quite exciting as we have the \nopportunity to take advantage of some of the best eastern European red deer genetics.\n\nThe only frustrating thing is it is such a long-term investment \u2013 both in time and money \u2013 but we have to keep \nmoving or we will get passed by.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m finishing on a negative note. As some of you may have seen, video footage of shearers \nmistreating animals was recently circulated online. I do not excuse any form of hitting sheep.\n\nYes, the story was very one-sided and hard to watch, but as farmers we seem to be seeing a massive rise in people \nlooking to portray us as very aggressive and uncaring towards animals, trying to destroy what most of us really are.\n\nSo, if you see anyone doing anything unacceptable, tell them to cut it out, as it\u2019s giving shearers and farmers a bad \nname and image in the public eye.\n\nMatt and Pip Smith are  Farmer Focus writers from Cornwall.

There will be wagons that are looking for work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plant produced 500,000 tonnes a year of animal feed, including distillers dried grains and other protein-rich co-\nproducts.\n\nVale of York dairy farmer Paul Tompkins said it was likely that prices would rise for purchases of alternative \nfeedstuffs, such as Trafford syrup, once the plant shut down.\n\n\u201cWe can source from elsewhere in the UK or overseas but I really enjoyed being part of a circular economy, which \nwas also producing a \u2018green\u2019 product,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment procrastination\n\nNFU combinable crops board chairman Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cOur sympathy is with Vivergo employees who face an \nuncertain future as a result of the planned closure of its plant.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the biofuel industry has suffered for a number of years following government procrastination on \nrenewable fuel policy. The private sector has invested hundreds of millions of pounds on the premise of a \nsupportive policy, only to be let down by government back-tracking.\n\n\n\n\u201cE10 petrol needs to be embraced, particularly as it is a clear match for the green Brexit the government is trying to \ndeliver. We continue to call on the government to fast-track the introduction of E10 to the UK fuel mix.\u201d\n\nThere is speculation that the plant is likely to be mothballed rather than dismantled so that it could be reopened in \nthe event of crop prices falling significantly.\n\nThe price falls could benefit export-focused grain traders who have until now found it difficult to be competitive \noverseas as the UK has pivoted to being a net importer of grain.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSomething didn\u2019t seem quite right as I folded up the sprayer booms on an early September day.\n\nIt had been a successful tank \u2013 no blocked nozzles, no walkers, fantastic hits from 1979 on Wave105, the perfect \namount of water in the tank, and just one out-of-control springer from Kilmeston running loose in the last field. (Trust \nme: just one is a result.)\n\nWhat was troubling was that I was out there at all. I had had to abandon combining for the morning (mind you, the \nspring barley was still a bit chewy) and rush out to the oilseed rape with insecticide in an attempt to save a crop that \nhad \u2013 until then \u2013 enjoyed the perfect start. Perfect, until the flea beetles arrived.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nBut even that isn\u2019t unusual. We knew it would happen at some time after the neonic ban \u2013 it was just a question of \nwhen.\n\nWhat was bugging me (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun) was the fact that it was another symptom of one of the most insect-\nladen summers I\u2019ve ever known.\n\nUp to scratch\n\nNever mind the flea beetles and the bruchid beetles, we\u2019ve had a roof full of wasp nests, hornets hurling themselves \nagainst the outside floodlights, horseflies giving the Hinton Ampner woods a bit of break from National Trust hordes, \nflying ants clogging up the pool filters and clouds of thunderbugs turning any outdoor job into a scratchathon.\n\nThe shepherds have had a terrible summer with blowflies, the dogs and cats have struggled with harvest and ear \nmites, and Cain the cat has been generously sharing his fleas as a \"thank you\" for sharing my bed.\n\nThen there was the National Trust butterfly-counting lady, almost speechless at the fluttering clouds surrounding \nher as she stood on a scruffy piece of Drier Field\u2019s boundary, struggling to tick all the boxes on her clipboard.\n\nA neighbour (and country magazine editor) reeled off the names of butterflies he\u2019d spotted on his long morning \nvape \u2013 \u201csmall copper, marbled white, speckled wood\u201d.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: 12 short months ago, the media was being carpet-bombed with doom-laden horror stories of \nthe end of the bugs.\n\n\"Alarm over decline in insect population\" said the BBC in October last year. \"Insects disappearing at an alarming \nrate\" claimed the i newspaper in the same month, and The Guardian \u2013 with its customary restraint \u2013 cried: \"A giant \ninsect ecosystem is collapsing due to humans.\"\n\nGlass half clean\n\nAnd every single story backed up its claim with something called the \"windscreen phenomenon\": once upon a time \n(the writer would point out), any car journey would involve a bug-splattered screen. Not any more. And within a few \nsentences, farmers are getting the blame.\n\n\n\nThe \"windscreen phenomenon\" was reinforced by a tsunami of astonishingly similar letters from readers, all from \ndrivers claiming to have experienced the same thing.\n\nThey wrote to national papers, local papers, magazines; if memory serves me right, I think we had one in Farmers \nWeekly.\n\nWell, the insects are out there. I\u2019ve got the stings, the bites, and the wrecked crops to prove it. I\u2019ve been out and \nhad a look (the same reliable scientific technique that is used to disprove other eco-claims such as \"there are no \nhares\", \"it\u2019ll never snow again\" and \"all the topsoil is vanishing\").\n\nAnd as for the widely quoted \"windscreen phenomenon\" \u2013 well, we\u2019ll ignore the fact that driving above 40mph is all \nbut impossible these days, and consider the side profile of a Ford Cortina and then that of a Honda Civic.\n\nConsider the airflow. If your screen is free from bugs, it\u2019s not the farmers\u2019 fault. It\u2019s aerodynamics.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOur poultry farmer finalists this year occupy quite different parts of the sector.

The business farms 575,000 hens itself, and has about 300,000 \nadditional hens producing eggs on contract.\n\nBehind the business\n\nFarm facts\n\n\n\nEstablished in the early 1970s as a pullet-rearing operation, today more focused on expanding free-range egg \nproduction\n\nMore than half-a-million hens owned, with a further 300,000 producing eggs on contract\n\nWide range of environmental stewardship, with more than 60,000 trees planted across 40ha\n\nIts joint MD, Phillip Crawley, is clearly proud of the operation his father first established after leaving a career as a \nnuclear physicist building reactors for nuclear submarines in the early 1970s.\n\nInitially focused on pullet rearing, the outfit moved into caged hen production before switching focus to free-range \nas the relatively young industry grew.\n\nThese more recent years, withPhillip and his brother Ady at the helm, have been marked by innovation.\n\nThe farm was the first in the UK to trial LED lighting for its poultry sheds, back in 2013.\n\nIn the packing centre, they have invested heavily in automation, with robotic arms and sorting machines grading \nand placing eggs in their retail packaging.\n\nFree-range egg production began in 1997 and there has been steady expansion since. \u201cThat is what the consumer \nwanted and shows the growth in free range\u201d, says Phillip.\n\nProduction on a multi-age, multi-site set-up can be a challenge, but rather than the highest number of eggs, the \nfocus is on quality. \u201cOur interest is in first-quality class A eggs. As a producer-packer, we don\u2019t make any money \nfrom second-grade eggs \u2013 we supply retail.\u201d\n\nOut on the farms, there has been investment in solar energy, but more noticeable is the extensive trees growing out \non the range, with birds happily making full use of the shady space to exhibit natural behaviour.\n\n\u201cTree planting didn\u2019t feel right to start with,\u201d says Phillip. \u201cIt was a funny pill to swallow, but it was the right pill. The \nbirds like the trees.\u201d To date, more than 60,000 trees have been planted across 40ha.\n\nOverall, the business has steadily expanded alongside the growth in free-range and shows no sign of slowing.\n\n\u201cWe actively encourage visits by Young Farmers, scouts and Brooksby Melton College,\u201d says Phillip. He has also \nhosted children on the autistic spectrum and even people with varying levels of sight loss from the Royal National \nInstitute of Blind People.\n\nWithin the poultry industry itself, Phillip acts as vice-chairman of the NFU\u2019s poultry board, which helps drive the \nunion\u2019s lobbying effort for the sector.\n\nHe also represents the NFU at the Laying Hen Welfare Group, which works with Defra to develop policy \nsustainably.\n\nSunrise Eggs was also involved in beak trimming trials, a major issue for the poultry sector. It was one of the only \ncommercial-scale farms involved in the project, and required a big personal risk that paid off for the wider industry.\n\nPerformance\n\nOn the prospects for his sector, Phillip says: \u201cPoultry production has been the good news story in farming. It has \ngrown and grown \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful because it gives an added income to the business, and gives the next generation \nsomething to do on a family farm.\u201d\n\n\nAs for the next generation of the business, Phillip says: \u201cI would dearly love all to be involved, but it should be their \ndecision, not mine.\u201d \n\nHe concludes by saying Sunrise Eggs\u2019 focus is on \u201cquietly working all hours to build a family business that we\u2019re \nvery proud of, and we would like to celebrate that.\u201d\n\nThe judges liked\n\nWell-established, profitable business with a wide customer base\n\nImpressive track record of showing off poultry farming to schoolchildren and other groups\n\nLeadership in the broader egg industry, volunteering for important trials on beak treatment\n\nThe judges say:\n\n\u201cSunrise Eggs is a big player in the egg industry, but the business retains a family touch, with Philip and his brother \nAdy heading up the farm their father founded in the early 1970s.\u201d\n\nDerek and Jennifer McKeown\n\nTodds Leap Poultry, Ballygawley, County Tyrone\n\nThere is a reasonable chance that you have eaten a descendent of the genetic stock kept by Dereck McKeown in \nrural Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile the farm only tends to 32,000 birds on site, the progeny from the eggs laid there produce parent stock that is \nshipped across the UK, Europe and occasionally beyond. That parent stock lays the eggs that then go on to \nbecome the broiler birds that end up on dining tables across the world.\n\nBehind the business\n\nFarm facts\n\nSecluded site at least six miles as the crow flies from another poultry farm\n\n32,000 great-grandparent breeder birds from genetics firm Aviagen\n\nFamily affair, with Derek\u2019s wife and four children involved in the business\n\nTo give an idea of scale, those 32,000 birds will ultimately result in 168,000t of poultrymeat at the end of the chain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very conscious that what happens behind those doors has a huge effect on the supply chain,\u201d says Derek. \n\u201cWe\u2019re always focused on the end result, the broiler chicken.\u201d\n\nThe sheer numbers give an idea of the value of the stock in his care, and the procedures and rules surrounding his \nfarm are strict.\n\nIt begins at the farm gate, which is locked at all times. Visitors are kept to an absolute minimum, and biosecurity is \nat the forefront of everything that is done on the farm.\n\nApproaching in the car, wheels are disinfected before admission is granted to the spotless site.\n\nFrom there, boot dips are obligatory, and visitors must be screened for disease before entering sheds. Regular \ndeliveries of feed and egg collection is undertaken by the same few people, who are well versed in the rules of the \nfarm, and for Derek and his family, the procedures surrounding farm hygiene are rigorous.\n\n\n\nThe day starts with showering into the site, and changing into fresh clothing every day. As Derek says, it\u2019s taking \ncare of the basics that yields the best results, and that begins with getting the birds fed.\n\nAt eight in the morning each day, feed tracks are lowered, giving the stock three hours in which to access their \nration. \u201cIt\u2019s good practice to be present \u2013 feeding is the one time of the day you can watch birds and spot the ones \nthat are not eating or showing other signs that something\u2019s not right,\u201d explains Derek.\n\nCollecting and sorting eggs is another big part of the operation, as is monitoring their quality \u2013 both to learn more \nabout what is happening in each house, and to meet the exacting standards the operation requires.\n\nAny cracks, double yolks or other defects can indicate an early health problem, so need investigating, and only the \nmost flawless eggs can go on to be hatched as parent stock.\n\nFor antibiotics use there is the same pressure on this stock at the top of the tree as there is for farmers producing \nfood. It\u2019s part of the drive to produce more robust, healthy birds further down the chain, with birds more vigorously \nculled out rather than treated with medicines.\n\nBlood sampling is taken every two weeks to both reassure customers that the health status of birds has been \nmaintained throughout their laying life, and to detect any issues early on.\n\nPerformance\n\nAll this precision, passion and achievement is all the more surprising considering Derek only started out in poultry \nfarming eight years ago. After a career in haulage, he decided poultry would provide a more secure income, and \nless stress.\n\nWhile both conventional egg production and broiler rearing were options, he was attracted to the demanding \u2013 but \nultimately rewarding \u2013 husbandry of grandparent stock. \u201cIt\u2019s the Premier League of poultry production,\u201d explains \nDerek.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nAttention to detail runs through every element of this farming enterprise\n\nEmbraced technical poultry farming with top results\n\nDerek has innovated with the spec of his farm, being the first to install a lab on site to help testing\n\nThe judges say:\n\n\u201cDerek and Jennifer are proof that entering the poultry sector can pay dividends. They are clearly suited to the \ndedication and attention to detail that producing top-quality genetic stock requires.\u201d\n\nGlen Powell\n\nLadywath Poultry, Spilsby, Lincolnshire\n\nFor Moy Park, one of the UK\u2019s leading poultry production businesses, employing Glen Powell when there were no \nvacancies proved a shrewd move.\n\nHe has since grown from assisting with chick deliveries to managing one of the firm\u2019s most interesting new sites \u2013 a \ndouble-decker broiler farm with a 189,000-bird capacity.\n\nFarm facts\n\n\nUnusual construction, with six separate sheds stacked over two stories\n\nTwo full-time staff, with Glen taking overall responsibility for the site\n\nPart of Moy Park, the UK\u2019s second-largest poultrymeat producer\n\nBehind the business\n\nHe has come a long way to find himself at that point. Glen has no background in poultry farming, having grown up \nin urban Essex, and began as many do helping out on a free-range egg business after school.\n\nAn early passion translated to school holidays and weekends helping out on a range of farms that were \npredominantly smaller, traditional flat-deck systems.\n\nHe recalls it was dirty work, with climbing under nest boxes to collect floor eggs being a particularly messy job.\n\nThe move to broiler farming, with many thousands more birds, was a big change \u2013 less dirt and more precision, as \ngetting the atmosphere right in sheds is by far the most important way to improve performance.\n\nAfter about nine months as part of the team placing chicks, Glen was himself placed on Redbarn Farm as assistant \nmanager, where he learned the broad base of skills that broiler farming requires.\n\nAfter a spell at a farm that grew birds on contract for Moy Park, he returned to the company in August 2016 to \nmanage a newly rebuilt site \u2013 a double-decker poultry shed with three houses on lower levels and three above.\n\nWhile it is not the only farm of its type in the UK, it is a rarity, and wasn\u2019t performing well.\n\nGlen quickly turned the farm around. In his first year on the site he posted an average feed conversion ratio of \n1:1.51 and a European Production Efficiency Factor (a measure of poultry farm performance) just below 400.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with broiler production, they are very impressive figures indeed \u2013 and few farms in the UK \nwould match these numbers.\n\nThis was achieved on a tight eight-crop-a-year schedule \u2013 with just five days\u2019 turnaround between fully grown \nbroilers leaving the sheds and new chicks arriving, there is little room for error.\n\nPerformance\n\nIt is attention to detail that brings these results, and relentless focus on the task at hand. The judges visited at \nturnaround, which could be considered as downtime, but the farm was in a flurry of activity, with bedding deliveries, \ncleaning and general preparation.\n\nGlen explains the meticulous tricks to get chicks comfortable; laying out feed to get them eating as soon as \npossible, and ensuring cool, clean water is on offer from day one. From there, it is all about managing ventilation \nand lighting to ensure good growth rates and high welfare.\n\nThat management is clearly something Glen has a talent for. The site had received complaints about smells before \nhis tenure, but his careful management of airflow brought these to an end. It is also a key to the high performance in \nthe sheds.\n\nWhere next? Bigger and more complex sites beckon. \u201cI think a fresh pair of eyes on any unit can bring some \nimprovements,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd beyond? It\u2019s hard to see Glen moving into the corporate side of an integrator, with such a clear passion for \npractical farming.\n\n\nThe judges liked\n\nTop performance in a complex poultry site\n\nClear attention to detail and desire to succeed in everything he does\n\nMoved quickly through the ranks of Moy Park to managing a large, complex site with two staff members\n\nThe judges say\n\n\u201cGlen has come a long way in a relatively short period, from an after-school job collecting eggs to managing a \ncomplex site for Moy Park and producing astounding results to boot.\u201d \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGovernment action is needed to help growers obtain water for crops still to be harvested, say eastern region \nfarmers.\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove faced calls to ensure water for food receives a higher priority when he met farmers at \nthe NFU regional office in Newmarket last Friday (7 September).\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr Gove heard how the agricultural drought had affected crops in East Anglia, with some \nfarmers running out of water to irrigate fruit and vegetables.\n\nSee also: Water Bank launched to help drought-hit farmers\n\nFarmers thanked the Environment Agency for its response to requests for flexibility on abstraction licences, which \nhad helped some growers secure additional water for irrigation.\n\nBut Mr Gove was told there was a short-term need for greater flexibility to help growers with crops still to harvest to \nobtain the water they required.\n\nExtreme weather\n\nLessons needed to be learned so farmers were better prepared for future weather extremes, said NFU water \nresources specialist Paul Hammett, chairman of the Water for Food Group.\n\n\u201cOur farmers deliver remarkably high volumes of top-quality fruit and vegetables to the public, with only 2% of the \ntotal amount of water abstracted in England.\n\n\u201cBut this year\u2019s record-breaking heatwave has highlighted how vulnerable farmers are to dry weather and disruption \nto water supplies.\n\n\u201cWhile households are protected by unrestricted water use, farmers have been in danger of running out of water \nbefore crops are ready to harvest.\u201d\n\nFlexibility needed\n\nAdditional flexibility around abstraction licences will be required if warm and dry weather continued into the autumn, \nsaid Mr Hammett.\n\nThere is also a need for longer-term planning to improve the response to future droughts.\n\n\u201cWe would like Mr Gove to consider how water for food production can be given a higher priority, so its importance \nis recognised alongside water for domestic consumption.\u201d\n\nAt a drought summit last month, Mr Gove pledged to do whatever it takes to help farmers secure adequate access \nto water.\n\n\n\nFurther news is expected from Defra in the coming days following talks with Brussels to relax EU rules so farmers \ncan increase the availability of fodder resources for livestock.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMichael Gove has back-pedalled on a plan to ban live exports from the UK, indicating his position was now in \nfavour of \"restrictions\" to the trade.\n\nWTO tariffs on live exports are between 5-15%, whereas tariffs on lamb meat are 48%, raising questions whether \nthe U-turn is a contingency against a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe environment secretary had previously supported a ban, launching a consultation on ending the shipping of live \nanimals from the UK at the beginning of this year.\n\nSee also: Direct payments to be phased out by 2027\n\nHowever, Mr Gove repeatedly told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Defra was looking at restricting the trade.\n\n\u201cI am minded to take every step that we can in order to ensure we restrict animal exports and safeguard animal \nwelfare,\u201d said the minister.\n\nHe added that all options, including a ban, remained on the table.\n\nIn 2016, the UK exported about 380,000 sheep, 10,000 cattle and 8,000 pigs to the EU for slaughter. However, this \nwas as low as just 20,000 sheep and no cows in 2017, according to the NFU.\n\nA spokesperson for the Conservatives added that the party had consistently said it would control the export of live \nfarm animals for salughter once the UK left the EU. \n\nThey added, \u201cEarlier this year we called for evidence on restricting and potentially banning live exports. As the \nEnvironment Secretary said, all options are on the table and a ban remains a possibility.\"\n\nP&O ferry ban\n\nMr Gove\u2019s flip-flop follows the announcement that P&O Ferries would stop the live export of very young calves from \nScotland.\n\nThe company\u2019s decision came after the broadcast of a widely criticised documentary, Disclosure: The Dark Side of \nDairy by BBC Scotland, which examined dairy bull calves\u2019 six-day journey to Spain.  \n\n\u201cWe can confirm that P&O Ferries will cease co-operating with the Scottish government to transport across the Irish \nSea young calves destined for continental Europe with immediate effect,\u201d read a statement from the ferry company.\n\n\"We place the highest priority on animal welfare across all of our routes and were shocked by the scenes in last \nnight's documentary.\"\n\nBBC criticism\n\nNFU Scotland launched a scathing response to the documentary, describing it as inaccurate and sensationalised.\n\n\u201cAlthough the scenes are distressing, there is actually no evidence to indicate that the Scottish calves travelling to \nNorthern Ireland, Ireland and continental Europe were subjected to this kind of treatment,\u201d said NFUS president \nAndrew McCornick.  \n\n\u201cThe distressing scenes were those of cattle being shipped onto boats, which we have discovered were obtained in \nRomania and were Hungarian cows.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr McCornick added a segment of the documentary recorded in an Egyptian slaughterhouse was wholly \nunacceptable, but again there was no evidence to indicate that the cows featured were from Scotland \u2013 adding that \neven the clips of the dairy calves in the market were not Scottish calves.\n\n\u201cNFU Scotland has the utmost faith in the Scottish government and its chief veterinary officer to ensure that Scottish \ndairy bull calves being exported are done so to the highest of welfare standards and regulations.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing to learn that P&O Ferries have reviewed their policies following this sensationalised and \ninaccurate documentary and we will look to work closely with them to see where members of ours who this will \neffect can go from here.\"\n\nThe president added that his union would be submitting an official complaint to the BBC in regards to the standards \nof the reporting involved in the documentary and journalism showcased in the programme which, disappointingly, \nhad already had an immediate effect on the agricultural industry.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Herefordshire grower has travelled to Brussels to tell MEPs about the vital need for farmers to have continued \naccess to pesticides.\n\nJohn Chinn, co-owner of Cobrey Farms, one of Britain\u2019s biggest asparagus producers, in Coughton, Ross on Wye, \naddressed the European Parliament\u2019s Special Committee on Pesticides at the invitation of West Midlands \nConservative MEP Anthea McIntyre.\n\nMr Chinn, who also grows berries, beans and other crops, warned MEPs that the world population of 7.6 billion \nwould reach 10 billion by 2050, and the great challenge of the 21st century was to produce more food from the \nsame area while protecting biodiversity.\n\nSee also: Three growers look for alternatives to world\u2019s top pesticide\n\nHe said the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the European Crop Protection Association estimated that \nwithout crop protection tools farmers could lose 80% of their harvests to damaging insects, weeds and plant \ndiseases.\n\nIn the UK, this has been underlined this week by the difficulties oilseed rape growers have faced trying to establish \nthe crop without access to neonicotinoids. This has left crops vulnerable to severe attack from cabbage stem flea \nbeetle.\n\nMr Chinn spoke about his work for the Centre for Crop Health and Protection, one of four agri-tech innovation \ncentres set up by the UK government, which he chairs.\n\nHe outlined how developments such as targeted chemistry, use of biological control agents, targeted application \ntechnologies and progress in plant breeding and genetics could combine to ensure the production of safe, healthy, \nnutritious, affordable food with ever better care for the environment.\n\nSlow approval process\n\nBut he described the EU approval process for plant protection products as one of the most stringent in the world \nand said it took over 11 years, an average of 200 scientific studies and more than 250m (\u00a3225m) to bring a product \nto the EU market.\n\n\u201cRigorous testing and application protocols are very effective in protecting the public and the environment. However \nlittle attention has been given to its other aims of effectively supporting productive and competitive agriculture and \nhorticulture,\u201d Mr Chinn told MPs.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the regulation has just started its eighth year and it has only brought to the market the equivalent of \nabout one new active substance per year, including low-risk substances, demonstrates the approach is failing to \ndeliver for growers.\u201d\n\nHome truths\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Miss McIntyre, Conservative agriculture spokesperson in the EU parliament, said: \u201cThis \ncommittee was set up with a specific agenda to undermine trust in plant protection products \u2013 so I was determined \nthat it would hear from a farmer who is also an expert in this area.\n\n\u201cHe [Mr Chinn] told the MEPs a few home truths \u2013 not only about the industry's real needs but also about very \npractical ways of limiting the use of products while improving the environment.\u201d\n\nBut organic farming lobby the Soil Association (SA) said a less stringent approvals process could lead to even \ngreater harm to wildlife and increased risks to public health.\n\nEmma Hockridge, head of policy for farming and land use at the Soil Association, said: \u201cResearch is increasingly \nhighlighting the harmful impacts of pesticide use on the environment and human health.\n\n\u201cOrganic farmers show that it is possible to farm successfully without relying on synthetic pesticides and a lot more \nshould be done to help all farmers adopt and improve these practical alternatives, which pose less risk to our soils, \nenvironment, and health.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStale seed-beds and other cultural approaches can go a long way in managing blackgrass, but a robust residual \nherbicide programme is vital in getting the level of control needed for high cereal yields.\n\nThat\u2019s because survivors are very difficult to control with widespread resistance to herbicides like Atlantis.\n\nGetting it wrong can prove costly with just 100 ears/sq m of blackgrass reducing wheat yields by 1t/ha.\n\nSee also: 10 ways to improve potato storage management\n\nSo what can farmers do to ensure residuals do their job this autumn?\n\nKey steps to good residual efficacy\n\nGood seed-bed quality (fine and firm) and the right seed depth will minimise crop effect\n\nAim to drill when the soil temperature is in single figures\n\nIdeally, rainfall within two weeks of pre-emergence application\n\nPre-emergence: Avadex granules 15kg/ha, 1 litre/ha Movon plus 3 litres/ha Wicket\n\nPeri-emergence: 0.5 litres/ha Pontos\n\nAdd 0.2 litres of adjuvant Backrow\n\nFollow best practice for application\n\nTiming of drilling\n\nBoth soil moisture and temperature affect residual herbicide performance, with cool, moist soils giving longer and \nbetter activity.\n\n\nAgrii regional technical adviser Will Foss explains that moisture is needed for the uptake of herbicide by weeds in \nthe soil solution. Therefore, dry conditions hinder uptake.\n\nWith temperature, warmer soils lead to more rapid breakdown of the residual active, reducing the time it remains \nactive against germinating weeds.\n\nHe points to last autumn, where residual herbicide efficacy at Agrii\u2019s Stow Longa trial site in Cambridgeshire was \nexcellent.\n\nThe crop was drilled on 23 October in quite dry conditions. It remained dry the week after and then 0.5in of rain fell \nin the second week, which was enough to activate the residuals.\n\n\u201cHaving rainfall within two weeks of application is the most important factor,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, while farmers can\u2019t predict when it will rain, soil temperature is something that they can measure and act \non.\n\nSoil temperature was constantly about 15C for the first half of the month, then it started to fall and by the end of the \nmonth, it was down to 9-10C.\n\nHe advises aiming for the \u201cmagical single figure\u201d at drilling, as it will help residuals work for longer.\n\nProduct combinations\n\nActives\n\nAtlantis \u2013 iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron\n\nAvadex \u2013 tri-allate\n\nMovon \u2013 diflufenican + flufenacet + flurtamone\n\nLiberator - diflufenican + flufenacet\n\nPontos - flufenacet + picolinafen\n\nWicket - prosulfocarb\n\nFlufenacet is a key herbicide and should be at the heart of any residual programme. However, it needs to be \npartnered with other actives to deliver the required control and protect it from potential resistance development.\n\nIn Agrii trials, one stand out flufenacet product is Movon which at 1 litre/ha delivers 30g/ha more diflufenican than \nLiberator when applied at the same 240g/ha rate of flufenacet. It also brings flurtamone, a key active for \ngrassweeds and a range of broad-leaved weeds.\n\nWhile it\u2019s more expensive than the popular flufenacet product Liberator, across 31 conducted by Agrii between \n2009 and 2018, it delivered 6% better control of blackgrass ears than Liberator.\n\nIn a modest blackgrass population of 500 ear/sq (if left untreated), this additional 6% control equates to an extra \n0.3t/ha of yield, based on data from the Stow Longa blackgrass trial. \n\nAdding Avadex in the pre-emergence programme brings another lift in blackgrass control. The final part of Mr Foss\u2019 \nrecommended stack is prosulfcarb at 2 litres/ha.\n\n\u201cIn bad situations, you can go up to 3 litres/ha to give that extra hit,\u201d he says.\n\nThis stack delivers five different actives and when coupled with late drilling (23 October), it was giving nearly 100% \ncontrol of blackgrass heads in a farm trial near Brackley, Northamptonshire, in 2018.\n\n\n\nIn tougher situations, a top up may be needed at the peri-emergence timing, especially as options are limited once \nblackgrass is beyond the one to two-leaf stage.\n\nHe has found Pontos to be particularly useful at 0.5 litres/ha, delivering 120g/ha flufenacet (total dose 360g/ha) \nalong with some extra contact activity from piclinofen.\n\nOpting for this approach also avoids adding more diflufenican, keeping the total dose below the 120g/ha limit to \nreduce the risk of potential problems in a following crop of oilseed rape.\n\nAdjuvants\n\nWhile adjuvants are not herbicides themselves, they have been proven to give pesticides a boost.\n\nAgrii has recommended the use of adjuvant Backrow with residual herbicides for some years. It is a specific long-\nchain oil that has performed consistently well in previous trials.\n\nAcross 42 trials from the last nine years, there has been an average 9% uplift in control of grassweed heads. Based \nagain on an untreated population of 500 ears/sq m of blackgrass, this extra control equates to 0.45t/ha in extra \nwheat yield.\n\nMr Foss says the adjuvant helps to maintain a lethal dose of the resuidual in the weed germination layer in the soil, \nby binding with the clay particle. It also has a positive influence on spray quality.\n\nSo one question is whether an adjuvant can reduce the impact of a dry autumn on residual herbicide performance?\n\nDry conditions trial\n\nTo test whether an adjuvant can help in dry conditions, Agrii tested Backrow last autumn at Stow Longa.\n\nThe trial looked at its performance at different soil moisture levels using irrigation to simulate rainfall affter \napplication of the pre-emergence herbicide.\n\nSimulated rainfall improved residual performance by 10% in terms of numbers of blackgrass ears seen in June. \n\u201cAgain this highlights the importance of soil moisture.\u201d\n\nHowever, the adjuvant did help to overcome the lack of rain by adding 7% extra control when used with the pre-\nemergence and 8% when added to the peri-emergence.\n\nAn uplift was also seen where moisture was available with the addition of Backrow, which took the final blackgrass \ncontrol to an impressive 98%.\n\nTop application tips \n\nSoil is a difficult target which to achieve adequate spray coverage, as there are many variable angles due to the \nrandom distribution of soil aggregates. Here are Agrii regional technical adviser David Felce\u2019s top spraying tips for \nresidual herbicides.\n\nAim for a water volume of 200 litres/ha: Sprayer operators would prefer opting for 100 litres/ha, as halving water \nvolume increases output by one-third. However, trials show this low water volume compromises efficacy, with 50% \ncontrol at the low volume compared with 85% at 200 litres/ha.\n\nSelect the Defy 3D nozzle: The Defy nozzle is the proven performer, as the 83 degree fan produces fewer fine \ndroplets than a standard flat fan and as a result is less drifty. \u201cThis means more droplets are hitting the target.\u201d Best \ncoverage is achieved with alternating the Defy nozzle forward and backward.\n\nAim for a boom height of 50cm where practical: Doubling the height to 1m increases the risk of drift tenfold, which \nagain means less product hits the target, resulting in 20% loss in efficacy.\n\n\n\nGo no faster than 10-12kph: \u201cSpeed is the biggest enemy of accurate application.\u201d Going faster creates more \nturbulence, which increases drift.\n\nAdd an adjuvant to the mix: Use of Backrow results in a more uniform droplet size, giving better coverage of the soil \nand improved efficacy.\n\nUltra low drift nozzles: Be aware that target coverage may be compromised, as these nozzles produce fewer, larger \ndroplets.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCompact calving, outwintering of all cattle and forage-only finishing is enabling herd manager Robert Huxley to run \nthe 250-suckler herd at Yews Farm on the Longford Estate in Salisbury, largely on his own with a 2-2.5% mortality \nfigure.\n\nCattle numbers were cut back from 450-head in 2016 after a decision was taken to control the herd\u2019s fixed costs.\n\nThis has successfully streamlined an already low-cost system, with the herd managing outdoors all year with no hay \nor silage and now using only one full-time labour unit.\n\nSee also: Commercial focus improves sales and EBVs in Angus herd\n\nExtra staff are only brought in from the arable enterprise to help with gathering and working cattle. Other than that, \nMr Huxley manages them alone, seeing only four calves die this calving period out of 235 and current mortality to \nweaning and sale at 0.5%.\n\nFarm facts\n\nLongford Farms, Yews Farm, Odstock\n\nVaccinating for IBR and Clostridia\n\nTested free for BVD Leptospirosis and Johne\u2019s\n\n364ha of permanent pasture of which 131ha is water meadow for summer grazing\n\n1,300ha of combinable crops in a six-year rotation\n\nCrops grown include winter wheat, spring barley, oilseed rape, oats and peas\n\nLongford Estate\n\nTotal estate covers 6,400ha\n\nAquaculture business produces 1,200t of rainbow trout/year\n\n40% of the land is tenanted and the rest is farmed between two large farming partnerships\n\n890ha of woodland, producing commercial firewood and willow for cricket bats\n\n200 residential properties\n\n13 miles of double-bank fishing on the Rivers Ebble and Avon\n\nOwned by the 9th Earl of Radnor in possession of same family since 1717\n\nWith such huge alterations to the herd, the estate admits that budgets and costings need time to be calculated \nunder the new regime to work out the impact on profitability.\n\n\n\nFurther changes also came last year when the first finished animals from the herd \u2013 which is three-quarter-bred \nAberdeen Angus \u2013 were sold.\n\nAlthough initially unplanned, due to having a major surplus of heifers after a 45% reduction in cow numbers, Mr \nHuxley opted to finish 60 heifers off grass last summer.  \n\n\u201cWe would like to think we will be running a more profitable herd into the future because we are reducing our labour \ncosts while increasing income from the new venture into selling finished animals,\u201d explains Mr Huxley, who has \nbeen managing the herd for 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe could get an extra \u00a3400-\u00a3500 a head for 60 heifers each year for very little cost as we intend to finish heifers \non our grassland, which has no fertiliser.\u201d\n\nExtensive system\n\nNo buildings or creep feeding are required by the herd, with all youngstock, cows and bulls outwintered. The cattle \nrange on large expanses of permanent pasture from water meadows to chalky downland.\n\nSteep-sided hills (1 in 4 slopes) and walks of up to 1.5 miles to the yard are common and mean cattle are \nsometimes only gathered three times a year, with small corrals in some fields enabling Mr Huxley to work very small \nnumbers if required.\n\nThe herd is gathered no more than four times a year \u2013 TB testing, weaning, vaccination and a fly pour-on are the \nkey jobs.\n\nThe foundation of the herd includes some Simmental, Charolais and Limousin genetics, although the farm has been \nfocused on using purely Angus bulls since a change in farming policy 20 years ago.\n\nHerd productivity\n\nBy running a tight calving block, each of the three groups of cows calves for 9 weeks. By buying high index bulls on \nEBVs and cutting out any fertility or health problems, Mr Huxley has achieved a good level of productivity.\n\nCows are expected to produce seven to nine calves in their life, with cows lasting 10-11 years. Each year 70% of \nthe herd is in calf within six weeks of the bulls going in.\n\nThe aim is to get 230 of the 250 cows in calf, although in recent years this has been surpassed, calving 236 \n(94.5%).\n\n\u201cWhen cows reach 11 or so we sell them straight off the farm, getting an Angus premium at Pitstock, Telford, and \nusually a cheque of \u00a31,300-\u00a31,400, so it does pay to cash the cows in and not hold onto them for the sake of it,\u201d \nsays Mr Huxley.\n\nCalving\n\nCalving outdoors, the system requires the herd to calve themselves, with Mr Huxley assisting less than 1% last year \nand generally no more than 2-3%.  \n\n\u201cWe had a backwards calf, one set of twins and a swollen calf; apart from that, they managed on their own,\u201d says \nMr Huxley. \"I don't go out at night to watch them and I don't help calves suckle \u2013 they don't need it.\"\n\nA calving notebook records which cows are having calving issues and which bulls are leading to big calves. Freeze-\nbranding is done on the shoulder for easy identification as this area stays cleaner, he explains.\n\nCows calve for three months from April to June, with four groups of cows run in herds (first calvers, second calvers, \nthird and fourth calvers and older cows) to calve in batches every 10-14 days.\n\n\n\nTagging and castration has often happened by day two or three of a calf\u2019s life. Temperament is very important and \nis a culling offence, although first calvers are given a chance for minor misdemeanours.\n\nBeef finishing\n\nAlthough historically a store cattle-producing herd, the Longford herd took 60 heifers through to slaughter after \nselling the remaining surplus as breeding stock after the herd downsized.\n\nCommanding an Angus premium, the heifers sold for \u00a34.05/kg-\u00a34.20/kg into meat processor Dawn Cardington \nthrough Farm Mark, after Farm Mark director Paul Jeenes advised the estate to consider selling the animals prime. \nCows are sold to Pitstocks along with some prime animals, also through Farm Mark.\n\nLast year\u2019s prime heifers mainly hit R4L (48.15%), RH4H (20.37%) and O+4L (22.22%), with one -U4L and three \nR3s.\n\nMost youngstock are sold at 15 to 16-month-old stores off farm, with some sold at Frome and Salisbury.\n\nOutwintering\n\nWiltshire\u2019s light, chalky ground is ideal for outwintering on and the arable enterprise produces 90ha of stubble \nturnips and 40ha of winter grazing rye to winter the calves after they are weaned at 9-10 months.\n\nThe herd is usually taken off pastures by early November and moved to wintering ground until mid-March where \ncattle are given 50m x 60-70m of straw bales to nest and winter on stubbles.\n\nExtra minerals and energy are supplied by mineral buckets \u2013 no hay or silage is given.\n\n\u201cThe cattle eat the straw or nest in it as they wish,\u201d explains Mr Huxley. \u201cThey can feed on the blocks as and when \nand I can manage myself with no hard work feeding and mucking out through the winter.\u201d\n\nBulls at Longford\n\nBulls are bought from Stirling each year and tend to run across 30 females each, with 11 bulls serving the herd, \nalthough some are required to bull up to 60 in a summer.\n\nBulls from the Tonley, Duncaziemere, Tree Bridge, McCornick, Lakewood and Haughton herds have worked well in \nrecent years, says Mr Huxley.\n\n\u201cI study the EBVs and health status of the bulls \u2013 particularly looking for high milk percentages and ease of calving \n\u2013 and narrow them down that way, before having a look at them,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAs well as being leader of the Liberal Democrats and a former cabinet minister, Sir Vince Cable is well versed in the \nfundamentals of farming; his wife Rachel Smith raised suckler beef on a New Forest smallholding.\n\nIt gives him an insight into agricultural policy and the challenges that lie ahead with Brexit looming, which he \nbelieves will be a disaster for the farming sector.\n\n\u201cThe Chequers accord may cause less damage than \u2018no deal\u2019 at all, but it has serious problems,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody \nhas explained how the proposed two-tier tariff system is actually going to work, it is far from clear that it can solve \nthe problem of the Irish frontier, and it will not prove acceptable to Brussels.\u201d\n\nSee also: Farmers \u2018could go bust without subsidies\u2019, say Lib Dems\n\n\nTrade concerns\n\nFor agriculture, Sir Vince sees three big issues \u2013 trade, labour supply and future support.\n\n\u201cIf we get a \u2018no deal\u2019, the trade implications for agriculture will be pretty horrific,\u201d he says. \u201cIn industrial goods, there \naren\u2019t too many tariffs. But for agriculture, they are massive and if there is no deal, those come into effect.\n\n\u201cAbout two-thirds, or \u00a312bn, of UK food exports go to the European Union and that would stop \u2013 it\u2019s as brutal as \nthat.\n\n\u201cI can understand the logic of not wanting to stay in the single market because of the freedom of movement issue, \nbut the decision to leave the customs union is utterly perverse,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cLeaving it creates enormous problems, not just for the Irish frontier, but for the whole supply chain. It\u2019s completely \nunnecessary and it cuts us off from the existing framework of trade agreements that the EU already has with large \nnumbers of other countries.\u201d\n\nSeasonal labour\n\nOn seasonal labour, Sir Vince remains sceptical \u2013 despite the recent announcement of a new pilot scheme by \nHome Secretary Sajid Javid.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office is very bureaucratic and tends to treat all foreigners as a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that they \nwill devise some sympathetic, business-sensitive model requires an enormous leap of faith.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just agriculture. Large parts of the country with upland farming also depend very heavily on tourism, \nand the hospitality industry is just as vulnerable as farming to labour shortages.\u201d\n\nLong-term support\n\nSir Vince also questions the government\u2019s long-term commitment to supporting agriculture with taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\n\u201cAt \u00a33bn, direct payments represent a substantial amount of overall farm income,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough the \ngovernment has promised to keep this going to 2022, after that it will come under enormous pressure to cut the \nsubsidy level, given all the pressures on other areas of public finance.\u201d\n\nSir Vince says it is \u201cironic\u201d that the Common Agricultural Policy has come in for such criticism, given the reforms \nthat have already taken place.\n\n\u201cThe direct payment system is no longer based on subsidising production. Many of the things people are asking for \nin terms of better stewardship are already happening. There is not enough acknowledgement of the extent to which \nthe CAP has already been reformed.\u201d\n\nThe replacement domestic agricultural policy is set to focus future support on environmental delivery \u2013 something \nSir Vince agrees is essential. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure the balance is right. I don\u2019t think the farmers have been at the centre \nof [Defra secretary] Michael Gove\u2019s thinking.\u201d\n\nSelf-sufficiency\n\nHaving stressed the importance of productive agriculture, Sir Vince is more cautious when it comes to issues of \nself-sufficiency.\n\n\u201cI would not put a figure on it to define what self-sufficiency is \u2013 we don\u2019t do it for any other sector,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, \nthere is an argument for producing as much stuff as close to home as possible. But I\u2019m not arguing for a closed \nborder approach.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are some areas where liberalisation of trade makes sense, sugar being a case in point. But there is also a \nstrong argument for supporting domestic production, providing it is not done in an extremely costly, protectionist \nway.\u201d\n\nSecond referendum\n\nWith all the turmoil surrounding Brexit and fears of a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, Sir Vince is far from convinced it will \nactually happen at all and remains a keen supporter of a second referendum on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a position where, in two months from now, it\u2019s likely that parliament will not endorse a \u2018no deal\u2019, \nand will not endorse the Chequers compromise either. When we confront this dilemma, the sensible option will be \nto ask the public: \u2018is this what you really wanted or would you rather stay in the European Union?\u2019\n\n\u201cNow they are better equipped to understand what\u2019s on offer, they may have a different view. In places like \nSwitzerland, the idea of a confirmatory referendum is not unusual at all.\u201d\n\nVince Cable on...\n\nRural crime \u201cAll major police forces need to have a rural task force. Money is not limitless and I was part of a \ngovernment trying to enforce financial discipline, but the truth is we do need more police officers with specialist \ncapacity for dealing with rural areas.\u201d\n\nThe supply chain \u201cOne of the things I did when I was secretary of state for business was to set up the Grocery Code \nAdjudicator. The problem is that it only covers the people who deal direct with the supermarkets. I would like to go \nback and strengthen the rights for people on the second and third tier of the supply chain who often bear the brunt \nof aggressive approaches from above.\u201d\n\nRural housing \u201cThe price of housing in relation to people\u2019s earnings in rural areas is just astronomic. The planning \nsystem is very restrictive and the second home ownership problem is well known. We need a combination of \nmaking it easier to build new housing \u2013 especially social housing \u2013 and penalties on second home ownership, such \nas higher council tax surcharges and higher stamp duty on second homes.\u201d\n\nPublic access \u201cThe right to roam principle is a good one. Obviously it should be done with properly managed routes \nand respect for livestock, but as far as possible we want the countryside to be open. If you want a strong rural \neconomy, townspeople must feel they have an interest in it.\u201d\n\nBadger culling \u201cIt should very much be driven by the scientific evidence. Sentiment should not drive the policy. I was \na member of the cabinet that approved the existing policy back in 2013. It is stupid for politicians to get involved \nwith quarrels with their scientific advisers.\u201d\n\nGlyphosate \u201cAgain, it\u2019s down to the science. The worst thing is when ministers get a bee in their bonnet; they have \nread an article that challenges the consensus and they jump on the bandwagon. That\u2019s a very dangerous thing to \ndo.\u201d\n\nHis political future \u201cThere is much going on. There is the possibility of an early election, there is Brexit, there are \ndiscussions about new party formations. I\u2019m going to be leading us through all of that. But equally I\u2019m not Robert \nMugabe. I\u2019m not going on forever.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLet\u2019s face it, it doesn't get much better than tucking into a nice steak, especially when you have something to \ncelebrate (maybe even just making it to Friday).\n\nRare or medium, sirloin or fillet, we all have our preferences, but one thing that we can all agree on is that for the \nperfect eating experience, your steak must be tender, juicy and flavoursome.\n\n\n\nI have spoken before about the need to improve the consistency of beef products in the UK, and although \nnumerous changes need to be made for this to be achieved, for me there is one simple change that will help \nsignificantly.\n\nSee also: More articles from Josh Dowbiggin\n\nThe answer is to go native. There is a reason why the premium beef ranges of all the major retailers are breeds \nsuch as Angus or Hereford, and it isn\u2019t because it looks good on the label.\n\nThey offer an element of consistency when it comes to the eating experience that continental-sired cattle cannot \nmatch. I am not suggesting breed is the only contributor to eating quality \u2013 far from it \u2013 but it certainly has an \ninfluence.\n\nChange in mentality\n\nHowever, for these breeds to have a real impact on the beef business, they need to move away from the \"premium \nmentality\".\n\nPremium product offerings will only ever impact a certain portion of a consumer population, purely because of the \nprice tag. But who says native beef has to be expensive?\n\nThese breeds are built for easy management and low-cost production systems, so in reality they are the profitable \noption for farmers, regardless of premium.\n\nThe eating quality benefits presented by these breeds, coupled with the likelihood that Brexit will mean a change in \nthe grading system and the need for a lower-cost, forage-based approach to beef production, puts native breeds in \na great position over the next decade.\n\nUntil we see a change in beef grading system, native breed premiums will have to remain in order to incentivise \nbeef producers against producing what the EUROP grid tells them to.\n\nBut when the grading system incentivises quality as much as it does quantity \u2013 then you will likely see a major shift \ntowards native, and not just at the premium end of the market.\n\nBreeders beware\n\nFor now, the responsibility falls with the breeders of the likes of the Hereford and the Aberdeen Angus to make \nthem the best they can be.\n\nIt is vitally important that these breeds continue to improve on economically important traits such as growth and \nconformation.\n\nBut even more important is that these breeds do not stray away from and continue to improve on the traits they \nhave always been known for.\n\nCalving ease, easy-fleshing, eating quality and maternal traits cannot take a back seat to performance. Don\u2019t try \nand make these breeds something they aren\u2019t meant to be \u2013 continental.\n\nTo win an election, a political party must achieve two things. First, keeping their own voter base happy, and second, \nbecoming attractive to middle-ground voters who could vote either way.\n\nThis is the same for the customers of your breed, the long-term user of your breed being your voter base, and the \nfarmer considering it being the middle-ground voter.\n\nYes, growth rates should be improved, but not at the cost of calving ease. Yes, conformation should be improved, \nbut not at the cost of eating quality and fleshing ability.\n\n\n\nGenetic antagonisms make this difficult, but with the recording and reproductive technologies available to breeders, \nit's not impossible to appeal to all.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLiveweight lamb prices are edging lower as sales numbers head towards their autumnal peak.\n\nThe average price in Great Britain for an SQQ lamb, one weighing between 25.5 and 45.5kg, was 170p/kg \nyesterday, a fall of 8.7p/kg on the previous week.\n\nThis would put the value of a typical 40kg lamb at \u00a368, down around \u00a33.50 on week-earlier levels.\n\nSee also: Why on-farm ram auctions are growing in popularity\n\nMarket reports today indicate that prices have fallen further, with Kent-based Ashford Market seeing prices closer to \n165p/kg.\n\nLamb prices normally fall during September as sales numbers hit their peak and this year looks to be no exception, \nalthough throughputs are lower as more lambs than average died during the harsh spring weather.\n\nIndustry insiders report that around one million fewer lambs had been tagged by the end of July than the previous \nyear.\n\nA strengthening pound will also do the export trade no favours, with the pound worth 1.12 for the first time since \nmid-August, after dropping to 1.10 around the start of September.\n\nAt current prices that would mean each 40kg lamb would cost an importer more than 1 extra.\n\nLower domestic demand\n\nRebecca Oborne, AHDB red meat analyst, said the long-term decline in demand for lamb among UK shoppers also \nshowed no sign of abating.\n\nThere has been a 14% year-on-year decline in lamb sales in the 12 weeks ending on 12 August, the most recent \nset of statistics collected by market research firm Kantar.\n\nMs Oborne said the hot weather had driven more consumers towards more typical BBQ food, with the volume of \nbeefburgers sold up 15% and sausages rising 3%.\n\nThe problem had been exacerbated by an average lamb retail price rise of over 40p/kg, as retailers chose to put \nother meats on promotion.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA visa scheme that will allow 2,500 migrant farmworkers into the UK after Brexit falls short of requirements, say \nindustry leaders.\n\nThe two-year pilot scheme will allow non-EU migrant workers to work on UK farms for up to six months during peak \ntimes of the year before returing home.\n\nSee also: Visa scheme announced for migrant farm workers\n\nThe NFU has welcomed the announcement of the scheme, which follows a lengthy campaign and warnings that a \nshortage of workers is hampering food production.\n\nNFU president Minette Batterrs said: \u201cFarmers and growers have seen worker availability tighten significantly in \nrecent years, with the shortfall to July this year reaching 10%.\n\n\n\n\u201cGrowers will take great confidence in knowing that the government is listening during what have been extremely \ntesting and uncertain times for the sector.\u201d\n\nMore workers required\n\nBut other farming organisations said the scheme did not go far enough \u2013 with only 2,500 workers coming into the \nUK and some 80,000 workers required.\n\nCountry Land and Business Association president Tim Breitmeyer said he was pleased the government was finally \nshowing signs of taking action to ease the labour shortage.\n\nBut he warned: \u201cThis pilot must only be a starting point, and only scratches the surface.\n\n\u201cIt will allow for just 2,500 seasonal workers, while the number of seasonal and permanent migrant workers \ncurrently employed by rural businesses across the UK is far greater.\u201d\n\nBroader solution needed\n\nMr Breitmeyer said a much broader solution was needed to address concerns about availability of labour after \nBrexit across the rural economy.\n\nThis included seasonal farmworkers but also longer-term professionals and managers in agriculture and other rural \nsectors such as tourism, food processing and the veterinary profession.\n\nThe British Growers Association said the pilot scheme fell \u201cwell short of the numbers of labourers required\u201d to \nsustain the fresh produce industry in Britain.\n\nBritish Growers chief executive Jack Ward said the British fresh produce sector needed 75,000-80,000 seasonal \nworkers \u2013 a number expected to rise to 85,000-90,000 by 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has been made aware of this figure in our discussions,\u201d said Mr Ward.\n\nStep in right direction\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a step in the right direction, but the scale of the current shortfall in seasonal labour far \nexceeds the numbers involved in this latest scheme,\" he said.\n\nMr Ward said it was important that UK growers had access to seasonal labour 12 months of the year to cover the \nspread of crops grown in the UK.\n\n\u201cWithout access to an adequate supply of seasonal workers there is a danger we could be facing a real threat to \nthe UK\u2019s capacity to produce crops of fresh fruit and vegetables.

One is John Major, the man who pushed the \nMaastricht Treaty through parliament, laying the foundations for the euro and significantly expanded cooperation \nbetween European countries.\n\nSee also: No-deal Brexit risks flood of imported chicken\n\nThe other is Tony Blair, the man who led this country into a war based on alleged misinformation. They make an \ninteresting pair, neither keen on the outcome of a democratic referendum, to which all parties agreed to abide.\n\nThen we come to the EU itself. Rocked by the decision of our people to leave the EU, they seem bent on extracting \nevery last penny, every last concession. Clearly some have a desire to \u201cpunish\u201d the UK.\n\nFree-trade treaty\n\nThe EU has recently developed a free-trade treaty with Canada that doesn\u2019t involve Canada abiding by the core \nrules of the EU but has abolished 98% of all tariffs. Why can we not have a similar arrangement?\n\n\n\nLet us remember that the UK\u2019s trade is already growing with the outside world. Some 55% of our exports go to non-\nEU countries. The world of growth is not the EU, but the Americas, the Pacific Rim, Africa, India and China.\n\nI\u2019m forever told that \u201cno deal\u201d will be a disaster for our great farming industry. Why? Will the EU demand for \nsheepmeat fall to zero after we leave? No. But what may change is the EU charging a whacking great tariff on it.\n\nIf that is to be the case, then we need to be ready. We need to plan on transitional aid for our sheep sector and \nothers that are affected in this way. We also need to bolster our national marketing budget, give AHDB the means \nto go out into the world and sell those products that are displaced.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all one-way traffic. Will the Spanish salad growers not want to sell us their fresh salad crop, the French \ntheir cheeses, the Dutch their pork and bacon, and the Irish their beef, milk and horses? Of course, they will and, \neven in a no-deal scenario, they will not want to see us impose our own tariffs on them.\n\nCAP\n\nAs I went around the country during the referendum, I heard people talking about the need for freedom from the \nrigours of the CAP; the need to develop an agricultural policy more in tune with our way of working, our environment \nand our standards. Currently, we only produce 60% of our food, compared to 75% in the early 1980s. What an \nindictment of the CAP and what an opportunity for the industry.\n\nSince the referendum, I\u2019ve seen Defra and its ministers taking every opportunity to get the views of all stakeholders \nas to how we may develop the sector. Within the department, ideas are being worked up. In my own area of animal \nhealth and welfare, we want to see our industry become the world leader.\n\nThere is so much we can do, freed from the shackles of the EU \u2013 from finding a new TB test to providing help to \nimprove our productivity and competitiveness, and using R&D to improve our means of production.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not surprised at the apparent lack of progress in negotiating with the EU. It was ever thus. But at \nthe end of March next year, we are leaving the EU. I hope we part as friends and neighbours, co-operating in trade, \nsecurity and a myriad of other issues. I have no fear for the future of farming.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I like better than being part of an angry mob in a saloon.   \n\nSo it was that I set off to a local pub to listen to a combined Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and TB \nAdvisory Service (TBAS) presentation on \u201cBovine TB In Your Area\u201d (in this case, East Sussex).\n\nThe place was soon packed with farmers looking just as ornery as myself, hollerin\u2019 for a showdown. \n\nSee also: Stephen Carr is reassured by Dyson\u2019s farming losses\n\nFirst up was small town mayor (I mean, NFU regional director) William White, who knows how to stoke an angry \nmob to good effect when he gets the chance. He promised us a couple of quick presentations before we got into \nquestions and the politics of bTB.\n\nA murmur of anticipation rumbled round the room. I licked my lips. \n\nNext up was an understandably nervous looking representative from the APHA. Julio Diaz, a senior veterinary \ninspector, told us what we East Sussex cattle farmers already knew: bTB is still wreaking havoc among the county\u2019s \ndwindling number of beef and dairy herds. \n\nAt the end of his presentation there were angry questions about why annual testing had reduced East Sussex \ncowpokes to \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d. \n\n\n\nNo one, it was claimed by one member of the audience, wanted to buy our store cattle \u201ccompared with cattle \nfarmers from Kent\u201d (who only have to test their stock every four years and can sell them with no post-movement \ntesting requirement).\n\nYeah, someone wanted to know, how many bTB reactors had there been in Kent?  Mr Diaz thought maybe one last \nyear, but other than that \u201cnone at all for the previous four years\u201d. \n\nThe audience was having none of it. \u201cA vet told me about a farmer who bought cattle from Kent and four of them \nhad TB,\u201d said one farmer. Someone else wanted Kent cattle tested annually \u201clike us\u201d (I thought, \u201cwhy not every \nmonth?\u201d).\n\nI surveyed the audience looking for a smug face \u2013 a sure sign of a Kent farmer.\n\nWith the tension now at boiling point, next to take the stand was Sarah Tomlinson of TBAS.\n\nMs Tomlinson is famous in these parts for writing a provocative article in the September edition of the NFU\u2019s own \nBritish Farmer and Grower magazine in which she dares to suggest that bTB is not much different to Johne\u2019s or \nBVD \u2013 just another disease of cattle that farmers should screen for.\n\nAnd, hey guys, she told us, you should be grateful that, in the case of bTB, it\u2019s the government that pays most of \nthe cost of testing and compensation for animals you are told to cull.\n\nYou had to give her full marks for even turning up to face this crowd after writing that, but surely she wasn\u2019t going to \ndare repeat it to our faces?\n\nIt soon became apparent that not only was she going to do just that, she even offered us the services of TBAS to \ncome up with bespoke strategies for our individual farms to reduce the risks of bTB.  \n\nAs Mark Twain observed first-hand more than a century ago, it only takes one brave man to quieten a mob. And by \nthe time this brave woman had finished with us, we were meekly reduced to borrowing biros from one another to fill \nin our TBAS \u201cWe value your feedback\u201d forms.  \n\n\u201cWas the meeting useful?\u201d I ticked \u201cyup.\u201d \u201cDid you learn anything new?\u201d I ticked \u201cyup.\u201d Will you be visiting Kent in \nthe near future? I ticked \u201cHell, no.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers should be asked to maintain public footpaths on their land in exchange for government payments post \nBrexit, say ramblers.\n\nThe walking charity Ramblers, formerly known as the Ramblers\u2019 Association, says landowners should be rewarded \nfor adding new routes or improving existing paths on their land.\n\nThe charity is calling on the government to make access to the countryside and the path network a key part of its \n\u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d system under the new domestic agricultural policy post Brexit.\n\nSee also: Know the law when farming near footpaths\n\nAgriculture accounts for 71% of land use in the UK, including a large proportion of the nation\u2019s paths.\n\nLandowners have a legal duty to keep paths on their land clear. But a YouGov poll of 1,848 people found more than \ntwo-thirds (69%) had experienced problems with footpaths in the countryside, including overgrown paths and \nblocked gates.\n\nYouGov poll\n\n\n\nThe vast majority (85%) of adults surveyed in England and Wales said they believe that being able to experience \nthe countryside is important for children\u2019s understanding of the environment and food production. The results also \nshowed that more than eight out of 10 adults said visiting the countryside is good for their physical fitness (83%) \nand mental wellbeing (82%).\n\nBut almost two-thirds (65%) agreed that that farmers should receive less funding if they fail to maintain public \nfootpaths on their land.\n\nTompion Platt, Ramblers\u2019 director of advocacy and engagement, said: \u201cFarmers and other landowners should be \nexpected to meet their existing duties to keep paths on their land clear.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that countryside visitors can be a boon to rural communities. The path network helps \npeople learn more about the important work undertaken by farmers, benefits tourism and local businesses.\u201d\n\nBut CLA president Tim Breitmeyer said his organisation\u2019s Land Management Contract proposes ways farmers and \nlandowners could be rewarded post Brexit should they choose to help enhance existing public rights of way, \nincluding for visitors with limited mobility, and to provide new access on a voluntary basis.\n\n\u201cUsers of public rights of way also have an important role to play. This includes leaving gates as they are found, \nkeeping to paths, controlling dogs and respecting the countryside as a place of work as well as recreation.\u201d\n\nCountryside access 'a public good'\n\nA Defra spokeswoman said: \u201cLeaving the European Union gives us the opportunity to shape the future of our \nfarming industry and protect the countryside that we all enjoy.\n\n\u201cOur recent consultation specifically identified access to the countryside as something that could be recognised and \nrewarded as a public good. We have also been clear that farmers and land managers have a vital role to play in \neducating the public and building deeper links to the countryside. We will bring forward our plans for legislation \nshortly.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAn expert in agricultural economics has questioned whether Defra will achieve its goal of abolishing direct \npayments by 2027.\n\nPlans to phase out direct payments over seven years \u2013 ending in 2027 \u2013 are outlined in the government's \nAgriculture Bill, published on Wednesday (12 September).\n\nDirect payments \u2013 which account for more than half the income on many farms \u2013 will start to be simplified and then \nphased out after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nSee also: Analysis - How Michael Gove\u2019s Agriculture Bill will reshape UK farming\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove wants to replace the payments with a new system of pubic money for public goods, \nlargely requiring farmers to undertake environmental work on their land.\n\nBut Ian Bateman, director of the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute at Exeter University, \nquestioned whether the government would meet its target.\n\nProfessor Bateman said: \"The intention to end the public subsidy of massive farms just because they are big and \nirrespective of anything else has to be a good thing.\n\n\u201cReplacing this by a policy of \"public money for public goods\", principally environmental improvement, is also to be \nwelcomed.\n\nSpeed of change\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the speed of change is very slow, not being completed until 2028.\n\n\u201cA lot can happen in politics in a week, so a 10-year implementation period raises some concerns about what will \nactually be delivered.\u201d\n\nIan Ashbridge, farm business consultant at Bidwells, said the phased elimination of direct payments could not be \nguaranteed until the UK had agreed its departure from the EU.\n\nThe Agriculture Bill failed to articulate a comprehensive food and farming policy and left farmers and landowners no \nclearer about how they would be supported, he said.\n\nMr Ashbridge said: \u201cThe announcement is short on detail and will leave farmers unclear as to what is being asked \nof them in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Jeremy Moody, secretary of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers, said farmers should plan for Basic \nPayment Scheme (BPS) payments to be phased out.\n\nClear time frame\n\n\u201cWe have been given a clear time frame for the complete removal of BPS for English farmers. BPS is to be phased \nout from 2021 to 2027 and then it will be gone.\n\n\u201cThat gives a time window in which farmers and their advisers should review their businesses, consider how best to \nhandle the likely erosion of margins, and deliver the necessary changes.\u201d\n\nThe Agriculture Bill states that the agricultural transition period for phasing out direct payments in England is seven \nyears starting in 2021.\n\nThis means the final direct payment received by farmers would be in 2027, with no direct payments at all from 2028 \nonwards.\n\nHowever, the Bill also reserves the right for the government to extend the transition period should it deem that dong \nso is necessary.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers who are regularly falling short of Red Tractor standards will be faced with more frequent on-farm \ninspections from November as the organisation seeks to strengthen the integrity of the farm-assured brand.\n\nAnnouncing the new \u201crisk-based\u201d inspection regime at a briefing in London on Monday (10 September), Red Tractor \nAssurance chief executive Jim Moseley said the ultimate aim was that \u201cevery signed-up farmer should be complying \nwith every single standard, every day of the year\u201d.\n\nSee also: What\u2019s it like to be a Red Tractor assessor?\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of farmers in the UK, that regime already works,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously there are always \nopportunities for improvement.\n\n \u201cWe will increase the inspection frequency for those farmers who are failing to comply with all of the standards \nevery day, and many of those audits will become unannounced audits.\u201d\n\nThis would start in November 2018 and would give consumers greater confidence in the robustness of the scheme.\n\nCurrently about 60,000 farmers face an annual inspection, explained Mr Moseley. Given that data is routinely \ncollected by Red Tractor inspectors to measure the level of compliance, it is easy to spot those farmers who need \nmore scrutiny to up their performance.\n\n\n\nWhat is Red Tractor up to?\n\nRevised inspection regime to encourage greater compliance\n\nPlans for a \"complete assurance\" scheme, adding organic, environmental and animal welfare modules, with specific \nlogos\n\nNew \u00a31.5m TV, print and social media campaign \n\nStreamlined\n\nMr Moseley confirmed there was no plan to reduce the number of inspections for fully compliant farmers. \u201cAny \nconsumer would expect farmers and growers to get at least an annual inspection,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, there are plans to streamline the inspection regime, using technology to capture the information farmers \nrecord on a daily basis anyway, in order to determine compliance with Red Tractor standards.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with those excellent farmers to develop an online portal so we can collect the data, which will \nmake our inspections a lot shorter as we will not need to do the level of record-keeping that we currently do on \nfarm.\u201d\n\n\u2018Complete assurance\u2019\n\nAs well as beefing up the inspection regime, Red Tractor also announced plans to become the \u201cflagship of British \nfood and farming\u201d by including new \u201cmodules\u201d to stand alongside its basic \u201ccore\u201d standards.\n\nThese new modules could cover things like organic farming, environmental improvement or enriched animal \nwelfare.\n\nThe aim is to provide a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d so consumers does not become confused by the plethora of other \nassurance schemes that already exist to meet these specific interests.\n\n\u201cOur aim is that, ultimately, Red Tractor will be able to offer that broader choice,\u201d said Mr Moseley.\n\nIt will result in much clearer labelling for consumers, simpler auditing for farmers and reduced cost for processors \nand retailers.\n\nMr Moseley confirmed that Red Tractor had already been in discussion with Linking Environment and Farming \n(Leaf) Marque and the Soil Association to gauge interest in a collaborative approach, and had invited the RSPCA to \nopen discussions.\n\nThe aim is to launch a new set of modular standards by the end of 2019, once international benchmarking and \nfurther consumer research has been completed.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nEarly sales of Scotch Mules have seen lambs back \u00a33-\u00a34 a head and shearlings back by up to \u00a310-\u00a320 despite \nmany sale yards reporting much smaller throughputs. \n\nAugust and September shows of Scotch Mules have indicated the uncertainty of Brexit and the effect of challenging \nweather on sheep and buyers' budgets.\n\nHowever, a strengthening cull sheep market and much-improved late summer grass growth across many regions \nare bullish factors for trade going into the autumn, say auctioneers.\n\nMarkets have also noted that comparisons are being drawn with last year\u2019s very firm trade, with many 2017 sales \nup on the year.\n\n\n\nCastle Douglas\n\nEwe lamb and shearling numbers were back 14% at Castle Douglas, where Robin Anderson, managing director at \nWallets Marts, says a combination of factors have dropped averages.\n\nShearling numbers fell to 2,986 and the average dropped \u00a34.25 to \u00a3128. Lambs dropped \u00a37.92 to level at \u00a392.91 \nfor 7,266 sold.\n\nSee also: Cautious breeding sheep sales see some averages back\n\nHe told Farmers Weekly that Brexit, tighter fodder supplies, the increased costs incurred last winter and rising feed \nprices are combining to create \u201ca general lack of confidence\u201d.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what effect Brexit is going to have, but everyone you speak to seems to think the sheep sector \ncould suffer the worst,\u201d said Mr Anderson. \u201cLambs are bought for a five-year project, and Brexit is creating longer-\nterm uncertainty.\"\n\nHe said recent sale numbers had been affected by higher mortality during the difficult early spring period and many \nhoggs being culled when the lamb price skyrocketed in the new year.\n\n\u201cTop pens weren\u2019t back as far, but second and third pens were back more for our Mule lamb sale. Some buyers \nweren\u2019t forward this year,\u201d said Mr Anderson\n\nLast week\u2019s (3 September) Blackface ewe lamb sale saw the opposite trend, with trade \u00a38 higher and less money \navailable for the top pens, but more interest in the second and third pens. A total of 1,940 ewe lambs averaged \n\u00a387.76 compared with 2,726 making \u00a379.83 last year.\n\nCaledonian marts\n\nA 50% increase in shearling numbers led to a \u00a321 fall in averages at Stirling Caledonian marts, where 1,019 head \naveraged \u00a3114.50 on 31 August.\n\nIn the lamb ring, 2,850 lambs (-5.5%) fell by \u00a34.43 on the year to make \u00a390.75.\n\nAuction operations manager Alastair Logan said a lot of lambs were much smaller than last year, which hit lamb \naverages, while shearlings were affected by supply and demand, with buyers being able to \u201cpick and choose\u201d.\n\n\u201cHalf the gimmers [shearlings] were lacking in quality, but that\u2019s understandable because of the tough winter and \nlack of grass. Gimmers need grass, whereas lambs can thrive off their mothers.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSome vendors had nearly as many lambs, but other people were selling half the numbers \u2013 it was a \ntough winter.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritish sheep producers need to address their changing market and consider adopting a system that increases \noutput in order to survive the challenges of Brexit, according to an international consultant.\n\nBob Abband, who has 25 years\u2019 experience working with flocks in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Iran, \nbelieves that the UK needs to move away from the more extensive, low-input, low-cost sheep system and chase \noutput.\n\n\u201cI think the structure of the market in the UK, like everywhere else, is changing,\u201d he told delegates at the National \nSheep Association South Sheep event on Saturday 8 September.\n\n\u201cI believe sheep farming is a business and should be profitable through high output. People are running after jobs \nwith high pay. I haven\u2019t seen anyone chase prosperity by going on a hunger strike.\u201d\n\n\n\nSee also: How breeding for prolificacy can increase profit per ewe\n\n(function(d,s,id){var \njs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(d.getElementById(id))return;js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src='https://e\nmbed.playbuzz.com/sdk.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}(document,'script','playbuzz-sdk'));\n\n \n\nDefining output as the number of lambs born, reared and sold, he said that intensive lambing systems could \nincrease output. He also said using more prolific ewes, changing the time of breeding and being strict on \nreplacements could help.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t compromise production to keep ewes and lambs a long time. The production of a ewe is only about four \nyears,\u201d said Mr Abband.\n\nThe three system changes he proposed were:\n\n1. Synchronising\n\nBy synchronising in September/October, producers can get a shorter lambing period and uniform growth of lambs \nthat can be sold at the same time.\n\nMr Abband said farmers should aim for a two-to-three week tupping period and two-to-three week lambing period.\n\nThe extra costs incurred would amount to \u00a34-5 a ewe, but these costs can be offset by the advantages, Mr Abband \nsaid.\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nNormal breeding and lambing time to use spring grass\n\nBetter weather conditions for outdoor lambing\n\nShort tupping and lambing\n\nBetter lamb survival due to better control at lambing\n\nUniform growth of lambs\n\nBlock lamb sale \u2013 good sum of cash into the account\n\nThe cost of synchrony\n\nExtra seasonal labour\n\nIntense lambing requires better hygiene control due to faster bacterial build-up\n\n2. Advancing lambing to December by synchronisation\n\nBy moving lambing to December, producers can target the peak price period for sale. December lambing, for farms \nthat can support indoor lambing, is the quickest way to improve their income, Mr Abband reckoned.\n\n\u201cBetween April to early June, you can fetch the highest prices,\u201d he advised.\n\nAdvantages\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nHigher value of sale, selling in April-May market\n\nUniform crop of lambs\n\nIntensive tupping and lambing, higher lamb survival due to better supervision, more free time for doing other things\n\nBetter control of nutritional management for ewe and lambs\n\nIndoor lambing facility required\n\nExtra seasonal labour if required\n\nExtra feed supplement needed for ewes and lambs\n\nMore rams needed to cope with shorter tupping time \u2013 if synchronising, you need one ram for five to 10 ewes. \nUsing AI or batch synchrony can reduce number of rams needed\n\nIntense lambing requires better hygiene control due to bacteria build-up\n\n3. Lambing three times in two years\n\nWorking on a system of lambing every eight months can maximise the production of the ewe and increase gross \nmargin by about 40%, Mr Abband said.\n\nBased on a gestation period of five months, lactation for two months and one-month break, ewes can produce three \nlamb crops in two years. \n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nMaximise the use of the ewe\u2019s productive life by producing nine to 10 lambs v six lambs if you are achieving \nlambing of 150%.

We spoke to four experts to explain what renting out \nstorage entails.\n\nSelf-storage facts\n\nA large and growing market with a turnover of more than \u00a3540m a year\n\nThe Self-Storage Association estimates that there are more than 1,430 sites across the UK\n\nMore than 300 sites offer mainly container storage\n\nAverage occupancy rate in 2017 was 75.8%, slightly higher than in the previous year\n\nIncome averaged \u00a322.68/sq ft in 2017\n\nLondon net rental rates are double those of the East Midlands or the North\n\nMore than 70% of self-storage users live within 20 minutes of their unit\n\nIs planning permission needed?\n\nAs for any change of use from agriculture, planning will be an issue. Traffic and access are likely to be the main \nconsiderations.\n\nThe planning process should take about eight weeks from submission of the application.\n\nSmall-scale operations (up to 500m\u00b2) may be carried out under permitted development rights, although these cover \nonly the change of use and no building works.\n\nPermission for containers in yards is harder to get and in the green belt almost impossible. Such ventures would not \nbe subject to any permitted development.\n\nBrian Barrow, managing director of consultancy Acorus\n\nSee also: More diversification advice\n\nTax\n\nThe tax implications of changing the use of buildings can be significant and long-term.\n\nDifferent elements of expenditure attract different rates of relief \u2013 get a detailed quote and invoices so that relief can \nbe properly allocated.\n\nThe first \u00a3200,000 of expenditure on plant and machinery and integral features attracts tax relief at 100% a year for \neach business. Containers could qualify as plant and machinery but take advice on this.\n\nAfter this, an 18% writing down allowance can be claimed for plant and 8% for integral features.\n\nVAT must be charged on the storage or rental fees.\n\nA change of use can affect the inheritance tax (IHT) position. Non-agricultural use means the assets may not qualify \nfor agricultural property relief (100% relief) from IHT, but might attract business property relief, also at up to 100%.\n\nSuch ventures are often run as part of the main farming business, but it is important to cost them separately.\n\nConsider whether a separate business structure should be used, for example a separate company, sole trader or \npartnership.\n\n\n\nThe impact on any potential capital gains tax liability and reliefs should also be considered.\n\nMark Chatterton, director of accountant Duncan & Toplis\n\nLegal risks and obligations\n\nIn some cases gas safety certification and regular electrical and health and safety checks will be needed.\n\nEven if the storage building doesn\u2019t have any, asbestos in a building nearby could be an issue for users of the \nstorage facility. Check for the presence and state of any asbestos to see if action needs to be taken.\n\nIf the storage building has been used as security for borrowing, the lender\u2019s consent to the venture will be needed.\n\nIf the farm is subject to clawback (sale conditions which arrange for a proportion of the uplift in value caused by a \nnon-agricultural use, or grant of planning permission for that use, being passed back to a previous owner) this may \nbe triggered by the change of use.\n\nTenant farmers thinking of self-storage will almost certainly need the consent of their landlord, usually through a \nlicence to sublet.\n\nIf the lease is a sub-lease, the landlord may ask for a share of the storage income.\n\nSuch a lease/sublease should ensure the correct procedure is followed to \u201ccontract out\u201d of the Landlord and Tenant \nAct 1954, otherwise they may unwittingly grant the occupier of the unit the right to renew the tenancy at the end of \nthe agreed term, making it much more difficult to get rid of them. \n\nDiversification income can jeopardise tenancy succession on a traditional tenancy. This is a complex area and \nneeds expert advice at the outset.\n\nCheck whether the farm tenancy contains any restrictive covenants \u2013 for example, it is not unusual to see \n\u201cagricultural and equestrian use\u201d only conditions and this may preclude diversification, at least without consent.\n\nIf works are needed to convert a tenanted building, a licence for those works may be needed and the landlord may \nrequire reinstatement at the end of the tenancy.\n\nSian Edmunds, partner in law firm Burges Salmon\n\nInsurance considerations\n\nAny farmer diversifying must inform their insurer of the new venture and review cover.\n\nFarm policies cover only for the business of farming, so any non-agricultural venture can leave a business very \nexposed.\n\nFor a self-storage business, public liability cover needs to be reviewed because of the risk posed by the new activity \nand the increased traffic and pedestrian movement it will bring. Trips, slips and falls are common claim areas.\n\nCover levels in this area should take account of changes in the Ogden rate (a recent review of the sums awarded \nfor injury) and increases in potential compensation payments for serious injuries.\n\nFarm policies often have standard \u00a310m limits each for public and product liability, but some insurers are advising \nthese are doubled following the recent review.\n\nIt should be a condition of the storage agreement that customers are responsible for insuring their own stored \nproperty.\n\nCharles Foster, chief executive, insurance broker Lycetts\n\n\n\nTips for offering storage\n\nResearch your market carefully\n\nVisit the competition \u2013 what do they offer, what do they charge?\n\nKnow your local population \u2013 what will people want/expect?\n\nMake customers feel comfortable and confident about the place, don\u2019t hurry them\n\nUnderstand that people needing storage are often at a difficult point in their lives, stressed by a house move, \npossibly downsizing, grieving or going through some other family trauma, such as divorce\n\nThe ideal site is fairly close to a large population centre, has good road frontage, good access and, ideally, can be \nseen from the road\n\nDon\u2019t take your eye off the ball, keep standards up, the business will not run itself\n\nA good tight contract is essential, it must not be over-complicated but should include a customer declaration that \nthey are not bringing anything illegal or dangerous onto the site\n\nHave a secure payment method and try to avoid cash\n\nCase study\n\nMartin Bazeley started his self-storage business in 2003 on the farm he rents from the Southwick Estate near \nFareham in Hampshire.\n\nThis is his second major diversification, alongside a successful brewery business, Suthwyk Ales, also run from \nOffwell Farm.\n\nFarm facts\n\n350ha tenanted farm\n\nMainly combinable crops\n\n230-cow dairy herd\n\nDiversified into container self-storage storage and ales brewed using the farm\u2019s own malting barley and hops\n\nStorage capacity 14,000 sq ft in 140 units, all indoors, all ground level\n\nUnit sizes from 40 sq ft to 320sq ft, all containers, some subdivided to make smaller stores\n\nDevelopment of the storage business followed the merger of the farm\u2019s two dairy herds, which left under-utilised \nbuildings. As machinery grew in size, more 1960s and 1970s buildings became less suitable for their original use.\n\nUnlike many container-based storage sites, all of the Barn Store units are indoors, in squeaky clean and well-lit \nbuildings in which the farm\u2019s landlord has invested to convert and upgrade them.\n\nThe business takes about \u00a3140,000 a year in storage rental fees and is profitable, with a percentage of the rental \nincome going to the landlord.\n\nThe storage buildings have been taken out of the farm tenancy, leading to a slight drop in the farm rent.\n\nMr Bazeley was clear from the start that he wanted this to be a top-end venture, which looked after and understood \nits customers, who can access stores at any time using a personal electronic fob.\n\n\n\nCleanliness and security are high priority, including alarms and constant CCTV monitoring.\n\nAs a result, prices are at the higher end of the range with a 40sq ft space costing \u00a390 a month and the 160 sq ft \nunits \u00a3290 a month.\n\nThis is more than double the rate of many outside units but still well below the purpose-built self-storage units seen \non industrial estates.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re close to a big population centre (Portsmouth), relatively little of our trade comes from the city. \nPeople will drive a considerable distance for the right storage.\n\n\u201cThe business is a good fit with farming, as long as you don\u2019t mind the public and can be flexible,\u201d says Mr Bazeley.\n\n\u201cAfter office hours the business telephone numbers are diverted to our private numbers.\u201d\n\nThe storage and farm businesses are one, sharing a VAT number, but are costed separately.  Payment is by direct \ndebit and, unlike some storage sites, charges are clearly shown on the website.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of starting the storage business was that it was a leap into the unknown in terms of \ncustomer service and marketing, says Mr Bazeley.\n\n\u201cYou need to own what you are offering and understand your customer. The first time someone comes to look at \nthe storage, you might need to spend 20 to 30 minutes showing them around and talking with them so that they feel \ncomfortable, that\u2019s all part of it.\u201d\n\nThe success of his own Barn Store business has prompted Mr Bazeley to diversify in a very unusual way, \nfranchising the Barn Store model to 12 other farms as far north as Staffordshire, west to Herefordshire, south-west \nto Somerset and eastwards to Kent. More new stores are to open soon.\n\nThe brand relies on the same high level of service and storage at all locations, where the owners also all live on \nsite.\n\nMr Bazeley\u2019s sister Jane works full-time for the storage business, while his daughters Emma and Naomi work part-\ntime for Barn Store and Suthwyk Ales. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTractor sales eased off over the harvest period, ending a run of four months of double-digit growth compared with \n2017 sales levels.\n\nTractor registration figures published by the Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA), the trade body representing \ntractor and machinery manufacturers, show sales of new tractors larger than 50hp in August were nearly 2% lower \nthan the previous year at 862 units.\n\nHowever, total sales during the first eight months of 2018 remain 7.7% ahead of last year\u2019s levels at 8,738 units.\n\nSee also: Fourth month of double-digit growth in tractor sales\n\nAEA agricultural economist Stephen Howarth said new tractor registrations had taken \u201ca breather\u201d during August.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether this is a short-term blip or represents the start of a reversal of fortunes, after the \nrobust growth seen in the first seven months of the year.\u201d\n\nMr Howarth said the pressures of this summer\u2019s drought conditions may have been a contributory factor in sales \nfalling back.\n\n\n\nAlthough many of the tractors registered in August would have been ordered during May -  before the full impact of \nthe hot and dry conditions had been felt - crops were starting to show signs of drought stress at that point.\n\n\u201cOr it may just be a case that we\u2019ve had three or four very strong months and the purchasing for this year has \nhappened.\n\n\u201cAugust is also a busy month for farmers and hence a relatively low month [for sales] anyway.\n\n\u201cThere is no particular sign that for other types of farm machinery there has been a slow down during August,\u201d he \nadded.\n\nThe biggest month for tractor purchases this year was March, when dealers sold 1,650 machines.\n\nBut the month with the strongest growth in sales was July, when farmers and contractors bought 1,347 units, \ncompared with 1,091 in July 2017 and 942 in July 2016.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritish growers will be allowed to recruit non-EU migrant workers for temporary jobs on UK farms after Brexit under \na pilot scheme announced by the government.\n\nThe two-year pilot allowing 2,500 migrant workers to come to the UK for up to six months was announced by Defra \nand the Home Office on Thursday (6 September).\n\nSee also: 10-point plan for attracting the best farm workers\n\nThe government said the scheme would alleviate seasonal labour shortages during peak production periods for \nfruit and vegetable farmers.\n\nThe NFU \u2013 which has long warned of labour shortages \u2013 said there was \u201cwork to be done now to examine the \ndetail\u201d and develop the scheme.\n\nSoft fruit production in the UK has grown by 130% in the past 20 years.\n\nTechnology\n\nTo ensure this growth continues, the government said farmers must also look at ways technology can reduce \ndemands for physical labour.\n\nThe pilot scheme would support farmers in the short term during peak production periods because automated \nharvesting solutions were not universally available.\n\nThe time-limited pilot would also explore how to keep British horticulture competitive, as almost all other OECD \ncountries sourced seasonal workers to pick fruit and vegetables.\n\nHome secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cBritish farmers are vital to the UK\u2019s economy \u2013 and the government will look to \nsupport them in any way we can.\n\n\u201cThis pilot will ensure farmers have access to the seasonal labour they need to remain productive and profitable \nduring busy times of the year.\"\n\n'Sustainable immigration'\n\n\u201cI am committed to having an immigration system that reduces migration to sustainable levels, supports all industry \nand ensures we welcome those who benefit Britain.\u201d\n\nThe scheme will be run by two operators \u2013 to be announced in due course \u2013 that will oversee the placement of the \nworkers.\n\n\n\nThey will ensure suitable workers are selected for the pilot, reach their place of employment, and leave the UK at \nthe end of their visa.\n\nReturn rates will be monitored throughout the duration of the scheme, with provisions to close the route if the \ngovernment deems that it presents a threat to immigration control.\n\nTo be eligible for the scheme, migrant workers must be aged at least 18 years on the date of application and be \nfrom outside the European Union.\n\nThe pilot will commence in the spring of 2019, run until the end of December 2020 and will be monitored closely by \nthe Home Office and Defra.\n\nPowerful arguments\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove said: \u201cWe have listened to the powerful arguments from farmers about the need for \nseasonal labour to keep the horticulture industry productive and profitable.\n\n\u201cFrom lettuce in East Anglia to strawberries in Scotland, we want to make sure farmers can continue to grow, sell \nand export more great British food.\"\n\nMr Gove said the government would review the pilot scheme\u2019s results as it looked at how best to support the \nlonger-term needs of industry outside the EU.\n\nScheme operators will be licensed by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority to ensure migrant workers are \nprotected against modern slavery and other labour abuses.\n\nIt will ensure all workers are placed with farms that adhere to all relevant legislation, including paying the national \nminimum wage.\n\nFarmers will also be vetted to ensure living and working conditions are of a suitable quality.\n\n'Step in right direction'\n\nNFU president Minette Batters described the new pilot scheme as \u201ca big step in the right direction\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have been telling government all along that we have strong evidence about the need for such a scheme, and it \nseems our lobbying has paid off,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Batters described the 2,500 places that will be offered in the pilot scheme as \u201cmeaningful\u201d.\n\n\u201cHad it just been a few hundred, or had the scheme been regionalised, we would have been disappointed,\u201d she \nsaid. \u201cBut this pilot is going to be broad and accessible. We appreciate the leadership Defra secretary Michael Gove \nand home secretary Sajid Javid have shown on this.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNorthern arable farmers have lost a key customer for feed wheat after Vivergo Fuels announced it was ceasing \nproduction of bioethanol for good at the end of the month.\n\nThe move comes just four months since the 11-year-old plant reopened after a prolonged winter closure on the \nback of weak ethanol prices and a lack of direction on government energy policy.\n\nUK producers grow around 15m tonnes of wheat on average and Hull-based Vivergo purchased 1.1m tonnes a \nyear from 900 farms across east and north Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.\n\nSee also: Hull bioethanol plant reopens after four-month shutdown\n\n\n\nThe high domestic and international price of wheat will have been a further blow to the company, with global \ndroughts and weak sterling meaning little prospect of the company importing cheaper grain from overseas.\n\nThe plant's shutdown will also mean a reduced supply of valuable dried distillers grains and other co-products for \nthe livestock sector.\n\nNearby rival bioethanol company Ensus has the capacity to switch to alternative feed sources but Vivergo does not.\n\nMark Chesworth, managing director, Vivergo Fuels, commented:\n\n\u201cI am extremely disappointed at having to announce the proposed cessation of production as of 30 September 2018 \nat the Vivergo Fuels plant.\n\nWe have created a highly skilled and world-class business that had the opportunity to be part of a British \nsustainable biofuels industry. But sadly, the government\u2019s lack of pace over the past decade to introduce E10 has \nfurther undermined our ability to operate.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Welsh government has taken an unprecedented step by writing to every farmer in Wales to defend its post-\nBrexit payment reforms.\n\nIt comes after a summer campaign by the Farmers\u2019 Union of Wales (FUW) urging its members to reject the \nproposals and demand the retention of the Basic Payments Scheme (BPS).\n\nSee also: Welsh farmers face end to direct payments by 2025\n\nThe union suggests that ending BPS risks \u201cfinancial hardships and the loss of farms and rural businesses\u201d.\n\nBut in direct reaction, Wales\u2019 rural affairs secretary, Lesley Griffiths, has written an open letter to farmers setting out \nwhy she believes maintaining the status quo after the UK leaves the European Union would not work for Wales.\n\nFarmers will today (Friday, 7 September) also receive a factsheet in which the government seeks to explode what it \nlabels as \u201cmyths\u201d being perpetuated about its reform proposals.\n\nIt is thought to be the first time the government has intervened part-way through any consultation.\n\nA two tier-system\n\nThe government believes the industry in Wales needs to respond to the challenge posed by Brexit by improving \nproductivity, reducing costs and diversifying.\n\nIts current consultation, set out in its Brexit and Our Land document, proposes a two-tier system:\n\nAn Economic Resilience Scheme, with grants to improve farm efficiencies\n\nA Public Goods Scheme, rewarding initiatives that improve water quality, reduce flood risk and improve habitat\n\nMisleading\n\nMs Griffiths described the FUW campaign as \u201cmisleading\u201d and argued that keeping the current system would leave \nWelsh farmers worse off.\n\nBrexit means that the government must do things differently, the minister insisted, and that included abolishing \ndirect subsidies from 2025, while focusing more on efficiency improvements.\n\nBut the FUW has reacted angrily to the letter and the accusations that is has been misleading farmers.\n\n\n\n\u201cI find it utterly bizarre that the government is singling out a single organisation because we are saying something \nthat it does not agree with during the course of an open consultation,\u201d said FUW policy director Nick Fenwick.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit like Donald Trump screaming \u2018fake news\u2019 whenever anybody says something he disagrees with. This \namounts to an appalling interference during a consultation process.\u201d\n\nNew policy\n\nThe FUW campaign maintains it is foolish to move forward with a new policy until there is greater clarity on what the \neconomic landscape will look like post Brexit and until there has been a detailed assessment.\n\nIt is also demanding a retention of direct payments, at least in the medium term, to enable Welsh farmers to \ncompete with their counterparts in the EU, who will continue receiving such support from Brussels.\n\nBut according to Ms Griffiths \u201cthere is no debate on whether we should support farmers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to protect the funding. But we need to provide support in a different way to keep farmers on the \nland,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBusiness as usual\u201d was not an option, she added. \u201cWe need farmers to engage properly with us to help make this \nwork, so the recent misleading FUW campaign is not helpful.\u201d\n\nThe FUW said it was writing to Ms Griffiths to demand greater clarity on exactly where she felt it was being \nmisleading.\n\nWelsh government\u2019s Brexit reform \u201cmyth busters\u201d\n\nMyth: There will be an uneven playing field with our nearest competitors.\n\nFact: Maintaining the Basic Payment Scheme does not help us compete because it does nothing to improve farm \nperformance. There is nothing in the system to reward farmers for performance or outcomes. Payments are devoid \nof incentives.\n\nMyth: Farmers cannot make a living from public goods.\n\nFact: The Public Goods Scheme will go beyond \u201cincome foregone and costs incurred\u201d and pay a meaningful income \nstream. For some, public goods payments will form a large proportion of future income. Every farm has public \ngoods potential.\n\nMyth: The Public Goods Scheme will not pay for public goods that already exist on farms.\n\nFact: We will pay for the ongoing management of existing public goods \u2013 for example, we will pay for the active \nmanagement of an existing native woodland or habitat.\n\nMyth: The Welsh government wants farmers to produce public goods, not food.\n\nFact: We need to increase farming productivity \u2013 in other words, increase the margin a farmer makes per unit of \nproduction. Investment, not income support, is the only way we can deliver a significant increase in productivity.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarming to improve soil health, maximise production from grass and be self-sufficient is the aim of dairy farmer \nRichard Park of Low Sizergh Farm in Kendal, Cumbria.\n\nHis ambition is to manage the farm holistically, which incorporates financial planning, ecological monitoring and a \nregenerative grazing system into a decision-making framework.\n\n\n\nAlthough he is only at the start of his journey, small changes to the farming system are already reaping some \nbenefits.\n\nSee also: How mob grazing can be used to improve soil health\n\nFarm facts\n\n160 cross-bred cows plus followers (Holstein, Friesian, Scandinavian Red and Montbeliarde\n\n150 sheep\n\nSecond year of organic conversion\n\nAutumn block calving on a 12-week block\n\nNational Trust tenant farmers\n\n121ha split into one third cow grazing, one third silage ground and one third youngstock/sheep grazing\n\nCurrently yielding 6,500-7,000 litres on 1.5t concentrates due to forage shortage over winter\n\nSlurry spread with trailing shoe\n\nFarm shop sells eggs from 600 free-range hens\n\nWhat is holistic planned grazing?\n\nMr Park first heard about holistic management when he attended a course run by 3LM on the subject.\n\nIt is an idea that was developed by Zimbabwe environmentalist Allan Savory in the 1960s after studying the reasons \nfor desertification in Africa.\n\nHe concluded if animals were managed in a way that simulated the natural behaviour of herds and wildlife, then \nhabitats, water management and the condition of the land improved.\n\nThe concept is now practised globally. Holistic planned grazing considers the time that a plant is exposed to a \ngrazing animal so that the recovery of the plant is planned.\n\nThe planned moves are usually shorter and faster during the fast plant growth period and slower during the slow \ngrowth and non-growing seasons. This is because the timing of the moves is driven by plant recovery. \n\nIt also ensures manure is spread more evenly and organic matter is incorporated into the soil by the trampling of \nlonger grasses into the ground.\n\nThe longer grass also aids ground cover and, with it having an extensive root mat, the water infiltrates better, \nreduces flooding, doesn\u2019t burn up as quick in drought conditions, and helps restore depleted aquifers.\n\nIt is different from mob and rotational grazing because it gives grass a longer recovery period. Mr Park says mob \nand rotation grazing systems don\u2019t take into account the time needed for certain species of grass to fully \nregenerate, wildlife habitats and the water, mineral and energy cycles.\n\nWhy holistic planned grazing?\n\nMr Park felt holistic management suited his system as he has crossbred cows, is in organic conversion (converted \nby 2019) and has a limited land area as a National Trust tenant. He has also been rotational grazing for eight years, \nso a paddock system was already in place.\n\nHis ultimate aim is to position the farm in a place that is as removed from external influences as possible.\n\n\n\nMr Park says: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change going on with Brexit and milk prices so I assessed the business and looked \nat our strengths. I decided to focus on producing as much as we can off the land we\u2019ve got, but in a way that \nimproved the health of the soils.\n\n\"One of the criticisms of organic farming is that it\u2019s not productive enough, but my aim is to be as productive as a \nconventional system, if not better,\u201d he says.\n\nPutting a holistic plan together\n\nAfter attending the course, the first thing Mr Park had to do was assess the land. During this he looked at \necosystem processes, such as the amount of decaying matter; percentage of bare soil; capping \u2013 whereby bare soil \nhas been sealed by water; different species of grass; insect life; mineral flow and energy flow \u2013 for example, the \namount of canopy/leaf area.\n\nAlthough Mr Park felt he had a lot of technical experience, when he assessed the land he was surprised by some of \nthe things he found.\n\n\u201cI was totally unaware of why ponding of water occurred in the middle of some established grassland, for example,\u201d \nhe says.\u201cBy assessing the land, I found out this was happening because of soil erosion. The fine soil was running \ndown and sealing the soil surface, resulting in pools of water.\u201d\n\nMr Park also discovered why docks were a problem in some areas.\n\n\u201cThe thing with holistic management is that with every decision you make you always have to ask whether your \ndecision is addressing the root cause of the problem.\n\nBefore organic conversion we would just spray the docks; however, this wasn\u2019t addressing the root cause. When \nwe assessed where the docks were we found evidence of compaction and also bare soil.\n\n\u201cDocks are nature\u2019s way of trying to cover up bare soil. So, if we manage bare soils and compaction and increase \nthe diversity of the plants we grow, then we are less likely to get domination by docks,\u201d he explains.\n\nChanges and benefits\n\nAlthough much of what the Park family hope to do is based on theory, they are already seeing some benefits from \nthe changes they\u2019ve made on the farm.\n\n \n\nPlanned holistic management changes at Low Sizergh Farm\n\nAim\n\nPosition before change\n\nWhat is the change?\n\nReason for change\n\nCurrent position/benefit post-change  \n\nAdd more diversity to the silage and grazing ground\n\nMostly monocultures of ryegrass with some clover\n\nDirect drill extra grass species such as Timothy and Fescues, more red and white clover, chicory and plantain as \nwell as other herbs\n\n\n\nNature needs diversity. Different species will offer better ground cover and aid community dynamics such as insect \nlife. Different leaf surface areas will also help harvest energy from the sun.\n\nPlants with long tap roots will also help reduce compaction and survive better in dryer conditions.\n\nDue to the weather, they haven\u2019t direct drilled yet. The hope is to complete it this year.\n\nIncrease the grazing height at which stock enter\n\nMost land was grazed at heights of 2,800kg/dm/ha down to 1,800kg/dm/ha\n\nCows entering grazing at 4,500-5,000kg/dm/ha and allowing roughly 30% of the grass to be trampled back into the \nground (depending on individual paddock and the age of stock). Fence to be moved twice a day.\n\nGoing in at higher grass lengths allows the different species of grass to fully recover. Trampled grass provides \ncoverage and reduces bare soil. Also, the grass is broken down and provides nutrients for the soil.\n\nHave tried it this year with the youngstock grazing and found youngstock still achieving target growth rates of 0.8kg \na day. In the hot summer, this land hasn\u2019t burnt up to the extent other fields have.\n\nTo produce rich fungal soils\n\nThe ryegrass dominated swards are bacteria microbe dominant\n\nTo support more diversity more fungi will be added to kickstart their growth. The fungi will be added through a \nsprayer.\n\nIn order to increase diversity, you need a balance of bacteria and fungi microbes\n\nNot completed yet\n\nIntroduce larger rotations\n\nTypically, a 21-day rotation \u2013 39ha grazing platform with 160 cows\n\nIncrease up to 60-day rotation in the growing season\n\nTo allow grass to recover fully\n\nHave already introduced to youngstock grazing area \n\nIntroduced hens into the grazing rotation\n\nTheir 600 free-range hens were housed on a dedicated range area\n\nMr Park has constructed a mobile cabin, which allows the hens to follow the cows after grazing. Hens are shut into \nthe cabin at night and then released the following day when they are moved into the next paddock.\n\nHens are adding nutrients into the soil. They also scratch the ground and help break up the cowpats and spread \nthem. Also adds variety into chicken diet as they pick larvae out from the cow dung, for example.\n\nCurrently ongoing. Eggs appear to have a better taste as the hens' diet is more varied.\n\nMr Park says since entering organic conversion he has seen grass yields decrease as a result of not using bagged \nfertiliser. But he hopes this holistic approach to grazing will help combat this.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d normally be averaging 10-11t/dm/ha, but last year this dropped to 8t/dm/ha/year,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn four to five years\u2019 time when we have implemented the holistic plan, we\u2019d hope to be back up at 10-11t.\n\n\n\n\u201cEventually, we would also like to be a 100% forage-fed herd.\u201d\n\nKey principles of holistic planned grazing\n\nRun as few herds as possible. One herd provides the best graze-to-plant recovery ratio (shorter grazing periods \nand longer recovery periods).\n\nAnimals that remain bunched in a single herd are more effective at chipping the soil surface with their hooves and \ntrampling down plant material to cover the soil so that air and water enter and new plants can grow.\n\nScattered animals have less impact on the soil surface with their hooves and will create less litter to cover the soil \nsurface. If animals \u2013 bunched or scattered \u2013 are left in any one place too long, or if returned to it too soon, they will \novergraze plants and compact and pulverize soils.\n\nPlan plant recovery times before you plan grazing times\n\nOvergrazing is linked to the time animals are present, rather than how many animals there are\n\nBase stocking rates on the volume of forage available and how long it must last. Align it with carrying capacity \u2013 the \nnumber of animals the land can carry based on the forage available over the non-growing season plus a month or \nmore of drought reserve.\n\nPlan on a grazing chart. This provides a clear picture of where livestock needs to be and when, and determines \nhow managers plan their moves backwards or forwards.\n\nCreate one plan for the growing season before main growth starts. The aim of this plan is to grow the maximum \namount of forage possible during the growing season so that animals have enough to eat throughout the year and \nplants are not overgrazed.\n\nCreate one plan for the non-growing season once grasses stop growing. The aim of this plan is to prepare the soil \nand plants for the coming growing season and to ration out the remaining forage over the months.\n\nMonitor the plan\n\nSource: Savory\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers in England can now sign up to the Woodland Grant Creation Scheme (WGCS) all-year round.\n\nThe move is designed to attract more applications and ties in with the government\u2019s plans to increase the amount of \nwoodland cover.\n\nIts goals include planting 11m trees by 2020 and having 12% woodland cover by 2060.\n\nSee also: NSA and Woodland Trust unite to give tree planting advice to farmers\n\nThe WGCS is a capital grant scheme that falls under the umbrella of Countryside Stewardship and provides \npayments of up to \u00a36,800/ha to establish new woodland.\n\nThe government hopes that removing the old time-limited application window will encourage more projects to come \nforward, as applicants will be able to prepare them at their own convenience.\n\nUnder the scheme, applicants can apply for one-off payments to fund trees, associated protection items, including \nfencing and spiral guards, and support towards any infrastructure needed to help the establishment of new \nwoodland.\n\nMaintenance money\n\n\n\nOnce the woodland has been planted, farmers can apply for a separate multi-year grant worth \u00a3200/ha for a 10-\nyear period to maintain it.\n\nThis support is called the Woodland Creation Maintenance Grant and is part of the Countryside Stewardship Higher \nTier scheme.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nThe minimum project size is generally 3ha, with a minimum individual block size of 0.5ha.\n\nHowever, smaller projects will be considered if the planting is designed to improve water quality and help with flood \nprevention.\n\nThe scheme is competitive so all applications will be scored to decide whether it should get the go-ahead.\n\nThe highest scores will be given to applications that cover a large geographical area or those that have the greatest \npositive impact on biodiversity, water quality, flood prevention and climate change.\n\nThe majority of any new woodland planted needs to be native species.\n\n\u2018Generous support\u2019\n\nRichard Greenhous, Forestry Commission director of forest services, said: \u201cBy making it easier to apply for \ngenerous grant support we are ensuring that we deliver on the government\u2019s and the forestry sector\u2019s ambitions to \nplant millions more trees across the country.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to hearing from applicants who want to reap the economic, environmental and social benefits of \nsustainable woodland creation.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nRed Tractor is launching its first ever TV advert this week \u2013

\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA student bursary worth \u00a327,000 is on offer to help bring fresh talent from outside the industry into the agricultural \nsector.\n\nThe John Innes Foundation (JIF) offers a bursary to one undergraduate each year and is aimed at candidates who \nare not from a farming background and also from families that are financially disadvantaged.\n\nThe idea is to attract new entrants into the sector who are looking for a career in primary crop production or farm \nmanagement, but who need help and support to enable them to do so.\n\nSee also: Nine ways to fund agricultural career development\n\nIn addition to having their fees paid, successful candidates are mentored periodically throughout their degree by \nVelcourt\u2019s technical director, Keith Norman, a past winner of Farmers Weekly\u2019s Farm Adviser of the Year award.\n\nThey are also offered the opportunity to gain valuable work experience by working for Velcourt during summer \nholidays and may be considered for the Velcourt management training scheme following graduation.\n\nScheme details\n\nThe John Innes Foundation farming bursary is available to candidates who meet the eligibility criteria who are \nenrolled on a full-time, three year BSc (Hons) degree course in agriculture or crop production.\n\nThe student must be from a non-farming background and intend work in primary crop production in the UK, as \nopposed to an academic, research or overseas career.\n\nThe money, which covers the annual cost of the course fee, is paid at the beginning of each term and is \ndiscretionary on the student\u2019s progress and attendance record.\n\nEach student\u2019s progress will be monitored at the end of each academic year and they will be expected to make a \nshort presentation of their progress to the JIF trustees.\n\nAfter graduation, the student will be asked to make an annual report to the trustees on their career progress.\n\nThe bursary is promoted to nine universities which offer crop-based degree courses: Newcastle, Harper Adams, \nRAU, Writtle, Risholme, Reading, Askham Bryan, Bishop Burton and Easton & Otley.\n\nThe closing date for this year\u2019s applications is 31 October, 2018.\n\nOpportunity for Holstein Young Breeder\n\nHolstein UK is offering a member of Holstein Young Breeders (HYB) the opportunity to go on an all-expenses-paid \ntrip to Australia for a month in January 2019.\n\nThe winner of the award will get the opportunity to visit a wide range of Australian dairy farms, take part in \nInternational Dairy Week and see some of the country\u2019s top tourist attractions.\n\nIt is part of an exchange programme which will focus on learning, practical on-farm experience, skills development, \nnetworking, and gaining first-hand knowledge of how dairy farming compares in Australia and the UK.\n\n\nThe winner will be required to keep a blog detailing their time in Australia and write an article for the Holstein UK \nJournal on their return.\n\nDetails of the scheme can be found on the Holstein UK website.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nEarly generation Land Rover Discoverys have been a farming favourite for two decades but many have been struck \ndown with a vicious case of tinworm that, until now, has left them destined for the scrap heap.\n\nHowever, a gang of upcyclers in the Isle of Wight have come up with a new cab design that bolts in place of the old \nbody while making use of Land Rover\u2019s decent engine, gearbox and chassis.\n\nThe forward control cab sits on top of the engine and leaves a big load bed out back capable of carrying up to \n1,200kg.\n\nSee also: Land Rover Defender gets \u00a380,000 Twisted treatment\n\nThis solution differs from other companies vying to sell alternative farm runabouts, such as far smaller UTVs, \nconverted Jimnys with limited carrying and towing capacities, the two-wheel-drive OX flat-backed truck and Projekt \nGrenadier (a kind of Defender replacement that remains a long way from production).\n\nThe other perk of Rotodama\u2019s kit is that it retains all of the Discovery\u2019s stand-out features, including a 3.5t towing \ncapacity, coil springs all round and the pretty solid combination of 2.5-litre 300Tdi engine and five-speed auto \ngearbox.\n\nLand Rover Discovery 300Tdi spec\n\nEngine: 2.5-litre four-cyl Tdi\n\nPower: 111hp@4,000rpm\n\nTorque: 265Nm@1,800rpm\n\nTransmission:Five-speed\n\n0-62mph:18.5secs\n\nTop speed:91mph\n\nEconomy: 32mpg\n\nTowing capacity: 3,500kg\n\nWeight: 1,985kg\n\nCab frame\n\nThe cab skeleton is made from a motorsport-spec tubular frame that is tough enough to handle the knocks and \nbashes of off-highway life.\n\nThe boxy shape keeps construction simple, while double posts on the front and rear corners and diagonally-set \nbracing across the roof stiffen it enough to handle a rollover.\n\nSome of the panels are currently made of aluminium, but on full production models these will be replaced with GRP \nfibreglass, which is both tough and easy to replace.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\n\n\nForward control cab sits on original body mounts\n\nFirst version will be a single cab with rear deck, but double cab and people carrier models will come later\n\nAsking price for the cab is \u00a311,250 (ex VAT)\n\nCustomers can provide their own donor vehicle or get Rotodama to source one\n\nThe panels themselves self-retain in the frame, so by running cheese wire through the sealant they can be popped \nout and replaced pretty easily if broken.\n\nThey\u2019re also light, which helps the cab stay well under the 1,250kg front axle weight limit on Series 1 Discos.\n\nOther external tweaks for full production models include a front bumper that will improve impact absorption (there \nare currently no crumple zones) and some steps, as the climb into the cab is almost a metre.\n\nOn the inside, buyers get the essentials: seats, steering wheel, doors and windows, and a three-speed fan for the \nfootwells and windscreen.\n\nThere are currently no dials, but the firm says it will probably reuse Land Rover\u2019s instrument binnacle.\n\nOther internal tweaks include switching all the panels to aluminium, extending legroom and adding window locks.\n\nFitting\n\nThe fitting process is pretty simple, provided the 12 mounting bolts for the old body come undone cleanly and angle \ngrinder work is avoided. In all, it should take Rotodama less than two hours to remove the old shell.\n\nHacking the body off provides the perfect opportunity to give the rest of the vehicle a health check. In particular, it\u2019s \nworth having a quick gander at a couple of the chassis\u2019 weak points around the rear tubular cross member. If there \nare signs of rust then it\u2019s well worth getting them patched up with 2mm plate.\n\nIn fact, the company suggests shot-blasting and repainting the chassis before lifting on the new cab, which is simply \nheld by four M10 bolts that slot down through the original mounts.\n\nDoes it alter the Discovery?\n\nThe beauty of the system is that it doesn\u2019t alter any aspect of the engine, transmission or chassis, so it sits within \nthe same footprint \u2013 the only alteration is some mildly stiffer suspension springs to handle the extra front-end \nweight.\n\nKeeping the bare bones of the vehicle intact also avoids the rigmarole of changing the Individual Vehicle Approval \nwith the DVLA \u2013 as far as they\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s still the same vehicle (bar the colour).\n\nThe changes see 950kg of bodywork removed and replaced with just 500kg in new cab and rear deck. That means \nalmost 500kg has been shaved off the Discovery\u2019s overall weight and leaves 1,200kg of payload capacity in the \nback, which comfortably competes with the biggest pickups on the market.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t building rear-deck add-ons itself \u2013 instead it has recruited Solent Body Builders in Fareham, \nwhich will manufacturer all sorts of kit, including shoot trailers with minibus-style seating, campervan units or tipping \nbodies.\n\nHow does it handle?\n\nBecause the running gear remains the same, top speed is well over 80mph, it can still tow 3.5t and has decent \nground clearance too. Coil springs are also far more forgiving than the leaf setups on most pickups when blatting \nalong rutted farm tracks.\n\n\n\nLosing most of the bodywork causes the centre of gravity to drop by about 60cm, which makes it more balanced \nover rough ground, too.\n\nThe other benefit from the changes is the forward control design, which gives the driver an up-close view of the \nfront corners \u2013 particularly handy for anyone that does forestry work.\n\nOn the inside, it\u2019s a pretty crude setup at the minute, although the pre-production model will be tidied up and fine-\ntuned with a few extra mod cons.\n\nThere\u2019s currently little in the way of sound deadening, so it\u2019s quite noisy, but the combination of aluminium interior \npanels and foam sealant will be good at stifling the sound from the engine, the company says.\n\nSurprisingly, it doesn\u2019t get overly hot in the cab, despite the engine being between the two seats. Legroom is \nreasonable too \u2013 and will be improved by 40mm on later versions \u2013 and there\u2019s more space between steering wheel \nand door than in the Defender.\n\nConsumption stats are pretty similar to the original vehicle \u2013 expect to get about 22mpg from the auto or more like \n30mpg in the manual.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nPricing is still being ironed out and is likely to change as production gets ramped up.\n\nAs a guide, Rotodama expects to charge \u00a311,250 (ex VAT) for the cab, including the steering column, belts, seats \nand gear shift assembly.\n\nSurprisingly, 90% of enquiries have been for cab kits, but the company will offer to remanufacture vehicles. Going \ndown this route is likely to cost closer to \u00a330,000 as it will include a revamp of the running gear, so it looks like a \ncheaper bet to source the vehicle yourself.\n\nOnce you own the cab, there\u2019s also the option of swapping it to another vehicle further down the line.\n\nWhy a Series 1 Disco?\n\nThere are around 30,000 Series 1 300Tdi Discoverys still on the road and their tendency to suffer from body rot \nrather than mechanical gremlins makes them the ideal donor vehicle.\n\nMost eventually fail MOT tests for the same reasons \u2013 particularly rusty boot floors and inner wheel arches \u2013 but \nthey all run on what is essentially a solidly-made Range Rover chassis.\n\nThe cab will also fit Series 2 Td5 Discovery models, of which there are another 30,000 on the road. However, it\u2019s \nnot so much body rot that is the problem but rusty chassis.\n\nReplacement galvanised chassis are available for about \u00a32,000, so they can still be salvaged, but generally they \nwere built with thinner, lower-grade metal and weren\u2019t protected by paint in the right places.\n\nLand Rover Defenders have different chassis mounts but the overall width is the same, so conversions shouldn\u2019t be \ntoo difficult.\n\nThe sticking point is the price \u2013 hard-worked 110 High Capacity models from the early 2000s are now fetching \n\u00a310,000-\u00a312,000, which makes the whole job very expensive.\n\nOf course, the advantage of using Land Rover vehicles as the base is the abundance of spare parts, but any ladder \nchassis vehicle can be adapted to forward control and the Toyota Hilux is another likely candidate for the future.\n\nHow did it come about?\n\n\n\nA team of four friends have been developing the front cab for the past three years, with a mix of skills in fabricating, \nengineering and marketing.\n\nKeen upcyclers, they noticed the number of Discoverys drifting towards redundancy due to their tendency to suffer \nfrom bodywork rust.\n\nThey came up with a basic plan for a forward control cab and knocked together a rudimentary concept within three \nmonths using human dimensions to get the pedal angles correct in relation to the seat and wheel.\n\nThe original idea was then developed into a proper prototype that is still running now.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrowing crops for added value premiums allows Northampton farmer Rick Davies to offset the extra income against \nthe effects of cropping highly variable soils.\n\nWith 404ha of combinable crops being grown across a range of soil types, yields can be limited on the lighter, \ndrought-prone soils in dry years, while flooding is also a threat to output on around 80-100ha of land that adjoins the \nRiver Ouse.\n\nSoil variability is part of the planning process at the new Northamptonshire AHDB Monitor Farm.\n\nSee also: Big and small arable monitor farmers face the same challenges\n\nOn the flood plain land, silt over gravel and sandy gravel soils predominate, while other soil types like sandy clay \nloam, brash and clay loams are found across the two farm sites operated by MTH Davies from its Clifton Reynes \nbase.\n\nGiven those constraints and recent unpredictable weather patterns, Mr Davies is clear about his cropping strategy. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t always get the highest yields here, so we need the premiums.\u201d\n\nFarm facts: MTH Davies, Newton Lodge Farm\n\n404ha\n\n242ha milling wheat, 55ha oilseed rape, 64ha spring barley, 17ha grass, 26ha margins/mid tier\n\nFive-year average yields: first wheat 10.30t/ha, second wheat 9.85t/ha, oilseed rape 3.69t/ha and spring barley \n7.77t/ha\n\n6,000t of grain storage plus continuous flow drier\n\nClaydon 4.8m drill, often used in conjunction with a 3m Dyna-drive\n\nContract Avadex (tri-allate) spreading\n\nRed Poll cattle and box beef scheme\n\nCropping strategy\n\nAs a result, his winter wheat is all in Group 1 milling varieties, his high-oleic, low-linolenic (Holl) oilseed rape is \ngrown for the specialist oil market and his spring barley is on contract to Budweiser.\n\n\u201cIt has worked well for us in most years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only crop under review is the Holl oilseed rape \u2013 the \npremium dropped right back from \u00a325/t to \u00a38/t last year, making it borderline. The \u00a390/ha cost of the seed makes it \nhardly worth doing if there\u2019s insufficient reward.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother consideration is that his oilseed rape yields have dropped in the past two years. \u201cWhether that\u2019s due to the \nHoll varieties, or a combination of other factors, I\u2019m not certain.\n\n\u201cTo check, we have also got some conventional oilseed rape varieties, Campus and Elgar, growing alongside the \nHoll type V316OL, to see if they can do any better.\u201d\n\nAlternative choices\n\nAn alternative could be high-erucic acid (Hear) oilseed rape, with its \u00a360/t premium, he says. \u201cThat figure includes \nthe oil bonus. The seed cost is \u00a370/ha, which is slightly better than Holl seed.\u201d\n\nAll of the winter wheat at Newton Lodge Farm is in Group 1 milling wheat varieties, which include Gallant, Crusoe, \nSkyfall and Zyatt. The farm has a good track record of hitting the full milling specification and supplies local firm \nHeygates.\n\n\u201cThe variety mix works well,\u201d says Mr Davies. \u201cThe oldest variety, Gallant, is useful because its early maturing, so \nwe get it cleared first at harvest.\u201d\n\nOn land which is blackgrass-free, he grows two wheat crops, followed by spring barley and then oilseed rape. \nWhere blackgrass is a problem, a first wheat is followed by two successive crops of spring barley, followed by \noilseed rape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unknown for us to grow a third wheat,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are looking at widening out the rotations if we can, \nperhaps bringing in a pulse crop. We\u2019re also going to try a cover crop between the two spring barleys this coming \nyear.\u201d\n\nSpring barley experience\n\nExplorer spring barley is grown on contract for Budweiser through Glencore and suits the farm well. As well as \nbeing very competitive against blackgrass, it has yielded as much as 9.8t/ha in the past.\n\n\u201cIt tillers well, so with the right seed rate we find that it really helps with blackgrass. The ground is moved in the \nautumn, so that we can go straight in with our Claydon drill in the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year, it went in a month too late. The upside of that is reduced expenditure on the crop, especially herbicides, \nbut the delay is likely to have reduced yields. We\u2019ll see when the combine goes through.\u201d   \n\nDiversification\n\nBeing a fourth-generation family farm has given Rick Davies and his father the time and energy to pursue other \nenterprises and make the most of diversification opportunities.\n\nTime and money spent converting old pig buildings mean that 14 office lets and four light industrial units are an \nintegral part of the business, with 52 container storage units being a more recent addition.\n\nIn addition, a box beef scheme makes best use of the farm\u2019s 25 Red Poll cattle, which are extensively grazed, while \na contract Avadex (tri-allate) spreading operation has been set up by Mr Davies and covers the local area.\n\nHis brother George runs a separate turf business from Newton Lodge Farm, building it up over the past 18 years to \ninclude three depots, six lorries and 17 staff.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAn animal rights group has published the names, addresses and phone numbers of farmers signed up to the \nbadger cull in the west of England.\n\n\n\nStop The Cull has created a map showing the location of more than 100 farmers and posted it online, telling its \nsupporters that \u201conly direct action\u201d can save badgers\u2019 lives.\n\nThis includes:\n\nCalling farmers directly\n\nPlaying the \u201cBadger Badger Badger song\u201d down the phone\n\nAdding farmers\u2019 details to call back request sites to generate masses of unwanted calls\n\nLeaving fake answerphone messages farmers will have to respond to, for example \u201cThis is Mole Valley Farmers, \nwe need to speak to you about your order\u201d.\n\nStop The Cull says these tactics are designed to \u201csabotage\u201d farmers\u2019 time but not to be intimidating.\n\nSee also: Practical farm advice for dealing with activists\n\nIt is \u201cperfectly legal\u201d to ring once, the activists said, but warn against ringing multiple times as this could be \nconstrued as harassment.\n\nThough keen to broadcast farmers\u2019 contact details, the group advises its members to remain anonymous, by \nblocking their number, buying new pay-as-you-go phones or using online voice simulators.\n\nThe Badger Trust, another campaign group, has spoken out against the publication of farmers\u2019 private details, \nexpressing concern the tactic could lead to people being threatened.\n\nDominic Dyer, chief executive of the trust, said: \u201cWe fully understand the level of public anger over the cruel, hugely \ncostly and ineffective badger cull policy, but nothing is to be gained by publishing details of those involved.\n\n\u201cWe believe in peaceful opposition to the badger cull, acting within the law.\u201d\n\nIndefensible tactics\n\nThe NFU has called intimidating, bullying and harassing farming families and their children in this way \n\u201cindefensible\u201d.\n\nAn NFU spokesman said: \u201cWe continue to find it extraordinary that this group \u2013 made up of a small number of \nextreme animal rights activists \u2013 feels it is morally acceptable to carry out activities like this, which are specifically \ndesigned to scare, threaten and intimidate normal farming families.\n\n \u201cBadger culls are being carried out legally and lawfully in specific areas as part of government policy to control and \neradicate this terrible disease, which saw more than 33,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year.\n\n\u201cAnyone who calls farmers and their families with the aim of causing them distress is committing a criminal offence.\u201d\n\nDefra has stated any criminality or intimidation by protestors is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and would be a matter for the police.\n\nWhat to do if you receive a suspicious, threatening or malicious telephone call\n\nRemain calm on the phone and try to collect as much useful information as possible, including their name and \nreason for call without giving away any of your details.\n\nFollow the standard police reporting procedure (see below).\n\nNever delete any voicemail messages and if possible record any phone calls.\n\nIf activity persists contact BT malicious calls bureau (0800 661 441) and follow their advice.\n\n\n\nStandard police reporting procedure\n\nDial 101 and tell the operator you want to report a crime.\n\nGive your location and postcode and describe the incident.\n\nGather as much evidence as possible, including descriptions of perpetrators and vehicle registrations.

Cultivations will bury seed, \nremoving it from predators and can induce seed into a deeper dormancy. \n\nUse minimal or non-inversion tillage, keeping seed within the top 5cm, where it can germinate.

I want to fully understand the impact on my business. \nWhat should I consider?\n\nA See your business in the same way your bank manager would. How at risk is your present financial situation and \nwhat might it look like if you make the purchase?\n\nAcquisition of major assets such as land and property that involve bank borrowing may put pressure on the balance \nsheet in terms of gearing ratios.\n\nThese compare medium and long-term liabilities with your net worth and are typically presented as a percentage \ngearing ratios will be one of several considerations by a bank before lending.\n\nSee also: Use share farming to meet greening requirements\n\nThe target ratio would be under 50%, however, it is accepted this figure will be distorted by the purchase of a \nsignificant asset with 100% borrowing but the bank will need to understand how the ratio will be brought back into a \n\"normal\" range.\n\nRemember also net worth calculations rely on asset values which may not be current or accurate.\n\nCashflow perspective\n\nBanks will also want to see a strong business case for the potential purchase and your plans make sense from a \ncashflow perspective.\n\nIt is important to include all expenditure during your proposed payback period, such as any other capital purchases. \nThere is no point in replacing a bank loan with an increased unforeseen overdraft facility and no immediate plan to \nrepay.\n\nAppraise how your business would look without Rural Payment Agency income. Prepare a sound plan for \nrepayments and understand the full demands of cash in the business (including private drawings and tax).\n\nIdentify and declare private drawings and income tax. Understand what depreciation means to the profit and loss \naccount and how this translates to cashflow forecasting.\n\nIt is essential all cash income and expenditure is considered when appraising a large long-term capital purchase. \nRepayments due on asset finance and long-term bank loans and mortgages are calculated over a period of time.\n\nMeanwhile your profit and loss account is affected by plant and machinery depreciation the moment the item arrives \non the farm.\n\nDepreciation is not a cash item but it is important to understand how your accountants calculates it.\n\nBe realistic and include sensitivity analysis in your future gross margin calculations; for example, what would a 30% \nincrease or decrease in the price of your sales or cost of your inputs do to your cashflow?\n\nConsider also the ownership of the land \u2013 whose name will be on the title deeds?

Here Peter Griffiths, tax director at accountant Hazlewoods, offers advice on how rollover relief is affected \nby inheritance of farming assets.\n\nQ Having read about rollover relief from capital gains tax (CGT) in Farmers Weekly, we would like to know what \nhappens when land bought with rollover relief is passed to someone after the original owner dies. Does this have to \nbe repaid from the estate or can the relief be continued until the recipient sells?\n\nA On an individual\u2019s death, all assets are uplifted to market value and no CGT is payable. Therefore, gains that \nhave been rolled over into assets held at death do not become chargeable to tax, and the whole gain is \u201cwashed \nout\u201d. \n\nAssets owned by the deceased may suffer inheritance tax (IHT), although if the relevant assets wholly qualify for an \nIHT relief such as agricultural properly relief or business property relief, the assets can be passed to the inheriting \nindividual with no tax liability arising.\n\nSee also: Tax considerations for farm cottages\n\nRollover relief from CGT is available for an individual when qualifying assets used in their trading business are sold, \nthere is a capital gain and the proceeds are reinvested in other qualifying assets to be used by the individual in their \ntrading business. This does not have to be the same business or even the same trade.\n\nRelief is available to sole traders and partners in a partnership. Relief is also available to limited companies or \nwhere individuals own an asset personally that is used by a company they own. \n\nThe acquisition of the replacement asset must be within a period commencing one year before and ending three \nyears after the disposal. HM Revenue and Customs may agree to extend the period, to allow relief on purchases up \nto two years before and six years after a disposal in certain situations. A claim has to be made for the relief.\n\nFor full relief, all the proceeds must be reinvested. Also, if the asset being sold has not always been used in a \ntrading business, then relief is restricted on a pro-rata basis to the trading period.\n\nReinvestment\n\nNo rollover relief will be available until proceeds at least equal to the cost of the asset being sold are reinvested. For \nexample, if an asset purchased for \u00a3400,000 is sold for \u00a31m, no rollover relief will be available in respect of the \n\u00a3600,000 capital gain until replacement qualifying assets costing at least \u00a3400,000 have been acquired.\n\nFor farming businesses, relevant qualifying assets include land and buildings but not normally farmhouses occupied \nby anyone other than an employee.\n\nFixed plant and machinery, for example, an anaerobic digester or grain dryer, is also a qualifying asset, but only for \na maximum of 10 years, when the gain becomes chargeable, if other qualifying assets have not been acquired in \nthat period.\n\nIt is important to note that to extend the rollover relief period beyond 10 years, the replacement qualifying assets \nmust be purchased before the 10 years have elapsed.\n\nmailto:fwbusinessclinic@rbi.co.uk\n\n\nIt is worth remembering that provided the replacement asset is used in the trade immediately, even if the asset \nstops being used in the trade in the future, then there is no clawback of the rollover relief on purchase.\n\nMany farming businesses are now structured to include a company alongside a partnership. Gains made by an \nindividual on qualifying assets can be rolled into qualifying assets used in a different trading business they own.\n\nHowever, gains on assets used in a sole trade or partnership will not qualify for the relief where the proceeds are \nused to acquire qualifying assets to be used by a limited company which the individual owns. \n\nWhere relief is claimed on gains on assets owned personally by an individual and used by a company, HMRC takes \nthe view that relief is only available if the proceeds are reinvested in other assets used by the same company.\n\nDo you have a question for the panel?\n\nOutline your legal, tax, finance, insurance or farm management question in no more than 350 words and Farmers \nWeekly will put it to a member of the panel.

Here, Robert James associate at Thrings offers advice on how to tackle a problem with expensive \nequipment not working as it should.\n\nQ I run a 121ha (300-acre) and 180-cow dairy farm. With a view to expanding and increasing profits, I bought four \nmilking robots in 2013 to replace my herringbone parlour. \n\nI\u2019ve had nothing but problems with them. They constantly breakdown, are wholly unreliable and profits have fallen. I \ncannot contemplate expanding the herd until the problems are resolved.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ve had to maintain my herringbone parlour as backup when the plan was to sell this and recoup some \nmoney. The whole episode has caused great distress to both myself and my family. What can I do about it legally?\n\nA The good news is it looks like you have a claim for breach of contract. If you bought the robots from the \nmanufacturer or an agent, I would expect they would have contracted on their set of standard terms and conditions \nwhich would set out some express terms. It is these that would need to be examined in the first place. \n\nRegardless of these terms, the law implies certain terms into contracts such as these, primarily that the robots \nshould be (a) of satisfactory quality and (b) fit for purpose.\n\nThis would be governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, as you purchased the robots back in 2013. It has since \nbeen replaced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which applies to all contracts after 1 October 2015.\n\nSee also: Danger of undocumented family loans\n\nIn any standard terms and conditions, I would expect to see certain exclusion or limitation of liability clauses. This is \nan attempt by the seller to restrict the category of claims that may be brought against it, or try to set up a financial \ncap on its liability for any claim.  \n\nIf the standard terms and conditions are simply imposed on you, and these exclusions or limitation clauses were not \nadequately explained and highlighted to you, then there may be an argument they are not valid.\n\nmailto:fwbusinessclinic@rbi.co.uk\n\n\nUnder the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, it would up to the seller to persuade the court the clauses are \nreasonable in the circumstances. On the facts of your case, this is not an easy task.\n\nIf it can be shown the breakdowns are caused by inherent defects with the robots and not by husbandry or other \nexternal factors then, on the face of it, you would have good prospects to show they are not fit for purpose and are \nnot of satisfactory quality.\n\nDetailed record\n\nTo support any potential claim, it is important to keep a detailed record of the frequency of the breakdowns and any \nknown cause. A positive expert report from a suitably qualified engineer would strengthen your position.\n\nIf you can successfully show the robots are defective, relief will come by way of damages. From what you have \ndescribed, there are three broad heads of loss.\n\nFirst, you need to be put in a situation where you have working robots. Usually, this involves the cost of repair, but if \nall repairing efforts to date have been to no avail you could certainly argue you should be awarded damages to \nenable you to go out any buy new robots.\n\nSecond is the question of any loss of profit from the drop in production. You will need to show these losses were \nforeseeable, for example, that they could reasonably be a contemplated result of having defective robots. Your \naccountant may be able to help you demonstrate and provide evidence of these losses.\n\nLast, you mention distress. The law only allows damages for distress in contract claims in very limited \ncircumstances, where the purpose of the contract was to provide peace of mind or relaxation. The current claim is \nunlikely to fall within that category.\n\nA note of caution. Any court claim for a breach of contract should be started and issued with the court within six \nyears from the breach, which could run from the date of purchase back in 2013 and may therefore mean that you \ndo not have much time left to pursue the claim.\n\nDo you have a question for the panel?\n\nOutline your legal, tax, finance, insurance or farm management question in no more than 350 words and Farmers \nWeekly will put it to a member of the panel.

The mix is claimed to have a root structure \nideally suited to breaking down compacted soils\n\nHere, he is using a cover crop mix using deeptill radish, sunflowers and other species, which is drilled  after early \nlifted carrots before going into a following crop of potatoes or onions.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly useful after these early lifted vegetables when we need a tap root to try a give the soil some \nstructure and better drainage,\u201d he says.\n\nThe roots from deeptill radish make a big difference to the soil, helping it to drain well as run-off on bare land after \nharvested vegetables can be significant on this light land, he adds.\n\nCover crop costs\n\nThe cost of the cover crops varies between \u00a310/ha and \u00a320/ha with the oat-vetch being the cheapest mix moving to \nthe deeptill radish mix at the higher end.\n\nMost of the cover crops are established using a Vaderstad TopDown light cultivator with a Biodrill attached, and this \nyear all the cover crop are expected to be drilled by the first week in September.\n\n\u201cWe are building up knowledge about cover crops and know we are putting something back so they  should benefit \nthe soils and eventually yields,\u201d he says.\n\nThe summer drought hit yields across the estate so the effect of the cover crops was difficult to assess this \nsummer, but Mr Cobbald remains confident about their success on the farm.\n\nThe estate, three miles south-east of Swaffham, consists of about 2,300ha of arable cropping, growing wheat, \nbarley, oilseed rape, sugar beet and vining peas along with the vegetable crops.\n\nIn addition, there is permanent grassland and water meadows along the River Wissey grazed by a 600-strong \nAberdeen Angus cross Charolais suckler herd and followers.\n\nCultivation change\n\nThe Norfolk estate is looking to improve establishment on its light soils by switching to strip\u2013tillage for drilling \noilseed rape this summer to restrict soil disturbance to a minimum.\n\nJames Brown, farm manager at the estate, is trying out the new strip-till technique this summer to improve \nestablishment on the light Breckland soils.\n\nWith 250ha of rapeseed to drill, he is using a cultivator with a disc and heavy tine ahead of each drill coulter of a \nVaderstad Tempo precision drill this year rather than the min-till approach of the past.\n\nThis one-pass system will help cut costs, retain moisture by cutting down on soil disturbance while a seed-bed with \nfewer clods will  mean fewer places for pests such as cabbage stem flea beetles to hide.\n\n\n\nRain in early August came at just the right time to allow oilseed rape drilling to start and this season's  crop was all \nin the ground by 25 August in ideal conditions with the soil \u201cwarm to the touch\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nResearchers from the University of Minnesota have been comparing the performance of three-way-cross cows \n(made up of Viking Red, Montbeliarde and Holstein) to Holsteins.\n\nTheir studies have compared feed intake; milk volume and milk fat and protein production; fertility as well as health \ncosts.\n\nWe were invited to a study tour in Portugal where the results where revealed and where we also caught up with \nthree farmers from Europe using this ProCross breed to see how they are performing in their systems.  \n\nFeed intake and milk production study\n\n10-year ProCross study findings\n\nCase study one\n\nCase study two\n\nCase study three\n\nPros and cons of the cross-bred animal\n\nHybrid vigour effect as crosses increase\n\nFeed intake and milk production study \n\nCross-bred cows are more efficient at converting feed into milk solids compared with Holsteins, the latest research \nfrom the University of Minnesota, US, has found.\n\nProCross cows ate 373kg less total mixed ration (TMR) across three lactations compared with Holsteins, but \nproduced the same milk solids.\n\nWhat is ProCross?\n\nIt is a three-way cross of Viking Red, Montbeliarde and Holstein used in rotation to maximise hybrid vigour.\n\nHow the trial was carried out\n\nThe study was led by PhD graduate Brittany Shonka-Martin at the University of Minnesota.\n\nShe compared the feed intake of Holstein and ProCross cows from first to third lactation over a three-year period.\n\nSee also: Alternative forage options for dairy cows this winter\n\nCows were fed the same TMR twice daily in tie-stalls with partitions in the feed manger.

The Holstein did produce 206kg more milk at 4,770kg, but milk solid production was 2kg higher in the \nProCross group at 331kg (see \"Dry matter intake and production in first lactation\")\n\nIn second and third lactation, the differences became even more stark, with ProCross animals eating 232kg less \nthan Holsteins, on average. Once again, volume of milk in the group of Holsteins was higher by 372kg, but \ncombined fat and protein levels were 4kg higher in the ProCross group.(see \"Dry matter intake and production in \nsecond and third lactations:)\n\nAverage bodyweight was not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Yet ProCross held body \ncondition better at 3.46. This was +0.26 higher than the Holstein at 3.20. This trend continued in second and third \nlactation.\n\nWhat the results mean\n\nWith the majority of UK contracts now paying for milk solids rather than liquid, Prof Hansen said UK farmers could \ncapitalise on this by using the ProCross breed. \n\n\u201cFarmers think if you are going to cross-breed you lose production, but that\u2019s not the case. You may lose water, but \nfat and protein production are the same.\u201d\n\nProf Hansen said improved body condition also afforded cross-bred cows better fertility.\n\n\u201cCows that carry more body condition have better fertility and better health \u2013 that\u2019s well known. The body condition \ncomes heavily from Montbeliarde because they select to preserve it.\u201d\n\nCan the Holstein cow compete?\n\nIn comparison, Prof Hansen, who also teaches Holstein dairy judging at the university, said until 10-15 years ago \nHolstein breeders ignored fertility and health in favour of tall cows, which has a negative relationship on health and \nfertility traits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profitable cow that should really matter. Show cows don\u2019t often make you the most money, but they can be \nfun.\n\n\u201cThe Holstein cow was a wonderful cow. She peaked globally in 1985 and there was no cow that could compete \nwith a Holstein, but breeds change.\u201d\n\nInbreeding\n\nWhen questioned whether the change in the quest for a more functional and fertile Holstein could once again \ncement the Holstein back in poll position, Prof Hansen said current inbreeding could hinder progress.\n\nSince the advent of genomics, inbreeding within the Holstein breed has sped up rapidly in the US. In 2010, \ninbreeding stood at 5.67%, but this has increased to 7.23% in 2017.\n\nHowever, UK inbreeding is lower than this. Data from more than 180,000 Holstein calves born in 2017 show the \naverage level of inbreeding to be 5.17%, which rose by just 0.14% on the year, figures from Holstein UK show.\n\nOnce inbreeding gets above 6.25%, traits such as fertility, health, mortality and longevity suffer. However, \ninbreeding has no effect on type.\n\nProf Hansen blamed the \u201crace to the top\u201d of bull rankings by AI companies for this decline.\n\n\n\u201cThe Holstein industry is breeding the best to the best as fast as [they] can. It\u2019s a race because it\u2019s all about survival \nof the company and right now you have to have the highest genomic young bulls to survive. So, we have this \ndilemma that\u2019s really becoming an issue.\u201d\n\nOne way to lessen the decline, Mr Hansen said, was for companies to move to internal genetic evaluations that \naren\u2019t shared with anyone outside of the organisation, like the pig and poultry industries.\n\nHowever, Marco Winters, head of animal genetics at AHDB Dairy, said dairy farmers would lose out ultimately \nbecause genetic evaluations would be in the hands of companies and would rely on them being completely honest.\n\n\u201cIn the pig and poultry sector, turnaround is rapid. If you get the wrong chicken you know pretty much in a month, \nbut in the dairy world it takes three years before you have any results.\u201d\n\nMr Winters said inbreeding was an \u201cinevitable by-product\u201d of doing an excellent job of genetic progress, adding: \n\u201cAlthough inbreeding is increasing in the UK, we are increasing at a really slow rate and because we started from a \nFriesian base, it is at a safe level and very easy to manage.\n\n\u201cInbreeding should never be a reason to go cross-breeding. There may be other reasons, but inbreeding shouldn\u2019t \nbe one of them.\u201d\n\nMating programmes are currently available in the UK to check for inbreeding coefficients on prospective matings, \nbut the AHDB hopes to launch a genomic inbreeding tool next April.\n\nThe tool will be available to use within their Inbreeding Checker programme to give farmers more accurate \ninformation on inbreeding.\n\nCurrent inbreeding values are based on the probability a calf will carry the same copy of a gene inherited from its \nancestors and is a crude measure, but this new tool will allow farmers that are genotyping to actually see what \ngenes calves inherit and predict inbreeding levels in further matings.\n\nDarren Todd, Holstein UK geneticist, said in the future UK herds could mirror what US genetic company Select \nSires practices.\n\nThey use a programme called StrataGen, which uses genomic insights to colour-code daughter proven and young \nsires into one of five genetic lines based on traits they have inherited from ancestors to avoid inbreeding.\n\n \n\n10-year ProCROSS study findings\n\nScientists from the University of Minnesota carried out a 10-year study comparing ProCross cow performance to \npurebred Holsteins from seven farms in the US.\n\nThey started with one group of 3,550 purebreds and bred 1,455 pure and 714 to Montbeliarde and 714 to Viking \nRed.\n\nDaughters from the two cross-bred groups were then mated to either Montbeliarde and Viking Red to achieve a full \nProCross animal. Once this three-way cross was achieved, those animals were mated back to Holstein. \n\nResearchers monitored fertility, health costs and milk production of two-breed-, three-breed- and four-breed-\ncrosses across different lactations compared with pure Holsteins.\n\nThey found:\n\nTwo-breed ProCross cows produced more combined fat and protein than Holsteins in first to fourth lactation.\n\n\n\nThree-breed ProCross cows produced less milk solids in first, second and third lactations when compared with \nHolsteins.\n\nThis was compensated by higher fertility, with two-breed ProCross averaging 12 fewer days open across three \nlactations than Holsteins.\n\nThis effect was enhanced with three-breed-crosses averaging 26 fewer days open again compared with purebred \nHolsteins.\n\nBy the time the cross was bred back to Holstein (generation four), their fat and protein production in first lactation \novertook the pure Holsteins by 10kg.\n\nHealth costs in cross-bred cows reduced as the number of crosses increased from two crosses to three and \nlowered further as the number of lactations increased.\n\nOn average, the three breed crosses (VMH and MVH) saved farms \u00a323.50 an animal in third lactation compared \nwith Holsteins, which cost \u00a3116.\n\nCase study: Farm owner Anders Nilsson and herd manager Jan Eriksson, Skramered Farm, Laholm, Sweden\n\n \n\nAnders Nilsson has increased cow profitability by \u00a3300 a head since switching to the ProCross.\n\nHis herd of Holsteins were averaging 11,500 litres, but it was taking two straws of semen to get cows to conceive. \nTherefore, in 2011 he changed breeds in the quest of better fertility.\n\nFarm facts\n\nMilking 350 cows\n\n400ha\n\nFeeding 4t a concentrate a cow a year\n\nCows housed in straw-bedded cubicles\n\n30% cull rate as they have been removing Holstein\n\nCows producing 40 litres on average daily\n\nYear-round calving\n\nNow, the herd is producing 13,000 litres at 4.2% butterfat and 3.2% protein on three-times-a-day milking, but fertility \nhas improved, with straws to conception averaging 1.5.\n\nWhile the production lift has been a benefit of moving to three-times-a-day milking, herd manager Jan Eriksson \nbelieves improved fertility was noticeable immediately.\n\nThey used the Viking Red over the Holsteins for calving ease and then mated their daughters to Montbeliarde. Mr \nEriksson believes the first crosses were the best.\n\nThe farm sells 50 surplus heifers annually and now has ProCross cows in their third lactation milking.\n\nMr Eriksson says: \u201cOur goal was to have a smaller cow with better fertility. Now we have a smaller cow that gives \nmore milk, but she\u2019s pregnant more quickly.\u201d\n\nCase study: Will Nixon, Nixon\u2019s Farm, Market Drayton, Shropshire\n\n\n\nWill Nixon imported 80 in-calf ProCross heifers from Denmark last year after fertility slipped in his herd of 300 pure \nHolsteins.\n\nHe farms in partnership with his dad, Ian, and uncle, David, near Market Drayton. He says they were very happy \nwith the performance of the Holsteins in 2004, when cows were achieving 29 litres daily with 19 litres produced from \nforage.\n\nFarm facts\n\nMilks 380

is 383 days\n\n2.6 cows/ha\n\nFeeds 2.6t a cow\n\nHowever, since then Mr Nixon says genetic progress had halted, with production reducing by 2 litres a cow and \ncalving interval slipping to 400 days. \n\nHe has been comparing the performance of the ProCross heifers in their first lactation to 80 Holstein heifers since \nboth calved in August.\n\nThe comparison has shown:\n\nHolstein heifers produced 42 litres more milk on average in first lactation.\n\nProCross heifers produced more milk solids at 4.1% butterfat and 3.54% protein compared with Holstein heifers at \n3.75% and 3.21%.\n\nThis year, only three ProCross heifers are not back in calf compared with 26 Holsteins to calve within their autumn \nblock.\n\nConception rate has been better on ProCross heifers at 58% and 1.7 services to conception.\n\nIn comparison the conception rate of Holstein heifers was 44% and 1.9 straws to conception.\n\nThis year they have served everything to Montbeliarde to begin the conversion to ProCross.\n\n\u201cThe fertility of the ProCross is superior to the Holsteins and I hope to see longevity improve too.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to tighten our calving block and reduce our cull rate to 20% and in turn that should increase our yield, as \nwe will have more older cows in the herd.\u201d\n\nCase study: Arthur Palmer, Oulton House Farm, Norbury, Staffordshire\n\nAutumn calver Arthur Palmer reckons he has reduced his cost of production by 4p/litre since he began cross-\nbreeding eight years ago.\n\n\n\nHis herd fertility was the main reason he made the move, with calving interval back in 2010 languishing at 425 days \nand replacement rate peaking at 31%.\n\nFarm facts\n\n9,500 litres of milk (35% of the herd is made up of heifers) at 4.1% butterfat and 3.3%

calving has reduced from 24.9 to 23 months and average inseminations to \nconception has lowered by 2.36 to 1.7.\n\nThis has allowed him to review the performance of a small group Swedish Red cross

\nanimal welfare offences.\n\nDaniel William Waring, 48, previously pleaded guilty to more than 30 animal welfare and disease offences at \nHaithwaite Farm, Penton.\n\nHe appeared at Carlisle Magistrates Court for sentencing on Tuesday (28 August).\n\nSee also: How to identify, prevent and treat the five sheep \u2018iceberg diseases\u2019\n\nJon Farnworth, prosecuting on behalf of Cumbria Trading Standards, outlined three sets of offences admitted by Mr \nWaring.\n\nHe had previously pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to sheep between December 2017 and January \nthis year. More than 640 of Mr Waring\u2019s sheep died due to starvation and neglect during this period.\n\nMr Waring admitted failure to abide by strict disease control regulations governing animal movements, including \nbreaches of the six-day standstill rule. He also failed to adequately report and keep farm records.\n\nThe third group of offences related to his failure to dispose of animal carcasses in a timely manner.\n\nMr Farnworth told the court that Mr Waring\u2019s failure to seek immediate veterinary attention for his stock left them \n\u201cdying like flies\u201d.\n\nFarmer \u2018truly sorry\u2019\n\nSimon Catterall,  defending, explained that the disease outbreak took a long time to control because it was \nmistakenly assumed to be liver fluke disease, until later post-mortem examinations suggested the presence of a \nmulti-resistant worm.\n\nHe added: \u201cMr Waring was overwhelmed by the rapid escalation of the outbreak. He was already drowning in \npaperwork and shattered by the sudden death of his father and uncle and was unable to cope. He is truly sorry.\u201d\n\nDistrict judge Gerald Chalk sentenced Mr Waring to four months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. He \nordered him to carry out 110 hours of unpaid work.\n\nMr Waring was also disqualified from keeping and owning livestock for seven years and told to pay \u00a317,668 \nprosecution costs.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFood prices will rise by at least 5% due to extreme weather hitting crop yields and pushing up farm input costs, \nconsumers are being warned.\n\nFarmers and domestic food production were feeling the impact of this year's dry summer following a cold, wet \nspring, said the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR).\n\nSee also: Base rate rises to 0.75%, adding to farm costs\n\nAs a result, wholesale prices for vegetables were rising markedly, it said.\n\n\n\nFrom March to July the farmgate price of onions (+41%), carrots (+80%), lettuce (+61%), wheat for bread (+20%) \nand strawberries (+28%) rose by a fifth or more each.\n\nThe CEBR used Defra research into the sensitivity of consumer prices to wholesale price shocks to estimate the \nUK's shoppers will have to pay an extra \u00a345m/week for food.\n\nPrice spikes\n\nThis is equivalent to a rise of \u00a37.15/month for each household.\n\nCommodity price spikes could take 18 months to fully feed through into inflation so the cost to consumers looked \nset to climb even though milder weather is expected in the autumn.\n\nEven when grass growth returns to normal, reduced grazing and lack of forage will have a lasting impact for months \nto come.\n\nSome farmers have had to turn to already depleted backup supplies to boost production, which will keep upward \npressure on feed costs in the coming winter.\n\nThe CEBR said the heat had reduced the fertility of pigs and contributed to an 8% rise in piglet prices since March \u2013 \nwith an expected knock-on effect on the price of bacon.\n\nIt expects the price of red meat to fall marginally in the short run as farmers sold livestock earlier than normal to \nreduce the burden on grazing land.\n\nWeak harvest\n\nIn the longer run, however, prices are expected to rise as feed availability is affected by a weak harvest which will \npush up costs.\n\nMuch of UK\u2019s grain \u2013 used to feed livestock, as well as for numerous food products \u2013 is imported from Europe, \nwhich has also seen record high temperatures this year.\n\nReserves have kept prices from spiking drastically thus far, but industry forecasts and futures prices point toward \ncoming increases.\n\nThe weak pound and the recent increase in the Bank of England base rate has also pushed up farm input costs and \nthe cost of borrowing.\n\nWheat, which features heavily in European and British shopping baskets, is a particular concern.\n\nThe CEBR said the wheat harvest was forecast to be down by 5% this year, and European wheat futures are \ntrading about 30% higher than at the end of April.\n\nWith the wholesale price of many crops already rising very significantly and meat prices set to climb in coming \nmonths it seems likely that wholefood prices will rise at least 5%.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhat a difference a month can make. We were relieved when the rain arrived here at the end of July \u2013 the farm \ngreened up almost overnight.\n\nSteady rain since has led to some serious grass growth and now almost farcically has put us in a position where we \nare faced with a surplus of grass on the platform.\n\nSo to ensure the grazing rule book is firmly thrown out of the window for 2018, we are going to take silage off the \nplatform over the next week or two.\n\n\n\nWe will measure grass again tomorrow, but I suspect our average cover has jumped up again from the 2,350kg DM \nit was last week, with growth rates probably somewhere between 70 -90kg DM/day.\n\nSee also: What is the ideal DM to milk solids ratio to survive price volatility?\n\nGrass DM drops\n\nCows responded well, with milk up about 2-3 litres a day, although this is proving harder to maintain now pre-\ngrazing covers are getting heavier. Lower-DM grass is resulting in some less-than-ideal residuals.\n\nThe milking herd here at home was scanned today with an 8.6% empty rate after 12 weeks of mating and 84% of \nthem in calf within the first eight weeks.\n\nGiven the poor weather at the end of 2017 and the tough spring we are delighted with the results - sets us up nicely \nfor 2019.\n\nThe majority of the heifers entering the herd will calve in the first three weeks, guaranteeing another compact and \nbusy calving period.\n\nSpring system getting stick\n\nI was disappointed to read an opinion letter published recently in the farming press citing young spring calvers in \nnorth Wales as the cause of the increase in forage prices.\n\nIt blamed them for unsustainable farming systems, the need to buy silage and paying high land rents. \n\nThe one huge contradiction the author made was that the basis of the moan was that his merchant was charging \nhim more to purchase forage this year \u2013 an alarming mindset.\n\nThe sense of entitlement to purchase a commodity at the same price each year leads to grossly unjustified, \nsweeping statements aimed at a single section of one farming sector.\n\nI\u2019d welcome this person to our farm any day, to attend a discussion group meeting and even allow a reciprocal \nmeeting at their farm.\n\nJohnjo Roberts is a Farmer Focus writer on Anglesey.

Harvest is over in record time.\n\nAll the yields were down on all crops across the board, which isn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nSince I last wrote, we have cleared out all the young bulls and we are now filling up with stores a month earlier \nthan usual due to the drought conditions, with suckler breeders having very little grass.\n\nThese have all been weighed in and are, on average, 56kg lighter than the same cattle last year.\n\nWe are feeding 20% more feed to the stores on arrival because they are \u201dbig, empty houses\u201d and once we have \ncaught them up, which is taking about a month, they are settling down into a more normal feed regime.\n\nSee also: Focus on traits for best beef finishing returns\n\nWe are more or less self-sufficient in our requirement for straw here. The price of straw has been much hyped up \non the open market. However, it would be nice to think farmers could swap straw for muck on a national scale.\n\n\n\nThe soils in the arable parts of the country are screaming out for organic matter, but I know through being a \nmember of  the Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops that back-loading with farmyard manure to keep \nthe feed or straw wagon full for both legs of the trip is a big no-no.\n\nTo keep our feed lot bedded up we need to bale in the region of 4,000 bales. Baling is one task, moving them is \nanother, so for the third year running the \u201csuper C \u201c has been unleashed.\n\nThis is where you clank together three articulated trailers and dollies to form a road train.

Despite being drilled last, the late-drilled Costello at lower altitude was \nahead all season.\n\nThe first field was cut before a short rain delay and our spirits were lifted as it averaged 10t/ha with some incredible \nspecific weights, hitting 82kg/hl on some trailer loads, and at 13% moisture.\n\nThe wheat was completed within the week with some good long days of combining. Graham and Costello have both \ndone well. With 1,150t over the weigh bridge and an estimated 200t in the shed, I am hoping we are going to \naverage 9.6t/ha \u2013 1t/ha over our long-term average.\n\nWe still have the winter beans and the spring oats left to cut \u2013 the spring oats are going to bring us back down to \nearth. Unfortunately, these are on a tonnage contract and I know we are going to be short, so much so I have taken \na bit of cover, a costly lesson to learn!\n\nOur new ex-demo John Deere tractor has arrived just in time to be put straight to work drilling cover crops and then \ninto drilling OSR.\n\nElsewhere the grass has finally started to grow again just in time for flushing and tupping the ewes. Over 1,300 fat \nlambs have now left the farm with a few more left to go in the store market in the autumn.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHarvest started well this year with good weather and low moisture contents. However, winter barley was \ndisappointing, which didn't really surprise me.\n\nIt suffered badly from a very wet winter and spring, which affected establishment and tillering, and resulted in a \nthinner than normal crop, which only managed 7.5t/ha at 15% moisture.\n\nOilseed rape followed, with one field achieving 3.5t/ha, but the second one was very disappointing \u2013 again due to \npoor establishment.\n\nSee also: Oat market offers opportunity for farms in the right areas\n\n\n\nWinter oats, however, lifted my spirits with 7.5t/ha at 15% and good quality. Straw, which is very valuable this year, \nhas all been baled and snatched up by customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the good weather has now left us, hopefully temporarily, so that I can move into wheat, which looks \nquite well, but I never like to get my hopes up until I am actually in the field. Spring crops will be into September.\n\nProfitability and equality\n\nI recently attended a couple of early morning Ulster Farmers' Union meetings to consider our response to the \nNorthern Ireland version of the Health and Harmony consultation.\n\nCredit should go to our department of agriculture for trying to plan ahead for life after Brexit, particularly in the \nabsence of a government here.\n\nThere are a lot of sensible proposals in the 68-page document, but my main concern is that 'profitability' is only \nmentioned twice and 'equality' not at all.\n\nProductivity, resilience and environmental sustainability do not necessarily deliver acceptable profitability.\n\nIf we are to develop a sustainable agricultural policy going forward, it must be based on profitability and equality for \nthe whole supply chain, not just parts of it.\n\nIf we can get that right, everything else will fall naturally into place. Another concern is that with no government in \nplace here none of these proposals can be implemented.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our politicians don\u2019t seem to want government in NI to work while others don\u2019t seem to \nunderstand the rules they are supposed to abide by, but all are happy to continue to receive hard-earned taxpayers' \nmoney for doing next to nothing. This crazy situation has to stop.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers have branded Lynx Trust UK \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d over claims they have support from \nlandowners for releasing the wild animals in Northumberland.\n\nThe community in Kielder and the surrounding areas has come together to form a united group in order to refute \nthis, supported by the National Sheep Association (NSA) and the NFU.\n\nThe group has released a statement challenging Lynx Trust UK and calling on Natural England, currently deciding \non whether to issue a licence to reintroduce lynx into the wild, to \u201cthoroughly test all claims\u201d made in the licensing \napplication.\n\nSee also: NSA and wildlife group clash over lynx release plans\n\nNatural England should also run its own public consultation exercise before any decision is made, the farmers and \nlandowners said.\n\nIf approved, the trust\u2019s application would see six cats released into the wild as part of a five-year trial \u2013 which, \ndepending on its success, could lead to a wider reintroduction of the lynx in other parts of the UK, such as the \nScottish Highlands.\n\nOn 8 August, the trust said 100% of the landowners approached had given their go-ahead for the trial reintroduction \nof Eurasian lynx to Kielder Forest.\n\nChallenging trust's claims\n\n\u201cIn particular we are challenging the claims made about the public consultation run by the trust in our area and the \nclaimed support,\u201d the Kielder group said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe reject any suggestion that objections only concern potential sheep losses. We strongly object to the \nconsequent abuse generated against our farmers by those who have no knowledge of our area and its \ncommunities.\u201d\n\nThe statement stressed that local ecological restoration projects and agri-environment schemes have strong \nsupport and are greatly valued, and raised concerns about the welfare of any animals released in the \u201cbusy, \nindustrial\u201d Kielder Forest.\n\nThe launch of such a project should be questioned, said the group, considering Paul O\u2019Donaghue, chief scientific \nadviser at the trust, said during a public meeting at Tarset in February 2017 that a lynx population in Kielder could \nnever be truly wild because continuing human intervention would be needed to ensure the renewal of its gene pool.\n\nNo decision made yet\n\nIn response to the Kielder statement, a Defra spokesman said: \u201cAny decision to grant a licence to reintroduce lynx \ninto the wild in England would be based on the potential impacts on affected communities and the wider \nenvironment, and follow international guidelines.\n\n\u201cNo decision has been made and ministers will decide whether to grant a licence after considering advice from \nNatural England.\u201d\n\nOn behalf of the trust, Dr O'Donoghue said: \u201cIt's heart-warming to see the NSA and NFU so concerned for the \nwelfare of Eurasian lynx, though their understanding of the species biology and behaviour leaves a lot to be \ndesired.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritain's agricultural students are our future farmers, advisers, managers and skilled workers \u2013 without their energy \nthe industry would be lost.\n\nAll three of our Ag Student of the Year finalists are brilliantly ambitious, have an unshakeable commitment to \nagriculture and impressed the judges with their smart ideas.\n\nSee also: Meet the 2018 Farmers Weekly Awards finalists\n\nThe 2018 Ag Student of the Year Finalists\n\nLuke Cox\n\nAlex Dunn\n\nEmily Hickman\n\nThe judges\n\nJosh Dowbiggin \u2013 2017 Ag Student of the Year\n\nOli Hill \u2013 Community editor, Farmers Weekly\n\nIan Pigott \u2013 Independent judge, Hertfordshire farmer and Farmers Weekly columnist\n\nLuke Cox\n\nTetbury, Gloucestershire\n\nRather than follow the herd to study at one of Britain\u2019s more obvious agricultural universities, Gloucestershire \nfarmer\u2019s son Luke made a conscious decision to go mainstream.\n\n\n\nThe twenty-two-year old left the family farm to study for a degree in agriculture with industrial training at the \nUniversity of Reading.\n\nHe opted for Reading because he wanted to be in an environment where his peers were from a diverse range of \nbackgrounds with interests beyond his own.\n\nLiving and learning with people outside the farming bubble meant he wasn\u2019t preaching to the converted when he set \nabout banging the drum of British agriculture.\n\nStudent notes\n\nStudied at: University of Reading\n\nCourse: BSc (Hons) Agriculture with Industrial Training\n\nFavourite module: Cereals marketing\n\nAmbition: To gain experience working as a farm trader before returning to help run the family farm\n\nFun fact: Luke loves playing a range of sports and is a qualified football referee and tennis coach\n\nStudies\n\nGraduating with a 2:1, Luke is described by his peers as a highly motivated and extremely proactive member of the \nstudent community.\n\nHe went above and beyond what many would expect to achieve during their time at university, completing \nextracurricular activities to develop his management skills and brush up his CV.\n\nHe has also been an active member of his agricultural society, organising events such as the University of \nReading\u2019s very first Back British Farming day in his final year.\n\nThe idea was to shout about how fantastic British agriculture is and encourage the public to think more about where \ntheir food comes from and how it is produced.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of the issues facing the industry at the moment relate back to public understanding,\u201d says Luke.\n\n\u201cThe university is the best in the UK for agriculture, but I didn\u2019t feel they were doing enough to promote the industry \nto whole student populations.\n\n\u201cI spent the whole of last year working on the concept, applying to the Student Union to get its support.\u201d\n\nThis was no easy task, given a historically fractious relationship with the Student Union after the ag society was \ndisbanded.\n\nThe day took over the campus, capturing the minds of the thousands of students milling around and going some \nway to healing the difficult relationship between the society and the union.\n\nFarm experience\n\nAway from life on campus, Luke has always been keen to gain practical farm experience on other farms before he \nreturns home. He knows how to get the most out of working for other farmers.\n\n\u201cAt harvest, I would actively choose to do different jobs rather than just corn carting all the time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFor example, I took the opportunity to run the grain dryer to gain more experience and develop other skills and \nfocus on my personal development.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile a work placement was not an essential part of this degree course, Luke had always intended to get a year of \nworking in the industry under his belt to help him land a job after graduating.\n\nHis placement with agronomy advice group Frontier saw him make the most of opportunities on the precision \nfarming side of the business, supporting farm traders and assisting in trials work.\n\n\u201cMy initial development of a new grain sampling system using barcodes was probably my biggest impact on the \nbusiness,\u201d he says.\n\nAspirations\n\nLuke\u2019s placement with Frontier proved a good decision \u2013 it helped him bag a full-time role as a trainee farm trader \nstraight after leaving university.\n\nHe is now set on building a career and strong working relationships in this sector, with a view to returning to the \nfamily farm one day to take the reins.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nEnthusiastic about grain marketing and strives to develop his skills and level of understanding\n\nDriven and willing to take risks to get where he wants to go in life\n\nTook it upon himself to try to heal a somewhat fractious relationship between his student union and the society he \nbelonged to for the benefit of his peers\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\"Luke is passionate about arable farming and is pursuing opportunities beyond the gates of his family's farm to build \nhis own skills and experience. He is keen to promote British farming.\"\n\nAlex Dunn\n\nReading, Berkshire\n\nWhile not from a farming family, 21-year-old Alex has been dead set on getting into farming for as long as she can \nrecall. She showed her willingness in her teenage years, helping out on a local mixed livestock smallholding, which \nfostered her love of farming.\n\nFast forward to today and she recently graduated with a first-class degree at the Royal Agricultural University \n(RAU), where she was recognised as a stand-out student.\n\nCurrently working on a dairy farm in New Zealand, Alex has bundles of enthusiasm for the future, with ambitions to \nbecome a dairy farm manager or get into milking goats. She also has plans to tackle agriculture\u2019s poor health and \nsafety record.\n\nStudent notes\n\nStudies at: Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester\n\nCourse: BSc (Hons) Agriculture, fourth year\n\nFavourite module: Entrepreneurship\n\nAmbition: Getting into milking goats on her return to the UK\n\nFun fact: Alex is a qualified open water scuba diver\n\n\n\nStudies\n\nStudying straight agriculture at university, Alex says her favourite element of her degree course was a module \nfocused on entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cIt looked at farm business development \u2013 other ways that farms can make money through diversification and \nbusiness planning,\u201d she says.\n\nAs a student ambassador, she loved promoting the benefits of studying agriculture to young people.\n\nJust as the challenge of having no prior knowledge or experience of farming didn\u2019t stop her from starting out in the \nindustry, Alex has not allowed her severe dyslexia to stunt her impressive progress.\n\nShe dictates to her computer and uses other technologies for tasks such as writing her dissertation, which \ninvestigated the issues that will face UK farmers after Brexit and opportunities for greater collaboration in the future.\n\nHer experiences of working on dairy farms in New Zealand feeds into this piece of work.\n\n\u201cIn New Zealand there is a lot of focus on the business. In the UK we are very individualistic, but there are many \nbenefits of co-operation and collaboration that would raise our productivity,\u201d she says.\n\nFarm experience\n\nDuring her studies Alex worked part-time on a dairy livestock farm in Wiltshire with about 1,500 head of livestock, \nincluding an organic Jersey cross dairy herd. She also has experience of working with sheep and goats.\n\nShe embarked on a five-month trip to New Zealand last year as part of her course placement.\n\n\u201cIt included sightseeing and farm work experience on a dairy goat farm on the North Island and later a cattle dairy \nfarm on the South Island. This was an amazing experience. It would have been easier and cheaper to stay in the \nUK for my placement, but I wanted a challenge and to stretch myself,\u201d she says.\n\nOne issue that she feels strongly about is health and safety. She has developed a prototype smartphone app to \nhelp with staff management and health and safety, and aims to secure funding to develop it.\n\n\u201cPoor health and safety in agriculture is a deep-rooted problem that needs a solution,\u201d she says. \u201cThis app would \nhelp to protect staff and visitors by changing attitudes towards health and safety and promoting best practice.\u201d\n\nAspirations\n\nOnce she is back from working abroad next May, Alex will set her sights on getting into farm management, although \nher ultimate aim is to have her own farming business.\n\n\u201cThis is an industry that is exciting and open to those not from farming backgrounds. I like the quick response to \nactions in dairy and I\u2019m good at reading people, so my short-term goal is to become a dairy farm manager. I would \nalso love to get into milking goats because this is a growing market in the UK,\u201d she says.\n\nThe judges liked\n\nHas actively sought out work on many different farms in the UK and abroad to build up her practical knowledge and \nunderstanding of farming\n\nShows real entrepreneurial flair and is serious about improving agriculture's poor health and safety record\n\nA strong ambassador for British agriculture\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\n\n\"Alex is somebody who turns challenges into opportunities. She is a real grafter, is confident and is selflessly \nworking to improve British agriculture.\"\n\nEmily Hickman\n\nPrestatyn, Denbighshire\n\nEmily isn\u2019t somebody who does things by halves. Her boundless enthusiasm and open-mindedness make her one \nof Britain\u2019s brightest young people in agriculture.\n\nGrowing up in north Wales, her childhood home backs onto fields, with the resident sheep often breaking into her \ngarden. This was an early experience of agriculture and Emily knew it wouldn't be her last.\n\nShe has never let her non-farming background act as a disadvantage to her progression.\n\nStudent notes\n\nStudies at: Harper Adams University\n\nCourse: BSc (Hons) Agriculture\n\nFavourite module: Global agriculture production\n\nAmbition: To work her way up the ladder in the poultry sector\n\nFun fact: Emily set up her own magazine \u2013 People in Ag UK \u2013 to share the stories of people working in agriculture\n\nStudies\n\n\u201cIt was the scientific advances and the opportunity to be a part of something bigger that cemented my interest in \nfarming,\u201d says 23-year-old Emily. \u201cWith constant changes and advances in the world of agriculture, I knew it would \nbe an exciting, dynamic degree to study.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s big on encouraging others to get into this world too, taking time to visit her old secondary school each year to \nget students excited about a career in farming.\n\nEmily says her proudest achievement while at Harper Adams University was being awarded a British Poultry \nCouncil scholarship in her second year, which included a year\u2019s placement with poultry processor Faccenda Foods.\n\nA keen blogger, Emily decided to take things to the next level by launching her own magazine at the start of this \nyear to celebrate the lives of those working in agriculture.\n\nThe thought of juggling the pressures of producing a free quarterly publication with the intense workload of final \nyear studies would make most students wince, but a blend of good time management, late nights and determination \nmade it work. She brands it her biggest success and hopes her readers learn something from the interviewees.\n\nFarm experience\n\nEmily\u2019s first taste of life on the farm was TB testing on a work experience placement with a local vet.\n\n\u201cMy mum had wanted me to be a vet, so for me the biggest challenge was proving there would be career prospects \nfor me once I graduated,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cMum was very much of the opinion that farming was restricted to people with farms, and it took me a while to get \nher to understand that agriculture is about so much more than just farming.\u201d\n\nDespite her lack of experience, she got a job on a dairy farm at the age of 17 and progressed to the parlour, milking \ntwice a day at weekends.\n\n\n\nHer placement year saw Emily organise and run farm trials, carry out a weekly farm and factory rejects report and \nformulate action plans with area managers and vets to reduce reject numbers.\n\n\u201cMy placement year was probably the highlight of my time at Harper Adams. I was able to take myself out of my \ncomfort zone and learn about something completely new for a whole year,\u201d she says.\n\nAspirations\n\nOn the back of her year in industry she has been offered a graduate role at poultry processor Avara Foods.\n\nIn five years she wants to be in a management position at the company, either working as a farm or area manager.\n\n\u201cI would like to work within the poultry industry for a while, but my end goal is to make the switch to agricultural \njournalism full time,\u201d she says. \n\nThe judges liked\n\nHas thrown herself into everything the poultry sector has to offer and built up an impressive knowledge of the sector \nfrom a position of little experience\n\nUnderstands the key flaws in agriculture systems, but has ideas on how things need to change and improve\n\nHas worked hard to create multiple potential careers for herself in the future across several sectors, be it in poultry, \nagricultural journalism or elsewhere\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\u201cEmily is committed to making agriculture more accessible to a non-farming audience. She has shown herself to be \nversatile and adaptable and is totally dedicated without compromise.\u201d\n\nSponsor's message\n\n\"Kubota are proud to sponsor the 2018 Farmers Weekly Ag Student of the year award as it recognises the students \nwho are taking up these challenges and who will bring these key skills and attributes into our industry in the near \nfuture.\"\n\nRob Edwards, business development manager, agriculture for Kubota UK\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA father of three has died after becoming trapped in a baling machine on his Scottish farm.\n\nAllan MacCallum, 46, was on his croft with two of his sons, Sean, 22, and Bradley, 13, when the incident occurred \non Saturday, 18 August, at his property in Tiree, Inner Hebrides.\n\nSean was on the phone in a caravan when he heard shouting and ran out to his father. He tried to open the back \ndoor of the baler but saw oil leaking out, suggesting damage in the mechanism.\n\nSee also: Why accidents in agriculture remain stubbornly high\n\nHe said: \u201cI tried everything I could and eventually I got the strap on the door and I lifted it right out and my father just \ndropped.\u201d\n\nEmergency services were called but Mr MacCallum was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nIn a statement, Sean said he and his brothers Bradley and Darren, 15, were heartbroken.\n\n\n\nA Justgiving page has been set up to show support for Mr MacCallum\u2019s family and so far it has raised more than \n\u00a317,000.\n\nAll funds will be shared between Sean, Darren and Bradley and help towards funeral costs.\n\nInquiries continue\n\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: \u201cInquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident. \nA report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal and the Health and Safety Executive.\u201d\n\nJohn Dickson, NFU Scotland\u2019s regional chairman for Argyll and the Islands, said: \u201cEvery loss of life through a tragic \naccident of this kind has a huge impact, but in a tight-knit island community the feeling of loss goes deeper.\n\n\u201cIt is a sad reminder that farming and crofting is dangerous and it is important that everyone living and working in \nthe countryside take the necessary steps to keep themselves, their family and their staff safe while working.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTomorrow, the first Saturday in September, is the most important day in the farming calendar: it\u2019s time for the \nAlresford Agricultural Show.\n\nOn a gently sloping piece of picture-perfect parkland, 20,000 people from all walks of life will come along to enjoy a \nday out in the Hampshire countryside, mingling with farmers to enjoy a celebration of rural life. It\u2019s like Countryfile \nLive, but with real farming.\n\nBut, for the first time in years, there might be controversy; tucked away in a corner is the cereals competition. A \ncouple of dozen bowls of the very basic farm products from Hampshire\u2019s arable farmers, neatly laid out for the \njudge\u2019s keen eye.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nBut Messrs C H and H E Flindt will not be entering the pulse competition this year.\n\nThis will come as a shock to many, as the Flindts have been cleaning up in the peas \u2019n\u2019 beans category for some \nyears. But this year, we\u2019re not growing peas, and only growing spring beans.\n\nAnd on a damp and humid day in mid-August, too sticky for not-quite-ripe spring barley but perfect for keeping bean \npods from shattering, I got stuck into my Fuego.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much there \u2013 sometimes it was hard to see where I\u2019d actually combined. But the tank slowly filled \nwith what looked like a bright and even sample. I could see another \u2018Alresford Show \u2013 First Prize\u2019 certificate \nheading for the office wall.\n\nBad beans\n\nBut when it came to unloading, I donned my glasses for a closer inspection as the beans slid away from the cab\u2019s \nrear window. Every single one had a neat little hole in it. Not the usual one or two that make you wonder if they\u2019ll go \nfor human consumption; it was the lot.\n\nMr and Mrs Bruchid Beetle and 20 billion of their closest chums had obviously moved into Roe Hill field and made \nmerry since the last application of insecticide.\n\nIt was as even and regular as the sloes my father would spend three hours individually hand pricking in the autumn \n\u2013 and then, utterly predictably, put his back out as he stood up too sharply.\n\nTod the agronomist and band leader of the Thomas Lord Old Gits was in the band\u2019s rehearsal room in one of our \nsheds, checking out a new amp he\u2019d bought for the band to use at our gig at the Alresford Show.\n\n\n\nI rang him and asked for his thoughts. We could have done no more agronomically, he said. It has just been one of \nthose years.\n\nCentre stage\n\nI was happy to take his word for it; I know the square root of diddly squat about agronomy, and earlier that day I\u2019d \nheard of one farmer discing in his crop, rather than waste money combining it.\n\nFilling one-and-a-half 10-tonne trailers off 22 acres meant we were one step ahead of that, at least, even if the \ninspection for human consumption grade will be one of the shortest on record.\n\nSo a new name will be on the virtual cups in the pulses category of those much-coveted Alresford Show prizes. And \nafter the Flindts\u2019 recent successes, it will be good to have a change.\n\nOf course this will be of no consolation to me, the keyboard player of the Thomas Lord Old Gits, hunched over my \nRoland piano on stand B52 (how very apt), as we bang out three hours of hits from the 1960s right up to the \npresent day \u2013 assuming Tod\u2019s new amp works, of course.\n\nRumour has it we\u2019re working on a new song: I\u2019ve Got Them Holey Bean Blues. Perhaps we should change our \nname \u2013 to the Bruchid Beatles.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrain prices have come under pressure for a second week but tight UK and world supplies mean there is a limit to \nhow far they can fall.\n\nHarvest pressure and higher than expected UK grain import figures for June brought wheat prices down last week.\n\nDisappointing US export figures pushed Chicago futures down and other markets followed. EU export volumes are \nalso way behind those of last year.\n\nHowever, a mix of factors means the market is volatile. On the positive side, the further weakening of the pound on \nhard Brexit speculation has made UK exports competitive into northern continental Europe and to Ireland, limiting \nthe damage for sellers.\n\nSee also Business Clinic: How can options help me cut grain price risk?\n\nSeptember ex-farm values averaged \u00a3169.65/t as Farmers Weekly went to press on Wednesday (29 August), down \nby about \u00a32.50/t on the end of the previous week.\n\nThe global grain outlook predicts lower output for the second year , with consumption rising to an all-time high, so \nend of year stock levels will fall significantly.\n\nLocal factors\n\nHowever, more local factors may move the market to a greater degree in the short term.\n\nSpeculation about the closure of at least one of the two north-eastern bioethanol plants for maintenance has added \nto market volatility, though neither operator will confirm its plans.  \n\nEuropean crop size estimates continue to reduce, with the latest International Grains Council (IGC) report (23 \nAugust) estimating  the size of the EU grain crop lower by 9m tonnes compared with its previous report and 6.7% \nlower than last year.\n\nAdditionally, the EU\u2019s monthly Mars crop monitoring service this week cut its forecast for the EU\u2019s 2018 grain maize \nyield to 7.57t/ha (7.64t last month). The soft wheat yield estimate was cut to 5.70t/ha (5.82t last month).\n\n\n\nThe German farmers union DBV has once again reduced its expectations for the country\u2019s wheat harvest, putting it \nat about 18.6m tonnes, down 22.8% on 2017 and the lowest crop since 1993. Total German grain production is \nestimated by DBV at 35.6m tonnes, a 26% cut overall compared with 2017.\n\nDepending on the size and quality of the UK crop, the reduced German supply may raise questions over the origin \nof UK wheat imports in 2018/19, said the AHDB.\n\nGlobal maize outlook\n\nThe outlook for global maize production, which competes with wheat in many markets, has improved but the market \nstill looks tight because of rising consumption.\n\nFurther nervousness was added recently with speculation that low grain stocks and poor milling quality in the \nRussian wheat crop would lead to export restrictions.\n\nSubsequently the Russian Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that it was not imposing export restrictions, bringing \nprices back down.\n\nHowever, market nerves were jangled by the addition of the rider \u201cfor now\u201d to that announcement. Many traders \nthink that Russia cannot sustain its current export rate.\n\nGrain market factors push market both ways\n\nWorld grain output down for second year running at 2,063m tonnes (IGC) 1% down

cream but are legally allowed to call \nthemselves ice cream, according to a Which? investigation.\n\nThe consumer watchdog reported that of the 24 brands surveyed, including Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Walls and H\u00e4agen-Dazs, \nnine contained no fresh milk and 10 had no cream.\n\nSee also: Essentials for marketing the farm\u2019s ice cream\n\nIn total, seven ice creams from Asda, Ms Molly\u2019s, Wall\u2019s, Carte D\u2019Or and two different products from both Tesco and \nMorrisons used neither fresh milk nor cream.\n\n\n\nThirteen of the products surveyed contained both dairy ingredients (see table below).\n\nH\u00e4agen-Dazs vanilla contained the highest level of dairy products with 39% fresh cream, condensed skimmed milk, \nsugar, egg yolk and vanilla extract.\n\nWhat can be called 'Ice Cream'\n\nProducts labelled as \u2018dairy ice cream\u2019 must contain at least 5% milk fat, some protein from a dairy source and no \nvegetable fats.\n\nHowever, there are no such regulations for a product to be labelled as \u2018ice cream\u2019.\n\nThis means vegan products as well as those using cheaper products such as palm kernel oil, vegetable fats or \ncoconut oil, can use the ice cream label.\n\nIn many cases, fresh milk is substituted with reconstituted skimmed milk powder as well as water or buttermilk \npowder in the case of Tesco\u2019s vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe rules changed in 2015 with the introduction of the Food Information Regulations, before which products had to \ncontain at least 5% dairy fat and 2.5% milk protein to be defined as ice cream.\n\nThe lack of fresh dairy products highlights the scale of the opportunity for UK milk to offset cheaper products if there \nis a consumer demand for higher quality British ice cream.\n\nThe UK was the world\u2019s second-largest importer of ice cream in value terms in 2016, buying in \u00a3235m worth of the \nproduct \u2013 equal to a quarter of total world imports, second only to Germany which imported \u00a3241m, according \nto research from IndexBox.\n\nIn contrast, the UK was only the seventh-largest exporter of ice cream, shipping just \u00a3106m in 2016 giving the UK a \nnet deficit on ice cream of almost 230%.\n\nThe NFU launched a campaign to promote dairy farmers direct selling real British ice cream this summer called \n\u2018From Cone to Cow\u2019.\n\nConsumers can find out where to source authentic British dairy ice cream from the NFU\u2019s interactive map which \ncurrently lists more than 60 suppliers.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSpring hand-roguing of blackgrass is

and the farm\u2019s combination of cultural and chemical control are reducing blackgrass numbers each \nyear, although there are limitations on the use of glyphosate as a seed producer.\n\n\nAgronomist Graham Chester works closely with the Smithsons and advises that early control from stacked \nherbicide chemistry is vital to give good blackgrass control for autumn-sown crops.\n\nBlackgrass helicopter\n\nMrs Smithson\u2019s husband flies over the crops in a friend\u2019s helicopter to assess the weed burden and estimates the \narea that is infested and so prepares for roguing in the spring.\n\n\u201cBetween May-July this year I spent almost 200 hours roguing, achieving virtually total blackgrass elimination, with \nmost samples coming back totally clear of all weed infestation,\u201d Mrs Smithson adds.\n\nShe hopes that this hard work and determination will have a positive effect on head counts next year and sees this \nroguing policy as key, especially if regulations tighten on the use of glyphosate in the future.\n\nIn one 14ha field, last year\u2019s roguing saw the blackgrass-contaminated area fall from 3ha to 0.8ha, and Mrs \nSmithson says the reward is looking over clean crops and realising the weed burden is depleting each year.\n\nThe positive feedback the family team receive from neighbours and seed merchants gives them confidence that \ntheir hard work is paying off as they strive for total blackgrass elimination on the farm.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWet changeable weather is frustrating harvest efforts in Scotland not helped by problems with spring barley not \nthreshing easily from the awns.\n\nAreas of spring barley, winter wheat and spring oats are still to cut north of the border, with more reports of grains \nsprouting in the ear following the weekend rain.  \n\nScotland\n\nStarting in the North, spring barley harvest is 80% finished with reports of low to average yields, said Simon Barry, \nchief executive at Highland Grain.\n\nQuality has been reasonable, but maltsters have widened their nitrogen specification after concerns crop quality \nmay fall short of targets.\n\nSee also: The 5 top-yielding winter wheat varieties in your region\n\nAlthough most were managing to meet these new contract criteria, there were big problems with separating the awn \nfrom the seed, making handling more difficult, said Mr Barry\n\n\u201cWith the dry weather, the crops have raced through their growth stages and the seed hasn\u2019t broken off when \ncombining \u2013 it\u2019s a problem all over Scotland.\u201d\n\nHarvest progress\n\nSpring barley 80% finished in the North\n\nBig problems separating awns from spring barley seed\n\nWheat sprouting in Northumberland\n\nWoldGrain in Lincs waiting for the last 3,000t of wheat and spring barley\n\nScottish Borders\n\nFurther south, the unsettled weather has slowed harvest for contractor Stuart Fuller-Shapcott, but he was in the last \nfield of spring barley before heading into wheat and spring oats. \n\n\n\nHe has cut a small amount of wheat on lighter ground which averaged 6t/ha. \u201cIt had really died on its feet, but \nactually the yield was surprisingly good,\u201d said Mr Fuller-Shapcott. Elsewhere, on stronger ground, it has averaged \n9t/ha.\n\nHowever, he has concerns over the further 60ha left to cut as it has started to sprout.\n\n\u201cSpring barley was a miracle this year \u2013 very late planted after the Beast from the East and in a matter of weeks it \nwas baked in the sun,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 60ha of Concerto came in at 15-16% moisture, yielded 6t/ha and had 1.6% nitrogen.\n\n\u201cI was expecting pinched grains and low yields, but it\u2019s not been as bad as I thought.\u201d\n\nNorthumberland\n\nNear Morpeth, harvest was nearly over with just 6ha of spring barley left to cut for Glen Sanderson at Eshott South \nFarm, after a successful wheat, oilseed rape and winter barley harvest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just finishing Laureate which is very pleasing although the nitrogen is a bit high,\u201d he said. Yields have \nreached 7.5t/ha so far. \n\n\u201cWe thought the spring barley was going to suffer, but it was a delight to combine.\u201d\n\nThe Skyfall and Grafton wheat averaged 9.9t/ha. \u201cThe wheat was definitely better than normal.\u201d\n\nThe Alizze oilseed rape was particularly successful for Mr Sanderson this year at 5t/ha. \u201cIt\u2019s been the best oilseed \nrape harvest in 48 years,\u201d he said.\n\nLincolnshire\n\nIn Lincolnshire, WoldGrain was waiting for the last 3,000t of wheat and spring barley to come in, according to Dan \nMurphy, laboratory and haulage manager\n\nSimilar to other regions, quality has been good, but with mixed yields. \u201cSome have reported above average yields \non heavy land and others have had poor yields,\u201d he said.\n\nAnecdotally, pulse yields are down although the firm hadn\u2019t seen any samples yet. \n\nThe firm had seen problems with red seeds early on in oilseed rape. \u201cThe red seeds were not immature, inside the \nseeds they were normal yellow \u2013 they just had a red coating,\u201d added Mr Murphy.\n\nSomerset\n\nDown in Somerset the bulk of harvest is over, with wheat yields closer to 8.6t/ha rather than the 9.8t/ha achieved \nlast year, said John Collins, store manager at Cannington Grain.\n\nQuality wise, there are good specific weights and the crops have been coming in dry so there arn't any problems \nwith moisture, he added.\n\nHowever, logistics have been a problem for some stores due to so many crops arriving at once.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA simplified and less costly form of arbitration is available to help landlords and tenants resolve rent negotiation \nissues.\n\nTenants have recently been advised by the Tenant Farmers\u2019 Association (TFA) to serve notice so their rents can be \nreviewed next year once more is known about the implications of Brexit for farm finances.\n\n\n\nFearing they will end up with higher rents or locked in costly arbitration proceedings, tenants are usually reticent \nabout triggering the rent review process.\n\nSee also: How to manage a farm succession handover\n\nArbitration involves both parties submitting evidence about the productive capacity of the farm, with an independent \nprofessional nominated by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) ruling on what the final amount should \nbe.\n\nHowever, it is often extremely time-consuming and costly, with both parties often requiring the services of land \nagents and other professionals to compile supporting documents.\n\nThis means the cost of the dispute can often exceed the amount the two parties are disputing, according to Calum \nGillhespy, chartered surveyor with GSC Grays.\n\nAlthough only a small proportion of rent reviews end up in arbitration, it can be devastating for those involved, not \nonly due to the financial cost but because it often causes a severe breakdown in the relationship between tenant \nand landlord.\n\nSimplified Arbitration Service\n\nHow it works\n\nLimits arbitration process cost to \u00a33,000 plus VAT\n\nCosts shared equally between both sides\n\nDecision within 10 days of final meeting\n\nRelies on some goodwill existing and likely to be most successful in dealing with technical points\n\nMr Gillhespy says the Simplified Arbitration Service, a process launched by RICS in 2016, offers a quicker and less \ncostly alternative for disputes, particularly over smaller amounts of money.\n\nThis is where both parties agree to a RICS-nominated independent expert taking a maximum of three days to \nconsider skeleton arguments from both parties and undertaking a site visit.\n\nThe expert then is obligated to report back within 10 working days following the meetings, unless both parties agree \notherwise.\n\nThe streamlined system means costs are capped at \u00a33,000 (plus VAT) and the bill is shared equally by both \nparties.\n\nTFA chief executive George Dunn said the organisation supported an increased number of disputes being resolved \nusing this process.\n\nHowever, he warned it was only likely to succeed where a measure of goodwill still existed between the parties and \nthey were only at deadlock over technical points.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe four-model Jaguar 800 range now has a new model in the form of the flagship 880, which has the same power \nas the larger Jaguar 960, but in a compact and cheaper guise.  \n\nDetails are sketchy at the moment, but it will run the same 15.6-litre Mercedes lump as its smaller siblings and

Farmers Weekly) from \naccessing the Canbus system on its latest-generation Lexion combines.\n\nAlthough the company states that it is pleased to see more terminals coming onto the market to open up the \ncommunication channels, the firm prefers to direct its customers through the 365FarmNet data platform, of which it \nis a major shareholder.\n\nThis means that an \"unlock\" code \u2013 costing \u00a31,500 \u2013 is no longer available for 2018 Claas Lexion models in \nEurope, which would have previously allowed access for external companies to transfer yield and other data.

With Brexit on the \nhorizon, the export growth is interesting, said Mr Gooderham.\n\n\u201cThat suggests that buyers are either confident a deal will be done, or are just buying short-term at the moment,\u201d he \nsaid.\n\n\u201cBut Brexit continues to be a risk to the continual growth in our exports in the future.\u201d\n\nIn value terms, exports in the first half of 2018 were worth \u00a3320m, up 12% on the same period in 2017, but down \n2% on the second half of 2017.\n\nThis is mainly due to a drop in average prices.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA no-deal Brexit would ruin livelihoods \u2013 and wipe out British organic farming businesses, industry leaders have \nwarned.\n\nWithout a deal, organic food exports to the EU will only be allowed once certified by a \u201cUK control body\u201d recognised \nand approved by Brussels, according the British government.\n\nBut UK bodies overseeing the organic sector are not allowed to apply for EU recognition and approval until after the \nUK leaves the trade bloc on 29 March 2019.\n\nSee also: Budget for Brexit in a brave new world of lower subsidies\n\n\u201cApproval can take up to nine months so we are exploring alternative approaches that should speed up this \nprocess,\u201d says a no-deal Brexit document from Defra.\n\nOrganic farming is just one sector covered by 25 no-deal Brexit advice papers published by the government on \nThursday (23 August).\n\nOther no-deal advice papers relating to agriculture include documents on farm payments, rural development and \ndeveloping genetically modified organisms.\n\nThe government already guaranteed farm support until the end of the current parliament, even if the UK leaves the \nEU without a deal \u2013 although the form it will take is expected to change.\n\n'Cliff-edge scenario'\n\nEstimates suggest about 10% of the UK\u2019s organic output, worth some \u00a32.2bn in 2017, is exported \u2013 predominantly \nto EU countries.\n\nNFU president Minette Batters said a cliff-edge scenario would be disastrous for farm businesses, the economy and \nsociety if applied across the wider UK food supply chain.\n\n\u201cWhile these notices are an essential part of government\u2019s plans for preparing for all outcomes, they serve as a \nsobering reminder of what is at stake for farmers in the event of a no deal.\n\n\n\nMs Batters added: \u201cThe technical notice for organic farming is a warning for us on the future of trade of all agri-food \nproducts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all these products were subjected to the same problems in approvals and certification then this could result in \neffectively a trade embargo on exports to the EU.\n\n\u201cNot only would this be hugely disruptive but it threatens livelihoods and businesses in the UK.\u201d\n\n'Worst possible scenario'\n\nThe Soil Association (SA), which is the UK's biggest organic certification body, said a no-deal Brexit was the \u201cworst \npossible\u201d scenario.\n\nSA head of standards Chris Atkinson said: \u201cFrictionless trade with the EU is critically important for the food and \nfarming sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vitally important the UK remains in the customs union and stays aligned with EU standards on food and \nenvironment as a minimum.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit is the worst possible scenario.\u201d\n\nMr Atkinson said the government documents offered no further clarity and provided \u201cneither reassurance nor \nadvice\u201d on how to prepare for a potential no-deal scenario.\n\n'Every eventuality'\n\nHe added: \u201cThey confirm the scale of the challenge we face and the vital importance the UK achieves a workable \ndeal with the EU.\u201d\n\nBrexit secretary Dominic Raab said he was confident the government would secure a good deal \u2013 but it was \nimportant the government planned for every eventuality.\n\nIn a speech to launch the advice papers, he said: \u201cI am still confident that getting a good deal is \u2013 by far \u2013 the most \nlikely outcome.\u201d\n\nDefra said it was expecting to negotiate an equivalency arrangement with the EU which would allow the free \nmovement of organic goods between the EU and the UK.\n\nIt said it would ask Brussels to discuss these applications in advance of 29 March 2019.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\u201cSo, Mr Smith,\u201d asked the news reporter live on national TV. \u201cHow do you respond to the news that it\u2019s been proven \nto a jury in California that glyphosate causes cancer?\u201d\n\nI was tempted to respond somewhat flippantly along the lines of: \u201cIn much the same way I reacted when a \nCalifornian jury found OJ Simpson not guilty of murder\u201d.\n\nSee also: The glyphosate debate explained\n\nBut, instead, I calmly reminded the broadcaster that just last year the toxicity and carcinogenicity of glyphosate had \nbeen reviewed thoroughly by the scientific experts that sit on the appropriate authorities in Europe and been given a \nclean bill of health.\n\nFor me, the analysis of the eminent scientists who sit on these agencies holds far more sway than the opinion of a \nrandomly chosen, dozen folk whose sole qualification for the task they were given as a jury was that they were \ncitizens of San Francisco.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s been clear to me for some while that the ongoing campaign to get glyphosate banned isn\u2019t really about \nscience at all, but rather it\u2019s about an ideological hatred of GM technology and a politicised dislike of large-scale \ncorporations.\n\nAs a farmer, when it comes to glyphosate, it is irrelevant to me who makes the stuff, or how it\u2019s used elsewhere in \nthe world for the growing of GM crops. I just want to carry on using glyphosate because I\u2019m satisfied it is safe and it \nhelps me grow crops more efficiently and in a sustainable manner.\n\nIf glyphosate was brewed in cauldrons by little old ladies on Cornish cliffs operating as autonomous collectives, then \nI\u2019d happily still buy it, as long as it remained cost efficient, safe and effective to use.\n\nFurthermore, I don\u2019t positively prefer to deal with corporations over individuals or other legal entities, but at the \nsame time I have no prejudice against them either.\n\nA radical dislike of corporations makes little sense to me. It reminds me of a debate I had in a pub about GM crops \nmany years ago with a couple of trendy alternative \u201clifestylers\u201d.\n\nThey summed up their views by basically saying they simply didn\u2019t trust large American corporations and therefore \ndidn\u2019t trust their products. Throughout the conversation, on the bar in front of one of them was a packet of Marlboro \ncigarettes.\n\nConversely, I don\u2019t buy into the idea that the smaller, less corporate the outfit then the more honest it is to deal with.\n\nI remember many years ago a gang of thick-set looking individuals arrived in our farmyard in an unmarked tipper \ntruck offering to tarmac one of our farm tracks for, what seemed to me, to be an excellent price. Then my father \nappeared from somewhere to tell this gang in no uncertain terms to get out of his farmyard.\n\nWhen they were gone, Dad explained I should never, ever deal with people who didn\u2019t have a registered office at a \npermanent address. His main reasoning was that such outfits operated as if they weren\u2019t accountable to any laws \nand, as such, they were not to be trusted.\n\nOn reflection you could say such types are the least corporate of anybody you could come across. More fool \nanyone who thinks that makes them good people to deal with.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLast month the Welsh government launched perhaps its most important consultation paper since devolution \u2013 Brexit \nand our Land: Securing the Future of Welsh Farming. Having now read through it several times, I'm cautiously \noptimistic.\n\nYes, it's a bit long-winded, but show me a political document that isn't and I'll introduce you to a farmer that never \ncomplains about the weather.\n\nSee also: Welsh farmers face end to direct payments by 2025\n\nFirstly, there's the title, which, unlike the airy-fairy Health and Harmony, which came out from Defra earlier this year, \ndoes exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nIt's a practical paper that takes extremely seriously the impact that Brexit will have on Welsh agriculture and those \nof us involved.\n\nIt also makes proposals as to how we can not only keep farmers on the land, but also increase productivity and \nsignificantly improve our businesses to keep apace with world competition.\n\nTake a drive through vast swathes of our country and there isn't much else there apart from agriculture.\n\n\n\nThe paper goes to great lengths to acknowledge the multi-faceted role that farmers in Wales play, not only as food \nproducers but also as shapers of our unique landscape and social anchors of rural communities.\n\nThe Welsh government is to begin the five-year transition away from the Basic Payments Scheme in 2020, towards \ntwo new overarching schemes.\n\nThe first, the Economic Resilience Scheme, will provide targeted investment to farmers to support food production. \nThe second, the Public Goods Scheme, will financially reward farmers for the environmental and public goods that \nwe already provide.\n\nWelsh agriculture goes hand-in-hand with tourism, with our world-famous landscape attracting visitors from all over \nthe globe, and farmers have a vitally important part to play in building a bigger and better than ever before \u201cBrand \nWales\u201d.\n\nHowever, perhaps what I'm most pleased about is the acknowledgement of the ridiculous amount of red tape we \nface as farmers with existing government schemes.\n\nSpeaking to our rural affairs secretary, Lesley Griffiths, last week, she clearly stated that if they can't reform the \ncurrent regulatory burden for the new system, they will have failed. Whether they can do this remains to be seen. \nIt's a sizeable challenge, but we can certainly all get behind the idea.\n\nThe consultation lasts for 16 weeks, with a welcome understanding that this time of year is incredibly busy for \nfarmers. I would urge each and every one of you involved in Welsh agriculture that may be reading this to respond \nindividually to the paper if you can.\n\nIf you don't agree with any of the proposals, tell them, because they want to know. Similarly, if you have better \nideas as to how the new system could work, or are concerned about the lack of volatility measures in the paper, put \nit in your response.\n\nWales has a vibrant and greatly diverse agricultural sector, and with the right government support system in place, \nwe could be world leaders.\n\nWhether you voted for Brexit or not doesn't matter any more. It's happening and we now have a chance to help \nshape a better future for the next generation of Welsh farmers. It's absolutely vital that we make our collective \nvoices heard.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe sheep sector looks to be moving closer to a \"big win\" on carcass classification and price reporting rules in \nEngland, which will help farmers make more informed marketing decisions, according to the NFU.\n\nDefra recently closed a 12-week consultation on introducing a mandatory standard carcass classification and price \nreporting system for sheep in England, to improve fairness and price transparency in the supply chain.\n\nIf the proposals are given the green light, they will improve transparency about how much farmers are paid and \nallow a meaningful comparison between different market outlets.\n\nSee also: Farming union calls for sheep processor code\n\nAt present, this is difficult because companies typically work to their own dressing specification, with some, for \nexample, paying a higher headline price but trimming the carcass harder.\n\nRichard Findlay, NFU livestock board chairman, said he was optimistic that changes were on the way.\n\nThe consultation was a very positive step forward on an issue the NFU had been lobbying on for a long time.\n\n\u201cSpeaking with industry and government on this, it feels like we are now overall in a similar place,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news that Defra are consulting and proactively addressing the transparency issues within the sheep \nsector.\u201d\n\nSingle dressing specification\n\nThe consultation proposes a single dressing specification as well as a requirement to pay to the nearest 100g in \nweight rather than, as happens with some processors, rounding down to the nearest 500g.\n\nThe NFU points out that multiple dressing specifications can cause confusion and misunderstandings and, \nassuming a base price of \u00a34/kg dw, rounding down to the nearest 500g equates on average to \u00a31 per lamb sold.\n\nIn its official response to the government, the NFU said it saw the consultation as a \u201cmajor step in enhancing a \nmore productive, market-focused sheep industry that realises a fair return from an open and transparent \nmarketplace.\u201d\n\nImproving the clarity and transparency of information supplied to producers would help to drive productivity, \nprofitability and product quality.\n\nThe NFU also said it supported the proposed change to the EUROP grid system which would see an additional 'S' \n(superior) confirmation class added for double-muscled carcass types.\n\nHowever, it added that the industry would need 12 months to adapt to any changes so its introduction should be \ndone over a transitional period.\n\nPrice reporting\n\nOn the issue of price reporting, the union agreed with the government\u2019s proposal to make it mandatory for abattoirs \nto report prices to AHDB on a weekly basis \u2013 although it said this should be the case across the industry.\n\nIt has also called for the details of all slaughter charges to be publicly available on each processor\u2019s website, along \nwith details of any other possible price alterations such as farm assurance or breed-specific deductions or \npremiums.\n\n\u2018We want to make sure that any charges that affect the overall value of the carcass are fair and equitable,\u201d Mr \nFindlay said.\n\n\u201cWe want to see it all in the open so the farmer can make the most informed decision they can about where\u2019s best \nand most suitable to send their stock to.\u201d\n\nWales is currently consulting on similar proposals and a consultation in Scotland has already concluded, opening \nthe way for consistency between the devolved regions.\n\nMeat processors say devil in the detail\n\nNick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), which represents many UK abattoirs \nand other businesses in the meat supply chain said that industry is broadly supportive of the proposed changes, \nincluding paying to the nearest 100g of weight.\n\nHe said standardising weight and specification data would be possible providing it could be done without making \nstructural changes to mechanised production lines, some of which are operating at speeds of up to 600 animals per \nhour.\n\nInstead, the BMPA is proposing the industry work with the AHDB to come up with a formula which would \nstandardise the comparison of carcasses accurately between different companies regardless of when offal, such as \nkidney fat, was removed.\n\n\n\nHowever, Mr Allen warned that requiring more abattoirs to classify according to the grid would increase costs as \nthey would need a person trained in classification present on the slaughter line at all times.\n\nThis in practice would mean at least two members of staff would require training in order to provide cover for each \nother during holidays and sickness.\n\nThe consultation document proposes an exemption to mandatory classification for abattoirs slaughtering less than \n1,000 sheep each week.\n\nThis would cover around 90% of the annual deadweight throughput in England.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNew models and additional variants have extended the choice of pickup trucks for farm and leisure use, as you can \nsee in our full Pickup buyers guide (PDF).\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz X-Class is a new range included in our guide for the first time, aimed mainly at folk wanting a \nhigh-spec lifestyle vehicle but which can also do a good day\u2019s work on- and off-road if needs be \u2013 as illustrated by \nthe plastic flooring of the base Pure model.\n\nTech features include electronic stability, lane keeping, traffic sign recognition and autonomous braking as \nstandard, with trailer stability an option.\n\nSee also: Mercedes adds V6 option to X-Class pickup\n\nThere is a choice of two power outputs from the 2.3-litre four-cylinder engine and a livelier 258hp from a 3-litre V6 \ncoupled to MB\u2019s seven-speed auto 7G-Tronic transmission with lock-up in all gears to bolster power efficiency.\n\nSsangYong\u2019s next-generation Musso also makes an appearance, with new bodywork, a slightly longer wheelbase \nand the ability to tow up to 3,500kg while carrying a little over a tonne in its cargo box.\n\nThe 2.2-litre engine has a touch more power and torque and, as with the outgoing model, there is a choice of six-\nspeed manual or auto transmissions with low and high ranges.\n\nVolkswagen has extended its Amarok range with a manual six-speed gearbox option for the Trendline spec.\n\nIt\u2019s available with a more modest 163hp version of the 3-litre V6 diesel, along with the 204hp version that can also \nbe had with VW\u2019s eight-speed auto.\n\nAt the other end of the performance scale, a 258hp variant has been introduced to the Highline package, which \nadds leather, heated front seats, parking sensors and a rear camera to the base spec.\n\nThe new Cross specification for Fiat\u2019s Fullback adds a combination of style and substance in its \"rugged\" colour \nscheme and the practical benefits of a locking rear differential, bed liner and rear parking sensors as part of the \nstandard package.\n\nOff-road specialist Arctic Trucks has obviously impressed both Isuzu and Nissan because both offer more muscular \nlooking variants of their

improvements to land, such as ditches, \ndrainage, removal of stones and other obstacles to cultivation; field boundaries; access improvements; and \nprovision of services should also be included.\n\n\u201cIt is better to include too much rather than too little, as there will be no second chances if any improvements are \nmissed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe STFA is also stressing to tenants that the amnesty has the backing of the whole of the industry, so no tenant \nshould feel nervous about approaching their landlord on the matter.\n\nThe process was meant to be \u201cco-operative and consensual\u201d between both parties, it said.\n\nAmnesty procedure\n\nThe amnesty notice must set out the details of the improvement and why it is fair and equitable for compensation to \nbe payable at termination of the tenancy, even though the correct procedure may not have been followed at the \ntime the improvement was made.\n\nHowever, the amnesty will not apply where the landlord objected to the original improvement notice or the \nimprovement was carried out in a manner significantly different from the original notice.\n\nAlthough it is the tenant\u2019s responsibility to initiate the amnesty discussion, thereafter landlords and tenants should \njointly prepare an agreed list of improvements and both parties should assemble and be prepared to share relevant \ndocuments and other evidence.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe British sheep industry has reacted angrily to allegations of animal cruelty on 25 farms across England, saying \nabuse of livestock will not be tolerated.\n\nSheep farmers have been at pains to point out that undercover footage, which appeared to show shearing \ncontractors abusing sheep, was not representative of the industry. \n\nIn a video, released by animal rights group Peta Asia, contractors are seen punching sheep in the face, stamping \non them and standing on their heads and necks.\n\nShearers were also filmed jabbing animals in the face with electric clippers, swearing at and beating sheep. Other \nsheep had their heads slammed into wooden floors.\n\nOne worker was filmed dragging two injured sheep who were unable to walk into a shed, where they were left and \neventually died.\n\nMore sheep died during shearing from possible shock from the rough handling, or what one farmer called a \u201cheart \nattack\u201d at a farm near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\n\nAn eyewitness also documented that shearers from two contractors touring 25 farms made large, bloody wounds on \nthe sheep\u2019s bodies from fast, rough shearing and the workers stitched gaping wounds up with a needle and thread \nwithout administering any pain relief.\n\nAccording to Donald Maurice Broom, professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, sewing up a \ncut without any anaesthesia is contrary to the recommendations for legal practice by the World Organisation for \nAnimal Health, and other international bodies.\n\nIn a joint statement, British Wool, the NFU, National Sheep Association, National Association of Agricultural \nContractors, and Farmers\u2019 Union of Wales said: \u201cHaving not had access to the footage taken by Peta we are unable \nto comment on this specific claim.\n\n\"However, farmers and contractors in the sheep industry take animal welfare very seriously and any behaviour that \nis found to fall below that standard is not tolerated.\u201d\n\nRSPCA contacted\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Peta Asia said all the footage recorded concerned two sheep shearing contractors who were \nworking on farms in five counties \u2013 Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Suffolk, Essex and Northumberland \u2013 between \nMay and June this year,\n\nPeta Asia has filed a 15-page complaint with the RSPCA and asked it to launch an investigation and, if appropriate, \nfile criminal charges against the workers for alleged violations of laws prohibiting cruelty to animals.\n\nAndrew Butler, of Peta Asia, told Channel 4 News: \u201cI think really the whole industry needs to be held to account \nhere.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is workers who are paid piece work.

In Germany, the law states that produce from non-stun slaughter cannot be exported.\n\n'No compromise'\n\nBVA president John Fishwick said: \u201cWe welcome new trade deals that demonstrate the quality of UK agriculture, \nbut we absolutely must not compromise on animal welfare. Animals slaughtered without stunning suffer \nunnecessary pain at the time of death.\n\n\u201cIf non-stun slaughter is permitted under the derogation in the UK it should only be available for local communities \nand not for export.\u201d\n\nThe BVA has raised these issues directly with Defra secretary Michael Gove, and asked for clarity on whether meat \nfor export is stunned in accordance with the UK\u2019s high animal welfare legislation.\n\n\u201cBVA is calling for an end to all non-stun slaughter, but while it is still permitted we would like to see new laws to \nban export of non-stun meat such as those in Germany,\u201d added Mr Fishwick.\n\nThe only UK scheme approved by the Riyadh-based Gulf Accreditation Centre to certify the exported meat is the \nHalal Monitoring Committee UK, which does not accept stunning.\n\nStandards 'won't be watered down'\n\nA Defra spokesperson told Farmers Weekly: \u201cEarlier this year, the government announced it had reached an \nagreement with Saudi Arabia to lift the 20-year ban on lamb exports, which was introduced after the BSE crisis.\n\n\u201cWhilst there are currently no restrictions on exporting non-stun meat, all slaughter \u2013 whether stun or non-stun \u2013 \nmust strictly comply with EU and UK rules on animal welfare.\n\nmailto:SainsburysAsda@cma.gov.uk\n\n\n\u201cWe have been clear these standards will not be watered down as we leave the EU.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOur What\u2019s in Your Shed series heads to a 240ha farm bordering the Lincolnshire Wash for a chat about the \nparticulars of Dean Bowd\u2019s machinery list and why he has an unwavering love for one particular brand.\n\nWe visited the family as they had just started to lift and grade daffodil bulbs, where they revealed a problematic \ntractor in the fleet that is due for the chop this year and what may replace it.\n\nWe also get the lowdown on why Mr Bowd has some rather unwanted competition for the job of combine driver.\n\nAre you brand-loyal?\n\nMassey Ferguson through and through, and have been since the early Massey TVO was introduced in the late \n1940s.\n\nI\u2019m the third generation Bowd and, since my grandfather rented the farm from Lincolnshire Council in 1942, red has \nbeen the only colour of tractor \u2013 even our ride-on lawnmower is an MF.\n\nFavourite dealer?\n\nOur local dealer is Chandlers, which supplies all of our Massey kit plus most of our cultivation machines.\n\nIt was formally Boston Tractors and sold machinery to my grandfather, so the guys have got to know us all well over \nthe years and tend to give me some stick when I go in there.\n\nThe only other dealer we use is David Harrison Handling for our potato bagging equipment.\n\nSee also: Take a trip around the UK with our What's in Your Shed? map\n\nFavourite piece of kit?\n\nOur brace of MF 6480s are particular stand-out tractors \u2013 everyone loves to drive them and they are bomb-proof. \nI\u2019m not quite sure what we will do when they come up for replacement as I reckon MF made an error when it \nstopped building them.\n\nFarm facts\n\nBowd Farming Company Ltd, Holbeach Marsh, Lincolnshire\n\nFarmed area - 240ha tenanted Crown Estate land\n\nCrops\n\nWinter wheat 95ha\n\nWinter barley 42ha\n\nSugar beet 25ha\n\nPotatoes 42ha\n\nDaffodil bulbs 10ha\n\nPeas 26ha\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nDean Bowd, Debbie Bowd, James Bowd, Peter Bowd and Mrs Bowd Senior\n\nLeast favourite piece of kit?\n\nThat\u2019s an easy one \u2013 the 2013 Massey Ferguson 7618.

The in-cab computer has taken a bit of getting used to, but it\u2019s a lovely machine.\n\nWe used to lift all our own sugar beet but in recent years have used a contractor.\n\nWe've now switched back to lifting again after I bought a Garford V6 Hydro trailed harvester, which I aquired for a \nvery decent price and it's a fantastic piece of machinery.\n\nOldest machine still working?\n\nThe Massey Ferguson 135, which starts on the button every time. The clock stopped working years ago, so who \nknows how many hours it has clocked up.\n\nIt\u2019s now used for rowing up daffodil stalks so they don\u2019t get hoovered up by the harvester, as well as a few other \nlight duties.\n\nWhat\u2019s your replacement policy?\n\nWe don\u2019t really have one. Our biggest factor is potato prices \u2013 if we have a good year then we\u2019ll reinvest in some \nnew machinery.\n\nWe aren\u2019t scared of running things outside of a warranty period as long as the machine has been fairly trouble-free.\n\nAs it\u2019s only us that does the driving, we look after them well and my sons have added chrome exhaust stacks and \nMF stickers to a few of them, although these modifications are pretty lost on me.\n\nEveryday transport\n\nI\u2019m on my second Mitsubishi L200 Warrior in white and I think they are brilliant trucks. My first one was a 2006 \nmodel and did 120,000 miles, while the current one is a 2011 model on around 62,000 miles.\n\nMost expensive repair bill?\n\nWe were combining wheat a few years ago and had stopped for some in-field tea. I was in a hurry and jumped back \nin the seat to carry on, but after a couple more bouts our harvest student was frantically flagging me down as there \nwere flames coming from the MF 321\u2019s engine bay.\n\nI had enough time to grab my phone and the toolbox before a couple of colourful explosions, the second one being \nblue as the hydraulic tank exploded and the header fell to the ground.\n\nLuckily, we didn\u2019t lose any crop as we were harvesting a couple of minutes from the fire station and they sent three \nunits to put it out.\n\nIt was a complete write-off, and the damage was so bad the insurance company couldn\u2019t determine the cause.\n\nChandlers was brilliant and hired us a Massey 7278 to finish harvest, which I liked so much I bought, although \nunfortunately the insurance didn\u2019t pay old for new.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the problem with the 7618, then?\n\n\n\nWhere to start? It was one of the early models off the production line and we are now on warranty claim 46 since it \narrived new in 2013. The first claim went in on day three of ownership, which was a faulty AdBlue system.\n\nSome have been small such as work lights blowing fuses, others have been rather large and expensive, and the \nmost spectacular was the PTO clutch welding itself together.\n\nWhen the engineers took it out, which was a sizable job in itself, it had turned a shade of blue due to the heat and \nthey couldn\u2019t get it apart. I bought it to power the potato harvester but we deemed it too unreliable for the job.\n\nWe took out extended warranty due to the issues we had with the tractor, which proved to be a sound decision. We \nnow also have to keep a selection of 7.5amp fuses in the cab as they blow on such a regular basis.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating as, when the tractor is running well, it\u2019s a lovely machine to drive and there are other 7618s in the \narea that have been near-faultless.\n\nIt ran out of warranty in March and we are going to chop it in later this year, but the issues haven\u2019t tempted me to \nswitch brand.\n\nDo you buy second-hand?\n\nMy father only had one new tractor in his career, which was the MF 6150 we still own. I have always tended to buy \nnew as I like to know where I am with warranties and reliability.\n\nWe would probably only buy second-hand in an emergency and it would have to be the right machine.\n\nNext on the wish list?\n\nWith the varied workload, we need three reliable front-line tractors, so a replacement for the troublesome 7618 is \ntop of the agenda.\n\nWe had a demo of a 200hp MF 6718 four-cylinder earlier this year and it made light work of our five-furrow \nDowdswell plough and could easily cope with more.\n\nMy eldest son James is very friendly with the local Lemken dealer and keeps badgering me for a new plough and \ndrill, but he still hasn\u2019t told me how he is planning to pay for them yet. \n\nOur Team trailed sprayer could also do with an upgrade, so we\u2019ll see how well the potatoes sell.\n\nFavourite job?\n\nI\u2019m addicted to farming and don\u2019t really have a favourite job as I like everything we do.\n\nHowever, with James now 21 years old I'd better say combining, as he will be more than happy to kick me out of \nthat seat if I\u2019m not careful.\n\nBiggest machinery bargain?\n\nHas to be the Garford beet harvester, although I\u2019m not sure Phillip Garford would thank me for the business.\n\nAny classics?\n\nThe oldest machine we own is a 1965 MF 35, which was bought new by my grandfather and I bought it from his \nretirement sale.

Exports have also risen, due to concerns over key EU milk producing nations being impacted by \nhot, dry conditions.\n\nTrade has been fairly quiet for butter with average prices only really rising as a reaction to cream, rather than a \nspecific butter market factor. The price has also risen by 4% on July, to \u00a35,080/tonne.\n\nThe mild cheddar market saw no change, remaining stable at \u00a33,050/tonne, with little activity taking place across \nthe month.\n\nWith stocks plentiful, sellers are generally in no rush to sell, and buyers are also in no hurry, says AHDB Dairy.\n\nDairy market indicators\n\nThe actual milk price equivalent (AMPE) increased by 4.3% from July\u2019s figures to 33.18p/litre.\n\nThe milk for cheese value equivalent (MCVE) increased by 0.7% from July\u2019s figures to 33.62p/litre.\n\nAMPE and MCVE track butter and milk powder, and cheese and whey values respectively and indicate what these \ncommodities are worth to processors after processing but before transport costs.\n\nMilk industry\n\nThe price rises follow Arla's decision to hold its milk price for September as the industry waits to see the final impact \nof the drought on European milk volumes.\n\nArla\u2019s standard manufacturing litre with a constituent content of 4.2% butterfat and 3.4% protein will remain at \n31.38p/litre through next month.\n\nMuller is expected to announce its milk price for September at the end of this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the Global Dairy Trade (GDT) index, an indicator of international dairy market sentiment, added to its \nthree-month slump on 21 August, dropping by 3.6%.\n\nPrices averaged US$3,044/t (\u00a32,357) as all but one of the products offered tumbled in value across the auction, \nwhich fell for the ninth time in the past 12 auctions. \n\nThe biggest falls were reserved for butter and cheese, dropping by 8.5% and 4.7% to average US$4,392/t (\u00a33,401) \nand US$3,484/t (\u00a32,698) respectively.\n\nDairy market analysis from Peter Meehan, INTL FCStone\n\nVolatility remained high in the global dairy markets over the past week. While European spot skim milk powder \n(SMP) and butter prices edged higher again last week, futures\u2019 price activity was somewhat more mixed as more \nfavourable weather conditions prevail across much of Europe and concerns over milk supplies ease.\n\n\nOn the spot market, European SMP gained a further 4% last week, climbing to \u00a31,457/t. European spot butter \nprices saw more moderate gains, increasing by 0.5% to \u00a34,990/t.\n\nOn the futures markets, things have been more mixed with EEX butter futures\u2019 September to March contracts down \nsharply, falling by 5.6%. SMP futures meanwhile saw October-December move down by 1% and January-March up \n0.9%.\n\nDespite the modest milk production numbers for July coming out of the Netherlands (-1.2%) and the US (+0.4%) \nover the past week and very strong export numbers out of New Zealand for July, futures\u2019 prices struggled to find \nsupport.\n\nLast week\u2019s GDT auction also did little to support market prices as it saw its fifth move lower in six events and 10th \nmove lower in the last 13 events with the overall index dropping by 3.6%. Fats, in the form of butter and AMF drove \nthe decline.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBeef finisher Paddy Murphy erected an unroofed unit at his farm in County Wexford four years ago to replace a \nbadly performing woodchip pad.\n\nThe cost of woodchip was rising and it was a challenge to dispose of the soiled material, so Mr Murphy decided to \nreplace the pad with a roofless, slatted unit.\n\nThe cattle performed so well in the unit a second, duplicate was built last year, with each shed holding up to 120 \nanimals. This has meant cattle previously housed in rented sheds could be kept on-farm.\n\n\u201cWe have been renting sheds on other farms but our aim is to eventually have everything here on the farm because \nit would be easier from a management point of view,\u201d Mr Murphy explains.\n\nSee also: Business Clinic: How much to rent a cattle finishing building?\n\nErecting the new sheds\n\nThe pad was removed and replaced with a 2.7m deep slatted tank enclosed by three 8ft-high walls; a feed passage \nwas already in place and this formed the fourth barrier.\n\n\u201cWe struggled to get the pad draining properly in certain weather conditions even though we had constructed it \ncorrectly with drains and stone,\u201d explains Mr Murphy, who farms with his wife, Bridget, and their children, Padraic \nand Sinead.\n\nEach unit is split into three pens to allow different groups of cattle to be kept separately.\n\nOne of the most important considerations was to provide shelter for cattle from the wind which the walls and the \nsheltered position of the unit offer.\n\nThe units were built in a sheltered part of the farmyard to avoid cattle huddling together during bouts of bad weather \ninstead of lying down, which would have risked foot problems and other animal health issues.\n\nMr Murphy also insisted on the feed passage being covered as he believes this is integral to the system functioning \nat its optimum.\n\n\u201cSome farmers don\u2019t cover the feeding area but I think it is important cattle are sheltered when they are eating \nbecause it encourages them to eat more,\u201d he says.\n\nThe trough is covered with sheets of 10ft-long metal cladding which overhang the troughs.\n\n\nFarm facts\n\n120ha farmed\n\nCattle fed a ration of silage, grain and also sugar beet or fodder beet which are grown on contract\n\nCattle are sourced direct from farms and markets at all ages and finished by 30 months\n\nMostly continental and early maturing breeds and some Friesians\n\nCattle vaccinated for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis\n\nSlats and space\n\nThe dimensions of the unit provide 2.75sq m of accommodation per animal \u2013 well within regulations in Ireland which \ndictate that stocking rates for slatted housing must be no less than 2sq m.\n\nThe slats are covered with rubber mats, another feature which Mr Murphy regards as essential.\n\n\u201cCattle don\u2019t mind what is coming down on top of them once they have comfort beneath them and they are \nprotected from draughts,\" says Mr Murphy.\n\n\u201cThe cold doesn\u2019t bother them. They will lay closer together when the weather is colder as was the case last spring \nand their coats also grow thicker in the winter as a reaction to being outdoors.\"\n\nBenefits\n\nHad the Murphys roofed the units it would have added about 16,000 (\u00a314,400) to the cost of each.\n\nSavings are made on the maintenance of gutters and downpipes associated with buildings and there is also a \nuseful reduction in the time spent treating stock for disease.\n\nHowever, the Murphys had to spend an additional 7,288 (\u00a36,563) per unit on extra slurry storage capacity to \naccommodate the annual rainfall of 1,000mm.\n\nThey need sufficient storage for 16 weeks to comply with nitrate vulnerable zone regulations in Wexford \u2013 they have \n33,000 gallons of additional capacity per unit to allow for the additional rainfall on an unroofed structure.\n\nAdditional rainwater collected from roofless accommodation can increase slurry requirements by more than 20% \nbut Mr Murphy says this additional water has allowed him to make better use of the slurry.\n\nBut Mr Murphy admits the cost saving of 8743 (\u00a37,837), when taking into account the additional slurry \nrequirements, wasn\u2019t the reason why he opted for this design \u2013 animal health and performance was the ultimate \ndetermining factor.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I considered was health not cost. We knew of other farmers with this design and they were very \nhappy with how the cattle were performing,\" he says.\n\nMr Murphy buys cattle from different sources. He says one of the biggest health risks of doing this and then housing \nthem in a mixed air space is pneumonia, but the topless building combats this problem, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe cattle have fewer coughs and runny noses than those in our enclosed sheds and not only is this good for \nperformance but, because they are less likely to develop respiratory infections or pneumonia, we spend less on \ntreatment costs.\"\n\nAnimal performance\n\nPerformance has been good too. \u201cWe have monitored some cattle and have had some very good gains.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t find that they eat any more outdoors than they would indoors, the cattle get the same ration whether they \nare outside or inside.\n\n\u201cIf the weather is very cold we might increase the feed slightly but that would also be the case for the cattle \nindoors.\"\n\nAlthough people are exposed to the weather when they are managing the cattle in the units Mr Murphy says this is \nnot an issue. \u201cIt is no different to having an outdoor system and it can be more enjoyable to work in an outdoor \nenvironment than in an enclosed shed.\"\n\nFuture\n\nThere are an assortment of buildings at Knockbay Livestock but Mr Murphy believes the unroofed sheds outstrip \nthe rest.\n\nOther housing on the farm includes three covered slatted sheds, one of which was built in the 1970s and has a low \nroof which results in poor ventilation.\n\nMr Murphy says he plans to gradually replace each of these with unroofed accommodation.\n\n\u201cThey suit our system and, with cattle healthier and performing well, they are the way forward for us.\"\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhile other crops have suffered this season due to the hot and dry conditions, Soya has had no such problems. Its \naptness for drought means growers looking to lessen the risk of dry conditions might want to consider it in their \nrotation.\n\nSoya\u2019s ability to cope with droughty conditions such as those experienced this season are expected to help push up \nthe area grown to almost 5,000ha next year.\n\nWith bean and pea crops yielding poorly in the hot and dry weather, seed group Soya UK expects the healthier \ngross margin available with soya, even in a bad year, to convince many growers to swap.\n\nIn a good season British soya crops are expected to yield around 2.5t/ha, but due to the adverse conditions this is \nlikely to be down slightly.\n\nThe stems and leaves of soya plants are covered in hundreds of tiny hairs, which reduces evaporation and makes \nthem ideally suited to drought conditions.\n\n\u201cSoya has loved the sun. I have seen some crops that will do 2.5t/ha this year,\u201d says David McNaughton, managing \ndirector of Soya UK.\n\n\u201cIronically, the thing that hurts the crops was the wet before the dry period. Where we are seeing poor crops, it is \nwhere the seed-beds were bad and wet.\u201d\n\nSoya does not like compaction, and will also not germinate well if drilled too deep, especially on heavy ground.\n\nPrices for UK-produced Hard IP (full non-GM traceability) soya have also been buoyed by the introduction of \nChinese tariffs on imports of any origin soya.\n\nThis positive outlook means demand is outstripping supply and Soya UK would like to expand the British soya area \nwell beyond next year\u2019s 5,000ha.\n\n\u201cI would like to have 8,000ha next year; the market wants it so I will buy it. Major soya producers have had a car \ncrash this year, but UK soya beans could well rise over \u00a3400/t,\u201d said Mr McNaughton.\n\n\n\nSeed-bed preparation\n\nJamie Clark from Maidstone in Kent is growing 69ha on a seed contract at Boughton Place, Sandway, for the first \ntime after the price for marrowfat peas dropped to uneconomical levels.\n\nOnly 7.6cm of rain fell on his farm in June and July, but despite this, he says the crop never wilted or looked \nstressed even on the hottest days.\n\nLast autumn after the straw was baled it was sprayed off in mid-October and sub-soiled as deep as was possible.\n\nOn the heavy Wealden clay it was too wet in early April to drill the crop after the weeds were sprayed off, so drilling \ndidn\u2019t take place until 25 April. However, this was followed by 7.6cm of rain on 30 April.\n\n\u201cThe rain created some problems on the heavier ground as it capped it like concrete. I didn\u2019t think it was going to \ncome through, but it did except for on the headland,\u201d Mr Clark says.\n\n\u201cMy only problem with it is that it sets too many pods low down on the plant so we are going to have high losses.\u201d\n\nMr McNaughton says losses from low-set pods can be an issue for growers, but can be minimised by good seed-\nbed preparation to allow the header to get down as low as possible to \u201cscalp\u201d the crop.\n\nAchieving the target plant population of 50-60 plants/sq m will also encourage taller plants and higher-set pods, as \nsoya is inclined to compensate and fill out the space by producing short and bushy plants if the target isn\u2019t \nachieved.\n\nMr Clark is likely to combine the crop in the first week of September after it started to senesce two weeks early, \nwhich is expected to affect yields. Despite this, he still plans to continue with the crop next year.\n\nNew chemistry\n\nDahlia bean fly\n\nSoya growers gained a new weapon in the battle against pests this year with the issuing of an extension of \nauthorisation for minor use (EAMU) for the pyrethroid Lambdastar (lambda-cyhalothrin).\n\nLambdastar is the only option available for soya growers for controlling dahlia bean seed fly, which alongside \npigeons is the biggest threat to crops and can reduce yields by a third.\n\nSoya UK says that applying Lambdastar as close to emergence as possible is essential, and at \u00a30.80/ha will not \naffect gross margins.\n\nPre-emergence\n\nOptions for pre-emergence herbicides are Stomp (pendimethalin) plus Gammit (clomazone), Nirvana (imazamox + \npendimethalin).\n\nHowever for this season, Artist (flufenacet + metribuzin) has been given an EAMU, giving growers three options for \ngrassweed control next season.\n\nPost-emergence\n\nGrowers now have two graminicides options to tackle grassweeds; both Fusillade Max (fluazifop) and Laser \n(cycloxydim) have secured EAMUs, while an EAMU for Centaurian Max (clethodim) should be in place ready for the \n2019 season.\n\nInnoculants\n\n\n\nThe nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria for soya is not native to the UK so Soya UK seed is pre-inoculated with three \ntypes of bacteria. From next season, this will be increased to four following trials this year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis year\u2019s harvest has been a strange one. The drought meant that the barns didn\u2019t quite fill up but the lack of rain \ncertainly made planning easier.\n\nLast year I was constantly testing the moisture of the crops but this time I was more concerned about them drying \nout too much.\n\nIn my last column I wrote about the precautions we were taking in case a fire broke out and this proved to be a \ngood decision.\n\nSee also: More Will\u2019s Way farming columns\n\nShortly after finishing the headlands on a field of rye, we had to deal with a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nI think the combine must have caught a flint and set fire to some chopped straw, and it started to spread fairly \nquickly.\n\nLuckily the wind was blowing away from the crop and the extra extinguishers we\u2019d bought did an excellent job of \nputting out the blaze, but it was a close call.\n\nHarvest emergency\n\nI was back at the farm at the time, but rushed down there with a set of discs and some extra extinguishers, just in \ncase we needed them.\n\nBy the time I arrived the situation was under control, but if the wind had been blowing the other way we could have \nlost most of the crop.\n\nI\u2019d seen pictures that other farmers had shared on Twitter of entire fields razed to the ground, so I was relieved that \nwe didn\u2019t have to go through that.\n\nOf course up until 1993 farmers used to purposely set stubbles alight as a way of controlling weeds, but it was \nbanned because of environmental and safety concerns.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that if we were still allowed to do it, then blackgrass wouldn\u2019t be such a big a problem, but I can \ncertainly understand why it was stopped.\n\nI\u2019m sure if glyphosate ever ends up being banned there will be calls to bring back burning, but I can\u2019t ever imagine \nany UK government agreeing to it.\n\nWeed wars\n\nSpeaking of blackgrass and other unwanted plants, I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll have fewer of them on our farm this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent quite a lot of time discing fields to try to chit as many seeds as possible.\n\nThe theory is that once they\u2019ve been sprayed off and killed we can Sumo the land and drill into a relatively sterile \nseedbed. That\u2019s the plan, but we\u2019ll have to wait a while to see if it works.\n\nAway from land work, I\u2019ve been busy checking on our harvested crops. As many of you will know, it\u2019s really \nimportant to keep an eye on the temperature and moisture content once they\u2019ve been put in the barn.\n\nLast year the wet conditions caused us a few problems but this year everything has gone in fairly dry. I\u2019m hoping \nthis will make storing them easier, but I\u2019ll keep checking them just in case there are any issues.\n\n\n\nIn terms of yields, our winter wheat was down on last year and the less said about the spring wheat the better, but \nour rye and winter barley was actually better than in 2017.\n\nI\u2019m sure the next 12 months won\u2019t be easy as we battle the elements once again, but I\u2019m actually looking forward to \nit. I must be mad.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA 45-year-old Wiltshire farmer says his cancer diagnosis is the driving force behind the \u201cextremely difficult decision\u201d \nto sell the family\u2019s arable farm.\n\nAnthony Snook doesn\u2019t want to sell Lavington Farms, where he has lived all his life, but says it\u2019s the only option he \ncan see in order to secure a future for his wife, two children and parents.  \n\n\u201cMy cancer is incurable, albeit manageable,\u201d he told Farmers Weekly.\n\nSee also: Video: Estate comes to market as family leaves farming after 70 years\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t carry on the way I\u2019m going, so selling seems to be the only way to secure my family\u2019s immediate future \nin the event of me not being able to work.\n\n\u201cMy children (14 and 11) aren\u2019t old enough to go farming and I don\u2019t want the pressure being put on my wife.\u201d\n\nFor the past five years cultivations have been contracted out, with Anthony responsible for the rest of the operation, \nalongside his full-time job helping to run an ATV business.\n\nThe 809-acre enterprise in the Vale of Pewsey comes with two semi-detached houses and a grain store and is \nbeing launched this week at a guide price of \u00a38m as a whole, or in three lots.\n\nThe Grade 1 and Grade 2 chalk soils have been put to a winter wheat, winter barley and oilseed rape rotation.\n\n\u201cYields can touch 5t/acre for wheat and 4t/acre for winter barley,\u201d Anthony said.\n\n\u201cLast year our crop of Graham made milling quality but normally we grow for feed.\u201d\n\nIt is divided into three blocks, the largest of which is 300 acres and comes equipped with an 800t grain store.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had my diagnosis I was ready to invest in a 1,000t grain store so we had more storage for barley and \nwheat. In the past we have missed out on the higher prices by not being able to store more.\u201d\n\nAnthony said his wish is that a buyer can be found to take the farm as a whole and the existing contractor to remain \nin place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the land needs to be split up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe contractor is keen to continue and has always farmed to \nan incredibly high standard.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to plant next year\u2019s crops and have all the inputs \u2013 everything is in place to carry on as we are, and \nwe will see what happens.\u201d\n\nStamp duty saving\n\nSelling agent Woolley & Wallis said the sale is unusual because buyers are being offered Lavington Farms as a \nlimited company, which carries a significant stamp duty saving.\n\nIn this case, a sale at the \u00a38m guide price would mean \u00a340,000 is due, rather than \u00a3400,000.\n\nThe firm said the number of farmers who trade as a limited company has declined because of a relatively benign \ntax regime for partnerships and individuals. \n\n\n\nPartner Richard Nocton said: \u201cNormally stamp duty would be charged at 5% but in the case of selling a company it \nis at the much lower rate of 0.5%.\u201d\n\nThe Wiltshire market\n\nMr Nocton feels there is interest in farmland at all scales in the Vale of Pewsey; an area where supply is traditionally \nslim.\n\nBut he said there could be added appeal because the bulk of the value is in the farmland, not the residential \nelement of the sale. \n\n\u201cBuyers are likely to come from some distance to find a farm of this quality and great potential,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe crop yields are excellent, the farm is clean and buyers will really chase a farm of this ilk.\u201d\n"}
