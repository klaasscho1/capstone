{"title": "Wallet theft could cause INS confusion", "body": "\nQ I was shopping at Kmart on Aug. 6 and put my wallet in the shopping cart. Somebody took it. I lost my \nImmigration and Naturalization Service card, my Social Security card, driver's license, ATM, Visa card and my \npaycheck. I reported it to the police. But on Wednesday, I have an appointment with the INS for the swearing-in \nceremony. I have nothing to prove who I am. What should I do? A. Sally San Jose\n\nA Go back to the police department and get a copy of the police report. Normally, one would need to take this report \nto the swearing-in ceremony, says Sharon Rummery, INS spokeswoman. By then you might have paperwork from \napplying for a duplicate driver's license and a Social Security card and could bring those with you.\n\nBut we've made arrangements for the INS to have your file at the resolution table (a spot to handle potential \nproblems at swearing-in ceremonies).\n\nSound off: garbage\n\nIt's been five weeks since the new garbage/recycle program began. I've noticed that many people are unaware that \none should leave 1 1/2 to 2 feet between the carts so that the equipment has enough room to operate efficiently. If \nthe people were to put out the carts correctly, the driver wouldn't need to dismount and separate the carts so that \none can be picked up without knocking the other one over. C.S.
