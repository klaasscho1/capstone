''You hear a lot of stories about so-called illegals coming over. My client has a problem with it to a \ncertain extent. He thinks if people are coming over, they should do it legally.''\n\nDeputy District Attorney Wendy Patrick said the defendants went looking for ''beaners'' to beat and rob and went to \na spot where they knew they could find undocumented immigrants.\n\nPatrick said Cisneros was repeatedly stomped in the face.\n\nIn an interview last month at the Mexican Consulate, Cisneros told The San Diego Union-Tribune he had crossed \nthe border illegally the day of the attack to look for work.\n\nHe was walking near a highway when he was assaulted and robbed of his wallet and $40, he said.\n"}
