{"title": "...and a crackdown on illegals", "body": "\nPicture this: Illegal immigrants toiling day after day to help build Atlanta's new Federal Center, by definition a \nfederally financed and presumably federally inspected mega-project. Add this touch of irony: A mere 60 feet across \nthe street is the regional office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the nation's watchdog against \nsuch lawbreaking.\n\nFor the INS, the discovery of these ongoing violations under its unsuspecting gaze was a powerful embarrassment, \nas if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found poachers had set traps for bald eagles atop its headquarters. The \nsymbolism hardly could be worse.\n\nBut the illegals at the Federal Center are only symptomatic of wider abuse throughout metropolitan Atlanta, just \nabout the hottest employment locale in the Southeast. So this week, responding to hundreds of complaints, 130 or \nso agents of the INS and several other federal departments are making a major, coordinated strike against the \nemployment of illegals.\n\nFar more is involved here than just arresting foreign nationals with forged or no documents and deporting them, \nalthough hundreds will be so processed, humanely but firmly, in the coming days. This operation, coded \nSouthPAW, takes a systematic approach to identifying violations, removing illegals, working with employers and \nsecuring justice for American job seekers and also for foreigners who have legal status.\n\nThe feds are not focusing alone on the illegals, most of whom are driven from their homelands by desperation and \nexploited, at least by U.S. standards, once they get here. One of the aims of the operation is to track down crooked \nlabor brokers, identification counterfeiters and knowingly exploitative employers. But INS agents also want to work \nwith willing employers to help them spot bogus credentials.\n\nA fair number of the jobs illegally occupied till this week are in manufacturing and construction and pay decent \nwages. The foremost objective of Operation SouthPAW is for INS to empty these positions temporarily so the U.S. \nLabor Department can fill them with qualified Americans. That's as it should be.\n"}
