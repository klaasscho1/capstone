{"title": "WILSON ACCUSED IN ILLEGAL WORKER FLAP", "body": "\nChallenger Kathleen Brown charged Monday that Gov. Pete Wilson intervened in 1989 with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service on behalf of a campaign contributor who hired undocumented immigrant workers. Wilson \naides acknowledged that the governor, then a U.S. senator, did write a letter to the INS the day after federal agents \nraided two San Diego hotels -- the Bahia and the Catamaran -- looking for illegal immigrants. But they argued that \nWilson's letter did not defend the hotels' hiring practices and had no bearing on the outcome of the case, in which \nowner Anne Evans ultimately was fined $70,000.\n\nNotes\n\nCAMPAIGN NEWS IN BRIEF\n"}
