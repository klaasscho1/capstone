This 'New  Republican' emphasizes traditional Republican values through the lens of family values.  \nFamily encompasses transportation, growth, employment, education and immigration. Expanding highways creates \ngrowth and traffic. Bringing jobs, even the federal government, closer to home increases time with loved ones. My \nchildren's school can compete with any private school. Why is not every Virginia school as good as Little River \nElementary? Having worked internationally, married a foreign national, I know immigrants' plight, tremendous \nvalues and ethics. Even my Mayflower forefathers were immigrants; we are all Americans. I will work vigilantly for \nLoudoun County, basing decisions on family.\"  \n\n Why should voters elect you? \n\n \"1) I understand the problems we all have. \n\n \"2) I can achieve the results we need. \n\n \"3) My only interest is to serve the people.\"  \n\n Web site: \n\n None given. \n\n E-mail address: \n\n\n scottsmith4senate@gmail.com \n"}
