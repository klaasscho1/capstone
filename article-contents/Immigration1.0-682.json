{"title": "HONORING CONTRIBUTIONS;IMMIGRATION'S TRUE FACE", "body": "\nAs Washington works up its anti-immigrant obsession, Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights has been busy \nshowing the genuine faces of American immigrants. The message to a forgetful people: We Are Them.\n\nAt its awards dinner tonight in Minneapolis, the human rights group will celebrate immigrants' contributions, \nfocusing on five outstanding Minnesotans born outside the United States. The focus is timely and important. This \ncountry has been and is being built by immigrants. The five to be honored are:\n\nM. Nazie Eftekhari, a native of Iran and chief operating officer of the Araz Group, an independently held health care \npreferred provider organization.\n\nJose Lamas, a native of Mexico, a recent Worthington High School graduate who plans to study law.\n\nW. George Meredith, a native of South Wales in the United Kingdom, who is an executive vice president of 3M Co.\n\nViet Ngo, a native of Vietnam and founder and CEO of Lemna Corp. and a well-regarded sculptor.\n\nRocky Ralebipi, a native of South Africa who is Humphrey Fellow and library scientist.\n\nThe United States finds itself in an especially thick nativist stew now. The world is in a profound state of flux. \nImmigration demographics make many more newcomers stand out by their race or ethnicity in what has been a \nEurocentric nation. The disproportionate impact of illegal immigration in the southern United States is driving \nnecessary but exaggerated responses from policy-makers. But most of all, the political spin has degenerated so \nprofoundly that a citizen who channel-surfs or scans headlines to form ideas about immigration gets a distorted \npicture.\n\nMinnesota Advocates for Human Rights reminds the community that on the whole, the picture of immigrants is \npositive.\n"}
