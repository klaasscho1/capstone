{"title": "Among the Huddled Masses at the Golden Door", "body": "\nThere is no doubt that many immigrants to the United States were driven by economic imperatives, as Roberto \nSuro noted in his July 5 Outlook commentary about the Statue of Liberty. But that fact did not justify the conclusion \nreflected in the headline \"She Was Never About Those Huddled Masses.\"\n\nI was one of those \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free\" as I stood on the deck of the ship Nieuw \nAmsterdam on the morning of Dec. 15, 1938.\n\nAlso standing on the deck were hundreds of other passengers who were fleeing the Nazis, as I was. We gazed at \nthe Statue of Liberty as our ship brought us to the golden door. Admittedly, the door was no longer wide open, but \nit had not been \"slammed shut\" in 1924, as Mr. Suro contended. There were tens of thousands of us whose lives \nwere saved because we found refuge in the United States in the 1930s.\n\nMr. Suro was also mistaken when he said that the door remained shut after World War II. Under the Displaced \nPersons Act of 1948, hundreds of thousands of those who lost their homes during the war were allowed to enter the \nUnited States. And hundreds of thousands have entered under the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nOur immigration laws undoubtedly need review and revision, but that does not change the fact that no other country \nhas been as willing to open its doors to victims of persecution as has the United States. The Statue of Liberty \nshould indeed continue to symbolize that lifting of the lamp beside the golden door.\n\nRICHARD SCHIFTER\n\nBethesda\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE; By Andrew Harrer -- Bloomberg News\n\n"}
