{"title": "FEDERAL IMMIGRATION FIGURES QUESTIONED", "body": "\nBoth legal and illegal immigration are increasing more than government figures show, and the foreign-born \npopulation is growing at nearly four times the rate of native-born Americans, a private study contends.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, which examines immigration issues and has been critical of the high \nnumbers of foreigners allowed into the United States, said the 1993 total added more than 1.25 million to the \npopulation.\n\nThe study counted 972,000 new legal immigrants for the fiscal year, compared to the 880,014 the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service reported. The center counts refugees and asylum-seekers not included in the INS figures.\n\nIn addition, 300,000 foreigners illegally settle in the United States each year, according to government estimates. \nThe center said the actual number is probably higher because of increased smuggling of Chinese and fraudulent \nasylum applications.\n\nNotes\n\nWashington News in Brief\n"}
