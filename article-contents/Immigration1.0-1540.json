{"title": "POLL: AMERICANS BACK IMMIGRATION LIMITS", "body": "\nNearly eight in 10 Americans believe immigration rates should be dramatically scaled back - and one-fifth want a \nhalt to all immigration, legal or not, a new poll suggests.\n\nThe Roper poll, commissioned by a small non-profit group that advocates a substantially decreased U.S. \npopulation, comes as Congress is poised to tackle bills seeking to thwart illegal immigration and make a dent in \nlegal entries.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of those polled for Negative Population Growth Inc. said the United States should allow \n600,000 or fewer immigrants entry annually. Of that 79 percent, about half endorsed rates of 100,000 or fewer.\n\nIn 1994, the United States granted legal residency, asylum or refugee status to 804,416 foreigners. At least 300,000 \npeople are believed to enter unlawfully each year.\n\nNotes\n\nWashington News in Brief\n"}
