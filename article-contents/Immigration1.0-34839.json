{"title": "BEFORE WE INVITE 'GUEST WORKERS'", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nSlashed Federal social programs will have a particularly severe im-pact on Puerto Rico. According to a news article \npublished on July 25, we can expect a ''huge new wave of migration to the mainland'' as a result.\nB A Rittersporn letter discusses Federal plan to relax immigration policies to allow Mexican \"guest workers\"; cites \nneed to help Puerto Rican peoplePuerto Rican officials assert that the only safeguard against ''possibly hundreds of \nthousands'' of immigrants would be to restore benefit programs.\n\nMeantime, the Congress (Senators Hayakawa, Schmidt and others) and the Reagan Administration are proposing \nvarious ''guest worker'' programs. Many thousands of Mexicans and perhaps others would be imported to work in \nAmerican factories and farms.\n\nIs there a contradiction? If the workers are genuinely needed - unemployment rates notwithstanding - and the \nAmerican taxpayer is required to smooth the way for the newcomers, shouldn't we opt to help our fellow nationals \nfrom Puerto Rico ''to relocate''?\n\nB.A. RITTERSPORN JR., New York, July 30, 1981\n"}
