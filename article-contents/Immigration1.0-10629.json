{"title": "DOD EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FOREIGN LANGUAGE CAPACITY", "body": "\nStatement of Galal Walker Professor of Chinese The Ohio State University\n\nCommittee on House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n\nSeptember 23, 2008\n\nIntroduction\n\nChairman, Vic Snyder, members of this distinguished committee, and your special guest, Congressman Rush Holt, \nI am grateful and for the opportunity to speak on the role we in Ohio are playing in the national effort to prepare our \ncountry for the interdependent global community of the 21st Century. We are primarily motivated by the successes \nof our students, who have shown time and again that young Americans can reach the highest level of foreign \nlanguage and culture expertise if given the right opportunities and resources. We see the mission of The Ohio State \nUniversity Chinese Flagship Center as preparing young Americans to succeed in careers that involve extended \ninteractions with counterparts in China and the interpretation of the intentions of Chinese individuals and \norganizations. Graduates of our program are prepared to work with Chinese counterparts and organizations to \nachieve commonly understood goals.\n\nChinese Flagship Center: Our Center at Ohio State is undertaking four programs that advance our mission: 1) The \nChinese Flagship, which focuses on bringing students to the highest levels of proficiency and communicative skills \nwithin Chinese culture; 2) the K-12 Chinese Flagship Program, which works to provide schools across Ohio with he \ncapacity to effectively teach Chinese; 3) Flagship Center in Qingdao, which currently manages in-China internships \nand summer programs; and 4)\n\nThe Language Summit and Ohio Language Roadmap for the 21st Century. In order to carry out the mission of our \nCenter, we have adopted three strategies to guide our operations: 1) Teach language in culture, 2) Combine \nlanguage with content knowledge, 3) Utilize technology, and 4) Assess performance. In the following paragraphs, I \nwill expand on these strategies and, when I describe the programs later, I will explain how each program \nimplements these four strategies.\n\nTeach language in culture\n\n\nThe assumption that the purpose of these programs is to produce demonstrable abilities to communicate in \nChinese requires us to explicitly frame language instruction in Chinese culture. I try to alert every Chinese language \nstudent that cultural understanding is absolutely necessary to their future success by warning them: \"If you want to \nspeak Chinese the way you speak English, you can learn to do that since you all are obviously talented in language \nlearning. It will take you five to seven years of demanding and persistent work. After all that, you will have only \ngained the ability to immediately annoy 1.3 billion people.\" To assure that our students are not annoying to the \nChinese and can more accurately interpret Chinese intentions, we build into our materials and practices \ncommunication frames that reflect the social expectations of Chinese culture. At the beginning levels, for example, \nwe teach learners of Chinese to present and refer to themselves as members of a group rather than as individuals; \nat the advanced levels, we create opportunities to engage in in-depth studies of topics from the Chinese \nperspective, making sure that our students are familiar what most of their Chinese counterparts know about a \ncommonly known subject. We have a course entitled \"Chinese Perspectives on China's Civilization\" that is taught \nby established Chinese academics serving as visiting scholars who regularly expose our students to important \nideas and viewpoints that are not encountered in the classes of Western academics. We tell our students that our \ngoal is to make them appear intelligent in Chinese culture and key to giving that impression is a demonstrable \nknowledge of Chinese culture and the ability to express explicit respect for the culture.\n\nRegardless whether American students of Chinese will use their linguistic skills and knowledge with Chinese people \nin interactions, transactions, presentations, or interpretation, being familiar with the experiences and expectations of \ntheir counterparts in China is crucial. Such knowledge is only gained through a persistent and prolonged exposure \nto and performance of Chinese cultural norms.\n\nCombine language with selected content knowledge\n\nAdult learners of the language do not learn Chinese; they learn to do things in Chinese. The more things they can \ndo in Chinese, the more expert they are in the language. Since the language and culture is too immense to \"learn\" \nas a whole, students and teachers have to restrict the targets to areas that will be most useful and most needed as \nthe students' Chinese learning careers develop.\n\nAs a program, we have to choose the things that a learner will learn to do in Chinese.\n\nThe better we are at choosing and implementing this instruction, the more efficient the learning and teaching \nbecome.\n\nAt the higher levels of instruction, students combine their language study with what we call \"domain study.\" A \ndomain is either an academic field or a career area and the ability to combine domains with an intensive program of \nChinese is one of the great advantages of our location at a large public institution. With OSU's extensive \ninternational community of students, faculty, and staff, almost any academic interest can be matched with a native \nspeaker who is eager to assist young Americans in their pursuit of advanced skills in Chinese. Our students have \nchosen a wide variety of domains: among them, microfinance, public health, marketing, emerging political and \neconomic forces in China, and even real estate.\n\nAt the elementary and middle school levels of Chinese study, after inculcating the foundation skills of listening, \nspeaking, reading, and composition, we are focusing the Chinese lessons on subjects in natural science. After \nreaching intermediate or ILR level 1, we will introduce a progression of materials in mathematics, astronomy, \nbiology, geography, and environmental studies. We have pedagogical reasons for this direction: Chinese \nvocabulary in the natural sciences is more transparent than the English terminology. Thus, as students are \nincreasing their skills in the language, they reinforce basic science skills. Secondly, since we intend to eventually \nhook Ohio classrooms up with classrooms in China, the natural science subject mater will give our students a \nshareable frame of discussion and presentation.\n\nUtilize technology\n\nWe are in the process of catching our pedagogy up to the technological resources available to us. Over the past \ndecade and a half, we have gained the ability to show language learners naturally occurring communication events, \n\n\n\nconnect them to native speaking counterparts at almost any point on the globe, and link different kinds of \ninformation that can be accessed any where at any time. Our Challenge is to render all of these opportunities for \nour students in the most effective ways. While we are making progress on this front, we still have a long way to go \nto realize the full potential.\n\nAt the beginning level, we expose students to short video recordings of Chinese communicating with each other \nand then coach them through the events so they can understand them, replicate them, and participate in similar \nevents, essentially increasing our students' sophistication in the language by steadily increasing the number of \ncommunication events in which they can successfully participate. On the advanced levels, we provide broadcast \nprogramming with coordinated scripts to exercise listening and extensive sets of examples of video clips showing \nspecific events (e.g., refusing, complimenting, and taking leave). To facilitate extensive reading, we put native texts \nonline and combine them with audio programs, search and concordance functions, and electronic reference \nsystems. With the expanding video-conferencing capacities, we create events such as thesis events that include \naudience and participants in both Columbus, Ohio and Qingdao, China.\n\nAssess performance\n\nEffective language learning requires a prolonged experience of performing the language in meaningful contexts. \nAssuring the effectiveness of the instruction requires us to assess our students' performances throughout their \nlearning career. To this end, we have developed an online e-portfolio, Advanced Language Performance Portfolio \nSystem (ALPPS), to provide a longitudinal record of our students' progress in the language. Using \"You Tube-type\" \ntechnology student performances of key interactions (e.g., conversation, presentation) are collected in individual \nand class files, which are then subject to evaluation by teachers and native speakers with pedagogical or domain \nexpertise. This provides us with extensive sets of transparent evaluations-- meaning that students, teachers, and \neventually recruiters can view the evaluation reports, identify the groups of evaluators, and drill down to the actual \nevents on which the evaluations are based.\n\nOur program goals are stated in terms of proficiency standards, namely the Interagency Language Roundtable \n(ILR) proficiency ratings. The highest level of programming is focused on producing ILR 3 and above. We view \nproficiency as a summative assessment and do not train our students to sit for proficiency examinations. Rather we \nassume that a regimen of accurate evaluations of well-chosen performances will lead to solid performances on the \nstandard proficiency examinations. In addition to the ILR and ACTFL proficiency assessments, ALPPS also records \nand tracks performances on standardized tests such as the Chinese Ministry of Education HSK and our own \nChinese Computer- Adaptive Listening Test and Chinese Computer-Adaptive Reading tests.\n\nOur programs include internships where our students spend time in Chinese workplaces, contributing to the goals \nof the host organizations and working cooperatively with Chinese colleagues. This experience has brought about a \nrevelation of the shortcomings of American assessments of foreign language capacities. That is, we train our \nstudents in Chinese and then we assess their (and our) achievements by testing them with instruments that we \ndevise without reference to the opinion of non-English speaking native- speaker members of Chinese culture.\n\nOhio: Chinese Flagship, Language Summit, and Language Roadmap\n\nWhen ILR or ACTFL proficiency ratings consistently seemed to be poor indicators of our interns' success in \nChinese work environments, it became clear that Chinese organizations and individuals were looking for abilities \nthat were not reflected in these tests. Therefore, we have begun to place emphasis on recruiting evaluators for \nALPPS performance files from China and launching research projects to discover what native speakers of Chinese \nin the workplace see as beneficial in the communication efforts of our students.\n\nChallenges Facing the OSU Chinese Flagship Center\n\nWe are continuing to work toward making advanced language training the standard for our institutions. This \nrequires us to find ways to shift the focus from teaching Chinese to learning Chinese. This seemingly slight change \nof perspective seems to challenge the way we run our schools. We need to encourage more investment in \nadvanced language training, making sure that we can provide adequate opportunities to all the students who seek \n\n\n\nto pursue excellence in this field. We need to lower barriers between our classrooms and the institutions in which \nour students will have to make their livelihoods. Finally, we need to find a way to secure facilities in China where we \ncan continue to serve our students. Having our own facilities will keep our costs more constant in an environment \nthat is quickly becoming more expensive, following the pattern in other areas of East Asia. Finally, we need to keep \ntrack of our students after they leave our programs. These young people comprise an incredible resource for our \nprograms, society, and Nation just as long as we know how to contact them.\n\nChinese Flagship Program\n\nThis program has permitted us to raise the standard for Chinese language study at Ohio State. By building the \nChinese Flagship around a Master's of Arts that is earned by attaining ILR level 3 (tested by FSI or ACTFL, whose \ndesignation is \"superior\") in speaking and reading, completing a thesis written and defended in Chinese, and \npublicly demonstrating an ability to give presentations in and discuss a domain (i.e., academic major or \noccupational area), language and culture proficiency has been instituted as the standard for learning and teaching \nachievement. The Ohio State Chinese Flagship is a two-year program. The first academic year is spent in \nColumbus, taking courses delivered completely in Chinese. The subjects are chosen to prepare the students to \nfunction in formal social environments: China's media, networking in China and the United States, Literary \nlanguage in modern mandarin, Language in China, Chinese perspectives on China's civilization, and Negotiation in \nChina. These courses are taught by native speakers that include visiting scholars recruited from universities and \ncompanies in China. We also assign a mentor for each student based on his or her declared domain and the two \nworks together in an individualized instruction course to develop a research agenda that will eventually lead to a \nthesis. Mentors are recruited from the Central Ohio Chinese community and include graduate students, faculty, and \nstaff from Ohio State as well as professionals outside the university. In every course, the students are required to \ndeal with textual materials from China, engage in class discussions, take tests that reflect Chinese testing \nprocedures, and give presentations of their individual research.\n\nOne indication that the first year of this program is effective is the record of our students in the Chinese Bridge, an \nannual international competition in Chinese language proficiency sponsored by China's Ministry of Education. This \ncontest involves well over 100 students of Chinese as a foreign language who have won regional competitions in \nover 50 countries. Our students participate in the US regional competition and the final contest in China, which is \ntelevised throughout China. This occurs during the summer between the first and second year in the OSU Flagship \nProgram. In the past five years students, from Ohio State have earned three first place, one second place, and two \nthird place awards in the international competition in China and fourteen first, second, and third place awards at the \nregional level in New York City. No other college or university has approached this record of achievement.\n\nMore impressive is the performance of these students in their internship assignments, which constitute about one-\nhalf of their second year in China. Our students spend months working in Chinese organizations more often than \nnot as the only non-Chinese staff. The internships are arranged and supervised by the program, with the resident \ndirector in China keeping track of their work and monitoring the host organization's satisfaction. To the present, \nFlagship students from OSU and BYU have worked in 29 organizations in China, including serving as a program \nassistant in the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC), researching intellectual \nproperty rights in a Shanghai law firm, and working on production teams for China Central Television. With proper \npreparation, the experience of working successfully within a Chinese organization leads to a rapid gain in language \nand an irreversible gain in confidence.\n\nThe OSU Chinese Flagship Program has attracted a rather wide demographic range of young Americans who are \nwilling to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of advanced skills in Chinese. The first three cohorts of \nFlagship students consisted of 26 students from 18 states and 20 different universities with 15 different \nundergraduate majors. Our students are 89% non- heritage and 69% male. NSEP fellowships supported 39% of the \nstudents with program and department support going to 44% and 17% being self-supporting.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the program included undergraduate students. Initially undergraduates were \"combined degree\" \nstudents, being enrolled in an undergraduate BA or BS degree program and a Chinese MA program at the same \ntime. For exceptionally performing students, this permits earning the undergraduate and graduate degrees \n\n\n\nconcurrently. But, for most it allows the student to earn the MA one year after obtaining the BA or BS. In the most \nrecent cohorts, we have undergraduates who qualify for Flagship courses before graduating. In the 2008 cohort \nabout one half of the Flagship students have undergraduate status. In coming years, we intend to expand the \nundergraduate element by recruiting students who begin their undergraduate career with intermediate to advanced \nskills in Chinese. This leads us to a discriminating set of terms: Flagship Fellow, for NSEP funded students who \nenroll full time in Flagship courses; Flagship scholars who are other- funded and full-time in Flagship courses; \nFlagship students, who qualify for at least one Flagship course and have at least two majors; and Flagship preps, \nwho are on track to reaching advanced Chinese as undergraduates.\n\nK-12 Chinese Flagship\n\nWith China emerging on the global stage and growing Ohio exports to China increasing ($1.5 billion in 2007), \nChinese language has finally caught the attention of secondary and even elementary schools throughout Ohio. In \n2006, only a few schools in Ohio offered Chinese language instruction. Because of the joint efforts of schools and \ndistricts, the OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program and Ohio Department of Education (ODE), K-12 Chinese has \nwitnessed a significant growth in Ohio schools. The number of schools and students engaged in Chinese studies in \nthe 2007-08 school year almost tripled over the previous year. Here we will describe the current conditions of K-12 \nChinese in Ohio and future plans of the OSU K-12 Flagship program's partnership with K-12 schools to offer \ninnovative and effective Chinese programs.\n\nThe OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program: The OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program has worked closely with Ohio \nDepartment of Education in many areas, including co-hosting two statewide conferences on K-12 Chinese in \nDecember of 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe program goal is to build the infrastructure for Ohio schools to establish successful language programs leading \nto solid communication skills in Mandarin Chinese. The program is developing partnerships in Ohio and beyond to \nachieve objectives that include the following:\n\n-- Developing a multi-access, performance-based curriculum;\n\n-- Providing teacher support and ongoing professional development; and\n\n-- Creating a technology support system with effective Chinese language programs.\n\nOur current stage of K-12 curriculum development consists of two sets of materials: 1) a 9-12 introduction entitled \nChinese: Communicating in the Culture which includes an interactive DVD, a textbook, and a MP3 audio program; \nand 2) a P-5 set of materials designed to be implemented in three phases followed by a series of language \nmaterials dealing with natural science topics. The phases are designed to be offered in a manner analogous to \nbeginning, intermediate, and advance orchestra, where beginning students can start the study of the language at \nPhase I and work their way through the remaining phases by demonstrating command of performance standards. \nThis permits multiple points of access to a program and avoids the necessity to progress in the language on a \ngrade-by-grade basis. Completing Phase III will give the students a firm foundation in listening, speaking, and a \nsolid introduction to the writing system. From that point, we will provide language instruction that focuses on \nscience-related topics: mathematics, astronomy, biology, geography, chemistry and environmental science. We \nhave three reasons for choosing this direction for our curriculum: 1) Chinese science vocabulary is more \ntransparent than English, e.g., volcano is huo-shan \"fire- mountain\" and glacier is bing-he \"ice-river\"; thus, Chinese \ncan reinforce subjects studied in English. 2) We intend to connect our classrooms with classrooms in China and \nfeel that natural science subject matter will be both easier and more attractive as a mutually accessible field of \ncommunication for both our students and Chinese students. 3) We can avoid the issues of cultural relativity that \nseems to be difficult for middle-school-aged students to cope with, leaving the more culturally oriented subject to \nhigh school and/or summer intensive language camps.\n\nThe OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program is interested in supporting any school in Ohio that is operating or plans \nto start a Chinese language program. We are building partnerships with a select number of schools to create model \nChinese programs for Ohio schools. We are also working on creating partnerships with corporations, heritage \n\n\n\nschools and other public and private entities to generate creative support for the development of K-12 Chinese in \nOhio and beyond. Ultimately, we want to see more Ohio students to be proficient in Chinese language and \nknowledgeable about Chinese life and culture. This will not only eventually broaden our students' career \npossibilities and benefit Ohio's economy, but also improve our national security and international relations.\n\nK-12 Chinese Programs in Ohio\n\nAccording to data collected by the OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program, the number of Ohio schools and districts \noffering Chinese language has increased from 8 three years ago to 50 in the 2007-08 school year (Exhibit 1). \nMeanwhile, the number of students enrolled in Chinese increased from 777 (ODE data) in 2006-07 to more than \n2,000 in regular language programs (offering 3-10 sessions each week) in the current school year. In addition, \nmore than 3,000 elementary and middle school students are enrolled in Chinese exploration programs, offering 1-2 \nsessions each week (Exhibit 2). More high school students are learning Chinese through distance learning and the \nOSU summer programs for college credits and/or high school credits.\n\nThe growth of Chinese programs in Ohio schools, 2005-06 to 2007- 08\n\nThe sharp increase of Chinese programs and student enrollment in the last two years is the result of joint efforts of \nschool/district administrators, OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program and ODE. The biggest increase occurred in the \nlast two years, especially after we co-hosted the conference in December 2006, titled \"Making the Global \nConnections: Linking Students and China in the 21st Century.\"\n\nRange of Ohio Schools Offering Chinese: The Ohio K-12 schools offering Chinese are concentrated in and around \nmetropolitan areas (Appendices A&B), but they represent a wide range:\n\n-- Public (including charter or community) and private schools (14 private schools consisting of 27% of the total \nnumber of schools with Chinese programs); and\n\n-- Urban, suburban and rural schools. (The new Chinese language programs starting in the 2008-09 school year \nseem to follow this pattern.)\n\nThere is also a wide variety of ways Chinese language instruction is delivered:\n\n-- Classroom instruction (for most schools and districts);\n\n-- Distance learning for students at multiple sites (e.g., Diocese of Columbus);\n\n-- Distance learning of individualized instruction for college credits (e.g., OSU);\n\n-- Summer programs: Regents' Chinese Academy (funded by State of Ohio, with 50 high school students last year \nand another 50 this summer) and Chinese Immersion Summer Day Camps (funded by StarTalk and operated at \nthree sites: Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton, with more than 70 students);\n\n-- Exploration learning for special education students (e.g., Summit Academy Schools);\n\n-- Full language programs (3-10 sessions per week, usually in high schools) vs. exploration programs (1-2 sessions \nper week, usually in elementary schools). Distance learning may be a solution to rural schools where some \nstudents want to take Chinese but the numbers are not big enough for schools to hire teachers. Currently, the \nDiocese of Columbus is using videoconferencing equipment (Polycom) to offer Chinese to 6th graders in eight \nurban and rural schools. The OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program is providing distance learning of individualized \ninstruction and is providing a distance learning pilot to 12 students in Dover High School in eastern Ohio.\n\nIn addition to the traditional K-12 schools, an important provider of Chinese language and culture to children and \nadults during weekends is the heritage schools in all Ohio metropolitan areas (e.g., Ohio Contemporary Chinese \nSchool in Columbus, Cincinnati Contemporary Chinese School, Chinese Academy of Cleveland, Cleveland \nContemporary Chinese School in Solon City, the Greater Dayton Chinese School, and Toledo Chinese School). \n\n\n\nSome of these schools have a large enrollment--up to 500 students. The majority of students are from heritage \nfamilies, but increasingly, non-heritage students are signing up, particularly those from organizations like Families \nwith Children from China (FCC). Most of the heritage schools are members of a national Chinese School \nAssociation in the United States (CSAUS). The OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program is working closely with some \nof the heritage schools. For example, we partner with them to operate the Chinese Immersion Summer Day Camps \nin three Ohio metro areas: Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton.\n\nType of Students Learning Chinese in K-12 Schools: The majority of the Ohio students are taking Chinese as \nexploratory courses in K-8 programs. That means they spend only one or two sessions a week and some schools \nonly offer exploratory Chinese for a part of one school year. This is certainly not the direction we should promote for \nlearning Mandarin Chinese. We are keeping track of these exploratory programs to learn whether or not they lead \nto more serious goals. All high school students (29% of total enrollment), however, are taking Chinese as a regular \nlanguage program, most of them taking classes every day.\n\nThe other challenge of fast growing Chinese programs is to maintain program quality. Nearly all the students (95%) \nare beginners. This demonstrates that sustaining programs and keeping students continuously interested in \nlearning Chinese are important tasks. This is why we made \"program maintenance\" an important component of the \nannual conference in December 2007. This will be given even more attention when we plan for the third annual \nconference for December 2008.\n\nAn Initial Assessment of Teachers of Chinese: The significant growth of K-12 Chinese programs in Ohio presents \ngreat opportunities for us, but it also creates tremendous challenges, particularly in the areas of teacher and \ncurriculum development. The OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program is developing its capacities and has worked \nwith partners to meet these challenges.\n\nOhio has done a relatively good job in preparing certified teachers of Chinese for K-12 schools, thanks to state \nfunding and the Chinese teacher licensure programs at three universities (OSU, Cleveland State, and Akron). In the \nlast school year, 24 Chinese language teachers graduated from the OSU licensure program and 16 from the CSU \nprogram. Some of these teachers were already teaching Chinese in the K-12 schools, and about half have found \nteaching positions. However, some have not been hired to teach Chinese because they are not willing to relocate to \nwhere the jobs are. Therefore, future Chinese teacher licensure training programs should take relocation issue into \nconsideration. Ohio still has some teachers who are not licensed, most of whom are in private schools. The guest \nteachers sent from China meet the temporary licensure requirement set by ODE. But a licensed teacher does not \nmean that s/he is automatically more effective than other teachers. Guest teachers from China who are made \navailable to schools at no or little cost causes some difficulty in finding positions for the teachers we certify. This will \nrequire attention in the future as we seek to establish Chinese language study as a permanent presence in Ohio \nschools.\n\nAccording to school visits, class observations and teacher professional development workshops in the last year and \nhalf, it seems all teachers of Chinese are dedicated and excited about their new jobs and the overall development \nof Chinese programs in Ohio. However, most of them, including those holding teaching licenses, lack sufficient \npedagogical training to help American students to learn Chinese language effectively. For example, most teachers \nspeak too much English in class, including often repeated basic classroom instructions. The students are doing too \nmuch translation in the classroom rather than performing what they learn in Chinese cultural contexts. We intend to \nprovide more support to the newly formed Ohio Association of Teachers of Chinese and more professional \ndevelopment opportunities for the teachers to deal with this problem.\n\nNumber of K-12 Chinese language teachers in Ohio (Total: 57), 2007-08\n\nThe above number (57) of teachers does not include those in heritage schools, which only operate on weekends \nand focus on heritage children. It does not include the two guest teachers from the Confucius Institutes in the state. \nThe 21 guest teachers in Ohio schools include 19 sponsored by Hanban or other Chinese organizations, two hired \nby the Teachers of Critical Language Program (TCLP, funded by the State Department), and one from Taiwan. In \nthe next school year, there will be 23 Hanban guest teachers coming to Ohio schools (most of them replacing the \n\n\n\ncurrent teachers), five of whom will start new Chinese programs in the schools or districts they are placed. There \nwill also be more TCLP teachers from China and more from Taiwan.\n\nThe guest teacher program is a big help to some schools that want to start a Chinese program but are temporarily \nshort of funds, or for those that want to add to their existing Chinese programs. However, the guest teacher \nprogram is temporary in nature; schools and districts should not regard it as a permanent solution and rely on it for \nlong-term program development. Although the guest teachers are intelligent and increasingly well trained, they have \nunique challenges. For example, most of them are not familiar with teaching Chinese as a foreign language (their \ntraining background is at best \"teaching Chinese as a second language\"); most of them return to their home country \nafter one year of teaching, thus creating uncertainty for schools and students; and some schools have encountered \nmanagement and cultural difficulties with guest teachers that have led to eliminating their entire Chinese program \n(e.g., Belpre Schools).\n\nTeacher Development: Ohio is taking the lead in training Chinese language teachers. The State has invested \nmoney since September 2006 to operate year-long Chinese licensure programs at OSU, Cleveland State, and \nUniversity of Akron. (The contact information is: Dr. Charles Hancock of OSU at hancock.2@osu.edu, Dr. Jane Ann \nZaharias of CSU at J.ZAHARIAS@csuohio.edu, and Dr. Susan Colville Hall of UA at colvill@usakron.edu.) The first \ngroup of 40 teachers of Chinese graduated last summer, and the second group will graduate by the end of this \nsummer.    \n\nThe OSU Department of East Asian Languages and Literature (DEALL) has operated a Chinese language teacher \ntraining program for over a decade: Summer Program of East Asian Concentration, or SPEAC. It is an intensive \nseven-week program offering 15 graduate credits. It focuses on pedagogical training and the trainees have hands-\non experience with high school students who are taking Chinese during the summer. The program director is Dr. \nMari Noda, the chairperson of DEALL. For more information about SPEAC, please visit  \nhttp://deall.osu.edu/programs/summerPrgm .\n\nThe OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program has provided four one-day teacher development workshops in Columbus \nand Cleveland in the past twelve months. The workshops focus on creating Chinese environments in the classroom \nand performance-based pedagogical issues. The formal (written evaluation) and informal feedback indicates that \nteachers were satisfied with the professional development and the training helped them in their teaching. We are \nplanning to provide more teacher development workshops in the near future, including more intensive workshop for \npartner school teachers and workshop during the OATC annual meeting. We also plan to create a webpage on the \nK-12 Chinese Flagship website for teachers to connect and share resources.\n\nIn addition to the regular year-long Chinese teacher licensure program provided by OSU, the K-12 Chinese \nFlagship Program provides information to help teachers who are already teaching Chinese in a K-12 school but \ncannot participate in the year-long program to apply for an alternative educator license.\n\nThe Ohio Model: Innovations for Effective Programs: The goals of the NSEP funded Language Flagship programs \nfor critical languages are innovation and effectiveness, and then diffusion of the innovations. (For more information \nabout The Language Flagship programs nationally, please visit  http://www.thelanguageflagship.org ). The OSU K-\n12 Chinese Flagship Program is less than three years old, but it has significantly impacted the development of \nChinese language programs in Ohio schools. Unlike the Oregon K-12 Chinese program, which is focused on a \npartial immersion model within one school district, the Ohio model has a statewide approach, providing technical \nassistance to any school that operates or plans to offer Chinese language programs. Meanwhile, we work with a \nselected number of \"partner schools\" to develop model programs. We have six partner schools in the Cleveland, \nColumbus and Dayton metropolitan areas. We intend to add three more partner schools every year, schools \nselected to engage in more collaborative work. Eventually we intend to connect the Chinese classrooms in partner \nschools and with schools in China via the Internet.\n\nBy working with schools and partners, we strive to meet the needs of the growing interest in Chinese language \nprograms across Ohio. Since its initiation in 2006, the OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program has made significant \ncontributions to Ohio schools and teachers, including the following support and services:\n\nmailto:hancock.2@osu.edu\nmailto:J.ZAHARIAS@csuohio.edu\nmailto:colvill@usakron.edu\nhttp://deall.osu.edu/programs/summerPrgm\nhttp://www.thelanguageflagship.org/\n\n\n-- Two statewide conferences for school administrators on how to start and maintain successful Chinese language \nprograms (each time attracting about 200 in December);\n\n-- Site visits to most of the 50 schools/districts currently offering Chinese with technical assistance provided to \nadministrators;\n\n-- Class observation of most of the current 57 Chinese language teachers with recommendations provided to \nteachers;\n\n-- Development of the first phase of K-1 curriculum kit, which will be piloted at Gahanna-Jefferson Public Schools \nand possibly other schools;\n\n-- Completion of a first level textbook, Chinese: Communicating in the Culture, with a MP3 audio program and an \ninteractive DVD.\n\n-- Development of lesson plans and teacher's guide for 9-10th graders based on Chinese: Communicating in the \nCulture and other instructional material;\n\n-- Four one-day professional development workshops for Chinese language teachers at no cost to teachers or \nschools;\n\n-- Creating the Ohio Association of Teachers of Chinese (OATC), with 28 paid members;\n\n-- Obtaining StarTalk funds to operate Chinese Immersion Summer Day Camps during June 16-27 in three metro \nareas of Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton;\n\n-- Resources to schools, teachers and other citizens through daily communications and website ( \nhttp://k12chineseflagship.osu.edu); \n\n-- Building a pilot global classroom at Metro High School that can be connected with other classrooms in Ohio and \nin China;\n\n-- Facilitating a partnership between the Columbus Metro High School and Ohio Contemporary Chinese School; \nand\n\n-- Developing a corporate partnership brochure and making initial contacts to help create a pipeline of Chinese \nspeaking professionals in Ohio.\n\nAs the demand increases, we plan on increasing support to schools and teachers. While we continue to support \nmore schools starting Chinese language programs in the future, we want to focus on helping the existing programs \nto increase quality and expand their offerings. Some of our tasks in the next twelve months would include:\n\n-- Accelerating the development of K-12 curricula;\n\n-- Intensifying professional development for current teachers;\n\n-- Supporting the activities of the newly formed Ohio Association of Teachers of Chinese;\n\n-- Increasing the number and quality of partner schools so they can become models for others;\n\n-- Facilitating partnerships between all partner schools with local heritage schools;\n\n-- Helping more partner schools to build global classrooms;\n\n-- Strengthening our statewide efforts in promoting Chinese language through coordinated projects (e.g., StarTalk \nfunded Summer Day Camps);\n\nhttp://k12chineseflagship.osu.edu/\n\n\n-- Providing more web-based resources for teachers and administrators;\n\n-- Better planning for program development by visiting all schools with Chinese programs and observing classes of \nall teachers; and\n\n-- Developing corporate partnerships to generate mutually beneficial support.\n\nOhio represents \"the heart of America\" in many ways. If the multifaceted partnership model in providing Chinese \nlanguage and culture works for K-12 schools in Ohio, it should work for schools in many other states. The OSU K-\n12 Chinese Flagship Program is determined to work with all its partners to help Ohio schools succeed in \nmainstreaming Chinese language in K-12 schools.\n\nFor more information about K-12 Chinese in Ohio and the OSU K-12 Chinese Flagship Program, please visit  \nhttp://k12chineseflagship.osu.edu .\n\nQingdao Flagship Center\n\nQingdao is a city of the future in China: it has been declared one of five cities to receive special investment from \nChina's central government for the current Five Year Plan, it is one of the few designated \"green\" cities in China, it \nwas the site of the 2008 Olympic outdoor water sports, and it has recently been voted the city most Chinese would \nlike to move to in a recent national poll.\n\nQingdao is a city on the cutting edge of China's rising economy and at the same time provides an environment that \npersons from other places in the world will find interesting and comfortable, whether they are China specialists or \nnot. Qingdao is quickly developing as an international city that is attracting people from all over the world and is a \ngood host to young Americans seeking opportunities to participate in the life of the community. For these reasons, \nwe have chosen Qingdao as the operational center for our activities in China. These include summer programs, \ninternship placement and management, and student research and community service projects, and program and \nmaterials development.\n\nSummer Programs: During the summer the Qingdao Flagship Center manages instructional programs designed to \nraise student proficiency levels to advanced threshold, advanced, and superior threshold. While the first two \nprograms are both designed for training learners whose Chinese skills are near or at ILR Level 2, they differ mainly \nin their focuses and the corresponding pedagogical approaches.\n\nAdvanced threshold courses are for students needing systematic training in basic language areas in order to \nperform effectively, and its curriculum provides a more structured classroom instruction plus measured amount of \nsocial practicum experience. The Advanced level program is for those who are prepared to engage with a Chinese \ncommunity and to communicate ideas with native Chinese speakers in authentic and non-textbook contexts. Its \ncurriculum is theme-based and task-motivated and its instruction is more dynamic and requires a much larger \namount of social practicum. The superior threshold program prepares those who are in China for their final Flagship \nyear. To assure they can function as independent learners, researchers, and interns before they begin their career \nas cross-cultural and bilingual professionals, we put them through a curriculum that provides intensive and \nindividualized one-on-one mentoring focusing on refining the exchange of ideas (through oral discussion and essay \nwriting) in the register of working professionals, undertaking individualized community service projects, and \nperforming-in- context projects aimed at preparing the students engage and establish themselves in a Chinese \ncommunity.\n\nThe Qingdao Flagship Center is responsible for the design and execution of the curriculums for these programs, \ndesign and directing all social practicum projects, and managing local logistical means to secure the realization of \nthese projects by coordinating with various Flagship programs from different US institutions, recruitment, training \nand management of local instructors, mentors and learning partners, negotiation with local hosting institutions for \nlocal onsite support, and monitoring and directing the progress of the students.\n\nhttp://k12chineseflagship.osu.edu/\n\n\nAs the number of undergraduate students increase and as the undergraduate Flagship programs develop, the \nCenter is also expected to work with different Chinese educational institutions and corporations to develop a flexible \nrange of courses and community- practicum opportunities to accommodate students with a variety of backgrounds \nin Chinese language and culture-- first timers, repeat visitors, and learners who \"picked up\" their Chinese \nlanguage through a variety of means other than the typical American undergraduate foreign language program.\n\nAs the K-12 Flagship program develops, the Qingdao Center will assume the task of working with the K-12 Flagship \nprogram in identifying and negotiating appropriate sites and partners for various types of in-China programs for \nhigh school students. It will also be working on developing courses and preparing activities that are appropriate for \nthese students and ensure they have linguistically productive experiences through these programs.\n\nInternship Placement and Management: One of the most important and most challenging tasks for the Qingdao \nFlagship Center is internship placement and management. The internship is the means by which Flagship students \ndemonstrate the real world knowledge and skills that verify their qualifications as cross-cultural and bi-lingual \nprofessionals to themselves and to our program.\n\nInternships are typically served in Chinese organizations that are chosen to reflect each student's domain and \nwhere a single Flagship student joins a Chinese workforce. Their bosses are Chinese managers and their \ncolleagues expect them to contribute to the goals of the organization. It is from the internship experience that \nstudents report the greatest gain in ability to achieve their intentions in Chinese. It is also from the internship \nexperience that our program gains the most valuable feedback, where we discover what programmatic elements \nhave effectively contributed to our students' success and which have not. The internship is key to our program \nconsistently producing Americans with truly advanced skills in Chinese language and culture.\n\nThe management of this internship program is challenging because of the great variety of domains and career \ninterests the of the Flagship students. Much time is spent in identifying appropriate internship sites and persuading \nthe organizations to host a Flagship student. We insist that each host organization invest resources in the \ninternship, providing housing or living stipend- -or both from the more affluent enterprises. We have found that an \ninvestment on their part raises the expectations of the intern contributing to their organization and these heightened \nexpectations raise the standard for the whole experience. For most Chinese organizations, the concept and practice \nof internships are still a novelty.\n\nThus, it requires extensive negotiations with potential internship hosts and intensive training of our students to \ndevelop strategies by which they can quickly become genuine contributors to the host organization. The Qingdao \nFlagship Center first works with each student to identify the type of internship that is most fitting for the student's \nstudy, research plan and career interest. It then utilizes its resources and connections to identify possible internship \nsites and to negotiate with the potential internship hosts. Inevitably, some adjustments have to be made by one or \nboth sides, and the Center keeps in very close communications with both sides in this process. While student \npreferences and internship host desires will be carefully considered, the Center has the responsibility to also take \ninto consideration the Flagship mission and makes the final decision on what will be the most suitable internship \nprogram for any given student. Since we have now interns throughout the year (fall, spring and summer) and all \nover China, and since we will place no more than one Flagship intern into one internship site, this process will \nalways be an on-going one.\n\nBefore the internship starts, the Center runs a \"Pre-internship Workshop\" for all Flagship interns. Through site visits, \nlectures and discussions led by working professionals in related fields, and a series of hands-on training sessions, \nthe workshop focuses on furthering the knowledge and practice of the types of behavioral culture having a direct \nimpact on how one establishes oneself in a Chinese working place and the skills necessary for navigating \neffectively and productively in such environments.\n\nDuring the internship, the Center continues to work with both the interns and the internship hosts to ensure the \ninternship will be executed in an optimal way.\n\nSince the great majority of the Chinese internship hosts still do not treat internship very seriously and thus do not \nhave specific internship procedures, the Center needs, on the one hand, continuously to work with internship hosts \n\n\n\nto further develop their internship programs for the Flagship interns, and, on the other hand, work with the students \nto develop knowledge of and skills for being accepted into a Chinese organization and being treated as a capable \nprofessional.\n\nAfter the internship the Center continues to work with the internship hosts on matters such as feedback on the \nFlagship interns' performances, maintaining relationships, and developing a network of potential internship sites for \nthe growing Flagship internship needs.\n\nThe success of our internships is reflected in the repeated requests from host organizations for additional and \ncontinuous Flagship students and by the frequent times the host organization seeks to continue a relationship with \na student after the internship is completed.\n\nStudent Research and Thesis Projects: Integrating research projects into a student's study and internship \nexperience in China ensures that the time spent there is meaningful and productive. To different degrees, most \nFlagship students in China have research assignments from their respective home institutions while each of the \nOSU Flagship students is expected to conduct research at a level that will be useful for their master's thesis \nprojects. Before the student comes to China, the Qingdao Flagship Center director works closely with the student \nand his/her academic advisor in the home institution in drafting a China research plan that is meaningful and \ndoable. When the student is in China, the center director continues to provide advice to the student on fine tuning \nhis/her research plan, identifying places and means, and developing strategies to carry out the plan. Typically, the \nCenter will work the student's research plan into his/her internship program, arrange local mentors who are experts \nin the field the student is working on, monitor the progress of the research, make all necessary adjustments \nincluding adjustments to the student's research plan and adjustments to his/her internship program and study \nprogram, arrange local editorial assistance, and identify and arrange Chinese experts to participate in the student's \nthesis defense through video conferencing from Center.\n\nProgram Development: In addition to the summer study programs and the year round internship programs, the \nQingdao Center is also working on developing a series of programs that will be mutually beneficial to the Flagship \nmission, OSU programs, and American education in general:\n\nGlobal Classroom Programs: Through video conferencing, we have developed several educational and cultural \nevents with a cross cultural and bilingual context, such as internship conference between Flagship interns currently \nconducting internship in China and Flagship students currently studying in their US home institutions; thesis \ndefenses participated in by students, American professors and Chinese experts in related domains; and \"cultural \nsalon\" events dealing with misconceptions between China and the US, traditional folk art in contemporary China, \nand educational issues in the US and China. Discussions are underway about developing courses that will bring \ntogether learners and experts from both China and the US and thus create a global learning context dealing with \ntopics such as Professional Networking in China and the US, Conflicting Viewpoints, Perspectives and \nPresentations on Chinese Civilization, Comparative Studies of Chinese and American Behavioral Culture, and \nAmerican Studies Courses in Chinese Universities.\n\nTeacher Training Programs: Training in foreign language pedagogy theories, approaches, and techniques for both \nChinese teachers teaching Chinese to foreign learners and Chinese teachers teaching English to Chinese \nlearners. Both the field of teaching Chinese to foreign learners and the field of teaching English to Chinese learners \nare expanding rapidly in China and the bottle- neck for the healthy development of these fields is the severe lack of \nteachers trained in effective instruction. The Center will work with both the local universities (Qingdao University, \nChina Ocean University) to create foreign language teacher training programs for local teachers and some leading \nnational universities (Tsinghua University, Beijing University, Jinan University, Wuhan University) to create Qingdao \nbased national foreign language teacher training programs. Creating a cadre of effective teachers in China will \nhave an important impact on American programs.\n\nMaterial Development: Utilizing the relatively easy access to authentic contemporary Chinese materials and native \nChinese speaker resources, the Center will engage in the development of a series of instructional materials for the \nFlagship program. These materials will be developed in audio, video, DVD and other types of digital formats (both \n\n\n\nonline and off line), and printed textbooks. Currently a material development team headed by the center director \nand assisted by the local staff is being assembled to plan the following projects:\n\nProfessional Networking in China and the US: this course has taught in the OSU US-China Links program and \nFlagship program for many years and it is one of the most fundamental and effective courses in our program. We \nhave accumulated a rich collection of materials and experience that can be brought a useful set of materials.\n\nViewpoints, Perspectives and Presentations on US-China Relations: this is one of the hottest and most easily \nmishandled issues between the two countries. The course and its instructional material will focus on familiarizing \nthe students with Chinese perspectives, their ways of presenting those perspectives and effective strategies for \nresponding to these viewpoints.\n\nClassical Chinese in Contemporary Chinese discourse: The focus of this course and its materials is not to teach \nclassical Chinese as such, but to familiarize students with a body of Chinese classical texts that is still very much \npresent in modern Mandarin. The goal of these materials is to train the students to comprehend these texts and use \nthem appropriately and effectively in the context of contemporary Chinese discourse. Command of this kind of \nlanguage is taken as a mark of how sophisticated one's comprehension of Chinese culture is as well as how \nserious one's commitment to learning the Chinese language is. Consequently, it has direct impact on if one will be \nperceived as a serious participant in the discourse of Chinese professionals.\n\nOhio Language Summit and the Ohio Language Roadmap for the 21st Century\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn June 28, 2007 the Ohio Language Summit was held in Columbus at the Center for Science and Industry \n(COSI), sponsored locally by the OSU Chinese Flagship Program, the Educational Council, and the Ohio \nDepartment of Development and nationally by the US Departments of Defense, Commerce, and Labor. From \nacross Ohio, eighty-five participants from business, government, public service, and academics met to discuss the \nrelationship between foreign language and culture knowledge and the future of our State. The business and \ngovernment participants (65%) represented the demand for people with language and culture skills and the \neducators (35%) represented those who can affect the supply of these people in Ohio. Together they identified and \nprioritized the critical domestic and international language needs in Ohio. This was followed by a series of meetings \nof two Roadmap Design Teams--one domestic and one international--who prepared a report based on the findings \nof the Language Summit and their subsequent deliberations. On October 25, 2007, a condensed version of this \nreport, titled Ohio Language Roadmap for the 21st Century ( \nhttp://chineseflagship.osu.edu/ohiolanguagesummit/LanguageSummit  Report.pdf), was presented at an event \nwhere Dr. David S.C. Chu, United States Under Secretary of Defense; Lt. Governor Lee Fisher, director of the Ohio \nDepartment of Development; Dr. Joseph Alutto, Provost of Ohio State University; Deborah Gavlik, Associate Vice \nChancellor, Board of Regents, Dr. Susan Zelman, Ohio Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Professor Galal \nWalker, addressed the content of the document and it relevance to the economic and political security of our State \nand Nation.\n\nThe process continues: this event has been followed with subsequent meetings of the Design Teams who have \nfurther elaborated the descriptions and strategized the implementation of the five recommendations of the \nRoadmap, namely the 1) establishment of a Language and Culture Service Center, 2) a citizens' advocacy group, \n3) extended sequences of language instruction in Ohio schools, 4) extensive teacher training that includes the \ncapacity to employ technology, and 5) performance assessments in the crucial languages.\n\nSubsequently under the leadership of Dr. Randy Smith, Vice- Provost for Academic Affairs, Ohio State has \nconvened representatives of 13 public universities in Ohio to discuss sharing resources to create the Language and \nCulture Service Center, extended sequences of language instruction, and the citizens' advocacy group. In addition, \nOhio State is exploring the creation of an Institute of Advanced Language Study devoted to producing global \nprofessionals in a number of languages. The goal of these meetings among the public universities of Ohio is to \npresent a multi-institutional proposal to the newly formed University System of Ohio to establish joint efforts to deal \n\nhttp://chineseflagship.osu.edu/ohiolanguagesummit/LanguageSummit\n\n\nwith these issues of language and culture education. This activity is in line with the Strategic Plan for the University \nSystem of Ohio ( http://uso.edu/strategicplan/handbook/uso/relationships.php#50 ) recently promulgated by its \nChancellor Eric Fingerhut. Influenced by recent activities of the Ohio Department of Education, The Ohio Language \nRoadmap for the 21st Century, consulting with Dr. Robert Slater, and the realization that global education has a \ndirect relevance to Ohio's future, the Strategic Plan includes these actions aimed at strengthening international \neducation:\n\n* The University System of Ohio will encourage foreign language learning and will promote the teaching of less \ncommonly taught languages critical to support the state's international trade linkages (such as the languages of \nOhio's top 20 trade partners) and the country's national security interests.\n\n* The University System of Ohio and the Partnership for Continued Learning will work with the K-12 system to \nencourage the study of foreign languages as early as possible.\n\n* The University System of Ohio will work with Ohio's private colleges and universities to develop shared programs \nfor study abroad that are more affordable to Ohio students.\n\n* The University System of Ohio will work with Ohio's private institutions and the Ohio Department of Development \nto jointly market and promote Ohio's higher education offerings across the globe and to share the costs of recruiting \ninternational students.\n\n* The Board of Regents will encourage Ohio institutions to measure the satisfaction of international students with \nthe services provided at Ohio campuses and to compare them to key competitors in the United States and abroad \nin order to improve services.\n\n* The Board of Regents will work with the Ohio Department of Development to identify Ohio companies that have a \nsignificant global presence to develop internship opportunities for Ohio students, provide these businesses with \nhigher education resources to support their work in other countries, and to help solve overseas shortages of skilled \nmanpower through sponsored training and recruitment of foreign nationals to Ohio's institutions.\n\n* The Board of Regents will collect, through the Higher Education Information system, international educational data \nconcerning students, scholars, international educational opportunities, and research activities.\n\nWe found that agencies in government and public service have critical, sometimes life-and-death, needs for \nlanguage and culture expertise and that businesses have the same needs in order to grow their markets. In Ohio, \nbusiness participation did not primarily come from the major corporations that are already engaged in large-scale \ninternational trade. Rather representatives of small and medium sized firms who see international involvement as \npart of their growth pattern were much more interested in contributing to this effort. As it turns out, it is these kinds \nof firms that are driving economic development in Ohio. Our Lt. Governor has stated:\n\nEntrepreneurship is a key factor in turning Ohio's economy around. In many respects, Ohio's future economic \nprosperity will be built around new ideas, new products and new processes that capitalize on our state's existing \nassets and leverage global opportunities. That's why Ohio is dedicated to helping early- stage businesses by \nexpanding access to capital, thus improving the commercial viability of their generation of products and services. \n(see Poised for Growth: 2007 Ohio Venture Capital Report, Fisher College of Business, Center for \nEntrepreneurship)\n\nThis level of business involvement is consistent with combining language with culture and technical knowledge with \nan eye toward economic development--a reoccurring theme in the deliberations of the Roadmap Design Teams. \nOne of the discoveries of the Language Summit and Roadmap activities is the realization that our communities \ninclude numerous talented people who have rich experiences in dealing with other cultures and languages that they \nare willing to share with their fellow citizens. These global citizens are our best resource for building the capacity to \nmeet the challenges a global century will bring to our State and Nation. The following account reflects the on-going \nconcerns and deliberations of the Ohioans who are participating in these activities. We conclude this section with \nappendices presenting some of the data the Design Teams considered in their deliberations.\n\nhttp://uso.edu/strategicplan/handbook/uso/relationships.php#50\n\n\nCritical Domestic Language Needs\n\n1) What are the languages in which Ohio needs improved capacity? Spanish, Chinese, Somali, Russian, Japanese, \nKorean, Arabic, French, Amharic, Fulani\n\n2) What are the areas in which foreign language/cultural skill are needed? External: customer service; identifying \nand developing markets; medical/legal services; developing and presenting financial products; government and \nsocial services to immigrant/migrant communities (such as family services, economic aid, worker safety training); \nlibraries\n\nInternal: manager-employee relations; finding qualified language instructors 3) What are costs associated with lack \nof foreign language skills? Shortage of qualified teachers; lost business with Muslim community (e.g., financial \nproducts); monolingual companies lose immigrant community's business to firms that can reach out to them; poor \nmedical/emergency interpretation is life- threatening; time spent on cross-cultural issues in organizations with \nsignificant number of foreign-born employees; corporate image problem; lawsuits over non-performance of Title VI \nrequirements; inability to measure level of skills of interpreters/translators; cost of outsourcing foreign language \nskills to third-party vendors\n\n4) What are the current solutions or \"work-arounds\" to situations requiring language and culture skills?\n\nHire bilingual employees to reach out to immigrant communities; outsource translation/interpretation to outside \nvendors; hire English-speaking foreign nationals as interpreters or in-house bridges; utilize family members \n(children) to interpret for non- English-speaking elders, provide diversity training; create multilingual websites; \ndevelop PR campaigns for information dissemination, ignore opportunities that require language and culture \ncapacity.\n\nCritical International Language Needs\n\n1) What languages are needed?\n\nArabic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Vietnamese, French, Korean, German, Somali, \nHebrew, Italian, Hindi\n\n2) Where are foreign language and cultural skills needed?\n\nMarketing to foreign nationals/firms, especially in the auto industry and agriculture; understanding foreign \nregulations, especially regarding medical devices; engaging in negotiation, especially in the intermediate levels of \ncorporate contacts abroad; contract translation; customer service.\n\n3) What costs are associated with lack of foreign language skills?\n\nLost contracts; bad national and corporate image; serious inaccuracies due to the lack of a match between the \ntechnical knowledge and language knowledge on the part of translators/interpreters; good ideas opportunities often \nlost in - or due to lack of - translation (reduces the talent pool in global organization to English-speakers); loss of \ncompetitiveness in global markets.\n\n5) What are the current solutions or \"work-arounds\" to situations requiring language and culture skills?\n\nHire interpreters, provide training/education to increase Americans' foreign language/cultural skills; use \nlanguage/cultural skills of heritage speakers, take persons off their regular job assignments to deal with language \nissues, avoid markets or sources that require language skills.\n\nQuestions from the supply-side (public and private language educators) to the demand-side:\n\n-- How much language education is \"enough\" and what should the content include?\n\n-- How can supply and demand side organizations partner to produce what the demand-side needs?\n\n\n\n-- What language/cultural skills are needed and used in business?\n\nOhio: Chinese Flagship, Language Summit, and Language Roadmap Critical Ohio Language Themes\n\nLanguage Summit Supply and Demand participants identified 12 themes relevant to Ohio's language needs. Each \ngroup then determined the six most critical language needs in Ohio as listed below.\n\n1 The need for a workforce that is highly skilled in content\n\nFollowing this meeting, we invited two teams of concerned and uniquely qualified Ohioans to address the \ninternational and domestic challenges facing the State in its determination to expand its economy, improve its \nforeign language education, and deepen the understanding of its place in the world on the part of its citizenry. \nThese are the bases for assuring the future security of the State and the Nation and are what we intend to address \nin Ohio Language Roadmap for the 21st Century. The members of these teams believe that globalization of the \nworld economy is on-going and members of the teams observe that national economies in some parts of the world \nare expanding explosively. If Ohio is to thrive in this global competition, we will need management and a workforce \nthat can interact creatively and effectively with people from other cultures, be able to glean information and \ninnovations wherever they may occur in the world, capitalize on Ohio's strategic location, resources, and \ncapabilities, and fully develop opportunities where the state has a sustainable competitive advantage. Some Design \nTeam members see the failure to act decisively in preparing the Ohio economy to participate fully in the global \narena as a major failure of foresight and will. Consequently, Ohio must invest in preparing our people and \norganizations to deal with linguistic and cultural complexity by creating programs and institutions to promote and \ndevelop a broad capacity to conduct business effectively in the 21st century.\n\nThe Language Summit and the subsequent final report, the Ohio Language Roadmap for the 21st Century, are \nessentially a citizens' effort to identify is educational issues in the global challenges facing Ohio and possible \nsolutions to resolve our shortcomings. The purpose here is to state the basic situation and then challenge ourselves \nand others, especially those in leadership roles, to step up and lay the foundations for a better response to what \nlooks like an inevitable future.\n\nII. Strategic Vision\n\nWe see Ohio gaining a strategic advantage by redefining the role foreign language ability plays in Americans' \neducational and professional lives. Solidifying Ohio's successes in foreign trade and attracting foreign labor \nrequires recognizing the importance of foreign language skills in building trusting relationships with non-native \nspeakers of English at home and abroad. From the national to the local level, trust between communities from \ndifferent cultures reduces the potential for conflict, increases the opportunities for cooperation, and advances \ncollective security. The Roadmap Design Teams' action recommendations for Ohioans in government, business \nand education are captured by one strategic vision:\n\nIn Ohio, businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions will collaborate to create a multilingual \nworkforce by developing innovative programs that assure Ohioans of opportunities to gain advanced knowledge of \nforeign languages and cultures in conjunction with job-related technical and academic knowledge.\n\nBuilding a strong multi-lingual workforce that opens untapped global and domestic markets creates a stronger Ohio \neconomy. Our vision is that Ohioans with professionally-useful foreign language ability will create positive, trusting \nrelationships with people of other cultures and that these relationships will lead to the creation of new jobs and \nbusinesses. By leading the nation in strengthening global economic ties, Ohioans will also lead the nation in \nstrengthening state and national security through their ability to communicate effectively in critical languages.\n\nThese global professionals able to establish trusting relationships with speakers of foreign languages will be the \nproduct of innovative educational resources that promote lifelong culture and language learning from elementary \nschool into the workplace. Ohio can lead the nation by developing a visionary approach to early language and \nculture study that combines language study with core educational content such as mathematics, science, and social \nstudies. In this way Ohio students can become global professionals, able to communicate with counterparts around \n\n\n\nthe world on occupational and academic topics. This approach works not only with English speakers learning other \nlanguages, but also in helping Ohio's new immigrants become proficient in communicating their expertise in dual \nlanguage environments. Through distance learning technology, this model can be promoted in the work place.\n\nAs a nation of immigrants, the United States is in a unique position to be the cross-language, cross-cultural broker \nof world trade and finance. If Ohio can recognize this potential and act on it, adding language ability to our \nmarketing and management skills will keep Ohio competitive in a global service economy.\n\nIII. Action Agenda\n\nStrategic visions become reality through actions. To realize the strategic vision, the Ohio Design Teams divided \ntheir action recommendations into a set of projects to promote the supply of foreign language instruction and \nlearning and a set of projects to increase the demand for foreign language skills. Some of the recommendations \nrequire dramatic decision-making by Ohio's political, business and education leadership. Some would be low or no \ncost changes in the way organizations regard language and culture issues in our state.\n\nA. Pulling together resources to implement the Roadmap\n\nAction Item 1: Establish an Ohio Language and Culture Service Center (LCSC)\n\nThe Design Teams focused on the concept of a service center that would develop and organize foreign language \nand culture expertise. This expertise would be devoted to assisting Ohio citizens and organizations deal with the \nthemes that emerged from the Language Summit. This Ohio LCSC could be located in an appropriate government \nagency, in an institution of higher learning, or even exist as an independent non-profit organization, but it would be \ntasked with providing the basic infrastructure for expanding and improving the learning of foreign languages and \ncultures in the state and the application of language and culture skills in Ohio's public and private sectors. This \ncenter could also have satellite locations throughout the state (libraries, education centers, heritage community \ncenters), connected by technologies and shared interests.\n\nThe Roadmap Design Teams propose that the basic functions of such an organization include:\n\n1) Developing and managing databases of individuals available to Ohioans who have certified language proficiency \ncombined with expertise in technical and occupational areas, public and private resources for dealing with language \nand culture needs, and employment opportunities requiring language and culture skills\n\n2) Organizing and managing projects requiring foreign language capabilities (e.g., developing foreign language \nweb sites for companies and government agencies, researching markets in other countries, public relations \ncampaigns in foreign languages)\n\n3) Consulting and advising on educational programs in foreign languages, including providing summer language \nfield study and study abroad opportunities for Ohio language students and teachers. The LCSC should function as \na clearinghouse for language and culture learning opportunities for all Ohioans seeking to expand their abilities to \nsuccessfully navigate other societies.\n\n4) Organizing teacher training and advising on the development of foreign language programs\n\n5) Providing assessment of students' and professionals' foreign language skills and foreign language programs\n\n1) Serving as a venue for the interface between government offices and constituents where language issues arise.\n\nWhat are the outcomes of such a center?\n\nThe LCSC would be one location where Ohioans and Ohio companies could go to when confronting a problem \ninvolving language. If the Ohio LCSC is unable to provide a solution, it should be able to identify available \nresources, give examples of previous solutions developed for similar problems, estimate the cost of a solution and \nbe prepared to organize and manage projects. The LCSC would provide the means by which qualified individuals \n\n\n\ncan find cross- cultural work and where Ohioans can improve their knowledge of foreign cultures and languages \nthrough access to resources such as Ohio State's Individualized Instruction and on-line courses taught by colleges \nand universities across the state.\n\nThe LCSC will have updated information on services such as language hotlines where law enforcement, courts, \nhospitals or security stations at airports can call to find the appropriate interpretation service. If care is taken when \nplanning and organizing the LCSC, it will also be a \"go to\" organization where immigrants feel comfortable. As such \nit will be an ideal venue for government representatives to reach out to immigrant communities to inform them about \ngovernment policies and programs.\n\nThe end goal of establishing the LCSC is to aggregate and nurture the resources necessary for transitioning Ohio \nfrom a manufacturing-based economy strongly affected by off-shoring of operations to a robust future-oriented \neconomy drawing strength and resilience from Ohio's strategic location, resources, and capabilities, and from \ndynamic expansion into national and global markets where the state has a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nTo be successful the LCSC would have to be built on a broad collaboration of education, government, and \nbusiness. The expertise of our strongest educational institutions must accommodate the needs of government \nagencies and businesses, share information on personnel and resources, and a provider- client relationship \nnurtured. If we are right in predicting that Ohio's economy will become increasingly global, the demand for these \nservices will be sufficient to sustain the expert staff this facility will require.\n\nWhich organizations might be the drivers for this project?\n\nThree state agencies are most concerned with cross-cultural interaction: the Ohio Departments of Development, \nAgriculture and Jobs and Family Services. The Departments of Development and Agriculture are tasked with \ncreating job opportunities for Ohioans through export and foreign direct investment; the department of Jobs and \nFamily Services is responsible for making sure that available job opportunities and government services are \ncommunicated to all Ohioans, including those with limited English proficiency. Federal agencies in Labor, \nCommerce, Education and Health & Human Services will be interested in the LCSC because of the positive impact \non workforce and trade. Trade associations will find added capacity for their membership to engage foreign \nlanguage communities. Law enforcement agencies such as the TSA, FBI, and local police will appreciate having a \none-stop location for resolving language issues. The Ohio Department of Education will have a powerful resource \nfor implementing its future foreign language policies.\n\nWhat would be the timeframe for establishing such an organization?\n\nThe LCSC will require five years to establish funding, staff and a physical location. If an existing facility such as the \nWorld Media and Culture Center at Ohio State could be expanded to serve this function, the timeframe might be \nshortened. The first two years need to be devoted to developing and managing standardized assessments, \nassessing foreign language speakers and building the databases that will serve as the basis for Ohio LCSC \nconsulting operations.\n\nHow the Ohio LCSC Contributes to the Strategic Vision\n\nSuch a Center will serve both a symbolic and practical function. It will symbolize to Ohio the social value of \nindividuals from other countries and of Ohioans who have developed the capacity to effectively communicate in \nforeign languages and cultures.\n\nThrough the use of a variety of world media technology such as satellite television and Internet news sources with \nelectronic dictionaries, the Center and its affiliated locations around the state can embody the spirit of the strategic \nvision, providing a venue for continued learning of language and culture as well as developing a welcoming social \nenvironment where heritage communities and their Ohio neighbors can interact.\n\n\n\nThe mutual understanding that comes from interaction and education reduces the mistrust that exists between \ncultures; the concentration of foreign language and culture expertise and language-related activities produces an \nenvironment here in Ohio where any American can be immersed in the foreign culture of their study or interest.\n\nAction Item 2: Create a networking organization, Language Partnering for Life (LPL)\n\nRoadmap Design Teams suggest that the LCSC organize a service organization that brings together public and \nprivate groups with a stake in cross-cultural understanding and communication. This group, tentatively named \nLanguage Partnering for Life (LPL), will be associated with the Ohio LCSC and will provide the community base for \nlife-long learning, putting individuals in touch with native speakers of languages they are studying and activities \nbased on the media sources of the Center. Functioning like a Rotary Club with many language-based sub-groups, \nthe LPL will organize international events, culture-festivals, trips abroad, and study groups. Drawing on the \nleadership of business and public organizations with vested interests in cross-cultural communication, the LPL will \nprovide the social motivation for continued language learning and for networking with persons of like interests. \nFunctioning in conjunction with the Ohio LCSC, this organization can provide the state agencies, local \ngovernments, and Ohio businesses with access to individuals who can facilitate interactions with foreign visitors \nwho are in Ohio to conduct business or simply to enjoy the amenities of the state. The LPL could play a key role in \nmaking sure foreign tourists and sojourners in Ohio have a good chance to experience the state on a personal \nlevel by including them in LPL activities and introducing them to LPL members across the state. Working with the \nLCSC, LPL will develop language and culture training programs for organizations and localities interested in \nattracting foreign direct investment to Ohio. Ohio has much to offer foreign firms, but it must be packaged and \npresented in such a way that these firms are made to feel welcome to Ohio.\n\nUsing the facilities of the LCSC and LPL, or the affiliated language programs of universities, colleges and \ncommunity colleges, individualized instruction programs, specialized language study groups (e.g., \"business \nSpanish\"), or language maintenance courses such as Japanese-for-anime-fans can be offered as a volunteer or \nfee-based activity. University language programs can cooperate to create foreign language mentorships such as \nEngineering in French or Medical Care in Somali.\n\nThese venues can be made accessible to a wide range of learners and can involve members of heritage \ncommunities and special interest groups who want to share their languages and cultures.\n\nWhat are the desired outcomes of the LPL?\n\nThe LPL office will compile a list of interested stakeholders in Ohio's globally-oriented communities and be the \ndriving force behind information sharing and networking among them. This information sharing will help guide \nfunding to groups who need it, help groups find synergies for growth, and help organizations with similar goals pool \ntheir resources. One example of such organizations are Ohio's sister city associations. Ohio cities with sister cities \nabroad currently act independently of each other, and, for the most part 1 , independently of other organizations in \ntheir city such as local universities, law enforcement, chambers of commerce, and even local government offices. \nThrough personal connections in the LPL, Ohio cities and their sisters abroad will discover rich opportunities for \ncross- cultural learning and trade.2\n\nThe LPL office will also organize meetings of its members so that the demand side of the world language equation \ncan regularly communicate their needs to the supply side. With regular input from the end users of the education \nsystem's product, educators can continuously improve foreign language education to fit current needs, including \nshifting resources to a newly identified critical/high-need foreign language.\n\nThe Ohio University language survey results indicate that Ohio's suburbanites are more likely to support foreign \nlanguage education than residents of urban and rural areas, but that a large segment of the state's population does \nnot believe foreign language ability brings job opportunities. With Ohio's industrial cities in decline and agriculture \ncompeting globally for markets, the demographics that most need new paths to profitability are the groups least \ncognizant of the benefits of foreign language skills. The LPL will be an excellent medium through which success \nstories involving foreign-language speaking Ohioans can be shared with state decision makers in business and \n\n\n\ngovernment. Anecdotal and qualitative data relating foreign language skills to increased business and happier \nimmigrant populations already exist, but they lack a group like LPL to disseminate them.\n\nWhich organizations might be the drivers for this project?\n\nThe Ohio International Trade Division, as a representative of the state's export interests, will be interested in the \nLPL's ability to find/create opportunities for its constituents. The Ohio Tourist Office will find this organization helpful \nin developing tourism from abroad. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and trade associations will expand their \nforeign resources. The Ohio Department of Education will have access to an organization of advocates and \nadvisors for their future foreign language policies. Ohio's heritage communities and international organizations will \nhave an umbrella organization through which their concerns can be amplified.\n\nWhat would be the timeframe for establishing such an organization?\n\nIt will take two years to organize membership, drawing on the databases organized by the Ohio LCSC. After that, it \nwill take two to three years to build committed partnerships and develop a strategic plan for advancing the LPL's \ngoals. How does the LPL contribute to the Strategic Vision?\n\nMany individuals and organizations already share the strategic vision for Ohio's future, but do not know there are \nothers like them in the state. The LPL can provide the focus on language and culture and provide the social vehicle \nfor articulating problems and working toward solutions. Handled correctly, this organization can be a desirable \naffiliation for the individuals and organizations that are or are intending to play on the global stage.\n\nIn addition to articulating problems, the LPL also articulates success stories of Ohioans using foreign language \nskills in their careers, generating demand for more such individuals and pushing a virtuous cycle of foreign \nlanguage supply and demand.\n\nB. Developing educational models and resources for lifetime foreign language learning and teaching\n\nThe strategy for assuring that the next generation of Ohioans will be players in the global competition for economic \nand cultural advantage should focus on making effective language instruction available across the state and in \nproviding motivation for developing and maintaining high-level language abilities. The Design Teams suggested \ntactics for seeing that strategy to a successful conclusion. Dovetailing with FLAC recommendations, some tactics \nwill require political allocations of scarce resources, some will only require us to rethink current practices and \nconsider the redirection of current resources to more effective use.\n\nAction Item 3: Developing long sequences of foreign language study\n\nThe long-term goal is to establish extensive articulated programs of instruction in critical languages. Depending on \nthe capacities of local communities, such programs should begin in the early elementary grades. If such sequences \nare not available in certain languages at lower levels, then institutions of higher education should institute extended \nsequences of language instruction focused on developing students who are capable of functioning in career \nenvironments, even if these sequences must extend into graduate levels to achieve these goals. The longer the \nsequence, the better.\n\nFor producing high-ability graduates, the length of time students are exposed to quality language training is the best \nindicator of consistently achieving success. Many education institutions in Asia and Europe are opting for a full K-16 \nsequence, with the role of dual-language schools becoming increasingly important. The one feature of sequential \nyears of foreign language study that cannot be ignored is that the sequence must lead to continued study. A K-12 \nprogram should not be attempted unless there is intention and commitment to continue the entire sequence and \nencourage graduates to continue their use of the language in college, in their work, or by spending time in \ncountries where the language is spoken. Based on Ohio's current and anticipated foreign language needs, \nlanguages that should be taught in extended sequences include (in alphabetical order): Arabic, Chinese, French, \nGerman, Japanese, and Russian. Different localities around Ohio may have reasons for including other languages \n\n\n\nin this list. Here are some tactics for realizing these extended sequences of foreign language study in schools \nacross Ohio.\n\nOhio: Chinese Flagship, Language Summit, and Language Roadmap\n\nRegional focus on particular languages: Supporting an extended sequence of foreign language study is a \nsignificant commitment for any school or school system; therefore, the choice of which language sequence should \nbe adopted is critical. For the state of Ohio, it would be beneficial if different communities focused on different \nlanguages, perhaps based on the availability of language resources in that community. Toledo would find extensive \nresources for developing an Arabic sequence, Central Ohio would find reasons for focusing on Chinese and \nJapanese, and the Cleveland area would find local resources for choosing to develop sequences in Russian and \nEastern European languages. Refer to the following chart to see a regional distribution of immigrants in Ohio. \nPlease note that Arabic speakers seem to be left out of this chart. Ohio Immigrant Population by Metropolitan Area \nand Region of Birth (2000) Materials development for early foreign language education in less-commonly-taught \nlanguages: There is a severe shortage of teaching materials for use in elementary and middle schools, especially \nfor the so-called \"less commonly taught languages\" such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Farsi, Korean.\n\nA concerted effort is necessary to produce the multimedia materials numerous enough to provide instructors with a \nchoice. For early childhood learning materials, there is a need for language and culture experts to join forces with \nearly childhood learning experts to create the most effective learning environments for pre-K through fifth grade \nlearners. Since these sets of expertise usually reside in different parts of the major universities that are not \naccustomed to working together, institutional leadership must encourage these kinds of cooperative projects to be \nundertaken.\n\nIntegration of foreign language education and content education: Language, unlike technical areas like math and \nhistory, can be used as a medium for communication rather than just a subject itself. Research shows that \nadvanced levels of foreign language ability are only reached when learners are able to use the language as a \nmedium of exchange in a particular field. Educational institutions can take advantage of these findings and \nintegrate foreign language education with other fields of knowledge: mathematics, science, technology, public \npolicy, or engineering. The end result should be students who can work in the languages they have studied. For \nexample, one American who learned Chinese and earned an MBA in the US now oversees a Chinese factory for its \nAmerican owners. Being bilingual and bicultural, the American is able to communicate American business needs to \nthe Chinese factory in a way that makes sense to the Chinese while at the same time explaining the Chinese \nemployees' needs and concerns to the US.\n\nIntegrated subject and foreign language education can be found in immersion schools, dual-language schools, \nlanguages for special purposes courses, and internships. In Columbus' K-8 French immersion school Ecole \nKenwood, students already receive 50% of their instruction in French by grade 5; at the Ohio State University, \nChinese Flagship Program graduate students work with Chinese mentors to complete practical research in their \nmajor. Copying such programs in more places, in more languages and in more grades, Ohio can assume the lead \nin American schools by shifting the role of foreign language instruction in the overall educational process.\n\nSupplying motivations for studying in extended sequences of foreign language instruction: There are many ways to \nencourage students to achieve high-level language proficiencies in their student careers. Some of these steps are \nnearly cost-free, while others will require institutions to allocate significant resources.\n\nAn example of the former is the acknowledgment of achievement of foreign language proficiency on diplomas and \ntranscripts. High school diplomas could acknowledge a demonstrated ability in \"advanced\" language (a foreign \nlanguage and English) and universities could acknowledge the \"superior\" level of ability in language. This would \nrequire schools to consider foreign language ability on par with honors designations. A more costly \nacknowledgement of achievement in foreign languages would be a tuition rebate for college graduates who can \ndemonstrate \"superior\" language competence. Such rebates could be adjusted to reward achievement in critical \nlanguages more generously than achievement in more widely studied languages. A 10% to 20% rebate on tuition \nwould be powerful enough to increase the number of students graduating with the desired language abilities. \n\n\n\nGovernments and private industry can also establish scholarships to support students who are studying both a \nforeign language and an employable skill. For example, there could be a Proctor & Gamble scholarship for Spanish \nMarketing awarded to a student who creates a Spanish-language marketing strategy that bridges to Latino \nconsumers.\n\nStudy Abroad, Community Service and Internships: Through sister city partnerships, corporate relations with \nforeign operations, individual connections, university development and alumni offices, opportunities can be \ndeveloped in foreign communities for students and graduates of extended sequence programs to develop working \nexperiences in their languages of study. For example, the University of Dayton's School of Engineering could ask \nits counterpart in sister city Augsburg, Germany to help arrange internships for German-speaking mechanical \nengineering students at leading German truck and engine maker MAN Diesel.\n\nWhat are the desired outcomes of the extended sequences of foreign language study in Ohio schools?\n\nBasing foreign language study on extended sequences acknowledges the nature of the process of learning to \ncommunicate in a foreign language. Researchers show that socialization in one's own culture takes from 25,000 to \n35,000 hours of intimate interactions with doting caregivers; becoming socialized in both one's own culture and a \nsecond culture is an ongoing endeavor that will be nurtured and encouraged by extended sequences. By the time \nour students reach college, they can be in a position to learn to perform professional tasks in their chosen foreign \nlanguages. If a student has learned to speak general-use Spanish by the time of high school graduate, s/he can \nlearn, for example, engineering Spanish in college. A tier-1 auto parts supplier recently brought a Mexican engineer \nto a plant in Ohio to improve communications after discovering that his American predecessor was unable to break \nthe culture barrier and failed to communicate the needs of customers GM and Ford to plants in Mexico. Ohioans \n(including Hispanic-American Ohioans) trained in professional engineering Spanish would have been able to \nresolve the communication problems without the supplier having to move the Mexican engineer, his wife and their \nthree children to Ohio.\n\nAn integral part of achieving professional ability in foreign language environments is having practical training in the \nform of internships. Americans on internships abroad will learn how to apply their classroom achievements to the \nspecific environments of their target cultures. Through the former US/China Links program and now the Chinese \nFlagship graduate program, Ohio State University students of Chinese have been placed in 5+ month internships in \nChina where they have learned how to entertain Chinese cruise ship guests, attract foreign investment, produce \nChinese television shows, and create financial reports. Many forms of knowledge can only be acquired through \nexperience, and internships abroad will inculcate Americans with experiential knowledge while reinforcing their \nforeign language abilities.\n\nWhich organizations might be the drivers for establishing extended sequences of language study?\n\nIt will be necessary for the Ohio Department of Education to promulgate the practice of regional language \nemphasis. The US Department of Education can direct resources to extended-sequence programs. The US \nDepartments of Defense, Commerce and Labor will be interested in the impact this will have on workforce \ndevelopment. The Ohio Board of Regents, Ohio university presidents, university deans and department chairs, and \nuniversity development offices will see the advantages of combining foreign language study with academic and \ncareer goals.\n\nLocal school systems will develop special expertise in particular languages, with Columbus creating programs to \nteach Somali and Toledo to teach Arabic. Private foundations with educational and international missions will view \nthese reforms as models for the rest of the country. Publishers of educational materials in the US and in the \ncountries of the languages being studied will see extended sequences as an expanding market for their products.\n\nWhat would be the timeframe for establishing extended sequences of foreign language study in Ohio schools?\n\ni. Articulated early FL education: 7-8 years (based on FLAC estimates)\n\nii. Materials development: 5-10 years\n\n\n\niii. Integration of foreign language and academic subjects: 5-10 years\n\niv. Scholarships and rebates for language proficiency: 1-3 years\n\nv. Acknowledgements of language proficiency: Immediately\n\nvi. Internships: Immediately\n\nHow would extended sequences contribute to the Strategic Vision?\n\nEstablishing extended sequences of foreign language study that are integrated with other academic and technical \nsubjects will cause a paradigm shift in foreign language education. The Design Teams consider this a necessity if \nthe needs identified by the Language Summit are to be met. It will take the entire education system to produce \nindividuals ready to work in foreign language environments--from the political will to focus on foreign language \ncapacity as a workforce issue, to the strategic educational decisions to focus on particular languages and academic \nlevels, to the daily implementation of performance-based instruction. Whether the individual is in Ohio working with \nforeign language speakers or is in a foreign land as a representative of an Ohio organization, the skills necessary \nfor interacting with foreign language speakers on their terms require more time to acquire than any single \neducational institution can provide. For this reason, the Design Teams again agree with FLAC that articulation \nacross all levels of education is the only viable and scalable means of consistently producing Ohioans who can use \nworld languages in all aspects of their personal and work lives.\n\nAction Item 4: Train, license and employ more teachers educated in the use of technology and develop networked \nprograms around these qualified teachers\n\nEspecially when FLAC and Design Team recommendations for extended sequences of foreign language study are \nimplemented across the state, there will be many more positions for foreign language teachers than there are \ncurrently individuals qualified to fill those positions. Growth in Spanish enrollments are driving the need for trained \nlanguage educators in Ohio, but the creation of entirely new less-commonly taught language programs is also \npointing the state toward a severe shortage of well-trained foreign language teachers.\n\nOne solution to the problem has been the establishment of the Governor's Alternative Licensure Program (ALP). \nCreated to fill teacher shortages across a number of subjects, the ALP has seen mixed results in producing \nqualified instructors that are immediately hired. For languages with broad appeal like French and Spanish, the \npositive results of the ALP are clear. Under traditional licensure procedures, 25 institutions of higher education \nproduced about 225 language teachers per year. In one cohort, ALP produced 120 qualified language instructors. \nBecause of their popularity with students and administrators, there is a shortage of teachers for French and Spanish \nprograms across the state, but there is also dire need for qualified teachers of \"critical languages\" such as Chinese, \nArabic and Farsi.\n\nThis shortfall has many causes: few schools hire such teachers, few training programs produce such teachers and \nthere are few authorized programs granting teaching licenses in these languages. While the need for fully certified \nteachers of critical languages looms large in the minds of the participants in the Language Summit and the Design \nTeams, the lack of demand and supply has made it difficult to move in that direction.\n\nThe Governor's Alternative Licensure Program in languages such as Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese was an \nattempt to break this stalemate. This program produced a few dozen trainees qualified for certification, mostly in \nChinese. However, only a few of these individuals were hired by Ohio schools. One reason was the availability of \nvolunteer, or \"free,\" teachers from China, provided by the Office of the Chinese Language Council International \nthrough the College Board and other cooperating agencies. These volunteers seemed to diminish the market for the \nChinese teachers trained in Ohio who are qualified for licensure. This experience shows us that the state must \nhave an overall policy for developing the human resources to meet its long-term needs. The opportune grasping at \nall available solutions can easily develop into harmful contradictions that impede the development of the \ninfrastructure necessary for making Ohio a leader in foreign language education.\n\n\n\nThe first step toward creating an overall language teacher training policy is to start a campaign to convince Ohio \neducators to build substantial language programs in their schools. Then develop the supply chain by:\n\n1) Developing more high quality, accelerated teacher training programs for high-need, critical languages\n\n2) Establishing more regular teacher training programs in universities and private training centers\n\n3) Recruiting college educated heritage speakers to become licensed teachers of critical languages\n\n4) Training teachers how to use technology creatively and effectively in foreign language instruction.\n\nAs the need for qualified foreign language teachers reaches a critical stage, departments of education may \nconsider programs that offer subsidies to schools for hiring qualified teachers. Such subsidies could have time limits \nand be offered with the understanding that the local school will continue successful foreign language programs.\n\nAs we develop a corps of qualified teachers in critical languages, Ohio should think outside the box and create a \nseries of language courses that are accessible through the Internet. We should strive to provide the widest range of \nOhio students with opportunities to study the languages they want to learn. Even if a school or school district offers \nan extended sequence of language courses, it cannot do so for more than one or two languages. However, it could \nmake other possibilities available to students if qualified teachers are connected to students in schools throughout \nthe state by means of the Internet and other instructional technologies. Examples of such networked programs are \nthe Regents Chinese Academy (summer 2007) and the Distance Chinese Individualized Instruction Program at \nOhio State.\n\nWhat are the desired outcomes of having qualified teachers and networked programs?\n\nThe primary goal of increased teacher training and the creation of multi-school programs is to accelerate the state's \ncapacity to teach foreign languages. While it is not practical for every school in every school district to have \ndifferent teachers for all the target languages, different districts can focus on specific languages and offer other \nlanguages through the Internet. As many experts have pointed out, learning a second foreign language is easier \nthan learning a first one; thus, students who happen to live in a district with elementary school Russian are not \nfated to learning only Russian in their lives - they may pick up a different language later on in their student career \nas they attend schools with other options or qualify for a networked program.\n\nA standardized teacher licensure program will lead to growth in teacher programs and a greater number of licensed \nteachers. Because foreign language education will become integrated with subject teaching, teacher training will \nhave to include team teaching skills so that foreign language teachers-to-be become comfortable with and effective \nin having a supporting role in subject learning. As language proficiencies spread and subject- matter teachers are \nimported (virtually or actually) from other countries to teach their subjects in American schools, the licensure \nprocesses will need to be streamlined and made less burdensome on potential teachers.\n\nWith technology employed in the classroom and beyond, we can integrate current internet and television content \ninto language instruction, have students interact with foreign nationals in the target language in speech and \nwriting, and use videoconferencing technologies to take foreign language education to areas of Ohio that would \notherwise be unable to provide early or varied foreign language education choices.\n\nHaving networked programs would allow small groups of students interested in studying a language not offered \nlocally to combine with similar groups across the state and form complete language classes. Thus, isolated \nstudents of a language can participate in a fully resourced course under a qualified instructor. Networked programs \ncould include the idea of creating multi-school classrooms and global connections between Ohio classrooms and \nclassrooms throughout the world. Which organizations might be the drivers for having qualified teachers and \nnetworked programs?\n\nThe Ohio Department of Education, in cooperation with university schools of education, and with organizational \nsupport from FLAC, can simplify certification processes. Interstate teacher associations can develop agreements on \naccepting certification between states. Private teacher training schools can offer training programs based on the \n\n\n\npublished standards for certification. Heritage community organizations can identify and encourage qualified \nindividuals to become certified teachers. Local school districts can offer wider choices to their students.\n\nWhat would be the timeframe for having qualified teachers and networked programs?\n\nIt will take two years to create accelerated teacher certification programs based on existing ones (e.g., accelerated \nArabic, Japanese and Chinese alternative licensure programs at Ohio State, the University of Findlay and \nCleveland State). It will take another three years to establish new teacher training programs for critical languages in \nschools of education throughout the state. It will take an undetermined number of years to change federal policies \nregarding visa requirements so that more heritage speakers are eligible to matriculate into these programs (e.g., \nspouses of international students). It will take two years to develop instructional materials describing use of \ntechnology in the classroom. Clusters of networked programs can be set up within one year.\n\nHow would having qualified teachers and networked programs contribute to the strategic vision?\n\nWithout qualified teachers, students cannot learn foreign languages. As foreign language education programs \nincrease in quantity and the expectations for proficiency rise across the country, standardized teacher qualifications \nand certification will contribute to articulation across grades, across localities, and even across languages.\n\nEven with a host of extra-curricular learning opportunities available to learners of all ages (from watching foreign \ncartoons to internships), qualified foreign language teachers are necessary for leading the language learning \nexperience.\n\nNetworked programs under the direction of qualified teachers can extend language learning opportunities \nthroughout the state, bringing the economic and security benefits (e.g., smooth interaction with public services) to \nmembers of all Ohio communities.\n\nAction Item 5: Create performance-based tools for assessing foreign language learners' ability to communicate \neffectively\n\nAssessment instruments for identifying an individual's skill and task proficiencies in a given language and a \nprogram's effectiveness are key to the development of the infrastructure that will sustain this effort. Once the goal of \nlanguage study is determined to be the ability to work in the language, performance- based assessments can \nprovide standards for language proficiency and language teaching qualifications.\n\nThe LCSC can assemble and distribute currently available assessment instruments (e.g., OPI, STAMP test, CAAP \ntests, NOELLA, SOPI), as well as create new assessment instruments using the latest technology and pedagogical \nresearch. In the Internet age, assessments can be implemented from any location and databases maintained to \nidentify persons and organizations with language and teaching qualifications.\n\nWhat are the desired outcomes of reliable performance-based assessments in foreign language study?\n\nIf performance-based tests and portfolio assessments reflect whether or not students are able to use foreign \nlanguage skills to communicate with foreign counterparts, teachers who are inclined to \"teach to the test\" will \nemphasize performance in their instruction. If progressing to higher levels of instruction is tied to performance in \nthe target culture, as sports is tied to the playing fields and music to the recital hall, students will clearly understand \nthe nature of learning to communicate in a foreign language.\n\nEffective assessment will require the creation of third-party assessment agencies.\n\nAssessment should not be controlled by the schools or programs that teach the languages. Bureaucracies \nresponsible for evaluating their own achievements tend to report success. Also, independent assessments will \nmake it possible to compare language programs across schools and regions which will facilitate the improvement of \nlanguage instruction in general. With commonly- accepted standards for assessment in place, third party assessors \ncan be tasked to assess foreign language programs and their learners throughout the state.\n\n\n\nWhich organizations might be the drivers for creating effective assessment tools?\n\nUnder this plan, the Ohio and US Departments of Education will be key in establishing the need for effective and \nassessment instruments. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), as the current \nstandard-bearer of language proficiency, will play a role in developing broader assessment tools. The Departments \nof Defense and State, including the Interagency Language Roundtable, will play an important role in the use and \nvalidation of such assessment tools. Language-based and subject-based teaching associations will contribute to \ncreating content-appropriate standards.\n\nWhat would be the timeframe for establishing reliable assessment for language study? In conjunction with the \ndevelopment of organizations such as the Ohio LCSC, an assessment center could be partially operational within \nthree years and fully operational in five years.\n\nHow would reliable assessment instruments contribute to the Strategic vision?\n\nEffective assessment tools are necessary in order to measure progress toward realizing the goals of creating a \nmultilingual workforce and developing the educational programs necessary to doing that.\n\nThe Roadmap Design Teams' recommendations were reached after several weeks of reviewing data and \ndiscussing the current state of foreign language education and use in Ohio. The following sections contextualize \nthe environment in which the preceding recommendations were born, describing Ohio's level of globalization from a \nstatistical perspective as well as Ohio's current foreign language capacity strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIV. The Current State of Play\n\nOverview\n\nThanks to its strong manufacturing and agricultural base and well- established higher education system, Ohio is \ncurrently a highly internationalized state:\n\n-- 20.6% of Ohio manufacturing jobs are linked to exports, mostly in vehicles and machinery\n\n-- Ohio's agricultural export volume was 13th in the nation in 2005 and 6th in soybean exports\n\n-- Ohio ranks #7 in non-bank foreign direct investment and 8th in # of foreign direct investment jobs\n\n-- Ohio's international students rank ninth in the nation in their economic contribution to the state (tuition, living \nexpenses, etc)\n\n-- Ohio agriculture depends on immigrant labor for harvesting and milking. At last count, 15,782 migrant laborers \nworked in Ohio.\n\n-- The top countries with businesses in Ohio are: Japan (339), Germany (165) and Canada (129)\n\nOhio's aggregate success in internationalization also reflects the migration of manufacturing jobs - once Ohio's \nbackbone - to Canada, Mexico and Asia.\n\nWhile Ohio corporations have benefited from off-shoring goods and services, Ohio's workers have seen their \nopportunities decline. The data below describes Ohio's needs for greater internationalization in such areas as labor \nmanagement and tourism:\n\n-- Only 3% of documented Ohio residents were born outside the United States. . . but that number (and another \npossible 75,000 undocumented immigrants) is greater than the population of Cincinnati\n\n-- Only 7.3% of the labor force in the Midwest is foreign born. . . but immigrants accounted for 83% of labor force \ngrowth here\n\n\n\n-- 18,465 interpretations were performed in Ohio courts 2003- 2004. . . but 30% of court interpreters have not been \nrequired to provide qualification of their skill\n\n-- Canadians comprise the largest group of international visitors to Ohio, with German- and English-speaking \nEuropeans following - all of whom speak languages already commonly spoken by Ohioans\n\n-- The #1 destination for Ohio State students studying abroad is England. Numbers 6, 9 and 10 are also English-\nbased programs in English-speaking locations\n\nThe Private Sector and Foreign Languages\n\nAs far as Ohio business is concerned, the issue is not how many foreign language majors Ohio's education system \nproduces every year, but how many graduates are ready to work in foreign language environments. In the \nabsence of Spanish-speaking accountants or Chinese-speaking mechanical engineers, large Ohio companies \nprefer to rely on US-educated natives of the target culture - and large budgets - to cross the cultural barrier. \nSmaller employers cannot afford to spend large amounts of money to resolve cross-cultural communication \nproblems, but also cannot afford to hire the few employees who have mastered both a technical specialty and \nforeign language skills.\n\nThe labor market for professionally-skilled foreign language speakers in Ohio presents a chicken-and-egg \nproblem: there are very few potential employees who are technically skilled and speak a foreign language at \nadvanced levels, so employers are satisfied with only technical skill; students see that foreign language skill does \nnot make them any more competitive and so they do not pursue the difficult road of mastering a foreign language \nand a technical skill.\n\nAs one Ohio State foreign language major discovered, many American jobs situated in foreign language \nenvironments are expatriate assignments reserved for middle and upper level management. Even students who \nhave majored in a technical field and achieved a high level of foreign language ability before graduating are faced \nwith the prospect of having to work for ten years in non-foreign language-using positions before they can even be \nconsidered for expatriate assignment.\n\nForeign Language Use and the Public Sector\n\nFor the most part, Ohio government offices' foreign language needs lie in serving the Latinos that comprise a large \nportion of the state's agricultural workforce. Following Spanish, other top language needs encountered by Ohio \ngovernment offices include: Somali, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Spanish is far and away the most-\nneeded foreign language in Ohio's public sector.\n\nDue to Title VI requirements to make government services available regardless of citizens' English skills, various \nOhio offices have taken steps to translate and interpret commonly- encountered materials. In 2003, Ohio courts \nspent $982,000 on over 18,000 court interpretations; the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services has \nSpanish-speaking staff to interact with immigrant constituents; Ohio law enforcement officials have available to \nthem cards that say \"I need an interpreter for [language X]\" in case they encounter a language barrier.\n\nInterpretation and translation is generally provided by private third parties, some of whom hold qualifications for \ntheir languages skills, but many of whom do not, relying only on their work experience to demonstrate their ability. \nSome Ohio offices also rely on heritage speakers such as Latino-Americans to interact with members of the target \ncommunity.\n\nForeign Language Education\n\nOhio: Chinese Flagship, Language Summit, and Language Roadmap\n\nAccording to the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages, foreign language enrollment in Ohio \noutgrew foreign language enrollment across the nation as a whole. A 2002 Modern Language Association report \nshowed that pre-college foreign language enrollments in the Midwest compared favorably to other regions of the \n\n\n\nnation, with Spanish enrollment second only to the South Atlantic, French enrollment third behind the South Atlantic \nand Northeast and German and Japanese enrollments well ahead of all other regions in the country.\n\nFew Ohio schools offer foreign languages for elementary students. In a few instances Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, \nGerman, French, Spanish, Russian, are offered at the kindergarten level. . . but only about 4,500 kindergarten \nstudents in all of Ohio received any language instruction in 2005-2006, compared to nearly 87,000 high school \nsophomores. These languages and Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Swahili, and Polish are all offered in the public schools, \nbut as is common across the country, the most popular languages remain Spanish, French and German.\n\nNationally, the top five world languages by enrollment are, in order: Spanish, French, German, Italian and \nJapanese. In Ohio, the popular world languages were: Spanish, French, German, Latin and Italian.\n\nFor most public school students in Ohio, there simply are no other alternatives to studying French, German or \nSpanish\n\nV. Gap Analysis of Ohio's Current State of Play\n\nOhio has a number of assets that promote the study and use of foreign languages amongst its citizens; and like \nany other state, Ohio faces many obstacles to improving the current foreign language learning situation. In this \nsection, we offer an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats regarding Ohio's ability to \nimprove its citizens' ability to interact with people for whom English is not their first language.\n\nStrengths\n\nEducation\n\nOhio's education system stands out amongst all its other strengths. In addition to having an excellent network of \nprimary and secondary schools, Ohio is home to many well-respected universities. In addition to four-year \ninstitutions, Ohio has many forward-looking community colleges that are geared toward practical education and \nserve populations that want to see a direct relationship between their education and their work.\n\nEleven of Ohio's 13 public universities offer foreign language majors and Ohio universities sent nearly 9,000 \nstudents on study abroad programs in the 2004/2005 school year. Within our borders, the Ohio State University is \nhome to Chinese Flagship programs for K-16 Chinese education and beyond as well as home to a Title- VI-funded \nCenter for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) and the National East Asian Languages \nResource Center. With few Ohioans more than 75 miles away from some institution of higher learning, Ohio has an \nexcellent existing system through which foreign language/culture outreach can be conducted.\n\nPerhaps because Ohio has so many universities, some of them recognize that they must be innovative in order to \ncompete. One consulting firm in Cleveland, China Source Link, is working with the University of Akron to develop \nforeign language certification for students in technical majors. Graduates in such fields as engineering and \narchitecture will be tested and awarded proficiency certificates that they can show to potential employers and justify \nthe salaries that bilinguals with technical skills should earn.\n\nAs numerous as Ohio's universities are, its rural citizens are spread over a large territory. Universities like Ohio \nState are taking a leading role in offering foreign language distance education to rural communities. Through \ndistance education, learners in otherwise isolated communities are beginning to enjoy top-notch foreign language \ninstruction.\n\nAnother important strength of Ohio's universities is their international student population. In the 2005/2006 school \nyear, Ohio universities had the 9th highest number of international students of all 50 states. The students not only \ncontribute to the local economy, but their very presence internationalizes discussion in class and helps Ohio \nstudents learn to work with people from very different backgrounds. When they graduate, these students also \nprovide Ohio with a ready population of bilingual workers with technical skill.\n\n\n\nThough higher education has traditionally been the center of attention for foreign language study, it is becoming \nclear that training for professionally-useful levels of foreign language proficiency should start earlier for some \nlanguages and must start earlier for several others (i.e., Arabic, Japanese, Korean and Chinese). Ohio is a \nnationally-recognized leader in pre- college foreign language education, and its legislature recently put its weight \nbehind \"early\" foreign language education by passing House Bill 115, which provides funds for a variety of foreign \nlanguage learning programs, from the summer Regents Academy for foreign languages to alternative teacher \nlicensure programs for accelerated qualification of teachers in critical languages. House Bill 115 also created the \nForeign Language Advisory Council (FLAC), a body whose Ohio Department of Education representative, Dr. \nDeborah Robinson, was also a Roadmap Design Team member. Demonstrating the high-level collaboration that is \nnow taking place in Ohio foreign language education, FLAC and Roadmap Design Team outcomes are being \nshared between each other. On a local basis, Ohio schools are experimenting with varying models of early foreign \nlanguage education, from immersion (Columbus City Schools), partial immersion (Cincinnati) to dual immersion \n(Cleveland Buhrer Elementary), to content-related language instruction (Toledo Larchmont and Grove Patterson). \nIn addition to foreign language education, some Ohio students are also taking International Baccalaureate courses \nthat stress knowledge of the world.\n\nFinally, Ohio's growing immigrant communities have established numerous \"heritage schools\" where the second \ngeneration is taught the language and culture of their homelands. Ohio's Chinese heritage schools are particularly \nwell-known and respected; Toledo's large Muslim community has also established a weekend Arabic school (Al \nBayan) whose enrollment increases necessitated the addition of a new wing.\n\nTradition and Diversity\n\nAn important aspect of Ohio's strength in cross-cultural interaction is, as Cleveland businesswoman Kimberly \nKirkendall says, \"Midwestern values export well\". Many Ohioans are brought up valuing community and family \nrelationships and hard work, values that are shared with most cultures around the world. Ohio's special combination \nof urban areas (Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown, Toledo, Dayton, Columbus, Cincinnati) and rural areas has \nproduced a state in which you find city people with traditional values, values very similar to those held by people \nfrom the developing nations with which Ohioans do business and from where Ohio's agricultural labor comes.\n\nThough 97% of Ohioans were born in the US, there is still a great amount of diversity in the state, especially in \nurban areas. From Toledo's Arab community to Cleveland's Russians, from Columbus' Somali community to \nCincinnati's South Asians, the amount of ethnic diversity in the state is increasingly significant. Add to that \nColumbus' status as having one of the nation's largest gay communities, many Ohioans are used to diversity of \ncultures and viewpoints. Because of Ohio's ethnic diversity, organizations have arisen to serve their needs and to \nhelp them integrate into American society. Organizations such as Asian American Community Services, Community \nRefugee and Immigrant Services, the Ohio Hispanic Coalition and the Spanish American Committee are existing \ncenters of cross-cultural skill and interaction. These and other heritage organizations produce foreign language \nmedia, offer English classes, and often serve as small-scale clearing houses for expertise in the respective cultures \nthey represent (including interpreters).\n\nBusiness & Government Infrastructure\n\nAn important strength that Ohio has in terms of foreign language ability is the degree to which Ohio businesses \nand government offices interact with peoples for whom English is not their native language.\n\nFrom GE aircraft engines from Cincinnati to bovine semen from northwest Ohio, Ohio's long-standing experience in \nthe export of manufactured goods and agriculture products has put Ohio business on the front lines of cross-cultural \ninteraction for decades. Ohio's strong financial and high-tech sectors are also exporting services around the globe. \nDespite huge job losses from NAFTA in the 1990's, Ohio has managed to remain competitive on the world market. \nSupporting this growth is an active state Department of Development whose domestic initiatives are led by the \nOffice of Workforce Development, and whose export promotion is led by the International Trade Division.\n\nOver 20% of Ohio's manufacturing jobs are export-related, but the state's international business is far from limited \nto exporting American goods. With its strong base in the auto and machinery industries, Ohio has attracted large \n\n\n\namounts of foreign direct investment from Japan and Germany3. With so much cross-border and cross-culture \nbusiness taking place with Ohioans, there is a fair degree of recognition that Ohio's future is closely tied to its ability \nto remain a part of the global community.\n\nOhio's multicultural strength in business and government is not limited to international trade, however. With a \ngrowing immigrant population, Ohio government offices and businesses are quickly finding ways of working with \nand capitalizing on the immigrant influx. Immigrants with different dietary standards are creating a need for more \n\"organic\" foods and specific methods of livestock harvesting perfectly suited to Ohio's modest-sized agricultural \noperations. Ohio's Department of Jobs and Family Services (ODJFS) is also working hard to make sure that the \nimmigrant workers that keep the state's agricultural economy going are taken care of to the fullest extent of the law. \nWith federal support, ODJFS administers \"One-stops\" state-wide, where employers and potential employers are \nencouraged to find one another and to engage in training programs that enable each side to work better with the \nother.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nEducation & Educational Resources\n\nOhio's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness in achieving widespread and/or high-level foreign language \nproficiency. While there are pockets of experimentation with early foreign language education, for the most part, \nthey are the exceptions that prove the rule: primary foreign language education in Ohio is limited and never \nmandatory.\n\nThere is insufficient funding to support training, licensure and/or employment of the number of foreign language \nteachers required to make foreign language learning common throughout the state. In many school districts, the \nneed for foreign language instruction is not even apparent to their administrators. Among schools that have \nforeign language classes, they are not articulated with higher education, leading to wasteful re- learning when and \nif students reach college. Other schools may offer foreign language instruction for a year or two, but cannot provide \ncontinuous learning opportunities from the time of initial instruction through high school graduation.\n\nOne factor contributing to Ohio's weakness in pre-college foreign language education is the relative lack of non-\ntraditional learning opportunities; foreign language learning for most children remains a somewhat stale and \nabstract exercise that involves neither interaction with natives of the target culture nor even interaction with an \ninstructor that has spent significant time in-country. Local Ohio businesses, which are interacting with native \nspeakers of foreign languages all the time are not connected to education and are ignored as resources for \nforeign language education and practice.\n\nBecause education in Ohio is locally regulated, there is a lack of coordination between foreign language \ninstructors, resources and administrators that leads to duplicated work as well as regions of minimal coverage. \nSome languages have a wealth of teaching materials, while others have very little, especially for primary and \nsecondary school learners. Without interregional cooperation, individual discoveries of useful teaching materials \noften remain local.\n\nFinally - and this is a systemic and conceptual problem - foreign language education in Ohio is often divorced from \nthe practical applications that foreign language skill must have in order to be relevant. Few schools - at any level - \nrelate foreign language use to technical skill; international business programs do not require more than a year or \ntwo of a foreign language - hardly enough for professional proficiency in most languages; math and engineering \nprograms do not help students find ways of incorporating foreign language study in already tightly-packed \ncurricula; high school students are often taught foreign languages as if they were learning to be children in the \ntarget culture, rather than adults-to-be. While there are inchoative movements toward developing a foreign \nlanguage policy for the state, the present situation has yet to be significantly influenced by these initiatives.\n\nPublic Attitudes\n\n\n\nThere remains a belief in Ohio that we have done very well using English only, and so our foreign language ability \nis not as important as everyone else's ability to learn English. Xenophobia and an \"English-only\" sentiment are \ncommon throughout the state, even in urban areas. Internationally, it is often felt that foreigners doing business with \nOhio *should* speak English, while domestically, immigrants are expected to assimilate and give up many trappings \nof their native cultures.\n\nParticularly in communities where Hispanic laborers are many, the win-win arrangement of having this population in \nOhio - cheaper labor, social security payments that support Americans, cultural diversity - is not recognized. As a \nrust-belt state, Ohio is home to many blue-collar workers who understand that their jobs were lost to capital shifted \nto Canada, Mexico, and Asia. Because the savings/wealth generated by lower manufacturing costs do not trickle \ndown to laid-off line workers, many working class Ohioans blame globalization and foreign-language speaking \ncommunities for their economic hardship. To people for whom \"work\" means \"factory work,\" foreign language \nlearning is sometimes perceived as \"selling out\" or helping to move even more jobs overseas rather than creating \npreviously unexplored opportunities for employment.\n\nMany Ohioans do not accept the utility of foreign language ability, but sometimes even those who do often fail to \nrealize the amount of time and resources that are required to achieve foreign language skills at a professionally-\nuseful level. A couple years of foreign language instruction may \"build character\" and certainly goes a long way \ntoward opening young minds to the possibility of alternative world views and lifeways, but a couple years of nearly \nany language is woefully insufficient for practical employment.\n\nAdded together, the fear of foreigners, fear of the unknown, and fear of the difficulty of language learning \ncontribute to a general lack of respect for foreign language learning in many parts of the state. In a vicious cycle, \nlocal governments do not fund foreign language education and so learners grow up in monocultural environments, \ncontinuing to fear and misunderstand foreignness; these learners then become businesspeople and policy makers \nwho again give foreign language education short-shrift. With few models of what Ohioans with foreign language \nexperience can do, few are prepared to make the sacrifices necessary for foreign language education to expand at \nthe grass roots level.\n\nThe major media outlets of the state are not focused on international issues or on the challenges facing Ohio in the \nglobal arena. Treatments of events and people beyond the borders of the state and nation have a distant focus and \nare mostly confined to wire reports or network feeds. The roles of Ohioans in the world at large and foreigners in \nOhio are usually beneath the media radar. Ohioans who achieve notable things abroad are not noticed. Programs \nthat represent Ohio in distant parts of the planet do not attract the attention of reporters and their editors. Like the \nweather that stops at the national borders on television weather reports, the winds of change from foreign sources \ndo not make it into shallow waters of public discourse in Ohio.\n\nWithout a change in the attitudes toward international issues and the opportunities offered by expanding language \nand culture capacity on the part of those who control the media in Ohio, a change in public attitudes will continue to \nbe a daunting challenge.\n\nOpportunities\n\nOhio also has many institutional and human resources that can be further mobilized to support foreign language \neducation. There are sources of government funding that could be taken advantage of, and groups involved in \nsimilar endeavors can begin working together. The fact that Ohio's opportunities are so numerous bodes well for \nprogress in the immediate and distant futures.\n\nPreschool-16 education\n\nOhio has a number of brand-new programs for foreign language/culture education as well as areas in which \nexisting resources have not yet been utilized.\n\nThe new Chinese Flagship Program at Ohio State and new Confucius Institute at Miami University are both \ncontributing to the expansion of Chinese education in Ohio with programs to support K- 16+ language instruction as \n\n\n\nwell as cross-cultural exchanges. The University of Findlay, a school that has long been ahead of the curve in \ninternational cooperation, offers a bilingual business degree that can be a model for other universities. The \nUniversity of Akron is exploring language certification for non-language majors to demonstrate their skill to potential \nemployees. Ohio's newly-formed Foreign Language Advisory Committee is in a position to help align these various \ninitiatives.\n\nWith the internet available throughout the state, technology can be used to bring foreign language education to \neveryone. New ways in which technology can be used for foreign language education include integration of \nsatellite TV programs in course content, integrating the Internet and language classes, expanding use of \nvideoconferencing technology for distance learning, and finding ways to use video games as a constructive \nlanguage learning tool (i.e., online community games like Second Life and World of Warcraft).\n\nAn important opportunity that has yet to be taken advantage of is K-16 articulation. Language learning is a long-\nterm endeavor, so it is important that students are able to take language classes year after year without \nunnecessary interruptions or repetition. Because and K-12 and post-secondary schools are governed by state \nagencies, it has been difficult to create a smooth learning transition from high school to college. The creation of \nFLAC promises to help bridge this gap.\n\nFinally, non-traditional language learning delivery systems can be further developed and promoted. These include \ndistance learning between hub and spoke schools (i.e. between cities and rural communities), greater integration of \nprivate language instruction and the school system (i.e., use of complementary materials, exchange of ideas and \nmethods), greater use of the language magnet school concept (each state could have a handful of language \nmagnet schools devoted to learning certain languages), and integration of foreign language study and technical \nskills (such as math and science programs, nursing/health, and business).\n\nGovernment support\n\nThere is a fair amount of funding available for cross-cultural activities in Ohio, but its existence is often unknown. \nPrograms such as the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and the Federal Department of Labor's Workforce \nInnovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) could be taken advantage of more to integrate immigrant \ncommunities; faith-based initiatives are another source of funding that has not been tapped for language/culture \noutreach. Federally-funded Title VI area studies centers at universities have been excellent loci for academic \nexchange, but they could go further to integrate foreign language/culture knowledge in average Ohioans' daily \nlives.\n\nEven though there may be untapped funds at the federal and local level that could be used for language/culture \neducation, it seems that many government employees themselves are unaware of the benefits of cross-cultural \nunderstanding. Government offices could do more to increase compliance with Title VI requirements regarding \nproviding services in foreign languages; government employees could receive more relevant multicultural training \nso as to prevent discrimination in the workplace.\n\nAnother important opportunity is the fact that Ohio is a key election state with a new governor. With so many eyes \non Ohio, the state is in a good situation to do something to make itself stand out. With a new president, the Ohio \nState University is in a similar position.\n\nCommunity Culture Centers\n\nThere are two major untapped opportunities for creating centers of foreign language/culture knowledge and \nresources: expanding \"One-Stop\" partnerships and working with the immigrant/heritage community centers.\n\n\"One-Stops\" are federally-funded offices managed by local Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services branches \nthat collect information from people seeking work, provide employee information to potential employers, and provide \ntraining to employers and employees. These One-Stops are already work- oriented and may be better equipped \nthan many other organizations (including schools) to see foreign language ability as a value- adding skill.\n\n\n\nImmigrant and heritage communities throughout Ohio construct community centers where people with a similar \nethnicity can come together for worship, social support, and often, ESL classes. Created as places where \nimmigrants and their descendants can come and feel comfortable in their shared backgrounds, these community \ncenters can also be loci for foreign language instruction. Outside of the community center, many immigrants are \nsparsely located, living amongst everyone else. Inside these community centers, however, American foreign \nlanguage learners can find a conveniently-located environment in which their target language is the lingua franca, \nand the target culture shapes behavior expectations. In addition to being a location for immigrants to learn how to \nget along in the US, these community centers can become places for Americans to learn how to get along with \npeople from outside the US. Community centers can become publishing houses of target language media and \nteaching materials, schools for teaching traditional culture (i.e., cooking, traditional arts), and even easy ways to \nmarket goods and services to a particular niche market (i.e., halal meats for Muslims).\n\nCollaboration\n\nThe greatest opportunity facing Ohioans may be creating greater collaboration between groups involved in cross-\ncultural interaction. Many organizations are engaging non-native-English- speaking communities at home and \nabroad, but many of them are doing so alone. The more collaboration and interaction that these organizations have, \nthe more likely it is that they will be able to share resources and knowledge. Some examples include:\n\n-- Non-profit involvement in foreign language education: organizations can provide extra-curricular programs that \nintegrate classroom learning and the real world\n\n-- Many countries around the world are promoting their language in response to the expansion of English - the \ngovernment agencies around the world responsible for this promotion have funds and expertise that can be used to \npromote learning of their language here in the US.\n\n-- Service organizations like Rotary Club and the Lion's Club can help by networking people in similar endeavors.\n\n-- The Ohio Department of Tourism is next door to the International Trade Division (both of which are in the \nDepartment of Development), making increased cooperation logistically simple.\n\n-- Partnerships between business and education, e.g., Battelle's support for The Metro High School, a STEM \n(science, technology, engineering, and math) focused high school. Businesses that believe foreign language skill is \nonly valuable in conjunction with technical skill can create scholarships for students who major in a technical skill \nand double major or minor in a foreign language\n\n-- Sister city relationships - many of which already exist - can be enhanced by creating more educational and \nbusiness exchanges.\n\nEducating the public about the utility of foreign language ability may be the grandest form of collaboration yet to \nhappen. Through public education and increased opportunities for cross- cultural interaction and learning, the \ngeneral public will come to expect foreign language education, rather than begrudge it. Around the world, people \nstudy English because they know they can have a better life if they master it. High English proficiency means a \ngood job with good pay - high foreign language proficiency in the US should mean the same thing.\n\nThreats\n\nA significant barrier to achieving widespread and high levels of foreign language ability in Ohio is the fact that \nforeign language ability is often not materially rewarded by employers. Given two candidates with similar resumes, \nif one speaks a foreign language and the other does not, the foreign language speaker may have an edge in \ngetting hired, but is not likely to be paid more if hired. In many organizations, holders of licenses such as the CPA, \nCFA, etc, are given raises in return for the added value their knowledge brings to the organization; foreign \nlanguage skill has no such reward. Without such a reward, there is less incentive to put in the kind of time and \nenergy that is required to master a foreign language.\n\n\n\nA related problem is that many organizations settle for less-than- appropriate levels of proficiency - including \nschools. Without a standard means of assessing professional-level foreign language proficiency, employers have \nbecome accustomed to \"flying blind,\" as far as foreign language skills are concerned. Coupled with Ohio's growing \neconomy, it appears to many as if \"good enough is good enough.\" Because Ohio is internationally competitive \ntoday, too many Ohioans assume that whatever is working today, will work tomorrow, as well. In this atmosphere, it \nbecomes difficult to convince leaders, students and parents that foreign language ability will be one of the \ndifferentiating factors between successful states and unsuccessful states in the 21st century.\n\nOhio, long a melting pot, has also long been a bastion of conservatism. For many in Ohio, English is the only \nlanguage they have ever heard, and will ever hear, even though their soybeans or dairy cattle are being exported all \nover the world. Fear of losing American/English culture to foreign influences - especially Latino culture - and the \nrecognition that the rest of the world is learning English has contributed to the impression in Ohio that English must \nbe the only language used in achieving economic security.\n\nThe final major threat - also an opportunity - is competition for resources with mathematics and science education. \nDuring the Cold War, mathematics, science and foreign language education were heralded as the path to besting \nthe Russians.\n\nIncreased spending on mathematics and science education sent men to the moon and pay-per-view to satellites. \nThe key now is to bundle foreign language and technical education together. Rather than competing for resources, \nthese two important learning areas should be working to make it possible for American students to learn them \ntogether - learning technical skills in foreign languages and learning foreign languages by engaging in technical \nactivities in the classroom.\n"}
