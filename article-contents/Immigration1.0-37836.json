{"title": "New School, Foreign Land;Immigrant Children Brave First Day", "body": "\nOn their first day of school in America, Selamawit Sereke, 6, and her sister, Helen, 8, yesterday entered a \ndizzying and unfamiliar world of classroom computers, math workbooks -- and simple words whose meanings they \ndid not know.\n\nIn Selamawit's first-grade class in Arlington, the teacher asked the students to sing the alphabet song. Selamawit \ndidn't understand; she speaks Tigrinya, the language of her native Eritrea in Africa.\n\nIn Helen's classroom at Barcroft Elementary, the third-grader walked to the front of the class after she heard the \nteacher say her name. As Helen stood waiting for direction, the teacher tried to communicate that she had not been \ncalled.\n\nFor the Sereke sisters, yesterday was a tough introduction into a school system where none of the teachers \nunderstand their language, and the prospects of getting one who does are slim.\n\nEnglish is a foreign language for thousands of students who started school yesterday in the Washington area. \nStudents speak as many as 100 different languages, according to school records, with most fluent in Spanish. In \nmany cases, few, if any, school staff speak the languages of the smaller student populations.\n\nDuring the last decade, school officials said, the number of non-English-speaking students has steadily increased.\n\n\"The situation is very tough,\" said Emma Violand, director of the English for Speakers of Other Languages program \nin Arlington, where students speak more than 40 languages. \"It's a sad reality.\"\n\nThe initial process of learning, said Barcroft principal Ellen Kahan, \"is terribly frustrating\" for immigrant children. \n\"They don't have any idea about being part of a class, raising your hand, responding to a teacher. It takes a while \nfor them to master all of that stuff.\"\n\nIn Arlington, for example, some staff members speak Vietnamese, Khmer, Laotian, Spanish and Chinese, \naccording to school spokesman David Rorick. When translations, testing or interviews are needed in other \nlanguages, such as Urdu, Farsi or Hindi, he said, the school system often arranges to use a language consultant.\n\nA relative who has lived in Arlington for several years translated for the Serekes during the few weeks before \nschool started as the girls got their immunizations and visited the Intake Center, which acts as the school system's \nEllis Island.\n\n\nBefore yesterday, Selamawit's and Helen's only exposure to school was in a makeshift classroom in a Sudanese \nrefugee camp where they lived four years before moving to their one-bedroom South Arlington apartment in June. \nTheir only classes were in Tigrinya, so they would not lose their native language, and in Arabic, the language of \nSudan.\n\nGebrehiwot Sereke, 33, and his wife, Ketem, 27, fled Eritrea to Sudan with the two girls during the area's 30-year \nwar for independence from Ethiopia, which ended recently. Three more children were born in the refugee camp, \nwhich the family reached after a 12-day, 300-mile trip from Eritrea.\n\nA brother helped the family, which receives aid from Catholic Charities, come to the United States.\n\nEthiopian community leaders estimate there are 20,000 to 30,000 Ethiopians in the Washington area, most of them \nin Silver Spring, the Adams-Morgan neighborhood in the District and along south Columbia Pike in Arlington.\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service officials said a few hundred Ethiopians and Eritreans immigrated to the \nWashington area in 1989, the last year for which figures are available. However, both school and immigration \nofficials said yesterday that those figures have risen during the last two years because of recent political upheavals \nin Eritrea and Ethiopia, and a new surge of refugees is expected.\n\nLike other students who don't speak English, Helen and Selamawit will spend half of the school day in a class \ncalled English for Speakers of Other Languages, or ESOL, until they have mastered the language sufficiently to join \ntheir English-speaking classmates in all their subjects.\n\nKelly Miller, director of the ESOL program at Barcroft, said the girls have an advantage because they are trying to \nlearn English at a relatively young age. Still, she said, it likely will be two to four years before they are fluent in \nEnglish.\n\nBecause of the growth in the number of Ethiopians and Eritreans and the desperate condition of many of the \nrefugees, Violand said, an attempt is being made to hire an Amharic or Tigrinya speaker for the Arlington schools.\n\n\"The Ethiopians are moving to the front burner\" on the school system's list of priorities, she said. \"They need a \nhand if they miss the bus or if they have forms to fill, and right now they're not getting it.\"\n\nYesterday, as he watched his daughters start their American school experience, Gebrehiwot Sereke worried about \nthe language barrier.\n\nFor about half an hour, he scanned the faces of children entering the building. He recognized a few as Ethiopians, \nand asked a teacher if Helen could be put in a class with a student who speaks Tigrinya. There were no other \nEritrean students at her grade level. By chance, however, a Tigrinya-speaking student is in the class with \nSelamawit.\n\n\"We'll get her through,\" Kahan told the father through an interpreter after Helen went to her class. \"We do this all the \ntime.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO, SELAMAWIT SEREKE, 6, LEFT, ON HER FIRST DAY AT BARCROFT ELEMENTARY IN ARLINGTON. \nCAROL GUZY\n"}
