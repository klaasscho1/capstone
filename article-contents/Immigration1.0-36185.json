{"title": "Window Opens Into New York's Immigrant Past", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhile preparing to celebrate our immigrant heritage, we are losing a great opportunity to learn how some \nimmigrants actually lived. New park construction in lower Manhattan has exposed the earth on a historic site, but \nno archeological work is being done.\n\nThe southwest corner of the construction site, at Baxter and Worth Streets, was part of the old Five Points, the first \nplace in New York City settled by Irish immigrants in the 1820's. By midcentury, the Five Points had a solid \nreputation as the most desperate locale in New York. Its notoriety spread through Europe, partly because of \nCharles Dickens's shocking descriptions in ''American Notes.''\n\nThe northern half of the construction site was part of the block known as Mulberry Bend, immortalized by Jacob Riis \nin ''How the Other Half Lives.'' Writing in 1888, two years after the Statue of Liberty was completed, Riis observed, \n''There is but one 'Bend' in the world, and it is enough.'' By then, southern Italians had replaced the Irish, but living \nconditions had not improved. A tenement housing commission found that 155 children younger than 5 had died on \nthat one block in 1882.\n\nIn the 1890's, the tenements of the Bend were demolished and replaced by a park. Between the mounds of bricks \nturned up in the current park construction, one can see the tops of old basements. Reports on the area throughout \nthe 19th century refer to underground tunnels, warrens and even illegal burials. Undoubtedly much was \nexaggerated. But we are missing a chance to find out what was true. BRIAN FERGUSON New York, June 6, 1986 \nThe writer is assistant professor of anthropology at Rutgers University.\n"}
