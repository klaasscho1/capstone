{"title": "'Immigration Divides Families'", "body": "\nThe article \"Hands -- and Hopes -- Across the Sea\" [front page, Feb. 1] should have been labeled news analysis. \nAlthough the immigration process could benefit from increased public scrutiny and understanding, articles such as \nthis -- in which the author's disapproval of the system of quotas established by Congress in 1952 is obvious -- serve \nonly to muddy the waters.\n\nDuring my 1994-1995 tenure on the nonimmigrant visa line in Seoul, I saw countless individuals in Mr. Shin's \nsituation. Refusing their visa applications was often a heart-wrenching decision, but it was the only possible \ndecision given our immigration law.\n\nNearly a million people immigrate legally to the United States each year. If every person in financial difficulty who \nwanted to join relatives in the United States were allowed to do so by simply obtaining a tourist visa, immigration \nwould increase exponentially each year. Would even the most ardent supporter of expanded immigration favor \nallowing 5 million, 10 million or even 15 million new immigrants each year?\n\nFinally, I would like to point out that \"U.S. visa policies\" don't divide Asian families; immigration divides families. \nFrom time immemorial, immigrants have had to decide between pursuing opportunity in a new land and remaining \nwith their extended families. Those who have come to America were not forced to leave their families behind; they \nchose to. Granted the decision is painful, but it is made freely nonetheless.\n\nDEBORAH MENNUTI\n\nArlington\n"}
