{"title": "ADVOCATES KNOCK HIL'S IMMIG PLAN", "body": "\nSEN. HILLARY CLINTON'S proposal for reforming America's immigration policies is shocking immigration \nadvocates - but not because she's suggested building a fence at the Mexican border.\n\nThey oppose Clinton's call for a staggered reform effort, with legalization of illegal immigrants taking place \"12 to 24 \nmonths\" after border-control measures take effect.\n\n\"I was a little shocked by what she said,\" said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration \nCoalition. \"You will never be able to secure the border without fixing the system - that's really wishful thinking.\"\n\nA staged approach to reform would also keep millions \"living in the shadows\" for another year or two, Hong said. \"I \nfind that very hard to accept.\"\n\nFor an article published yesterday, Clinton (D-N.Y.) told Daily News columnist Michael Goodwin that reform could \nbe packaged as \"one piece of comprehensive legislation, with a staged implementation. . . . A wall in certain areas \nwould be appropriate.\"\n\nHong said immigration advocates aren't opposed to tighter border security measures, such as a wall, as part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for a group working to build a fence along private land on the border said he suspected \nClinton was just posturing politically and didn't mean what she said.\n\n\"All these people keep saying these things, and nothing ever happens,\" said Tim Bueler of the Minuteman Project.\n\ndrose@nydailynews.com\n"}
