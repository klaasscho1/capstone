{"title": "A Spur to Immigrants", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhen the Mayor of Haverstraw, N.Y., is comfortable enough to say that one of the main problems with Dominican \nimmigrants is that \"They produce a lot of heavy garbage. I mean, rice and beans are heavy, you know\" (news \narticle, Sept. 30), let no one be mistaken that anti-immigrant sentiments, and more specifically anti-Latino \nsentiments, have been buoyed by the recent welfare and immigration laws. Such racist comments should provide \nfurther motivation to immigrants to naturalize, register and vote.\n\n \n\nSANDRA MULLIN\n\nBrooklyn, Sept. 30, 1996\n"}
