{"title": "Bosnian Runner Receives Most Meaningful Gift", "body": "\nChristmas came early for former Bosnian Olympic runner Mirsada Buric-Adam after months of fighting to get her \nfamily out of Croatia.\n\nBuric-Adam learned this month that her relatives have finally received permission to enter the United States.\nHer 8-year-old nephew, Adi, called Dec. 12 from Zagreb, where the family ended up after fleeing Sarajevo.\n\n\"He was screaming on the phone: 'Aunt! We're coming to America!' \" Buric-Adam said.\n\nBuric-Adam sent her sister money to survive and negotiated with U.S. immigration officials. Majda Jarovic, her \nhusband and their two children are due to arrive in January.\n\nBuric-Adam, who dodged bullets on the streets of Sarajevo while training for the 1992 Olympics, married Eric \nAdam, an audio-visual specialist at the Veterans Administration hospital in Prescott, Ariz.\n\nJarovic fled Sarajevo with Adi and 3-year-old Irma, traveling by night to reach Zagreb. Once there, she was \ninterviewed by a U.S. immigration official, who told her they were not eligible for a refugee resettlement program for \nBosnian Muslims.\n\nThe family survived on money from Buric-Adam and her husband, who launched a letter-writing campaign. The \nturning point came soon after Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) wrote to U.S. immigration officials on their behalf, asking to \nhave the case reconsidered.\n\nJarovic told immigration officials her family had been receiving threatening telephone calls since early 1992. The \ncallers threatened to kill Jarovic and her children because Buric-Adam was a member of the Bosnian Olympic \nteam. It wasn't clear why immigration officials changed their minds.\n"}
