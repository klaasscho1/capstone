{"title": "Federal Circuit Court of Australia Decision: Wotton v State of Queensland (No 5) [2016] FCA 1457", "body": "\nCanberra ACT: Federal Circuit Court of Australia has issued the following decision 5 December 2016:  FEDERAL \nCOURT OF AUSTRALIA\n    Wotton v State of Queensland (No 5) [2016] FCA 1457  \n   SUMMARY  \n\n In accordance with the practice of the Federal Court in cases of public interest, importance or complexity, the \nfollowing summary has been prepared to accompany the orders made today. This summary is intended to assist in \nunderstanding the outcome of this proceeding and is not a complete statement of the conclusions reached by the \nCourt. The only authoritative statement of the Court\u2019s reasons is that contained in the published reasons for \njudgment which will be available on the internet at www.fedcourt.gov.au together with this summary.\n\n      This is a case about race discrimination. Its focus is on the conduct of officers of the Queensland Police Service \n(QPS) on Palm Island between 19 and 28 November 2004. The case has been brought by Mr Lex Wotton, his \npartner Ms Cecilia Wotton, and Mrs Agnes Wotton, who is Mr Wotton\u2019s mother. All three were living on Palm Island \nat the time and were affected by what occurred.  The case is a representative proceeding, which means the three \napplicants bring the proceeding as representatives of a group of people affected, they allege, by unlawful race \ndiscrimination of QPS officers during that time. The \u2018group members\u2019 are people who were ordinarily resident on \nPalm Island on 19 November 2004 and who remained ordinarily resident there until 25 March 2010. The applicants \nalso bring the proceeding on behalf of a \u2018subgroup\u2019 of people who were affected by an operation carried out by \narmed officers of the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) on 27 and 28 November 2004. The subgroup \nincludes children who were in or near the houses that were entered and searched by SERT officers.  The \nrespondents are the State of Queensland and the Commissioner of Police for Queensland. The individual police \nofficers have not been named as respondents. However, the State of Queensland has accepted that all QPS \nofficers were acting in the course of their duties as police officers and that the State of Queensland is liable for their \nconduct.  On the morning of 19 November 2004, a 36-year-old Aboriginal man named Cameron Doomadgee died in \npolice custody on Palm Island. He is now known, posthumously, as Mulrunji. He had been arrested by Senior \nSergeant Christopher Hurley in a suburban street, not far from the police station, for yelling out what Senior \nSergeant Hurley considered to be abuse directed at Senior Sergeant Hurley and an Aboriginal police liaison officer \nwho was also on duty. Affected by alcohol, protesting and struggling, Mulrunji was brought into the Palm Island \nPolice Station. Near the door to the police station, a struggle and fall with Senior Sergeant Hurley occurred. \nMulrunji was then dragged limp and unresponsive into a cell. Within an hour, this man, known to many people on \n\n\nPalm Island as an active and likeable person, was dead.  Mulrunji\u2019s death, and the way QPS officers dealt with its \naftermath, led to three coronial inquests, a review by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, two \nreviews by the QPS, criminal proceedings against Senior Sergeant Hurley in which he was acquitted of \nmanslaughter, and litigation by police officers about potential disciplinary action against them. There were a large \nnumber of criminal proceedings against Palm Islanders, including Mr Wotton and Mrs Agnes Wotton, concerning \ntheir conduct on 26 November 2004. What happened on Palm Island during this time has been examined from \nmany perspectives and has damaged many lives, on all sides.  This case is about the role played by race in the \nQPS response to Mulrunji\u2019s death. The Court has been asked to decide whether, in the police investigation into \nMulrunji\u2019s death, in the management of community concerns, tensions and anger on Palm Island in the week after \nhis death, and in the police responses to protests and fires that occurred on 26 November 2004, officers of the \nQPS contravened section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).  The applicants claimed that the police \nofficers conducted themselves differently because they were dealing with an Aboriginal community and the death of \nan Aboriginal man.  The State of Queensland and the Commissioner denied all of the applicants\u2019 allegations. The \ntrial was a fully contested one, on all factual and legal issues arising from the applicants\u2019 claims. The Court sat on \nPalm Island for the first week of the trial, and as part of the trial visited most of the key places referred to in the \nevidence. The remainder of the trial was conducted in Townsville.  One of the central purposes of the Racial \nDiscrimination Act is to enact into Australian law international obligations assumed by Australia in the International \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In broad terms, section 9(1) of the Racial \nDiscrimination Act prohibits differential treatment of people based on race where that treatment has the purpose or \neffect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by them of identified human rights. In this \ncase, those rights include the right to equality in the application of the law, the right to access police services that \nare impartial and independent, the right to liberty and security of the person, and the right not to have one\u2019s privacy, \nfamily and home interfered with in an unlawful or arbitrary way.  I have decided that a number of the applicants\u2019 \nclaims should succeed, but not all of them, and that they should be given some but not all of the relief they seek. In \nsummary, I have found that the following conduct by QPS officers contravened section 9(1) of the Racial \nDiscrimination Act:\n\n(a) The QPS officers with command and control of the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death between 19 and 24 \nNovember 2004 did not act impartially and independently. Contrary to what would have occurred in an impartial, \nindependent and effective investigation, Senior Sergeant Hurley picked up the investigators from the airport when \nthey arrived and had a meal with them at his house that evening. He was never treated as a suspect, nor promptly \nremoved from the island. The police officers discounted and ignored accounts from Aboriginal witnesses \nimplicating Senior Sergeant Hurley. Incorrect and stereotypical information about Mulrunji and the circumstances of \nhis death was passed to the coroner, while relevant information from Aboriginal witnesses was not passed on.  \n\n(b) During the week after Mulrunji\u2019s death and prior to the protests and fires that occurred on 26 November 2004, \nthere were substantial failures by QPS officers on the island to communicate with the Palm Island community and \ndefuse tensions, including by not proactively participating in community meetings and by not providing timely and \naccurate information about the cause of Mulrunji\u2019s death and the progress of the investigation, which the community \nwas waiting to hear. The local Council and its members were scarcely consulted. Instead, there was a focus on \nincreasing security and police numbers.  \n\n(c) An emergency declaration issued under the Public Safety Preservation Act 1986 (Qld) after the police station \nwas set on fire had the consequence of shutting off the island from flights and ferry transport. It also triggered the \nevacuation of non-Aboriginal people from the island. I have found the emergency declaration was part of facilitating \nan excessive and disproportionate policing response, including the use of SERT officers. The declaration also \nmeant local Palm Islanders could not travel to and from the island, although non-Aboriginal people, media, police \nand authorities could. Police behaved as if there were threats to non-Aboriginal people living on the island, when \nthere were not.  \n\n(d) The use of SERT officers to arrest suspects on 27 and 28 November 2004, and to conduct entries and \nsearches of 18 houses on Palm Island. Despite the entire population of Palm Island (including children) being less \nthan 2000, between 88 and 111 police officers (including SERT and the Public Safety Response Team) were on \nthe island over the period covered by the emergency declaration. I have not accepted evidence suggesting the \n\n\n\npeople to be arrested were reasonably suspected of having any weapons nor that there were any acts or threats of \nviolence after the fires subsided on the evening of 26 November 2004. Yet, during the SERT operations, armed, \nmasked SERT officers broke into the houses of 18 families on Palm Island, with assault rifles raised, confronting \nunarmed men, women and children in and around those houses. Mr Wotton was tasered in front of his family. I \nhave found the use of SERT officers to effect the arrests was unnecessary, disproportionate and undertaken as a \nshow of force against local people who had protested about the conduct of police. Women and children in and \naround the houses attended by SERT officers, who had nothing to do with the protests and fires, were terrified. \nThose women and children who gave evidence have suffered a lasting detrimental impact from the SERT \noperation.    I have found that police acted in these ways because they were dealing with an Aboriginal community, \nand with the community of Palm Island in particular. I have found they conducted themselves, including Senior \nSergeant Hurley while he was there, with a sense of impunity, impervious to the reactions and perceptions of Palm \nIslanders who were, in large numbers, distressed and agitated about the death of Mulrunji. Officers preferred \nconfrontation to engagement and operated very much with an \u201cus and them\u201d attitude. I am comfortably satisfied \nQPS officers would not have taken a similar approach, in any of the respects I have outlined above, if a tragedy \nsuch as this had occurred in an isolated non-Aboriginal community in Queensland. The investigation would have \nbeen impartial. A person in Senior Sergeant Hurley\u2019s position would have been suspended and treated \u2013 at least \ninitially \u2013 as a suspect. Eyewitnesses would have been taken seriously. Accurate information would have been \npassed to the coroner. There would have been engagement and good communication with the community and, if \ntensions and protests had erupted as they did on 26 November 2004, there would have been a more proportionate \nand regulated response. I do not consider an entire community would have been locked down in the way Palm \nIsland was. I am satisfied that armed, masked SERT officers would not have forced their way into houses occupied \nby unarmed families, including young children, and pointed assault rifles at them, yelling at them to lie down and not \nmove, making those families think they were in danger of being shot.  There will be declarations reflecting the \ncontraventions of section 9(1) I have found proven. I have also found the arrests, entries and searches were \nunlawful under Queensland law. I have awarded Mr Wotton $95,000 in damages for the way he was treated when \narrested, and for the interference with his home, family and privacy. I have awarded Ms Cecilia Wotton $115,000 in \ndamages for the way she was treated and the interference with her home, family and privacy. I have awarded Mrs \nAgnes Wotton $10,000 for the interference with her home. She was not present when SERT officers came to her \nhouse (although a young girl who gave evidence in this proceeding was at the house, as was a two-year-old boy). I \nhave rejected the applicants\u2019 claims for aggravated damages and found the Court has no power to award \nexemplary damages under the Racial Discrimination Act.  In my reasons, I have indicated that I will not order an \napology, but the Commissioner of Police should be required to consider whether it is appropriate to make an \napology to the residents of Palm Island. I have given the parties an opportunity to make submissions on this issue. \nThey also have an opportunity to make further submissions on some consequential issues such as costs, and the \nway the remainder of the proceeding should be dealt with, because any individual claims by group members and \nsubgroup members are not finally determined by this judgment.  In conclusion, there are three aspects of this \nproceeding I wish to emphasise. First, although these events have been examined before, in this proceeding the \nparties each made a series of choices about the evidence they put before the Court. They also made choices about \nwhich witnesses they called. The Court can only determine the claims made under section 9(1) on the basis of the \nevidence before it.  Second, the SERT officers who were deployed to Palm Island are not the subject of any \nadverse findings. They performed their duties in the manner they had been trained to do: it was those who decided \nto use them to effect arrests of unarmed people at home with their families who are subject to adverse findings by \nthe Court.  Third, the parties and their legal representatives were cooperative and courteous in the conduct of this \nproceeding, although it was at times difficult for all concerned. The Court is grateful to them for that. The State of \nQueensland and the Commissioner, in particular, defended this proceeding in a commendable manner, making \nappropriate concessions and conducting themselves, through their legal representatives, with the kind of \nresponsibility and sensitivity that should be a model for litigation on behalf of government.\n\n MORTIMER J\n\n 5 December 2016  FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA\n    Wotton v State of Queensland (No 5) [2016] FCA 1457  \n\n\n\n                \nFile number:            \nQUD 535 of 2013              \n         \n                   \nJudge:            \nMORTIMER J              \n         \n                   \nDate of judgment:            \n5 December 2016              \n         \n                   \nCatchwords:            \n\nHUMAN RIGHTS \u2013 discrimination \u2013 racial discrimination \u2013 direct discrimination \u2013 s 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination \nAct 1975 (Cth) \u2013 police investigation of Aboriginal death in police custody \u2013 interactions between police officers \nand Aboriginal community following death \u2013 protests against police by some members of Aboriginal community \u2013 \nfires destroying police station and other public property \u2013 declaration of emergency situation under s 5 of the \nPublic Safety Preservation Act 1986(Qld) \u2013 entries and searches of homes by officers of Special Emergency \nResponse Team \u2013 arrests of persons identified as suspects in relation to protests and fires \u2013 rights to equality \nbefore the law and equal protection of the law \u2013 right to equal treatment before organs administering justice \u2013 right \nto access public services \u2013 right to enjoyment of property without unlawful interference \u2013 right not to be subjected to \nunlawful interference with privacy, family or home \u2013 right to liberty and security of person \u2013 right not to be subjected \nto inhuman or degrading treatment \u2013International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination \u2013 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n    \n    \n    \n\n    PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u2013 representative proceeding \u2013 racial discrimination \u2013 group comprising \nIndigenous community on Palm Island \u2013 subgroup comprising persons affected by arrests, entries and searches by \nofficers of Special Emergency Response Team\n    \n    \n    \n    STATUTORY INTERPRETATION \u2013 relationship between Australian statutes and international instruments \u2013 \nrelationship between Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) and International Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Racial Discrimination \u2013 consequences for interpretation of Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) \u2013 \nmaterials that may inform interpretation\n    \n    \n    \n    STATUTORY INTERPRETATION \u2013 word and phrases \u2013 \u201cact involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or \npreference based on race\u201d \u2013 \u201cinvolving\u201d \u2013 \u201cdistinction\u201d \u2013 \u201cbased on race\u201d\n    \n    \n    \n    DAMAGES \u2013 orders under s 46PO(4) of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) \u2013 appropriate \nbasis for and quantum of damages for racial discrimination \u2013 whether aggravated damages available \u2013 whether \nexemplary damages available \u2013 whether appropriate to order an apology              \n         \n\n\n\n                   \nLegislation:            \nAboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld)     \nAustralian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ss 46PH, 46PO,46PO(4), 46PO(4)(b), 46PO(4)(d)     \nConstitution, ss 109, 117     \n\nCoroners Act 2003 (Qld) ss 5(2), 7(3), 15(2), 27, 29     \nCriminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) Sch 1, ss 61(1), 61(2), 63, 63, 65, 66, 398, 419, 461, 469     \nDisaster Management Act 2003 (Qld) s 13     \nEvidence Act 1995 (Cth) ss 54, 140, 144(1)(b), 191     \nFederal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) Pt IVA, ss 22, 23     \n\nPolice Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 (Qld) ss 19, 198, 376, 447A     \n\nPolice Service Administration Act 1990 (Qld) ss 2.3, 4.8, 4.9, 7.4, 10.5(2)     \nPublic Safety Preservation Act 1986 (Qld) ss 5, 6, 8, 13, 46     \nPublic Sector Ethics Act 1994 (Qld) s 15     \n\nRacial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ss 3(3), 8, 9, 9(1), 10, 18A     \n\nCharter of the United Nations, Art 1(3)     \nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Art 1     \n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, Arts 3, 8     \nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Arts 1(1), 1(4), 2, 5(a), 5(b), 5(f)     \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Arts 2, 7, 9, 17, 26     \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights     \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, Art 7              \n         \n                   \nCases cited:            \nA v New South Wales [2007] HCA 10;

group members as defined in the further amended originating application filed \n25 August 2015, Detective Inspector Warren Webber, Detective Senior Sergeant Raymond Joseph Kitching and \nInspector Mark Williams committed unlawful discrimination, in contravention of section 9(1)of the Racial \nDiscrimination Act 1975 (Cth), by failing to treat Senior Sergeant Christopher Hurley as a suspect in the death of \nCameron Doomadgee and by allowing Senior Sergeant Hurley to continue to perform policing duties on Palm \nIsland between 19 and 22 November 2004.  In relation to the applicants and group members, between 19 and 22 \n\n\n\nNovember 2004, Detective Inspector Webber and Detective Senior Sergeant Kitching committed unlawful \ndiscrimination, in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act, in their treatment of Aboriginal \nwitnesses interviewed, and in their treatment of information supplied by those witnesses, for the purposes of the \ninvestigation by the Queensland Police Service into the death of Cameron Doomadgee.  In relation to the \napplicants and group members, between 19 and 22 November 2004, Detective Senior Sergeant Kitching committed \nunlawful discrimination, in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act, in submitting inaccurate \ninformation to the coroner, and in failing to supply relevant information to the coroner, for the purposes of the \ncoronial investigation into the death of Cameron Doomadgee.  In relation to the applicants and group members, the \nfailure of any officer of the Queensland Police Service with appropriate command responsibilities, including \nInspector Gregory Strohfeldt and Acting Assistant Commissioner Roy Wall, to suspend Senior Sergeant Hurley \nfrom active duty on Palm Island after the death of Cameron Doomadgee on 19 November 2004 constituted \nunlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.  In relation to the applicants \nand group members, the failure of any officer of the Queensland Police Service with appropriate command \nresponsibilities on Palm Island between 22 and 26 November 2004, including Inspector Brian Richardson and \nSenior Sergeant Roger Whyte, to communicate effectively with the Palm Island community and defuse tensions \nwithin that community relating to the death in custody of Cameroon Doomadgee, and the subsequent police \ninvestigation, constituted unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.  In \nrelation to the applicants and group members, Detective Inspector Webber, in making at 1.45 pm on 26 November \n2004 and continuing until 8.10 am on 28 November 2004 a declaration of an emergency situation under section 5 of \nthe Public Safety Preservation Act 1986 (Qld) engaged in unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of \nthe Racial Discrimination Act.  In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team to carry out the arrest of \nthe first applicant on 27 November 2004, officers of the Queensland Police Service with command responsibilities \nfor the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including Detective Inspector Webber, Inspector Steven \nUnderwood and Inspector Glenn Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the \nRacial Discrimination Act.  In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team on 27 November 2004 to \ncarry out the entry and search of the house of the first and third applicants, officers of the Queensland Police \nService with command responsibilities for the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including Detective \nInspector Webber, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination contrary to \nsection 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.  In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team on 27 \nNovember 2004 to carry out the entry and search of the house of the second applicant, officers of the Queensland \nPolice Service with command responsibilities for the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including \nDetective Inspector Webber, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination \ncontrary to section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.  Pursuant to section 18A of the Racial Discrimination Act, \nthe Racial Discrimination Act applies in relation to the first respondent as if the first respondent had engaged in the \nconduct of the officers of the Queensland Police Service referred to in paragraphs 1 to 9 above, and the first \nrespondent is taken to have contravened section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act in the manner there set out.\n\n THE COURT ORDERS THAT:\n\n      The first respondent pay to the first applicant damages in the total sum of $95,000.  The first respondent pay to \nthe second applicant damages in the sum of $10,000.  The first respondent pay to the third applicant damages in \nthe total sum of $115,000.  Paragraphs 1 to 3 of these Orders are stayed pending the determination by the Court of \nthe matters set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 and paragraph 6 of the Directions given by the Court on 5 December 2016.\n\nNote: Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011.  \n\n               \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY            \n[1]                  \nTHE COMPLAINT TO THE

Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (RDA) provides:It is \nunlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, \ndescent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, \nenjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, \nsocial, cultural or any other field of public life.  This is a representative proceeding brought under Pt IVA of the \nFederal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in which the applicants allege various contraventions of s 9(1) by reason \nof the conduct of members of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) on Palm Island, Queensland in November \n2004. The applicants are Mr Lex Wotton, Mrs Agnes Wotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton. They have brought this \nproceeding on their own behalf and on behalf of Indigenous people who were ordinarily resident on Palm Island on \n19 November 2004 and who remained ordinarily resident there until 25 March 2010. I will refer to the persons in this \ngroup as the group members. The three named applicants also represent a subgroup of the group members, \nconstituted by those persons who were affected (in one or more of four ways set out at [4] of the applicants\u2019 third \nfurther amended statement of claim) by entries and searches conducted by members of the QPS, including \nmembers of the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), on 18 homes on Palm Island during the period 27 to \n28 November 2004. Those entries and searches led to the arrests of 11 people, including two arrests made at a \n\n\n\nplace called Wallaby Point on 29 November 2004. The respondents are the State of Queensland and the \nCommissioner of the QPS, who is sued as Commissioner and as representing the members of the QPS who \nengaged in the conduct impugned by the applicants.  For the reasons set out below, the applicants have \nestablished some but not all of the contraventions of s 9(1) of the RDA which they alleged. I set out a summary of \nmy findings in favour of the applicants at [1540] below.  The events and conduct with which this proceeding is \nconcerned begin with the death in police custody of a 36-year-old man now known as Mulrunji at approximately 11 \nam on 19 November 2004. Before he died, Mulrunji was known as Cameron Doomadgee and in some of the \ncontemporaneous evidence he is called by that name. Unless the context otherwise requires, it is appropriate to \nuse his traditional name, Mulrunji. On the morning of 19 November 2004, Mulrunji had been arrested and placed in \ncustody in what was called the \u201cwatchhouse\u201d by Senior Sergeant Christopher Hurley, the Officer in Charge of the \nPalm Island Police Station. Police Liaison Officer Lloyd Bengaroo, an Aboriginal man employed by the QPS, \nassisted with the arrest. However, it was SS Hurley who brought Mulrunji into the watchhouse and it was SS \nHurley\u2019s physical interactions with Mulrunji that would become the subject of scrutiny. The impugned events and \nconduct end approximately 11 days later when the large contingent of police officers who had come to the island \nover the course of that period returned to the mainland.  The applicants allege contraventions by the respondents of \ns 9(1) of the RDA in the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death and the conduct of policing operations on the island \nduring this 11-day period. The respondents have accepted that all the allegations of conduct by individual officers of \nthe QPS occurred in the course of the employment of those officers, alternatively in circumstances where those \nofficers were acting as agents of the State of Queensland. Accordingly, vicarious liability under s 18A of the RDA \nwas accepted if the applicants\u2019 allegations were otherwise proven.  There have been a considerable number of \nproceedings and inquiries (including three coronial inquests) into the events with which this proceeding is \nconcerned. Race, and the circumstances and treatment of Aboriginal people on Palm Island, may have featured in \nsome of those previous proceedings and inquiries, but it was intermingled with many other matters. In this \nproceeding, the role of race in the events on Palm Island between 19 November 2004 and approximately 29 \nNovember 2004 is the central issue. At certain times during the course of the proceeding, it appeared the applicants \nconcentrated on failures and shortcomings in police conduct in general (including the issue of its lawfulness), \nwithout a clear set of contentions regarding how that conduct contravened s 9(1) of the RDA. However, the Court\u2019s \njurisdiction arises because this is a claim under s 9(1) of the RDA and a focus on the issues raised by the terms of \nthat provision must be steadily maintained.  The applicants\u2019 claims may be divided broadly into three groups of \nissues. The first involves the manner in which the QPS conducted the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death. The QPS \nofficers with principal responsibility for the investigation were Detective Inspector Warren Webber and Detective \nSenior Sergeant Raymond Joseph (\u201cJoe\u201d) Kitching. Inspector Mark Williams was a member of the Ethical \nStandards Command of the QPS and also participated in the investigation. I use the term \u2018investigation\u2019 in a broad \nsense, because this aspect of the applicants\u2019 claims really covers a number of events from very shortly after \nMulrunji\u2019s death on 19 November 2004 until just before the civil unrest that saw the burning down of the Police \nStation and other buildings on Palm Island on 26 November 2004. The applicants allege that, in a number of \nspecific ways, the conduct of the investigation was substandard, inadequate and flawed, and that these failures, \nomissions and inadequacies occurred because QPS officers were dealing with the death of an Aboriginal man, in \nan Aboriginal community, and more particularly the Aboriginal community of Palm Island. In the third further \namended statement of claim these allegations are made in Parts H and I, and cover the period 19 to 24 November \n2004. Many of these allegations begin with a premise that police conduct was unlawful, although in my opinion that \npremise is not as central to a potential contravention of s 9 as the applicants\u2019 approach suggested.  The second \ngroup of issues involves the lead-up to events that have sometimes been described as the \u201criots\u201d that took place on \nPalm Island on 26 November 2004, as well as the police reaction to those events. On that day, the wider \ncommunity on Palm Island was given some information about a preliminary autopsy report regarding the injuries \nthat caused Mulrunji\u2019s death. It was the provision of this information that triggered the events of 26 November 2004. \nThe word \u201criot\u201d is one I have decided to avoid, although on the evidence before me it was the description of choice \nused by the media at the time. The word \u201criot\u201d also forms part of the criminal offences with which some Palm \nIslanders were charged. Some people were acquitted of those charges, some were convicted, and some had \ncharges withdrawn. To use the word \u201criot\u201d may indicate this Court has formed a view about those charges, which is \nnot the case. It is the case that there were protests about Mulrunji\u2019s death, the police investigation and perceived \npolice inaction and bias, and those protests became violent at some points through activities such as rock-throwing \nand yelling abuse. There were also fires, which were deliberately lit and caused serious property damage, although \n\n\n\nno individual was convicted of arson. To use the word \u201criot\u201d to describe these events would be to convey an \nimpression that does not reflect my view of the evidence before me. I have used the composite phrase \u201cprotests \nand fires\u201d in these reasons to describe what happened on 26 November 2004. In like manner, I describe the \nconduct of QPS officers on 27 to 29 November 2004 as \u201carrests, entries and searches\u201d rather than as \u201craids\u201d, which \nwas a term used by the applicants and the media at the time.  In this second group of issues about the lead up to \nthe protests and fires, the applicants allege a series of failures, inadequacies and omissions by the QPS, \nincluding:(a) the failure to suspend SS Hurley from duty pending the outcome of the investigation; \n\n (b) the making of an emergency declaration under s 5 of the Public Safety Preservation Act 1986 (Qld) (PSP Act);\n\n (c) the entries and searches of the homes of subgroup members; and\n\n (d) the arrests of subgroup members in relation to offences said to have been committed on 26 November 2004.  It \nis alleged, broadly, that the police would not have conducted themselves as they did (including by deploying SERT \nofficers to effect the arrests and conduct the searches of the homes) if this were not an Aboriginal community. In the \nthird further amended statement of claim, these allegations are made in Parts J, K and L and cover the period 22 \nNovember 2004 to 28 November 2004. Again, many of these allegations begin with the premise that police conduct \nwas unlawful, and again in my opinion that premise is not as central to a potential contravention of s 9 as the \napplicants\u2019 approach suggested.  In their pleadings the applicants raised a third issue, concerning what was \ndescribed in Part L of the third further amended statement of claim as \u201csystemic and institutional discrimination\u201d. \nThese allegations centred on the policies, orders and procedures issued or continued by the second respondent \n(the Commissioner) being, to borrow a phrase, not fit for the purpose of policing in an Aboriginal community, and \nspecifically in the Aboriginal community of Palm Island. This aspect of the applicants\u2019 case was, ultimately, not \npressed at trial. On the last day of evidence, senior counsel for the applicants informed the Court that these \nallegations were not pressed, along with a series of factual allegations which she then identified. Accordingly, those \nmatters are not the subject of any express findings in these reasons.  In final submissions, and with greater focus \non s 9 of the RDA as I had requested, the applicants provided a short summary of their key contentions that \nsomewhat reorganised the first and second groups of issues into four main categories of claims. I have adopted \nthat structure in these reasons. The four categories of claims are:(a) the police conduct in the investigation of \nMulrunji\u2019s death;\n\n (b) the police conduct during the \u2018intervening week\u2019 after Mulrunji\u2019s death and prior to the protests and fires of 26 \nNovember 2004;\n\n (c) the emergency declaration issued under the PSP Act;\n\n (d) the use of SERT in the arrests, entries and searches carried out between 27 and 28 November 2004.  The \napplicants seek declaratory relief, an apology, compensation, and aggravated and exemplary damages.\n\nTHE COMPLAINT TO THE COMMISSION, THIS PROCEEDING AND ITS HISTORY    Although this proceeding is \nbrought as a representative proceeding pursuant to Pt IVA of the Federal Court Act, it comes to this Court pursuant \nto s 46PO of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (AHRC Act) after termination of a complaint \nmade to the Australian Human Rights Commission.  The applicants lodged a written complaint with the Commission \non 25 March 2010 on behalf of themselves and the group members. In the complaint letter, the applicants alleged \nthat the first respondent \u2013 the State of Queensland \u2013 contravened s 9 of the RDA through various acts and \nomissions after Mulrunji\u2019s death, and through the subsequent protests and fires and the police response to them. \nThe applicants divided the police acts and omissions into four heads of discrimination. The matter did not resolve \nat the conciliation conference facilitated by the Commission on 16 February 2012 and a delegate of the President of \nthe Commission issued a notice of termination under s 46PH of the AHRC Act on 13 June 2013.  The applicants \nfiled their originating application on 9 August 2013. On 20 November 2014, Dowsett J fixed the matter for trial for \nfour weeks, to take place in two tranches from 31 August 2015 to 11 September 2015 and from 21 September 2015 \n\n\n\nto 2 October 2015.  The matter was allocated to my docket in April 2015 and the parties appeared before me for a \ndirections hearing on 28 April 2015. I made orders on this date varying the trial dates so that the trial would run from \n7 September 2015 to 2 October 2015, to enable the trial to proceed in a single tranche, and requiring the \nrespondents to discover certain documents by 5 May 2015.  It is agreed between the parties that both the group \nmembers and the subgroup members as so defined number more than seven people. It is also agreed that, at all \nrelevant times, the applicants and group members as identified by the applicants were Aboriginal or Torres Strait \nIslander persons. When referring to the community on Palm Island, the parties used the descriptor \u201cAboriginal\u201d in \ntheir pleadings and submissions. Accordingly, that is the term I have adopted in these reasons. I accept there may \nbe Torres Strait Islanders on Palm Island, but there was no specific evidence adduced on that issue, nor did the \napplicants submit it was necessary specifically to refer to Torres Strait Islanders.  The applicants have made \nseveral changes to their pleadings throughout these proceedings. I summarised the changes made up until 21 \nAugust 2015 in Wotton v State of Queensland [2015] FCA 910 at [6]- [11], but will briefly repeat them here. The \napplicants filed the first version of their statement of claim on 22 October 2013. Throughout 2014, they filed three \nfurther iterations of the statement of claim: an amended statement of claim filed on 28 January 2014; a further \namended statement of claim filed on 29 May 2014 (together with an amended originating application); and a second \nfurther amended statement of claim filed on 1 August 2014. The respondents filed a defence on 3 October 2014 \nand the applicants a reply on 24 October 2014.  On 11 August 2015, less than a month before the trial was \nscheduled to commence, the applicants filed an interlocutory application to make substantial amendments to their \namended originating application and second further amended statement of claim. The application was heard on 19 \nAugust 2015 and, on 21 August 2015, I granted leave to the applicants to make some, but not all, of the \namendments they had sought leave to make: see Wotton [2015] FCA 910. In order to provide the respondents with \na proper opportunity to consider and respond to the amended pleadings, the hearing dates from 7 to 18 September \n2015 were vacated. It was determined that the Court would sit on Palm Island on the week commencing 21 \nSeptember 2015 and in Townsville in the week commencing 28 September 2015 and that a further tranche of trial \nwould be scheduled at a later date as required. The applicants filed a further amended originating application and \nthird further amended statement of claim on 25 August 2015.  Further interlocutory applications were made after the \ncommencement of the trial. The respondents objected to the admission of expert reports of Dr Rosalind Kidd and \nEmeritus Professor Jon Altman on the basis of relevance. On 23 September 2015, I made orders that the reports \nbe admitted and delivered brief reasons for my decision. On 28 September 2015, I refused an application by the \napplicants for closed court orders and suppression orders in respect of evidence concerning the psychological \ncondition of the first and third applicants. On 28 September 2015, the applicants applied to adduce further oral \nexpert evidence from sociolinguist Dr Diana Eades about specific parts of the evidence given by four Aboriginal \nwitnesses in an attempt to explain what the applicants seemed to consider might otherwise be seen as credibility \nissues with their evidence. On 29 September 2015, I refused that application for reasons given orally at the time \nwhich need not be rehearsed here.  The first week of the trial was, as foreshadowed, conducted on Palm Island. \nThe Court sat in the hall of the local school \u2013 the same school that was used as the police command post from 26 \nNovember 2004. During that week, the Court conducted, with the agreement and cooperation of the parties, a view \nof places on Palm Island which would feature in the evidence. Those places included the mall area in which \ncommunity meetings took place during the week of 22 November 2004; the police station, which was destroyed in \nthe protests and fires but has since been rebuilt in the same location; the hospital; the houses of the applicants and \nof certain members of the subgroup; and other locations at which events occurred which are the subject of this \nproceeding. A note of the view, which includes photographs of the locations visited by the Court, is an exhibit in the \nproceeding. I have drawn certain inferences from the view, as s 54 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) contemplates. \nThose inferences are set out at various places in these reasons. The view was material to many of the findings I \nhave made. An understanding of the nature of Palm Island, and its community, is critical to the resolution of many \ncontested issues in this proceeding. The view also informed my understanding of the contemporaneous evidence, \nincluding (but not limited to) the contemporaneous video evidence.\n\nPALM ISLAND    The applicants\u2019 claims in this proceeding cannot be understood without first appreciating the \nparticular history of Palm Island and its community. The particular features of this community form part of the \ncircumstances which existed on the island in November 2004. They are not mere matters of history, consigned to \nthe past without relevance to the present as it was in November 2004. My findings in this section are drawn from \nthe agreed facts; from the report of Dr Kidd, an expert called on behalf of the applicants, together with the annexed \n\n\n\nhistorical documents upon which her report was based; and from the report by Professor Altman, which was co-\nwritten with Dr Nicholas Biddle. Professor Altman was another expert called on behalf of the applicants. I discuss \nthe evidence given by Dr Kidd and Professor Altman, and their qualifications, at [441] and [450] below. In that \nsection I have made some findings about Dr Kidd which affect the weight I give to parts of her report. Given my \nreservations, I have relied more on the source material than on the commentary in Dr Kidd\u2019s report. Where I have \nrelied on Dr Kidd\u2019s summaries, these were aspects of her report that were not challenged in cross-examination.  On \nthe basis of the facts agreed between the parties, the population of Palm Island in 2006 was approximately 1,855 \npeople, 93.5% of whom identified as Indigenous. The 2001 census recorded the population as being approximately \n1,949 people, 90.8% of whom identified as Indigenous. I infer that in November 2004 the population, and the \nproportion of Indigenous people, was somewhere around or in between these two sets of figures. It was common \nground between the parties that the overwhelming majority of non-Aboriginal people who lived on Palm Island were \ninvolved in providing goods or services to the Aboriginal community. It is also necessary to acknowledge, soberly, \nthat the Palm Island community shares characteristics of disadvantage with other Aboriginal communities in \nQueensland and in other parts of Australia.  Gageler J provided a useful overview of the governance history of Palm \nIsland in Maloney v The Queen[2013] HCA 28; 252 CLR 168 at [255]:Palm Island comprises a group of ten \nislands forming part of Queensland situated about 70 km north of Townsville. Palm Island was established as an \nAboriginal reserve under Queensland legislation in 1914 and retained that or a similar status under subsequent \nQueensland legislation until 1986. Title to Palm Island was then granted in trust under the Land Act 1962 (Qld) to \nthe Palm Island Aboriginal Council, an Aboriginal council under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 \n(Qld) (the Aboriginal Communities Act), and Palm Island became a \u201ctrust area\u201d (subsequently redesignated a \n\u201ccommunity area\u201d) within the jurisdiction of the Palm Island Aboriginal Council under the Aboriginal Communities \nAct. In 2004, by force of the Local Government (Community Government Areas) Act 2004 (Qld) (the Community \nGovernment Areas Act), as well as being continued as a community area within the meaning of the Aboriginal \nCommunities Act as then amended, Palm Island was declared to be a \u201clocal government area\u201d and by virtue of that \nalso became a \u201ccommunity government area\u201d to which provisions of the Local Government Act 1993 (Qld) \nthereafter applied and the Palm Island Aboriginal Council was continued in existence as the Palm Island Shire \nCouncil.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    From 1897 until the early 1970s, the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of \nOpium Act 1897 (Qld) empowered the Queensland government to remove any Aboriginal person from rural and \ntown areas and confine them to Aboriginal reserves. From approximately 1914, the government operated an \nAboriginal reserve at what was known as Hull River on the northern coast of Queensland, now known as Mission \nBeach. This was the reserve to which Aboriginal people in northern Queensland were initially forcibly removed. \nReasons included their unemployment and an assessment that they were in need of \u2018protection\u2019. Removals \noccurred in circumstances where the demands of expanding white occupation of land in Queensland rendered the \noccupation by Aboriginal people of their country incompatible or inconvenient for white settlers.  Soon after its \nestablishment, the Hull River reserve experienced sufficient problems that the Queensland government began to \nlook for alternative locations for the reserve. In 1916, the government attempted to clear Palm Island of its original \nAboriginal inhabitants, being the traditional owners of the land and waters at Palm Island. When the Hull River \nsettlement was destroyed by a cyclone in 1918, John Bleakley, the then \u2018Chief Protector of Aboriginals\u2019, ordered \nthat the salvaged building materials and the inmates who had not died or escaped during and after the cyclone be \nrelocated to Challenger Bay on Palm Island. While there was little evidence in this proceeding about the \ndescendants of the original inhabitants of the island, it is apparent that some of the traditional owners retained their \nconnections and still comprise part of the Palm Island community: see, eg, The Manbarra People and Great Barrier \nReef Marine Park Authority [2004] AATA 268; 82 ALD 573 at [10].  Thus, Palm Island was occupied by Aboriginal \npeople before it was identified as a place for forced confinement and punishment. Dr Kidd reports that European \nawareness of the original Palm Islanders dates from a sighting by Captain James Cook in June 1770. She gives the \nfollowing summary of what historical records say about these people, and how they came to be tricked into leaving \nthe island (although a few of the original male inhabitants were transported back to assist in building the settlement \nfor other Aboriginal people who were to be forcibly removed there):Reports survive of periodic attacks by Palm \nIslanders on traders in b\u00eache-de-mer, trochus shell and sandalwood who visited Challenger Bay to recruit or kidnap \nmen and women. In 1877 it was suggested that Great Palm Island be declared an Aboriginal reserve to prevent \nEuropean incursions and protect Islanders from exploitation. \n\n\n\n Around the turn of last century there were around 50 men, women and children living on Palm Island although \nothers were said to be working on b\u00eache-de-mer and fishing boats. Reports of the Northern Protector and Chief \nProtector of Aboriginals record similar populations in the years to 1914. Families on the island reportedly lived well \nhaving their own cutter and two dinghies, well built gunyahs of thatched grass, hunting dogs to catch wild pig, and \nample supply of bush foods and fresh water.\n\n In 1913 the Townsville protector described Great Palm Island as a \u2018regular native camp and hunting ground\u2019[.] On \nhis suggestion most of the area was gazetted an Aboriginal reserve in June 1914. 226;128;\n\n In 1916 superintendent John Kenny, from the Hull River settlement reported that Challenger Bay would be a good \nsite for a new settlement. 226;128;\n\n The families on Palm Island were enticed to visit the Hull River settlement in 1916 with promises that they could \nreturn if they did not like it. Twenty-two men, women and children were removed, but refused permission to return.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Palm Island\u2019s remote geographical location made it a convenient place for the government \nto send people considered problematic, including those who had completed jail sentences or deserted compulsory \nlabour contracts. The island was described as a \u201cpunishment island\u201d, but it was used for other social and \ngovernmental purposes as well. This extract from Joanne Watson, Becoming Bwgcolman: Exile and Survival on \nPalm Island Reserve, 1918 to the Present (PhD thesis, The University of Queensland, 1994) at 72, which Dr Kidd \nprovided with her report, captures the thinking at the time:From 1897 the development of a punitive reserve on \nBadjala land at Fraser Island would serve as a prototype to the later institution on Palm. Murri ex-prisoners were \nsent to Fraser Island from Brisbane, Rockhampton, Roma, Townsville and Cardwell. By 1899 Roth, as Northern \nProtector, perceived Fraser Island as a place suited for the isolation of \u2018troublesome\u2019 or \u2018dangerous characters\u2019. \nThe island was under the surveillance of the armed physical presence of the Mestons and a lock-up and police \nforce soon established there. Those who were removed from their homelands developed an earth-eating disease. \nBefore its closure in 1905 the reserve had become \u2018a vast burial ground\u2019 where those who fell ill believed they were \n\u2018doomed to die\u2019.\n\n It was in the context of this historical background, combined with increasing numbers of removal orders, that Palm \nIsland was gazetted for reserve purposes. By 1916 Bleakley as Chief Protector complained to the Under Secretary \nthat neither Hull, Taroom nor Barambah could cope with the growing numbers of Murris under the Act, and that a \nreserve was needed \u2018suitable for use as a penitentiary\u2019, to confine \u2018the individuals we desire to punish\u2019. Bleakley \ndecided to take advantage of Kenny\u2019s removal of Wulgurugaba people to Hull River, to carry out an inspection of \nthe island, and the following year he reported that in \u2018Being an island\u2019 Palm \u2018also provided the security from \nescape required with such characters\u2019.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Dr Kidd also included an extract from Bill Rosser, Dreamtime Nightmares (1985) at 144-45. \nIn this extract, Fred Clay, who lived on Palm Island in the 1970s and was head of the island\u2019s Aboriginal Council, \ndescribes what happened when as a fifteen-year-old boy he tried to get off Palm Island to work in Cairns, and then \nto make his way elsewhere, but was recaptured. I refer to this extract because it is also a good example of the long \nand fraught relationship between Palm Island people and the Queensland Police Service:\u2018When they first opened \nthe settlement over there, they didn\u2019t have jails but, by gee, they used to handcuff them to a tree, you know. They \nused to have them in a chain-gang. In the early days,\u2019 [Fred] explained, \u2018they used to do all the clearing of the scrub \nby hand. There were no machines in those days\u2019. He gave a short laugh. \u2018Only a pick and shovel and the axe, \ngrubbing trees out. They cleared all the settlement there\u2019. He was silent again, probably thinking of the harsh \nconditions which he and his mates suffered in those far-off days. He stirred and said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t conscious of the Act \nuntil I left school. I was old enough to go to jail. That\u2019s when I realised that we had no hope on the island. It was \nthen that I realised the superintendent\u2019s powers.\u2019\n\n\n\n \u2018And you rebelled against it, even at that age?\u2019\n\n \u2018Yes, I did. Yes. I took off from Palm when I was fifteen. I went to work in Cairns under an agreement. I had my \nmoney sent to Palm. We didn\u2019t see the amount, they just filled it in \u2013 the Superintendent. We signed it. Each week I \nworked in Cairns, I got twenty-five shillings [$2.50] pocket money. So, I worked there for a year, then I jumped a \ntrain down to Ingham. I got in with a contractor, cutting cordwood for a sugar mill there. I was going bloody good, \ntoo, for about two months. Then, one dinner hour, a bloody big cop turned up.\u2019 Fred winced at the memory, \nshrugged his shoulders and then continued with his story.\n\n \u2018The cop was looking for a \u201cFred Clay\u201d. I said, \u201cI\u2019m Fred Clay\u201d. He said, \u201cAh, I\u2019ve got a warrant for your arrest and \nan order from the Department of Native Affairs to escort you back to Palm Island\u201d. This is when I was fifteen! I was \ngoing to go \u201cbush\u201d, but I saw this bloody big pistol handle sticking out of his pocket and I wasn\u2019t going to give the \nbastard a chance to shoot me. No way! He would have, I think. So, he took me to Ingham and put in the jail there, \nto wait for an escort to take me to Palm Island.\u2019\n\n \u2018They put you in jail \u2013 at fifteen?\u2019\n\n \u2018Yes. On the third day, this tracker turned up from Palm Island \u2013 my escort. He took me down to the railway station \nand handcuffed me to the seat. They didn\u2019t give him a key for the handcuffs. The police in Townsville had it. They \nwere waiting for us.\u2019\n\n Fred interrupted his story to look for a cigarette and was still wandering around when he resumed speaking. \u2018When \nwe got to Townsville a big cop came and released me from the seat and led me by the handcuffs. I stayed back in \nthe watchhouse for three or four days before I was taken back to the island. There, I went to jail first for fourteen \ndays, for absconding from the job in Cairns where I was under agreement with the Department of Native Affairs. \nAfter the fourteen days, I was given another six months punishment in the timber camp; that\u2019s around the back of \nthe island. I wasn\u2019t allowed to come into the settlement for six months.\u2019\n\n \u2018That was a bit rugged\u2019, I remarked.\n\n \u2018Yes, it was rugged all right,\u2019 Fred agreed. \u2018When I came back to the settlement, I was put to work on the wood \ncamp, cutting wood for the white people on the island.\u2019\n\n \u2018What pay did you get for that?\u2019 I asked.\n\n \u2018Heck! I wasn\u2019t on pay.\u2019\n\n \u2018No pay. Only rations?\u2019\n\n \u2018Yes, only rations. I didn\u2019t go on wages for about three years, I think, when I was eighteen. ...\u2019  In 1919, a \nmagistrate from Ingham was called to Palm Island following an assault by the Superintendent of the island, Robert \nCurry, on a German storeman.  The magistrate reported on the terrible conditions he observed on the island and \nmade a number of recommendations. Reference to one of them suffices to indicate the extremity of the living \nconditions, and attitudes, on the island at that time:That provision be made for such free issue that will allow \nunfinancial natives a change of clothing. As it is the gins at least some of them and some of the children have only \nwhat they stand up in and often after remaining unadorned while the said garment is being washed they put it on \nbefore it is properly dry thus leading to colds, pneumonia and other chest complaints.  Dr Kidd provides an overview \n\n\n\nof the layout of the settlement in the 1920s, including the poor living conditions:By 1923, after five years\u2019 \ndevelopment, the Palm Island population was around 730, including 200 children. Over half the children were kept \nin \u2018dormitories\u2019 comprising two tin sheds; there was neither school nor school teacher. Nor was there a qualified \nmedical practitioner, and even the monthly visits by the Ingham doctor had ceased. When the Queensland\u2019s \nGovernor Thatcher visited Palm that year, inmates protested their entrapment on poor rations comprising flour, \noccasional sweet potato, and 450 grams of meat weekly. Governor Thatcher criticised the policy of sending 100 \nable-bodied men to external employment to bring in revenue instead of using them for building and farming. He \nsupported their complaints in a letter to the minister, but nothing changed. \n\n By 1929, despite continuing substandard conditions and chronic illnesses on the Island, the government\u2019s \naggressive removal policy had increased the population to almost 1000 people.\n\n(Footnotes omitted).    The conditions on the island were deplorable and substandard in many areas of life over \nseveral decades. Dr Kidd\u2019s report identifies, for example, a critical shortage of food and resulting malnutrition, which \nwas particularly dire during the second world war; limited education and other opportunities for youth; widespread \nlethal diseases; very high infant mortality rates; chronic overcrowding in houses and dormitories; unsafe water and \ndefective sanitation; poor and oppressive management and policing by authorities on the island; and very poor \nquality medical facilities.  Although an education system was eventually established on the island, and children \nreceived schooling until the age of 14 years, their life and employment prospects remained extremely limited after \nthey finished their schooling. Teenage boys were sent back into the community without trades or other practical \nskills and teenage girls were either contracted to work on remote properties or, if unmarried, confined in dormitories \nfor decades. Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s own history, as recounted in her evidence, is an example.  In the 1920s, Robert \nCurry, an ex-serviceman, was in charge of the Palm Island settlement as Superintendent. Curry imposed and \nenforced strict curfews for the community and, armed with a revolver, patrolled the island with \u201cnative police\u201d who \nwere authorised to dispense punishments and break up meetings. Curry worked groups of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d in chain \ngangs clearing scrubs and trees. There were allegations that he interfered with Aboriginal girls and he was officially \nreprimanded for severely flogging an Aboriginal girl. In 1930, a few months after his wife died in childbirth, Curry \nkilled his son and stepdaughter, shot the local doctor and his wife, set fire to several staff homes, and blew up \nadministrative buildings. An Aboriginal man named Peter Prior shot Curry and fatally wounded him during this \nrampage, acting under the instructions of state police. Incredibly, Prior was later arrested for murder and jailed in \nTownsville for several months before the charges against him were dropped.  In the 1940s, regulations were \nintroduced to legitimise intensive control of Aboriginal people. Dr Kidd reports that:Inmates could be ordered to any \nsection of a reserve or to another settlement, they had to obey all orders, cease dancing or card playing if \ncommanded, surrender to the superintendent any property which might \u2018disturb the harmony, good order or \ndiscipline of the reserve\u2019. It was an offence \u2018to commit a nuisance\u2019, to act \u2018in a manner subversive to the good order\u2019 \nof the reserve, to be on a reserve or leave a reserve without permission, to refuse to work 32 hours per week. \nSuperintendents could censor mail and demand any correspondence be given to him. Superintendents appointed, \ndismissed, and made the rules for, community police who had powers to arrest and imprison those who breached \nthe regulations. Superintendents could pass sentence, and dictate behaviour and work of gaol inmates.  There were \nsignificant interferences with residents\u2019 personal autonomy and freedom of movement. In her report, Dr Kidd \ndiscusses a 1948 petition from a Palm Island woman which highlights the plight of the girls and women kept in \ndormitories:[The petition] implored the government to save her from her imprisoned existence where girls and \nwomen were locked up from 5 pm until 6 am, their only freedom a small patch of fenced grass. They could not shop \nor go to the weekly film show unless under police escort. For this \u2018free\u2019 show two shillings was deducted from the \nten shillings ($18.30) earned by the few dormitory monitors. While single girls were allowed 45 minutes once a \nweek to speak to boyfriends under police supervision, this small privilege was denied the writer, a widow. She \nblamed the suffocating confinement for girls becoming \u2018unbalanced\u2019 and running away after which, she said, \u2018the \nrope is tightened all the more\u2019 for those who remained trapped for life. (She didn\u2019t raise this with the visiting justice, \ndeclared the deputy director of Native Affairs, therefore \u2018she has no grounds for complaint\u2019.) Nothing changed.\n\n(Footnotes omitted).    Dr Kidd\u2019s summary of this source document is slightly inaccurate in parts. For example, the \npetition itself, poignantly written by one of the women living in the dormitory in 1948, states that the author was \u201ca \n\n\n\ndivorced woman\u201d rather than a widow.  Nonetheless, the 1948 petition, the role of Robert Curry and other \n\u201cSuperintendents\u201d on the island, and the role of the \u201cnative police\u201d give a flavour of the overwhelming, controlling \nand at times abusive role of the police in the lives of Palm Islanders: in this case, they were operating as guards to \nthe young women.  After noting in detail the appalling restrictions imposed on the women, and the quarantining and \nexpropriation of the paltry sums they earned for working, the author of the petition notes that any transgressions \n(such as stepping past lines intended to impose constraints on where the girls could move outside the dormitory \nbuildings) would result in jail. She then states:Sir, being Minister for Health and Home Affairs, do you consider these \nrules all above board, or do you think them a little inhuman, which is my point of view. We look to the white officials \nfor advice, help and protection. When we are in trouble we go to our Superintendent and he does try to right our \nwrong, yet I blame these rules over us girls which make some of them unbalanced and which cause them to break \nout of the Dormitory and run away.\n\n When one girl runs away the rope is tightened all the more. It is the ones that do try to live by the rules and help the \nstaff on this Island who suffer most. I myself have done my best, but as these rules stand I\u2019m afraid I will break \nthem by running away too.\n\n One girl at this moment has been gone now for a fortnight. When they get her she will get 6 weeks jail or maybe \nmore, on bread and water, but the girl is not at all to blame. Should we get a little more freedom without having the \npolice over us all the time I\u2019m sure the girls will be more contented. This is all I am going to say. I hope you will do \nsomething for us. Thanking you.  The poor medical facilities on Palm Island were documented in 1944 when, given \nthe infant mortality rate on the island was 15 times the infant mortality rate for Queensland generally at that time, a \nsenior Health Department officer was sent to investigate the facilities and conditions on the island. Dr Kidd \nsummarises the officer\u2019s findings, as well as the findings of other Department staff who visited the island around \nthis time in the following terms:He reported hospital practices were so defective that several child patients \ndeveloped septic sores; the diet was grossly deficient in milk, vegetables, and fruit. He said the resident doctor\u2019s \nbelligerent treatment of Aboriginal mothers was a major factor in the non-reporting of illness. (A visiting magistrate \nconfirmed the doctor had struck a female patient but said action against him would not succeed.) Perhaps seeking \nan acceptable internal assessment, the department sent the matron from its Cherbourg settlement. She reported \nthe hospital was in a filthy and neglected condition with many patients sleeping on old and soiled mattresses. \nChildren\u2019s cots and mattresses were filthy and crawling with cockroaches, the food store rooms were unventilated \nand full of flies and uncovered slops, and the labor ward was cramped and unhygienic.\n\n(Footnotes omitted).    Once again, this summary embellishes somewhat upon the source document. In it, the \nofficer does not state that the diet on the island was \u201cgrossly deficient in milk, vegetables, and fruit\u201d, although he \ndoes recommend that the matron should exercise vigilance to make sure each patient receives an adequate diet. \nNevertheless, the document clearly shows the deficiencies in health care and practice that existed on the island.  \nThe chief state health officer, Dr Abraham Fryberg, visited the island in July 1945 and gave the following summary \nof living conditions, which starkly illustrates how Aboriginal people were forced to live. I leave the language in its \noriginal form.DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, QUEENSLAND\n\n BRISBANE\n\n 13th July, 1945.\n\n The Deputy Director-General.\n\nRe Palm Island\n\n As directed I visited Palm Island arriving there on June 15th and leaving Fantome Island on June 19th.\n\n\n\n Palm Island was built as the result of a cyclone demolishing the settlement \u2013 at the mouth of the Hull River. 150 \nnatives were transferred there and this number has grown to approximately 1200 by \u20131. natural increase\n\n 2. transfer of natives of New Guinea\n\n 3. transfer of incorrigibles from all over QueenslandAccommodation\n\n Varies from the type made from pandanus leaves to up to date cottages. The poorest type of hut is occupied by the \npoorest type of native. As many as five people live in a room 10 x 12 ft. There is no space for furniture nor is there a \nkitchen in the poorer type.\n\n Every encouragement should be given to the inhabitants to improve their positions; many of the natives do make \nsomething out of their poor cottages. In such cases the authorities should assist them to get a better house. This \nwould give the natives something to strive for and would improve the general morale on the Island.\n\nKitchens\n\n Only provided in the better type of cottage. Cooking is carried out in the open. Cooking utensils are not provided. \nEquipment such as stores and pans are bought by natives who are earning money. No provision of safes to keep \nfood.\n\nLatrines.\n\n Daily pan service. Practically no latrines are fly-proof. The burial ground is situated at the waterfront a short \ndistance from the jetty. There is a native sanitary squad under the command of a native overseer. At the time of \ninspection the work for the day had been completed but faeces in big trenches had not been covered. A new burial \nground has been selected and will be put into use when a road has been made.\n\nAblutions.\n\n The sea. No bath houses as water supply is inadequate.\n\nLaundry facilities. Nil\n\nWater supply\n\n From shallow wells. No treatment. Hospital has tanks which will not hold water. Iron tanks holding 4470 gallons \nwhich originally cost 163;220 are available for 163;75. in Townsville from the Army Disposals Board. The Director of \nNative Affairs will inspect these tanks when he goes North on his next visit. In the dry season fresh water is in short \nsupply.\n\nHospital\n\n Consists of a male, female and maternity ward and operating theatre which is only used in extreme urgency. It is \nan old building and is far too small. It is suggested a new hospital might be erected from the Fantome Island \nbuildings. In fairness to the staff I must report the building was clean. I did not see sufficient of the staff to comment \non their efficiency.\n\n\n\nDairy.\n\n The dairy is a worthy institution but the hygiene is of a low standard, even though the utensils are clean. The \nutensils are stored in the open; the brass strainers are worn out and I was advised brass gauze could not be \nprocured.\n\n A building is required to house the utensils.\n\n The resting yard and bales have an earth floor and in the wet weather become a quagmire. No drains are provided. \nThe floor of the bales and part of the resting yard should be concreted.\n\nFarm.\n\n There is a super-abundance of vegetables at this time of the year but in the summer they will not grow on account \nof the heat.\n\n A few acres of land grown tomatoes, sweet potatoes and other vegetables are now under cultivation.\n\n The farm, which is under the supervision of Mr. Sturgess, who is doing an excellent job, is irrigated.\n\n Unfortunately Mr. Sturgess can only give a limited amount of time to it as he has too many other duties.\n\nMedical\n\n A matter of concern on the medical side is the infantile mortality rate, as is seen by the following figures.\n\n The deaths include 12 from prematurity, excluding still births. \n\n Total Deaths \u2013 78.\n\n Regular ante-natal treatment is not carried out. Facilities for child welfare are not provided as a regular thing.  Poor \nhealth issues continued. In 1973, there was a severe outbreak of gastroenteritis amongst the children on Palm \nIsland, leading to about 40 children being affected and many being hospitalised in Townsville. Doctors treating the \nchildren likened them to Biafran children in Africa.  State police were permanently stationed on Palm Island from \n1968, with one sergeant and one constable. In a 1980 report, Patrick Killoran, the director of the Department of \nAboriginal and Islander Advancement, stated that it was \u201ccommon gossip at Palm Island that the Police Station \nwas totally ineffective\u201d, with the station being shut on weekends and police officers taking extended weekends for \nfishing trips and spending long hours playing chess in public view while on duty. Killoran also commented that \nproblems were caused by quick promotions within the police force, which resulted in reasonably junior officers \nbeing promoted to sergeant positions when posted to Palm Island, quite often leading to personality clashes, \nculture shock, and other forms of discord between the inexperienced officers and the community.  Dr Kidd reports \nthat from the early years of the Palm Island settlement, an Aboriginal community police force played a central role \nin policing the island. They assisted in controlling public disorder and drunken violence and in identifying and \nlocating people the state police were looking for in relation to various civil matters. The existence of such a \u201cnative\u201d \nforce is apparent from the source documents to which I have already referred. However, Dr Kidd notes that \nAboriginal police officers often had difficult relationships with their own communities, and this was reflected in a \n1981 report titled \u2018The Position of Aboriginal Police on Queensland Reserves\u2019. That report also found that the state \nand Aboriginal police did not operate as a cohesive unit and that Aboriginal police officers were regarded as a \nseparate and inferior agency. Dr Kidd states that:Aboriginal police received no training, and were limited by poor \nliteracy. Unlike state police who were supplied with a private home, and \u2018all of the police benefits, allowances, \n\n\n\novertime etc\u2019, the native police were on call nights, weekends and public holidays on minimum wages while denied \npenalty rates, and were housed on Palm Island in a small poorly furnished room behind the cells. These \ndetrimental conditions underlay the lack of job experience expressed in a turnover of 62 workers for the nine \npositions. Native policing was \u2018fraught with danger\u2019 and their positions often untenable given \u2018problems of inter-\nfamily relationships and long-standing friendships\u2019 from childhood. These conflicts would not be faced by a state \npolice officer, who would \u2018not normally\u2019 be assigned to serve \u2018in the country town of his birth and upbringing.\u2019\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Dr Kidd reports that a 1991 review of the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 (Qld) \nrevealed that community complaints about the behaviour of state police were extensive and longstanding at that \ntime. The community was frustrated that police were not accountable to them and that there was no way they could \neffect changes to inappropriate police behaviours.  There has also been a long history of interference with workers\u2019 \nrights on Palm Island, including rights to equal pay. Dr Kidd\u2019s report describes how, pursuant to regulations in \n1919, every able-bodied person on Palm Island was required to work. However, no wage was set for government \nworkers. Aboriginal workers usually worked long hours with poor conditions for no or very little pay. The poor \nworking conditions and unequal pay for Aboriginal workers on Palm Island resulted in a strike in 1957, where all \nworkers (except those providing essential services) ceased work for approximately five days. Some witnesses in \nthis proceeding gave evidence about their parents having been involved in the strike.  While new regulations were \nintroduced in 1972 which declared that all Aboriginal workers must be paid an award wage, these regulations did \nnot apply to workers on government reserves such as Palm Island, where payment was labelled a \u201ctraining \nallowance\u201d, despite many employees having worked for decades. Other legal reforms in the 1970s did not improve \nconditions for Aboriginal workers. Dr Kidd reports that:After the 1975 ... federal Racial Discrimination Act made it \nillegal to underpay workers on the basis of race, the Queensland government continued its policy. Correspondence \nin mid-1978 put the state\u2019s profit at the expense of community workers at $3.6 million ($11 million) compared to the \nstate mandatory minimum wage and $6.85 ($21 million) if award wages were paid where due.  Finally, in 1986, \nfacing numerous union-funded wage challenges, the Queensland government agreed that award rates would be \npaid within existing budget levels. Further constructive changes occurred on Palm Island in the 1980s. After the \nCommunity Services (Aborigines) Act signalled the transfer of local government functions to community councils \nafter a three-year training period, the Palm Island community Council assumed local government functions in 1986. \nThe local Council gained title to Palm Island under a Deed of Grant in Trust, but at the same time the community \nlost the benefit of government infrastructure such as shops, a timber mill and farming equipment.  Palm Island\u2019s \nhistory also manifested itself in continuing socioeconomic disadvantage. Professor Altman and Dr Biddle\u2019s report \nprovides some information about the socio-economic circumstances of Palm Islanders at times close to November \n2004. Professor Altman and Dr Biddle used ABS census data from 2006 as the basis of their analysis \u2013 the 2006 \nnational census being the census closest to 2004. Professor Altman explained this use in his evidence:The way that \nthe census data is presented in community profiles ... is a summation of information for all the individuals on that \ncommunity that have been counted during the census collection day or period. It depends on which methodology is \nused, and so what I\u2019ve, in fact, referred to quite correctly is a \u2013 some summary statistics about that community \nwhich \u2013 which constitutes a summation, and then median information on \u2013 on Indigenous and non-Indigenous \nmembers of that community.\n\n Yes. The report uses data obtained from the 2006 census. Is that correct?---Yes. I chose to use the 2006 census \nbecause I thought this was an appropriate census to use, given that the issues that were under discussion occurred \nin 2004. I could have used the 2001 census, or the 2006 census, or the 2011 census, but the 2006 census \nappeared the most proximate.\n\n All right. And do I take from that you considered using the 2001 census, but you thought that was perhaps a little \ntoo early in time for 2004; 2006 was closer in time. Is that the thinking?---Yes, it was a lot closer. Yes.\n\n Yes. All right. And did you, in fact, look at the - - -?---Would it \u2013 I would add one other thing.\n\n Sure?---Is that experience tells us that census collection is \u2013 is continually improving, and so in some ways the \nlater the census one uses, the better, although if I had used 2011 I think that would have been too far away from \n\n\n\n2004.  In an analysis of the geographic distribution of socioeconomic outcomes for the Indigenous population \nAustralia-wide, Palm Island was ranked 475th out of 531 areas. With 1 being the most advantaged area and 531 \nthe most disadvantaged, this put Palm Island in the 89th percentile, and therefore one of the most disadvantaged \nIndigenous communities in Australia in 2006. Professor Altman and Dr Biddle commented on the \u201cmarked disparity\u201d \nin 2006 between median individual cash income for Indigenous people aged over 15 years on Palm Island ($216 \nper week) compared to $911 per week for non-Indigenous Palm Island residents, who were mostly professionals, \nteachers, police, and health services providers.  Professor Altman and Dr Biddle report that the unemployment rate \nin 2006 for Indigenous people on Palm Island was 17%, compared with 0% for non-Indigenous Palm Island \nresidents, 13.1% for Queensland Indigenous people generally, and 4.7% for Queenslanders generally. The \nemployment/population aged over 15 years ratio (35.7%) and the labour force participation rate (43.1%) for \nIndigenous people on Palm Island were also low compared to 83.3% and 83.3% respectively for non-Indigenous \nPalm Island residents, 48.9% and 56.2% respectively for Queensland Indigenous people generally, and 58.9% and \n61.8% respectively for Queenslanders generally.  Professor Altman and Dr Biddle concluded that:These statistics \ndespite arguments that they inevitably highlight Indigenous deficits because they reflect western norms reflected in \nsocial indicators, nevertheless indicate that Indigenous residents of Palm Island are as a group among the most \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged in Australia. Disparities are most clearly evident in a comparison between \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous residents of Palm Island which can be an acute source of community tension.\n\n But equally compared to Indigenous people elsewhere in Australia, Palm Islanders appear to be relatively badly off \n(ranking 475 out of 531 regions in 2006) an outcome that cannot just be explained by isolation and locational \ndisadvantage given Palm Island\u2019s relative proximity to the city of Townsville.\n\n(Footnotes omitted).    In November 2004, the matters which I have described were in the living memory of many \nresidents of Palm Island. In the contemporaneous video evidence adduced in this proceeding, the number of \nelderly people in the Palm Island community is easily visible. In 2004, people such as Agnes Wotton had personal, \nlived experience of some of the events, living conditions, and police behavior that is the history of Palm Island. \nThose people knew, through their parents and grandparents, of the earlier abuses and deprivations inflicted on \nAboriginal people on Palm Island, to which I have referred. In November 2004, the children and grandchildren of \npeople such as Agnes Wotton were the young people one sees in the contemporaneous video evidence. The \nhistory of the Palm Island community was a living history. Places around the island still went by names which \nresonated with that history \u2013 many witnesses called the area in which the mall, police station, Council building and \nstore were located \u201cthe Mission\u201d, because that is where the dormitories were located. The area where Mr Wotton \nand his family lived is called \u201cThe Farm\u201d, because that is where, in the early days of forced settlement on Palm \nIsland, a dairy farm was established. The historical experiences of families on the island with the police is \ninformed by the kinds of matters to which I have referred. Police were the ones who acted as guards, who placed \nlocals in jail for minor infringements of rules applying only to Aboriginal people, who sought out those who fled the \nisland and brought them back to be placed in jail. Control and subordination on a racial basis was central to the \nway this community had always been compelled to function. These matters were part of their lives, not simply \nentries in the history books and archives.  The pattern of arrests for minor infringements was, on the evidence, still \noccurring in 2004.  My overwhelming impression of the (current or former) QPS members who gave evidence in this \nproceeding was that they knew little or nothing about the history of Palm Island. Most freely admitted this. They \nalso paid no real attention to the particular history and characteristics of Palm Island and its people in the approach \nthey took to the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death and their subsequent interactions with local people, with elders and \nwith the Council. Yet it is clear in the contemporaneous video evidence that the palpable sense of powerlessness \nand injustice felt by people attending the community meetings is connected with the history of Palm Island, and the \nhistories of their own families.  If content is to be given to the obligation, contained in sections of the QPS \nOperational Procedures Manual (OPM) as it applied in November 2004, to consider \u201ccultural needs\u201d, then in the \ncase of Palm Island those cultural needs could not possibly be understood or met in any genuine way without a \ngood working appreciation of the racism and oppression that characterised the island\u2019s history.\nTHE PARTIES\u2019 COMPETING CONTENTIONS    Before descending into the resolution of the significant number of \nfactual and legal issues in this proceeding, it is necessary to make some preliminary comments on the parties\u2019 \ncompeting contentions on both facts and law, as they were developed in final submissions. It is also convenient to \n\n\n\naddress a number of connected issues, including the scope of the applicants\u2019 case on the pleadings, the standard \nof proof to be applied in assessing the evidence, the nature of the findings I make regarding the conduct of SS \nHurley, and the matters that are not in contest between the parties.\nThe approach I have taken to the parties\u2019 competing contentions, as expressed in final submissions    It is easy to \nget lost in the detail of a proceeding such as this, and to pay insufficient attention to the real controversy between \nthe parties. In the present case, and almost despite the detail, the real controversy between the parties, while acute, \nis not difficult to summarise: see [7]-[12] above.  At this point, the approach taken by Allsop J in Baird v Queensland \n[2006] FCAFC 162; 156 FCR 451 should be recalled. Dealing with issues of ambiguity and lack of clarity in the \npleadings in that case, his Honour said at [17]:The pleading is to be understood in its context. It is not to be read \ndivorced from counsel\u2019s opening and how the case was otherwise litigated. This is not to say that the pleadings are \nother than central to understanding what was fought below and thus what can be raised on appeal. But to the \nextent that context may cure or ameliorate ambiguity or lack of clarity, it is not to be ignored.  When his Honour then \ncame to identify the allegations made in relation to s 9 of the RDA in that case, he took the following approach (at \n[25]-[29]):A number of matters appear to flow from, and can be said in consequence of, the above outline of the \npresentation of the case. First, read in their context, the amended application and the Consolidated Statement of \nClaim contain a case based on s 9 of the RD Act not dependent upon any finding that the appellants were \nemployed by the State.\n\n Secondly, the case put forward was in effect that determining and paying the grants in the amounts that were fixed \nhad the effect of at least impairing the enjoyment of a relevant human right (the right to equal pay for equal work, by \nreference to applicable award rates) because the grants did not permit or did not enable the Church to pay award \nrates or because the grants effectively determined the amount to be paid in wages by the Church.\n\n Thirdly, the reference to the payments of the grants as the \u201cacts\u201d for s 9 incorporated, from time to time, notions of \ndecisions concerning how the grants were calculated. The primary case of the appellants was to the effect that the \nState in fact and in practical reality calculated the amount of the wages to be paid in the calculation of the grants. \nThis threw up for consideration, as a central issue in the case, how the grants were calculated and the relationship \nbetween the calculation and payment of the grants and the payment of below award-wages.\n\n Fourthly, there was a degree of imprecision and confusion in the identification of the distinction, exclusion, \nrestriction or preference for the purposes of s 9(1) and the relationship of such with race. What can be said, it \nseems to me, is that within the pleading and submissions can be found the assertions that the acts of calculating \nand paying the grants involved taking into account that the funds would be required to fund below-award wages as \ndistinct from award wages and that the calculation of the grants was made on that basis. This occurred, so it was \nsaid, because the ultimate recipients of the below-award wages were Aboriginals.\n\n Fifthly, in fairness to the pleader, some of the difficulty in enunciating how the case fits into s 9 on the hypothesis \nthat the State was not the employer of the appellants can be seen to flow from the almost elusive simplicity of s \n9(1), the content of which can be described as \u201cvague and elastic\u201d: see Gibbs J in Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA \n11; (1985) 159 CLR 70 at 86. Nevertheless, what was thrown up for debate and consideration were the calculation \nof the grants, the relationship between the amounts of the grants fixed upon and paid, the payment of below-award \nwages, the reasons why the appellants were paid below-award wages, and why the amounts of the grants were \ncalculated as they were.  I have extracted these paragraphs in their entirety to make good the following proposition. \nAlthough, especially in a large and wide-ranging proceeding such as this, it is important to hold a party to the party\u2019s \n\u2018case\u2019 (including, as a cornerstone, the pleadings), in order to do justice between the parties, the Court must strive \nto ascertain, as Allsop J put it, what is \u201cthrown up for debate and consideration\u201d by the case as it has been framed. \nAt times, the respondents\u2019 approach in final submissions was, in my opinion, too narrow and sought to have the \nCourt quarantine and assess in isolation the applicants\u2019 factual allegations. In my opinion, the approach taken by \nthe applicants in final submissions remained broadly consistent with their pleadings and properly grouped the \nconduct of QPS officers into four categories. Within each category there may be several \u201cacts\u201d for the purposes of s \n9 of the RDA, but it is appropriate to deal with the applicants\u2019 allegations in a more holistic way than the \nrespondents\u2019 submissions suggested.  For example, the respondents submitted, on the basis of the Full Court\u2019s \ndecision in Iliafi v The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Australia [2014] FCAFC 26; 221 FCR 86 at [44], \n\n\n\nthat there were a number of \u201celements\u201d to s 9(1), and in their written submissions, set out what they said the \napplicants had to prove in the following way:(a) the officer did an act;\n\n (b) the act:-(i) involved a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference;\n\n (ii) based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin; and(c) the act:-(i) had the purpose or effect of \nnullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing of a right of the applicants;\n\n (ii) which right was a human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other \nfield of public life.  It is correct that this is how Kenny J (with whom Greenwood J and Logan J agreed) in Iliafi set \nout what the appellants had to prove in the case before her. I do not understand this paragraph of her Honour\u2019s \nreasons as doing more than that. In particular, I do not read her Honour\u2019s reasons as suggesting that the division of \ns 9(1) into a series of smaller elements is a necessary part of s 9(1). In Iliafi, the respondent, the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints Australia, had discontinued its Samoan-speaking worship groups so that the appellants \nwere no longer able to worship publicly as a group in their native Samoan language at services conducted by the \nChurch. As Kenny J observed at [46] the central issue was whether or not the appellants had in fact identified a \nright that could be properly described as \u201ca human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, \ncultural or any other field of public life\u201d, within the meaning of s 9. Her Honour held that the three rights in Arts \n5(d)(iii), (vii) and (viii) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \n(ICERD) neither separately nor together gave rise to a right to worship publicly as a group in the appellants\u2019 native \nlanguage at the Church\u2019s services of public worship. Therefore, the appellants failed to establish that there was a \n\u201chuman right or fundamental freedom ... of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention\u201d that engaged s 9: at \n[110].  There was no dispute in Iliafi about what constituted the \u201cact\u201d for s 9 purposes. The appellants submitted that \nthe \u201cact\u201d was the Church\u2019s decision to cease Samoan language services, or alternatively to require services to be \nconducted in English (see [21]), and the Full Court did not have cause to comment on the correctness of that \ncharacterisation in its reasons.  In the present case, the respondents\u2019 submissions respond to the applicants\u2019 case \nat the level of itemised conduct of each individual QPS officer. Such a narrow and granular focus is not always \nrequired. The applicants\u2019 case, as disclosed through the pleadings and final submissions, takes the conduct of QPS \nofficers at both a broad and a particular level.  The applicants\u2019 factual contentions traverse a wide range of conduct \nby QPS officers. Sometimes the contentions do descend into great detail, and examine police conduct at quite a \nminute level, including by copious references to sections of the OPM and alleged non-compliance by QPS officers \nwith those sections. In circumstances such as these, it is likely (and has proven to be the case in my opinion) that \ncontraventions of s 9 will not be made out at such a detailed level, measuring each individual piece of conduct \nagainst s 9. It is also true that where there is a serious allegation of individual conduct it may well sustain a \ncontention that the conduct contravenes s 9, and this has also proven to be the case in this proceeding.  The detail \nin the applicants\u2019 allegations and arguments tended to overwhelm the general narrative and thrust of their case. To \nthat extent, the respondents cannot fairly be criticised for taking the plethora of allegations of individual conduct and \ndealing with them one by one. Rather, the point I am making is that a more holistic approach to s 9 is required, if it \nis to be properly understood.  Prior to final submissions, and in order to ascertain what was really \u201cthrown up for \ndebate and consideration\u201d, I asked the parties to provide a summary, limited to 3 pages, of their contentions on the \nspecific contraventions of the RDA alleged by the applicants (with cross-references to the pleadings and \nsubmissions). This was to encourage closer focus on how it was that conduct of QPS officers was said to \ncontravene the RDA, rather than how it was said to be generally substandard, or non-compliant with various \nprocedural requirements such as those set out in the OPM.  Those summary documents proved most helpful in re-\nfocusing the parties\u2019 arguments on contraventions of the RDA and in identifying the principal conduct impugned by \nthe applicants. In that regard, I note that the applicants pleaded that the second respondent, the Commissioner, had \na general \u201cprescribed responsibility\u201d pursuant to subs 4.8(1) and (2) of the Police Service Administration Act 1990 \n(Qld) (PSA Act) for the efficient and proper administration, management and functioning of the QPS, including its \n\u201cpriorities\u201d and the conduct and discipline of its members. However, in final submissions the applicants did not press \nthis as an independent ground of liability, focusing instead on the actions of individual officers for whose conduct \nthe first respondent is vicariously liable.\n\n\n\nTwo aspects of the legal contentions    There are two aspects of the legal contentions which should be summarised \nhere. The first is the nature and scope of the general legal duties and responsibilities said by the applicants to be \napplicable to the conduct of the police officers during the events in November 2004. The second is the parties\u2019 \nrespective contentions about the operation and application of s 9 of the RDA.\n\nNature and scope of the legal duties of QPS officers  The applicants contend the impugned conduct of QPS officers \nshould be viewed through the prism of the general legal duties and responsibilities of police officers, at an \nindividual and a systemic level, to members of the Queensland community whether individually or in relation to the \nwhole community. These duties are identified by the applicants as having their source in the common law and the \nprovisions of the PSA Act, read with the OPM and the QPS Human Resource Management Manual (although the \nManual barely featured in evidence or submissions). As I develop below, many of the applicants\u2019 allegations \nidentified non-compliance by QPS officers with their duties as the \u201cdistinction\u201d involved in their conduct for the \npurposes of s 9.  As the respondents submit, the applicants did not plead any common law duties informing or \ngoverning the conduct of QPS officers in the events in November 2004. In any event, it is difficult to see what the \nexistence of common law duties (assuming some could be identified) could add to the wide-ranging duties imposed \non the QPS officers by, and pursuant to, statute. It may well be that the statutory functions and powers of QPS \nofficers operate \u201cin the milieu of the common law\u201d (see Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] \nHCA 59; 200 CLR 1 at [26] (Gaudron J)) but the applicants did not develop any submissions about the content of \nthat \u201cmilieu\u201d.  The respondents admit that at all material times the functions of the QPS included those set out in s \n2.3 of the PSA Act, namely:(a) the preservation of peace and good order\u2014(i) in all areas of the State ...(b) the \nprotection of all communities in the State and all members thereof\u2014(i) from unlawful disruption of peace and good \norder that results, or is likely to result, from\u2014(A) actions of criminal offenders;\n\n (B) actions or omissions of other persons;(ii) from commission of offences against the law generally;(c) the \nprevention of crime;\n\n (d) the detection of offenders and bringing of offenders to justice;\n\n (e) the upholding of the law generally; ...  The respondents also accept that those officers involved in the \ninvestigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death had the following legal obligations:(a) to expeditiously conduct an impartial \ninvestigation;\n\n (b) to perform their duties in such a manner that public confidence and trust in the integrity and impartiality of the \nQPS is preserved; and\n\n (c) to perform their duties impartially and in the best interests of the community of Queensland without fear or \nfavour.  These obligations can be described as a synthesis of what is found in s 2.3 of the PSA Act, ss 2.5.1 and \n2.5.3 of the OPM (set out at [166] and [167] below), and a range of obligations imposed by the QPS Code of \nConduct. Although the respondents contended in their defence that the Code of Conduct was not legally \nenforceable, the concession described at [77] above recognises what is inherent in s 2.3 of the PSA Act.  Although \nthis is expressed in the respondents\u2019 submissions by reference to the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death, in my \nopinion there can be no meaningful distinction between the existence of those obligations in relation to a death in \ncustody, and the existence of those obligations in relation to the subsequent conduct of the QPS on Palm Island \nuntil approximately 28 November 2004 (which is the end point of the applicants\u2019 allegations). In other words, the \nrequirement to act impartially which the respondents accept attached to the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death is a \ngeneral requirement to act impartially attaching to all relevant conduct of QPS officers.  I did not understand the \nrespondents\u2019 submissions to cavil with that proposition, although senior counsel for the respondents did submit that \nthe way the \u201cimpartiality duty\u201d was pleaded was something of an artificial construct. I agree with that submission. \nThe important point, however, is that, in their conduct as police officers in all circumstances (for example, during an \ninvestigation, during public policing duties, when searching for and apprehending persons suspected of \ncommitting offence, when detaining suspects, and when dealing with the general public and communities in \nrelation to law and order issues) it is clear that QPS officers, like all other police officers, have a duty to act in the \n\n\n\nmanner described at [77] above.  The applicants submitted the \u201cimpartiality duty\u201d, as they described it, could be \napproached from the standpoint of the authorities on apprehended bias (Isbester v Knox City Council [2015] HCA \n20; 255 CLR 135)and procedural fairness (Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57; 170 CLR 596), and then also referred \nto Beckett v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 1017, which is a malicious prosecution case. The \nrespondents also referred to Isbester, mostly to submit it was of little assistance. This is one of several areas in \nwhich the parties\u2019 submissions did not assist the Court. Isbester is a decision dealing with apprehended bias as a \ncomponent of the rules of procedural fairness in the exercise of a statutory power (to destroy a dog), and dealing in \nparticular with the question whether a person who has previously performed a role as an \u201caccuser\u201d or \u201cprosecutor\u201d \ncan be involved in the making of a decision. The circumstances of Isbester are far removed from the circumstances \nof the present proceeding.  Beckett is a case to which I return later in these reasons in relation to damages. I outline \nthe circumstances of Beckett at [1751] and [1763] below. Like most successful malicious prosecution cases, \nHarrison J recognised there needed to be a finding that a police officer (or prosecutor, but both exercising public \npowers to maintain the rule of law) in commencing or continuing a prosecution did so for a dominant purpose other \nthan the proper invocation of the law \u2013 namely, an illegitimate or \u201coblique\u201d motive: see A v New South Wales [2007] \nHCA 10; 230 CLR 500 at [91] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ). Although the \nlanguage of impartiality is not generally used in the authorities dealing with malicious prosecution, impartiality is \nplainly an underlying premise in the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  The role of choice, or discretion, in \nthe performance of police functions and the exercise of police powers on a day-to-day basis has been the subject \nof considerable commentary: see S Bronitt and P Stenning, \u2018Understanding Discretion in Modern Policing\u2019 (2011) \n35 Crim LJ 319 and the sources to which they refer. Like other public powers and functions (and especially so \nwhere they affect liberty or involve coercion) they must be exercised reasonably, rationally and fairly: Minister for \nImmigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332 at [14], [23] (French CJ), [48], [64] (Hayne, Kiefel \nand Bell JJ), [88]-[89], [92] (Gageler J). The Supreme Court of Canada put in this way in Beaudry v The Queen \n[2007] 1 SCR 190 at [35]-[39]:There is no question that police officers have a duty to enforce the law and \ninvestigate crimes. The principle that the police have a duty to enforce the criminal law is well established at \ncommon law: R. v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [1968] 1 All E.R. 763 (C.A.), per Lord Denning, M.R., at p. \n769; Hill v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire,[1987] UKHL 12; [1988] 2 All E.R. 238 (H.L.), per Lord Keith of \nKinkel; P. Ceyssens, Legal Aspects of Policing (looseleaf ed.), vol. 1, at pp. 222 et seq.\n\n Moreover, this principle is codified in s. 48 of the Police Act, R.S.Q., c. P13.1:  The mission of police forces and of \neach police force member is to maintain peace, order and public security, to prevent and repress crime and, \naccording to their respective jurisdiction as set out in sections 50 and 69, offences under the law and municipal \nbylaws, and to apprehend offenders.In pursuing their mission, police forces and police force members shall ensure \nthe safety of persons and property, safeguard rights and freedoms, respect and remain attentive to the needs of \nvictims, and cooperate with the community in a manner consistent with cultural pluralism. Police forces shall target \nan adequate representation, among their members, of the communities they serve.Nevertheless, it should not be \nconcluded automatically, or without distinction, that this duty is applicable in every situation. Applying the letter of \nthe law to the practical, reallife situations faced by police officers in performing their everyday duties requires that \ncertain adjustments be made. Although these adjustments may sometimes appear to deviate from the letter of the \nlaw, they are crucial and are part of the very essence of the proper administration of the criminal justice system, or \nto use the words of s. 139(2), are perfectly consistent with the \u201ccourse of justice\u201d. The ability \u2014 indeed the duty \u2014 \nto use one\u2019s judgment to adapt the process of law enforcement to individual circumstances and to the reallife \ndemands of justice is in fact the basis of police discretion. What La Forest J. said in R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. \n387, at p. 410, is directly on point here:Discretion is an essential feature of the criminal justice system. A system \nthat attempted to eliminate discretion would be unworkably complex and rigid.Thus, a police officer who has \nreasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed, or that a more thorough investigation might \nproduce evidence that could form the basis of a criminal charge, may exercise his or her discretion to decide not to \nengage the judicial process. But this discretion is not absolute. Far from having carte blanche, police officers must \njustify their decisions rationally.\n\n\n\n The required justification is essentially twofold. First, the exercise of the discretion must be justified subjectively, \nthat is, the discretion must have been exercised honestly and transparently, and on the basis of valid and \nreasonable grounds (reasons of Chamberland J.A., at para. 41). Thus, a decision based on favouritism, or on \ncultural, social or racial stereotypes, cannot constitute a proper exercise of police discretion. However, the officer\u2019s \nsincere belief that he properly exercised his discretion is not sufficient to justify his decision.\n\n Hence, the exercise of police discretion must also be justified on the basis of objective factors. I agree with Doyon \nJ.A. that in determining whether a decision resulting from an exercise of police discretion is proper, it is important to \nconsider the material circumstances in which the discretion was exercised. ...  It was not in dispute between the \nparties that QPS members, like other police officers around Australia, had special responsibilities and obligations in \nrelation to the death of any person in police custody. There was no dispute that the principal source of those \nresponsibilities and duties for QPS officers was the OPM at ss 1.17 and 16.24. Clause 7.2 of the Queensland \nCoroner\u2019s Guidelines confirmed the particular sensitivities of such circumstances:Deaths in custody warrant \nparticular attention because of the responsibility of the state to protect and care for people it incarcerates, the \nvulnerability of people deprived of the ability to care for themselves, the need to ensure the natural suspicion of the \ndeceased\u2019s family is allayed and public confidence in state institutions is maintained.  The respondents also \naccepted that there was a suite of special considerations about the treatment of Aboriginal people in custody, \narising out of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC), which I \naddress at [129] below, and out of the reaction of state and federal governments to those recommendations. Where \nthe parties differed was on the significance (if any) of these matters to the allegations made by the applicants. The \napplicants submitted that those police officers present on Palm Island after Mulrunji\u2019s death and with responsibility \nfor the investigation, and for dealing with Mulrunji\u2019s family and the wider Palm Island community, should have \nknown more than they appeared to have known about recommendations in the RCIADIC report. The applicants \nalso submitted that QPS officers should have the acted consistently with those recommendations in the way they \ndischarged their duties during the events in November 2004. However, once again, the content of such \nresponsibilities or obligations arising from the RCIADIC report was not addressed by the applicants.  The police \nofficers who gave evidence disclosed little interest in the RCIADIC recommendations and little awareness of how \nthe matters discussed by the Royal Commission should affect their day-to-day policing where any Aboriginal \nperson dies in custody or where there is a risk of that occurring, especially in communities consisting \noverwhelmingly of Aboriginal people. This attitude is one of the circumstantial matters contributing to the view I \nhave formed that the conduct of QPS officers in the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death involved distinctions that \nwere based on race.\n\nParties\u2019 arguments on s 9 of the RDA  There are some differences between the parties on the construction and \noperation of s 9, although the larger area of dispute relates to the application of s 9 to the facts. I have set out my \nfindings on the construction and operation of s 9 at [508] to [562] below.  As I have noted above, while s 9(1) can be \nbroken down into a series of elements or components, it is important not to lose sight of the whole, and to read the \nprovision accordingly: see Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Limited [1996] HCA 36; 186 CLR 389 at 399-400 \n(Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ), endorsing comments made by Oliver LJ in Exxon \nCorporation v Exxon Insurance Ltd [1982] Ch 119 at 144; and see Baird at [37], [61] (Allsop J). The respondents \naccept, in general, that the applicants have alleged a series of \u201cacts\u201d (including omissions \u2013 see RDA s 3(3)) for the \npurpose of s 9 which, whether taken individually, or in groups, or cumulatively, can be assessed in terms of whether \nthey contravene s 9. There is broad agreement about the construction of the terms in the phrase \u201cdistinction, \nexclusion, restriction or preference\u201d in s 9 and the proposition that whether these matters exist must be determined \nobjectively:Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [209] (Cowdroy J). \nThe parties are also agreed on the correct approach to the causal element of \u201cbased on\u201d in that section. An act will \nbe based on race if it is done by reference to the race of a person and does not require the stronger causal \nrelationships that it be done \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cby reason of\u201d race: Macedonian Teachers\u2019 Association of Victoria Inc v \nHuman Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1998] FCA 1650; 91 FCR 8 at 29-30 (Weinberg J). The parties \nare agreed that the same approach applies to omissions. There is broad agreement between the parties about the \ndifferences of the words \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d in s 9, and the proposition that the phrase \u201con an equal footing\u201d in s \n9 suggests a comparison with how others enjoy the identified rights: Australian Medical Council v Wilson [1996] \n\n\n\nFCA 1618; 68 FCR 46 at 63 (Heerey J), and see the additional comments of Black CJ at 48 and Sackville J at 81.  \nThere is some contest between the parties about the nature and content of the human rights on which the \napplicants rely, and which they contend have been nullified or impaired by the respondents\u2019 conduct. The applicants \nrefined, over the course of the proceeding, the human rights on which they rely. At the time of final submissions, \nthey relied on seven human rights, namely:(a) to equality before the law and equal protection of the law (Art 26 of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and contended to be also a right in customary \ninternational law);\n\n (b) to equal treatment before organs administering justice (ICERD Art 5(a));\n\n (c) to access public services (ICERD Art 5(f));\n\n (d) to enjoyment of property without unlawful interference (contended to be a customary or general international \nlaw right);\n\n (e) not to be subjected to unlawful interference with privacy, family or home (ICCPR Art 17);\n\n (f) to liberty and security of person (ICERD Art 5(b) and ICCPR Art 9); and\n\n (g) not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment (ICCPR Art 7).  As I understand their submissions, the \nrespondents submit that Arts 5(a) and 5(f) of the ICERD are not engaged on the facts. As to Art 5(b) of the ICERD \nand Arts 7, 9 and 17 of the ICCPR (which apply to the subgroup members only) the respondents submit those \nrights, properly construed, have not been impaired. The respondents also submit, referring to Maloney at [317] and \n[336] (Gageler J), that the applicants cannot invoke Art 26 of the ICCPR (the equality before the law right, including \nin any form it exists in customary international law). They submit that, since s 9 is a means by which the objective \nexpressed in Art 26 is achieved, to construe Art 26 as part of the content of s 9 involves \u201cunproductive circularity\u201d. \nFinally, they submit that the applicants should not be permitted to rely on any general right to enjoy property as it is \noutside the applicants\u2019 pleaded case and, in any case, reliance on such a right is unnecessary because the \napplicants\u2019 complaints with respect to interference with their homes is covered by Art 17 of the ICCPR.\n\nThe applicants\u2019 s 9 contentions applied to the facts    I have outlined the three sets of issues on the pleadings, only \ntwo of which were pressed, at [7]-[12] above. On the first set of issues (the events following Mulrunji\u2019s death, \nbetween 19 and 24 November 2004), the applicants identify four categories of conduct which they contend \nconstitute unlawful racial discrimination. Those four categories are: the compromise of the impartiality of the \ninvestigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death; the failure to provide support to Aboriginal witnesses; the manner in which QPS \nofficers completed a \u201cForm 1\u201d, containing information for the coroner, and the conduct of the autopsy; and the \nfailure to meet the cultural needs and expectations of the Palm Island community.  On the second set of issues (the \nevents immediately following the burning down of the police station, between 22 and, broadly, 28 November 2004), \nthe applicants identify six categories of conduct which they contend constitute unlawful racial discrimination. Those \nsix categories are: the departure of SS Hurley from Palm Island; failure by QPS officers to communicate with the \nlocal community and defuse tensions; the making and subsequent revocation of an emergency declaration under \nthe PSP Act; the deployment of SERT officers; the arrests of those suspected of involvement in the burning down \nof the police station and the unrest on the island; the entries onto the properties and into the houses of those \nsuspects; and a sixth category of a collection of other more specific instances of conduct the applicants allege to \nhave been racially discriminatory in contravention of s 9 of the RDA.  In their summary of final submissions, the \napplicants re-organised these issues into four, broadly chronological, categories: the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath; the \u2018intervening week\u2019 claim; the emergency declaration claim; and the SERT claim. All these matters fell \nwithin their pleadings.  In that part of my reasons below where I make findings on the contested allegations (the \nResolution section, beginning at [717] below), I deal with the fact finding under each of the four categories identified \nby the applicants in final submissions, read with the pleadings.\n\nWhether certain claims by the applicants are within their pleaded case    In final submissions, the respondents \nidentified two areas where they contended the applicants\u2019 submissions strayed outside the pleaded case.  The first \n\n\n\nwas the applicants\u2019 submission that the conduct of QPS officers could be examined cumulatively, or as a whole, in \nrelation to each of the four categories I have set out at [5] above. The respondents submitted there was no pleading \nthat alleged a contravention of s 9 by the conduct in each of the four categories when viewed as a whole or \ncumulatively.  In my opinion it is clear that the applicants put their claim on alternative bases. It is correct that they \npleaded that individual activities constituted contraventions of s 9. Many of those claims must fail, for reasons I give \nelsewhere, because when the conduct of QPS officers is dissected in that way, then as dissected no contravention \nof s 9 is made out.  However, the applicants also relied on the conduct of QPS officers in a more cumulative way. \nThat is apparent from the descriptions of the \u201cQPS Failures\u201d in [244] and the \u201cFurther Failures\u201d in [309] of the third \nfurther amended statement of claim, in which various allegations are grouped under each of those headings. The \nsummary of final submissions by the applicants does not, in my opinion, constitute a new case based around four \ncategories of contraventions of s 9 presented in a new, cumulative way that is not reflected in their pleaded case. \nThe grouping found in final submissions is apparent from the descriptions of \u201cQPS Failures\u201d and \u201cFurther Failures\u201d \nin the third further amended statement of claim. What the applicants then did in their summary of final submissions \nwas to attempt to identify \u2013 by reference to the chronology of events, the pleadings and the submissions \u2013 how it \nwas said that the impugned actions and decisions of QPS officers contravened s 9 of the RDA. This is what I had \nasked them to do in their summary and by undertaking that task the applicants have not changed or altered their \nfundamental case. In their summary document, the applicants put their case directly in the terms of s 9 of the RDA, \nwhich is what I had asked them to do. I do not accept the respondents\u2019 submissions that the applicants have \nchanged their case.  The second area was the nature of the challenge to the conduct of the SERT officers on 27 \nand 28 November 2004. The respondents submitted there was, first, no s 9 challenge to the decision to deploy \nSERT officers to Palm Island and, second, no s 9 challenge to the decision to use SERT officers to effect the \narrests of the 11 individuals over 27, 28 and 29 November 2004.  The applicants\u2019 senior counsel in final \nsubmissions expressly disclaimed an argument based on any decision to deploy SERT to Palm Island, as distinct \nfrom what happened once SERT was deployed to Palm Island. However, she maintained, as did the applicants\u2019 \nsummary of final submissions, that the pleadings did disclose claims about the use of SERT to effect the arrests, \nentries and searches of the houses of the applicants and the members of the subgroup. As will be apparent from \nthe part of my reasons dealing with these issues, I accept that claim was fairly raised on the pleadings. Adapting the \nlanguage of Art 5(f) of the ICERD, senior counsel for the applicants submitted that the applicants have \u201cfocussed \nmore on the way the services were delivered on the island once they were there\u201d. She confirmed this included a \nclaim that SERT should not have been engaged to perform the arrests and should not have been instructed to go \ninto the houses and apprehend individuals.  I have some sympathy for the respondents\u2019 submissions. I too found it \ndifficult to keep comparing the way the case about SERT was put in submissions, and indeed the way the cross-\nexamination was conducted, with the pleaded case. However, in my opinion the answer to this difficulty lies in a \nsomewhat cumbersome and unwieldy pleading, rather than any change of case by the applicants. I turn to explain \nwhy.  The pleadings are structured in the following way. A series of \u201cacts\u201d for the purposes of s 9 are pleaded, \ndivided into three categories as I have said, one of which (the systemic failures) was abandoned. That left the \nseries of acts called the \u201cQPS Failures\u201d and the \u201cFurther Failures\u201d. In the latter series, one finds a sequence of \npleaded paragraphs dealing with the formulation of an \u201caction plan\u201d about the use of SERT (from [279] onwards). \nThis included allegations (at [281]) about the nature and presentation of SERT. The applicants then make a series \nof allegations about what SERT did on Palm Island (at [287]). The allegations of conduct which the applicants later \ncharacterise as unreasonable and disproportionate is set out at [288] and [290]. Relevantly, then at [300]-[306] \nthere are allegations about the unlawfulness of the arrests, and the entries and searches of houses. This conduct \n(the unlawful arrests and the unlawful entries) is then later alleged to be \u201cacts\u201d for the purpose of s 9 (at [309]).  Part \nof the difficulty arises because of the pleadings\u2019 focus on the description of \u201cunlawful\u201d arrests and \u201cunlawful\u201d entries. \nAs I note elsewhere, this is an unhelpful focus. But there is still no doubt that the conduct being impugned is what \nthe SERT teams were used to do, in effecting the arrests and conducting the entries and searches, even if the \nshorthand phrase \u201cthe unlawful arrests\u201d and the \u201cthe unlawful entries and searches\u201d is unhelpful. It is then alleged \n(at [312]), amongst other allegations, that the respondents \u201cdid not perform their duties in the best interests of the \ncommunity of Queensland, without fear or favour, and according to the same standard as those QPS services were \nsupplied to other residents of Queensland who did not reside in a predominantly Aboriginal community, whether or \nnot that community was geographically located in a remote location\u201d and \u201cacted so as to create the appearance of \nan excessive and unwarranted response to the events on Palm Island of 26 November 2004, and thereby brought \nthe QPS into disrepute\u201d.  These pleadings are not without difficulty, but in my opinion when considered with the \n\n\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the applicants from well before the trial, it is clear that a cornerstone of the \napplicants\u2019 case is that the employment of SERT officers (with all that goes with a SERT operation, as pleaded) to \neffect the arrests, and to enter and search houses for suspects, was unreasonable and disproportionate and was \nonly undertaken because Palm Island was an Aboriginal community. Neither the pleadings nor the written \nsubmissions focus on the decision to deploy SERT. Indeed, there were significant gaps in the evidence about which \nQPS officer or officers made that decision.  I do not consider that the respondents have suffered any unfairness \nbecause of the way the case was conducted by the applicants and drawn together in final submissions. It was clear \nfrom the outset that the manner and conduct of the arrests, entries and searches was a major feature of the \napplicants\u2019 case. Indeed it was the reason for the creation of the subgroup. The definition of the subgroup in the \nfurther amended originating application is:The Applicants also represent a sub-group of group members, being \npersons who either:  were apprehended or arrested by, or in the presence of SERT or PSRT officers in connection \nwith the events on Palm Island on 26 November 2004;b. were present at the arrests referred to in the preceding \nsub-paragraph;  otherwise witnessed or were present during the Raids (as defined in the 3FASC); and/or  had their \nhomes entered into, or their property otherwise interfered with, by officers of the QPS during the Raids without their \nconsent.  The evidence in chief and cross-examination also revealed a focus on the manner of the arrests, entries \nand searches. The respondents clearly understood this since they called three SERT officers as witnesses, and \naddressed in their evidence through DI Webber the connection between the deployment of SERT and the \nemergency declaration. I consider the respondents were on notice about how the use of SERT would be challenged \nas a contravention of s 9. It was always couched as a disproportionate and unreasonable use of force. The \napplicants\u2019 opening submissions, filed and served before trial, stated (at [20]-[24]):Part J also describes the police \nresponse to the \u201cRiot\u201d, whereby an emergency situation was declared, and the island was physically cut off from \nthe rest of Australia and placed under a regime of quasi-martial law, including \u201criot squad\u201d (PSRT) and \u201ccounter-\nterrorism\u201d (SERT) police officers marching through the streets in full uniform, and going house to house arresting \npeople in front of their children\u2014a spectacle that would be quite unimaginable in, for example, a residential suburb \nof Brisbane. Yet this was all done without the Palm Island community or even the local council being advised that \nan emergency situation had been declared, what that entailed, and for how long it was expected to remain in place. \n\n As Part K of the 3FASC alleges, the emergency situation allowed the police to bypass all of the usual checks and \nbalances on police behaviour. For example, when entering a person\u2019s home to arrest them as part of a carefully \nplanned and executed police operation, such as the operation on Palm Island on 27 November 2004, the ordinary \nprotocol would be for the police to first obtain a warrant to enter the property and a warrant for the person\u2019s arrest. \nAs Deane J further stated in Donaldson, 126: \u201cIt is plainly of critical importance to the existence and protection of \npersonal liberty under the law that the circumstances in which a police officer may, without judicial warrant, arrest \nor detain an individual should be strictly confined, plainly stated and readily ascertainable.\u201d On Palm Island on 27 \nNovember 2004, however, the police used the pretence of the \u201cemergency situation\u201d to excuse themselves from \nobtaining warrants. This meant that there was no evidence compiled and presented to a judge to ensure the validity \nof the entry and arrest, and the entire exercise thereby becomes less transparent and more questionable, \nregardless of some of the arrests resulting in convictions (and others not). \n\n Other actions of the QPS during and immediately after the emergency situation also contributed to the appearance \nof quasi-martial law, such as the commandeering of the Catholic school\u2019s bus, and the fact that all transport to and \nfrom the island was cut off unless it had the blessing of the police. \n\n The Respondents have pleaded that the visible police presence was created in order to \u201creassure residents that \nthe police were present on the island\u201d and \u201cto protect the community from unlawful disruption of peace and good \norder\u201d (Defence:[206(h)], see also [225(c)]). The suggestion of residents of Palm Island being at once intimidated \nand \u201cprotected\u201d by the authorities invokes the island\u2019s sorry history. Also familiar is the Respondents\u2019 attempts to \ndemonise the Palm Island community, including a focus on the local residents\u2019 supposed possession of \u201csticks and \nspears\u201d or \u201cbladed weapons\u201d and other implements and the use of the SERT team to raid the Sub-Group\u2019s houses, \nin circumstances where SERT officers are trained to presume that people present a threat until proven otherwise. \n\n\n\n The Applicants define the above acts and omissions as cumulatively forming the \u201cFurther Failures\u201d. As in the claim \nconcerning the QPS Failures, the Applicants\u2019 claim is not necessarily contingent on the conduct of the police being \nshown to have been unlawful in an administrative law sense, but rather that, because of the nature of the \ncommunity on Palm Island, the ordinary rules were simply not followed and the community was not policed as it \notherwise would have been. On this basis, the Applicants allege a breach of RDA s 9(1).\n\n(Italics in original.)    Finally, one of the common questions in relation to the whole group has always been:whether \nmembers of the Queensland Police Service responded unreasonably and/or unlawfully to the riots on Palm Island \nin November 2004;  This can only be understood as a reference to the manner in which SERT was used to effect \nthe arrests and conduct the entries and searches.  Accordingly, I do not accept the respondents\u2019 second \nsubmission regarding the way in which they contend the applicants have changed their case.\n\nProof    Two features of this proceeding were, first, the patchiness of the evidence relied upon by both the \napplicants and the respondents and, second, the patchiness of references in submissions to the evidence which \nwas relied upon. There has been a great deal of material accumulated about the events of November 2004 and it is \nvariously located in court records (including criminal prosecutions and appeals, and High Court proceedings), \ncoronial records (and appeals from coronial inquiries), internal police inquiries and inquiries of the Queensland \nCrime and Misconduct Commission (CMC). Some of the witnesses before me were in the unenviable position of \nhaving given evidence about these events on several prior occasions. It often appeared that the legal \nrepresentatives, and indeed the witnesses, knew a great deal more about the context and extent of aspects of the \nevidence than the Court was privy to. The forensic choices made by the parties and their legal representatives \nabout the nature and extent of the evidence adduced in this proceeding does have consequences for various \nissues to be determined. Where appropriate, I set out those consequences in the section of these reasons where I \ndeal with the issues affected. For example, findings I have made about individual officers can only be based on the \nevidence before the Court. If there were other, or more detailed, explanations for their conduct and attitudes, \nevidence of those explanations was not adduced.  Further, the patchiness with which the parties respectively \nreferred to the evidence which was tendered also means the court was left either without much guidance about the \nspecific use to which certain evidence should be put or, as to some of the evidence, without guidance about the \ncontent of the evidence. The video evidence is a good example in the latter category. No comprehensive attempt \nwas made to provide the court with information enabling it to identify all persons speaking in each video, to take but \none issue. Mr Wotton was asked in evidence in chief to identify some people in some videos, but it was far from \ncomprehensive. No agreed facts were tendered on these matters. Many people who played central roles in the \nevents which are the subject of the applicants\u2019 allegations were not called to give evidence. With one notable \nexception (Ms Erykah Kyle), no explanation was given for these omissions. Again, those forensic choices may have \nconsequences for the parties in the Court\u2019s fact finding.  Both parties accepted the relevance of the terms of s 140 \nof the Evidence Act which provides:Civil proceedings: standard of proof \n\n (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been \nproved on the balance of probabilities. \n\n (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to \ntake into account:(a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; \n\n (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and \n\n (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.  The Full Court in Ashby v Slipper [2014] FCAFC 15; 219 FCR 322 at [71] \nnoted that s 140(2) reflects the common law as stated in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336. The \nparties both accepted, however, that neither the matters in s 140(2) nor the common law approach in Briginshaw \ncreate any third standard of proof between the civil and the criminal, and the standard remains proof on the balance \nof probabilities: see Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66; 110 ALR 449 at 449-50 \n\n\n\n(Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ); Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69; 167 FCR 537 \nat[110] (French and Jacobson JJ) (Qantas Airways v Gama).  I accept that the applicants\u2019 allegations against the \nrespondents can be described as \u201cserious\u201d. To allege that individuals performing public functions and exercising \npublic powers did so on the basis of race is to make an allegation that reflects poorly upon those individuals. To \nallege that police officers, who have sworn to uphold the law, have contravened the law, is a matter of significance. \nI accept that these features of the applicants\u2019 case require the Court to be mindful of the three factors set out in s \n140(2) of the Evidence Act.  That said, the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the circumstances in this case is not one-sided. A \nyoung man died in police custody, having entered that custody apparently active and well just under an hour \nearlier. A community lost that young man, and a family lost a loved one. A significant number of people lost their \nliberty in the aftermath of protests over his death when those protests erupted out of control. Some people lost their \nliberty for a long period of time and were separated from their communities and their loved ones. Some of the \nfamilies involved were torn apart by these events. Young children, men and women, including a pregnant woman, \nwere terrified by armed masked men charging into their houses. A community was placed under police control in a \nway which resembled a war zone, with SERT and specialised riot officers, as well as other police officers and dogs, \noverwhelming the island with helicopters buzzing overhead. All these matters are also serious.  The respondents \ncontended that the applicants \u201cmust establish a reasonable and definite inference that the acts complained of were \nbased on race\u201d. The respondents\u2019 adjectives correctly recognise what is implicit in the drawing of inferences by a \ncourt. An inference drawn to make a finding of fact must be one that is reasonably available on the evidence and \ncapable of being expressed with clarity: Jones v Dunkel[1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298 at 305 (Dixon CJ), 306 (Kitto \nJ); Fuller-Lyons v New South Wales [2015] HCA 31; 89 ALJR 824 at [46] (French CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and \nNettle JJ); Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing & Allied Services Union of \nAustralia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132; 162 FCR 466 at [70]- [71] \n(Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ). An inference will not be reasonably available if it rests upon \u201cmere conjecture\u201d: \nR v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35;90 ALJR 1013 at [47] (the Court), quoting Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; 13 \nCLR 619 at 661.  Most findings of unlawful discrimination, including those arising from a provision such as s 9 with \nits formula \u201cbased on race\u201d, will be based on inferences drawn from the evidence. Seldom is it the case that there is \neither an admission of the racial basis for conduct, or direct evidence of that basis. Some of the examples that could \nbe given \u2013 a racially-based sign outside a cinema \u2013 are easy, but not especially realistic examples of direct \nevidence. In most cases dealing with a course of human conduct, the picture will be more complex, and the drawing \nof inferences will be required. All the more so when there are, as here, multiple actors. Where I have drawn \ninferences in reaching my conclusions in this proceeding, I am satisfied they are reasonably available on the \nevidence and I have sought to express clearly the inference I have drawn.  It is appropriate here to say something \nabout the parties\u2019 respective reliance on findings made by other bodies, and individuals, about the events of \nNovember 2004 on Palm Island. I have set out those other reports and inquiries at [397] below. During the course \nof the trial when the use of these other findings arose, senior counsel for each of the parties accepted the findings \nor conclusions in the respective reports could not be adopted by the Court as findings in this proceeding. \nNevertheless, in final submissions the course disclaimed during the trial was precisely what the applicants and the \nrespondents urged upon the Court. Broadly speaking, the respondents urged the Court to accept (and adopt, \nimplicitly or expressly) the correctness of the findings and approach of DC Rynders in the \u2018Report in Response to \nthe \u201cCMC Review of the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island Review\u201d\u2019. Conversely, the applicants urged the \nCourt to do the same with the findings of Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine and the CMC report. Obviously each side \nsought to impress the Court with prior conclusions which favoured that side\u2019s general thesis in this proceeding.  As I \nmade clear throughout the trial, that is not an approach which is appropriate to adopt. It may be that the fact of the \nconclusions of each, or some, of those previous reports has some probative significance for the issues to be \ndetermined in this proceeding. If that is the case, the fact of the conclusions reached may be taken into account. At \nbest, they have tangential relevance in this respect. Otherwise, each of those individuals or bodies reached their \nown conclusions consistently with the statutory task conferred upon them, and on the basis of the evidence before \nthem. The evidence before this Court was forensically selected by the parties, to advance their respective \ncontentions in relation to contraventions of the RDA. Although many of the witnesses before me had given \nevidence, or provided information, to some of these other inquiries, I take into account only their evidence given in \nthis proceeding, including any prior statements tendered, and including where they were examined or cross-\nexamined on evidence given elsewhere. Otherwise I have not taken into account reports of their evidence given \nelsewhere, and unless I say so expressly I neither adopt nor reject the findings and conclusions of those other \n\n\n\ninquiries. This proceeding occurs as an exercise of judicial power under a different statute and in a different context.  \nReliance on evidence given in other contexts by witnesses called in this proceeding raises a particularly difficult \nissue. Despite the Court having asked on several occasions for submissions on this issue, neither party made any \nmeaningful submissions. I give one example to illustrate the dilemma.  There is an allegation by the applicants that \nthe investigating officers did not interview PLO Bengaroo in a sufficiently thorough way, and also that they treated \nhim, and what he had to say, less seriously because he was an Aboriginal person. This is an allegation directed \nespecially at DI Webber. DI Webber had given substantial evidence on this issue to the Palm Island Review \nconducted by Acting Superintendent Mike McKay and Inspector Robert Gee. In that review there was an almost \nidentical allegation made, arising in that context out of criticisms of the investigators in comments by Acting State \nCoroner Clements. DI Webber gave substantial evidence on this topic: see the \u2018Palm Island Review\u2019 at 355-64. \nDuring this proceeding, he was examined extremely briefly on the matter (and gave some inconsistent answers), \nthen was cross-examined on the events themselves briefly, with most of the cross-examination involving putting to \nhim what was found by the Palm Island Review and by Acting State Coroner Clements. It was difficult to see the \nrelevance of that line of cross-examination, for the purposes of this proceeding. The absence, by forensic choice of \nboth parties, of direct explanation from DI Webber for his treatment of PLO Bengaroo leaves the Court to rely on \nother evidence in this proceeding to resolve this allegation.\n\nThe role of SS Hurley and my findings about his conduct    SS Hurley was eventually charged with manslaughter \nover Mulrunji\u2019s death and was acquitted. His acquittal by a jury of his peers must be respected. SS Hurley\u2019s conduct \nin relation to Mulrunji was put in issue many times during the trial of this proceeding and therefore there are many \nplaces in these reasons where his conduct is examined. Indeed, some of the applicants\u2019 central allegations relate to \nthe failure to treat SS Hurley as a suspect in Mulrunji\u2019s death.  To hear and determine those allegations is not to go \nbehind the acquittal. Rather, it is to assess the conduct of QPS officers in the conduct of the investigation, without \nthe undue benefit of hindsight. That is to be done, for example, by examining what information was available to \nthose officers at the time, its objective qualities, and how those officers did or did not use that information. To find, \nas I ultimately do, that SS Hurley should have been treated as a suspect if this was an investigation being \nconducted impartially and independently, and without unlawful race discrimination, is not to suggest he should have \nbeen charged with Mulrunji\u2019s murder, or with his manslaughter, or with any other criminal offence at any earlier \npoint in time. It is certainly not to suggest SS Hurley committed any offence in relation to Mulrunji\u2019s death. Rather, it \nis to assess, as best as can be done, the conduct of the investigating officers as circumstances stood in mid-\nNovember 2004.  Further, to recognise that SS Hurley\u2019s acquittal on the charge of manslaughter over Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath must be respected is not to immunise SS Hurley from appropriate criticism in relation to his conduct on Palm \nIsland during these events. He was the officer in charge of Palm Island Police Station. Of all the people who \nshould have realised it was inappropriate in the extreme for him to remain on the island for any period of time after \nMulrunji\u2019s death, let alone on active duty, it was SS Hurley. Of all the people who should have realised it was \ninappropriate in the extreme to fraternise with other officers who had been sent to the island to investigate \nMulrunji\u2019s death, it was SS Hurley. I am comfortably satisfied SS Hurley would not have behaved as he did, ignoring \nthe obvious community frustration and sense of injustice that existed, if these events had occurred in a small town \nin rural Queensland with a predominantly non-Aboriginal population. He too had a sense of impunity because he \nwas working in a remote Aboriginal community. His acquittal of the charge of manslaughter does not, in my opinion, \nstand in the way of this Court making such findings on the evidence before it for the purposes of reaching \nconclusions about contraventions of s 9 of the RDA.\nMatters not contested  \nThe second amended agreed statement of facts  The parties prepared, over the course of the trial, a number of \nversions of a substantial set of agreed facts. As the document developed, it became more than a document which \nrecorded the parties\u2019 agreement as to facts. It encompassed agreement as to provisions of state legislation, the \nterms of the OPM, the history and findings of the RCIADIC, and the contents of some other key documents upon \nwhich the applicants sought to rely. The parties very helpfully produced an agreed list of all the persons involved in \nthe events covered by this proceeding, and their role. A list of the houses entered and searched, with details of the \nperson or persons to whom each house belonged and who was or was not arrested at each house, was also \nagreed and was most helpful.  The parties each reserved their right to submit that some of the facts, legislative or \nregulatory provisions, or findings of various bodies, were not relevant to the issues arising in the proceeding. \nHowever, it was of great assistance to the Court that the parties could agree the provenance and effect of a large \n\n\n\nnumber of applicable provisions and policies.  I raised with the parties during the course of the evidence whether all \nof the matters in the agreed statement of facts could properly be admitted pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act. \nThe parties agreed that some parts were better treated either as admissions or joint submissions on questions of \nlaw. Accordingly, paragraphs of the statement as specified by senior counsel for the respondents on the last day of \nevidence in the proceeding were not admitted pursuant to s 191 but treated in that way. A final, second amended \nagreed statement of facts reflecting those changes was filed by the parties prior to final submissions.\nVicarious liability: s 18A of the RDA  In their defence to the applicants\u2019 third further amended statement of claim, the \nrespondents admit that all relevant conduct of QPS members as alleged in the applicants\u2019 pleading occurred in the \ncourse of the employment of those QPS members, and that those acts were performed by QPS members as \nemployees or agents of the State of Queensland. They also admit that the State of Queensland is liable pursuant to \ns 18A of the RDA for the actions of QPS members should it be found that those actions constituted unlawful \ndiscrimination.\n\nThe report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody  At various points in their pleadings the \napplicants rely on the RCIADIC report. Generally they do so to plead that QPS officers who interacted with \nAboriginal communities could have been expected to have knowledge of the issues raised in the report, and that \nofficers who could be expected to have such knowledge (such as those under scrutiny in this proceeding) should \nhave applied it in the discharge of their duties. In contrast, the respondents submitted there was, when one reduced \nthe submissions beyond the general, little work for the RCIADIC report to do in the context of this Court\u2019s fact \nfinding about alleged contraventions of s 9 of the RDA.  In my opinion, the respondents are broadly correct. \nHowever, the RCIADIC report is an important part of the background and context to this case. People on Palm \nIsland spoke about it frequently during the community meetings, as did witnesses before this Court. It, and deaths \nof Aboriginal people in custody, is part of their lived history, a point poignantly made by Ms Erykah Kyle during the \npublic meetings in November 2004 and by Ms Andrea Sailor during her evidence in this proceeding.  The RCIADIC \nwas established by the Australian government in October 1987 in response to public concern that deaths in custody \nof Aboriginal people were too common and were often poorly and evasively explained. Public agitation for the Royal \nCommission was led by members of the Aboriginal community.  The Royal Commission comprised five \nindependent Commissioners. Its terms of reference required it to examine all deaths in custody in each state and \nterritory between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989, together with the subsequent actions that had been taken in \nresponse to each death, including the conduct of coronial, police and other inquiries. The Royal Commission was \nalso authorised to take into account the social, cultural and legal factors which may have had a bearing on the \ndeaths.  The Royal Commission investigated the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who fell \nwithin its terms of reference. In its report, the Commission summarised its methodology for investigating the deaths \n(at [1.2.1]):All contemporary documents were subpoenaed and studied. Relevant people were interviewed wherever \npossible and in the great majority of instances this, was possible. In many cases post-mortem reports were \nreconsidered by eminent pathologists. Not only the cause of death, but all aspects of custodial care and the orders \nbinding on custodians were critically examined. Hearings were held in public; families of the deceased were \nrepresented by legal counsel. All documents were made available to counsel. Reports on the ninety-nine deaths \nhave been delivered to government. At the time of writing almost all have been tabled in parliament and thus made \npublic.  The Royal Commission\u2019s report was tabled in April 1991. It comprised five volumes of findings and \nrecommendations. Individual reports were also published for each state and territory, including Queensland. The \nCommission found that, while Aboriginal people in custody did not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people \nin custody, the rate at which Aboriginal people came into custody was overwhelmingly higher than the rate of the \ngeneral community. In relation to the causes of the 99 deaths investigated, the Commission found that none of the \ndeaths were unlawful or deliberate killings of Aboriginal prisoners by police. Nonetheless, the Commission found \nmany systemic defects in relation to the standard of care provided to the deceased persons by custodial authorities, \nand many failures to exercise proper care. In some of the cases under investigation, the defects and failures were \ncausally related to the deaths, in some cases they were not, and in others it was open to debate.  The Commission \nmade 339 recommendations in total. The recommendations focused on improving the standard of care provided to \npeople in custody by custodial authorities, improving police and coronial investigations into deaths in custody, \nensuring that both arrest and imprisonment are used as a last resort, promoting self-determination, improving \nrelations between Indigenous people and the police, providing adequate legal and social services for Indigenous \nyouth, reducing alcohol and substance abuse, and promoting reconciliation.  Every state and territory, as well as the \n\n\n\nCommonwealth, had responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the report and reporting on their \nprogress. I was not referred by the parties to any progress reports by the Queensland government about its \nimplementation of the Royal Commission\u2019s recommendations. Nevertheless, I have had regard to the 1996/97 \nprogress report of the Queensland government, pursuant to s 144(1)(b) of the Evidence Act; see also Thomas v \nMowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 at [619] (Heydon J). I have done this because the report explains how some \nimplementation occurred through instructions in the OPM, on which the applicants relied. I do not understand the \nsubject matter of the Queensland government\u2019s progress report, or its relationship to the OPM, to be controversial \nin this proceeding, nor to touch on any disputed facts. It is part of the background necessary to understand how the \nprovisions of the OPM came to be what they are. In the progress report, the Queensland government stated it had \nimplemented 163 of the 339 recommendations and partly implemented a further 30. Implementations discussed in \nthe 1996/97 progress report which are relevant to the work of the QPS include:(1) the introduction in the OPM of a \nchapter devoted to custody (chapter 16), which contains orders, policies and procedures concerning conditions in \ncustody and the procedures to follow where there is a death in custody. This addresses a large number of the \nrecommendations of the RCIADIC report; \n\n (2) the insertion into chapter 8 of the OPM of provisions which implement recommendation 29 of the RCIADIC \nreport, concerning the powers of the coroner in charge of an investigation of a death in custody over the officer in \ncharge of the investigation; \n\n (3) the introduction into chapters 2, 8 and 16 of the OPM of provisions which give effect to recommendations 32, 35 \nand 36 of the RCIADIC report, regarding the conduct of police investigations into deaths in custody; \n\n (4) the insertion into chapter 3 of the OPM of provisions which gave effect to recommendation 86 of the RCIADIC \nreport. That recommendation has some particular relevance to the circumstances of Mulrunji\u2019s arrest. The \nrecommendation was that the use of offensive language in circumstances of interventions initiated by police should \nnot generally be grounds for arrest or charge and that police services should examine and monitor the use of \noffensive language charges; and\n\n (5) the introduction into chapters 5 and 16 of the OPM of policies and procedures which give effect to \nrecommendation 62 of the report in supporting diversion of children from the criminal justice system.  A number of \nother reforms were foreshadowed in the report, relating to the upgrading of watchhouses, better cross-cultural \ntraining, and more Police Liaison Officers.  Prior to the Queensland government\u2019s implementation report, but after \nthe RCIADIC report, the QPS produced a review of its policing in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \ncommunities. The review, produced in 1994, was said to be a direct response to the recommendations 88 and 232 \nof the RCIADIC report. A copy of this review is in evidence. Inspector Gregory Strohfeld, who in November 2004 \nwas the officer to whom SS Hurley was directly responsible, was a member of the Steering Committee for the \nreview. The review commenced with an express acknowledgment of the reasons for the ongoing mistrust of the \npolice by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It stated (at [2.1]-[2.3]):Policing strategies employed \nin Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Queensland have been directly and indirectly determined by \nchanging State Government policies for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. These policies have been embodied \nin what is perceived by some as largely oppressive legislation which infringed upon fundamental civil and political \nrights. The police, as enforcers of the law of the day, have been required to undertake a highly visual role in the \nexecution of this legislation throughout Queensland\u2019s history.\n\n The nature of this role has been expressed in many forms, most of which were not conducive to the development \nof trust and respect for the Police Service among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Over the last \nhundred years, the indigenous people of Queensland have been subjected to a spectrum of ideological stances \nranging from dispersal, protectionism, assimilation and integration to self management and self determination. \n\n\n\nPursuant to legislation or expressed or implied Government sanction, members of the Police Service have been \nrequired to:\n\n (i) Effect the policy of \u201cdispersal\u201d of local Aborigines from their traditional homelands in the interests of economic \ndevelopment and, in particular, to cater for the interests of European colonial pastoralists and facilitate the \nestablishment of trade routes \u2013 a policy which often involved the mass slaughter of clan and tribal groups by police;\n\n (ii) Forcibly \u201cre-locate\u201d Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to reserve areas \u2013 which often involved the \nseparation of family members and the aggregation of traditional enemies in close confines;\n\n (iii) Locate and punish Aborigines and Islanders who had \u201cescaped\u201d from reserve areas;\n\n (iv) Forcibly remove half caste Aboriginal children from their parents;\n\n (v) Forcibly remove Aborigines from their homes to cater for mining interests; and\n\n (vi) Use British law enforcement procedures and methods to enforce contemporary State laws which were \nincompatible with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and did not take into account traditional indigenous \nlaws and rules of conduct.\n\n Although State Police are not actively involved in these activities today, there are still a significant number of \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been directly affected or had relatives or recent ancestors \naffected by these activities. Subsequently, it is not surprising that a significant number of Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander people today remain fearful and mistrusting of police. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see how these \nGovernment policies of the past have directly or indirectly contributed to any of the problems besetting Aboriginal \nand Torres Strait Islander communities today.  At [5.141], the review noted that watchhouse facilities on Palm \nIsland did not comply with national standards for custodial facilities.  The applicants attached large excerpts from \nthe RCIADIC report\u2019s findings and recommendations to the third further amended statement of claim. Their \npleadings placed particular emphasis on the following recommendations of the RCIADIC:Recommendation 19: \n\n That immediate notification of death of an Aboriginal person be given to the family of the deceased and, if others \nwere nominated by the deceased as persons to be contacted in the event of emergency, to such persons so \nnominated. Notification should be the responsibility of the custodial institution in which the death occurred; \nnotification, wherever possible, should be made in person, preferably by an Aboriginal person known to those being \nso notified. At all times notification should be given in a sensitive manner respecting the culture and interests of the \npersons being notified and the entitlement of such persons to full and frank reporting of such circumstances of the \ndeath as are known.\n\n Recommendation 20: \n\n That the appropriate Aboriginal Legal Service be notified immediately of any Aboriginal death in custody.\n\n ...\n\n Recommendation 33: \n\n That all officers involved in the investigation of a death in police custody be selected from an Internal Affairs Unit \nor from a police command area other than that in which the death occurred and in every respect should be as \nindependent as possible from police officers concerned with matters under investigation. Police officers who were \n\n\n\non duty during the time of last detention of a person who died in custody should take no part in the investigation into \nthat death save as witnesses or, where necessary, for the purpose of preserving the scene of death. \n\n Recommendation 35(a):  Investigations should be approached on the basis that the death may be a homicide. \nSuicide should never be presumed; ......\n\n Recommendation 60:\n\n That Police Services take all possible steps to eliminate:  Violent or rough treatment or verbal abuse of Aboriginal \npersons including women and young people, by police officers; and  The use of racist or offensive language, or the \nuse of racist or derogatory comments in log books and other documents, by police officers.When such conduct is \nfound to have occurred, it should be treated as a serious breach of discipline.\n\n Recommendation 61:\n\n That all Police Services review their use of para-military forces such as the New South Wales SWOS and TRG \nunits to ensure that there is no avoidable use of such units in circumstances affecting Aboriginal communities.\n\n ...\n\n Recommendation 87(a):\n\n That:  All Police Services should adopt and apply the principle of arrest being the sanction of last resort in dealing \nwith offenders; ...  The applicants also referred to recommendations 210, 214, 215, 225 and 228, all of which relate \nto an increased emphasis on culturally appropriate and sensitive policing practices in Aboriginal communities, \ndeveloped in consultation with members of the Aboriginal community.  Despite these references in the third further \namended statement of claim, the applicants\u2019 final submissions make comparatively few substantive submissions by \nreference to the RCIADIC and its recommendations. The principal submission seems to be that QPS officers could, \nand should, have been aware in November 2004 that Palm Island community members knew of the RCIADIC and \nits recommendations and this was a feature of their relationship with police. It seems also to be the applicants\u2019 \nsubmission that the way the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death was conducted paid insufficient regard to the \nRCIADIC\u2019s recommendations and observations. For example, the applicants\u2019 written submissions relied on the \nfollowing observations at [1.2.4] and [3.1.2] of the RCIADIC report:Deaths in custody are particularly distressing for \nfamilies and friends, and engender suspicion and doubt in their minds and also in the minds of members of the \npublic. The deceased person has been in the custody and care of the State, not accessible in the general sense, \nhis or her life controlled and ordered by functionaries of the State, out of sight and of normal contact. Deaths in such \ncircumstances breeds anguish and suspicion equally. Time may heal some of the anguish, but the suspicion can be \nallayed only by the most open and thorough going laying of the facts on the table.\n\n ...\n\n As has been said earlier, there was a widely held suspicion amongst Aboriginal people, and others, that at the very \nleast a number of the deaths were caused by foul play in the sense of the deliberate infliction of harm by \ncustodians. This has turned out not to be the case. But it needs to be understood that this perception was not at all \nunreasonable for at least three quite separate reasons: firstly, custody by its nature being away from the public \ngaze and out of the range of family and friends, the circumstances are such as to easily lead to suspicion and \ndoubt; secondly, the deep distrust grounded in history that Aboriginal people have for police and prison systems; \nand thirdly, the post-death investigations and the treatment of families were in not a few cases such as to raise \nsuspicion rather than allay it.  I have found that the QPS officers who gave evidence in this proceeding had little \n\n\n\nknowledge of, or insight into, the history of Palm Island, nor did they have more than superficial knowledge of the \nRCIADIC\u2019s recommendations. The QPS officers who gave evidence disclosed no awareness of the matters I have \nset out from the 1994 QPS review. Had there been such awareness, the obvious manifestation of it would have \nbeen more meaningful interaction and consultation with the Palm Island community in the days and weeks after \nMulrunji\u2019s death, through active participation at public meetings and greater flows of information between police, \nthe Council and the general community. Needless to say, any real awareness of the context made so plain in the \nQueensland government\u2019s 1994 review would have led to quite different behaviour from QPS officers during the \nearly days of the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death. The lack of impartiality (in appearance and in fact) that I have \nfound existed could not have occurred if QPS officers had any real understanding of those issues and applied that \nunderstanding to the way they behaved.  These matters are relatively clear on the evidence before the Court. \nBeyond providing a contextual basis for findings of this kind, I do not need to give any closer consideration to the \nRCIADIC report or its recommendations.\n\nSUMMARY OF STATE LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS, INSTRUMENTS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES \nAPPLICABLE TO THE QUEENSLAND POLICE SERVICE  \n\nThe role of state legislation, instruments and policies in the applicants\u2019 case    Almost all of the applicants\u2019 case \ninvolves allegations of non-compliance by QPS officers with Queensland law. In some circumstances, it is alleged \nthat police conduct was unlawful by failure to comply with the general law, or statute law (or both); in other \ncircumstances, it is alleged that police conduct failed to comply with a policy or procedure which may or may not \nrender the police conduct unlawful. The effect of non-compliance with a policy or procedure was said to depend on \nthe status of the policy or procedure within the internal hierarchy established in the Operational Procedures Manual. \nNevertheless, the fact of non-compliance (even if it did not render the conduct unlawful) was said by the applicants \nto be significant for the purpose of establishing a contravention of s 9 of the RDA.  A state law cannot authorise \nconduct which contravenes s 9 of the RDA. Insofar as the state law had such an effect, it would be invalid by \nreason of the operation of s 109 of the Constitution: see Gerhardy v Brown[1985] HCA 11; 159 CLR 70 at 92-93 \n(Mason J), 121 (Brennan J). In the present case, no argument of this kind was made by the applicants about any of \nthe state laws they identified as imposing duties on QPS officers.  Conversely, in Sharma v Legal Aid Queensland \n[2001] FCA 1699; 112 IR 124 at [27] Kiefel J observed that neither lawfulness, nor unlawfulness, would of \nthemselves foreclose or establish a contravention of s 9:A substantial part of the applicant\u2019s case was taken up with \nquestions as to whether the panel had followed policy guidelines regarding appointments and whether what they \nsaid was required in the position could be found in the description given of it. If the applicant had fulfilled the criteria \nspecified and guidelines had not been followed, questions might arise as to the approach being taken by the panel. \nIt is necessary to bear in mind however that this is not a case involving the application of principles of employment \ncontract law, or procedural fairness. Breaches of this kind do not themselves answer the question whether race \noperated as a factor in the appointment process. By the same token compliance will not foreclose the possibility \nthat considerations of race were influential in some way. The inquiry is as to what was truly in the minds of the \npanel members. I turn then to consider the explanations they have put forward.  Subject to what I say at [150] \nbelow, as Kiefel J suggested, questions of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of conduct according to domestic law do \nnot engage with the question posed by s 9.  However, the applicants sought to use the alleged unlawfulness of \nvarious conduct by QPS officers to contend that the conduct involved a \u201cdistinction\u201d for the purposes of s 9. That is, \nthe \u201cdistinction\u201d is said to be non-compliance with the law, or non-compliance with obligations imposed under the \nlaw. That conduct involving such non-compliance is then alleged to be based on the race of the applicants, \nincluding the group members. Sometimes this is put as being based on the Palm Island community as an \nAboriginal community, that is: a community defined by its race.  In relation to some of the acts relied upon, the \nlawfulness (or, on the applicants\u2019 case, the unlawfulness) of QPS conduct is said to form part of the necessary \ncontent of the human right relied on. Thus, for example, the right in Art 9 of the ICCPR to be free from arbitrary or \nunlawful arrest is said by the applicants to be impaired where, in their submission, Mr Wotton was subjected to an \narrest which was unlawful under Queensland law. In these kinds of examples, the \u201cact\u201d for the purposes of s 9 is the \narrest; it is said to involve a \u201cdistinction based on race\u201d because the arrest was made unlawfully by reference to the \nrace of Mr Wotton; and that arrest is said to have impaired his human right under Art 9 to be free from arbitrary or \nunlawful arrest. It can be seen that, in examples of this kind from the applicants\u2019 pleaded case, the unlawfulness of \nthe arrest is said to be capable of fulfilling two functions within the terms of s 9 in that it constitutes both the \n\n\n\n\u201cdistinction\u201d and the \u201cimpairment\u201d of a right. Nevertheless, the applicants are correct to identify lawfulness (and \nunlawfulness) as central to the nullification or impairment of some of the human rights upon which they rely. In \nrelation to the arrests, entries and searches by SERT officers, lawfulness does have a role to play in determining a \ncontravention of s 9.  It is necessary, then, to give an outline of the Queensland law applicable to the conduct of the \nQPS officers during the series of events impugned by the applicants. With a few exceptions (such as the arrest of \nMr Wotton) there was no dispute between the parties about the applicable law.\n\nThe Police Service Administration Act 1990 (Qld) (PSA Act)    Section 2.3 of the PSA Act, as it was in November \n2004, set out the functions of the QPS. I have set out extracts already, but it should be reproduced in its \nentirety:Functions of service\n\n The functions of the police service are\u2014\n\n (a) the preservation of peace and good order\u2014(i) in all areas of the State; and\n\n (ii) in all areas outside the State where the laws of the State may lawfully be applied, when occasion demands;(b) \nthe protection of all communities in the State and all members thereof\u2014(i) from unlawful disruption of peace and \ngood order that results, or is likely to result, from\u2014(A) actions of criminal offenders;\n\n (B) actions or omissions of other persons;(ii) from commission of offences against the law generally;(c) the \nprevention of crime;\n\n (d) the detection of offenders and bringing of offenders to justice;\n\n (e) the upholding of the law generally;\n\n (f) the administration, in a responsible, fair and efficient manner and subject to due process of law and directions of \nthe commissioner, of\u2014(i) the provisions of the Criminal Code;\n\n (ii) the provisions of all other Acts or laws for the time being committed to the responsibility of the service;\n\n (iii) the powers, duties and discretions prescribed for officers by any Act;(g) the provision of the services, and the \nrendering of help reasonably sought, in an emergency or otherwise, as are\u2014(i) required of officers under any Act or \nlaw or the reasonable expectations of the community; or\n\n (ii) reasonably sought of officers by members of the community.\n\nThe Operational Procedures Manual (OPM)    Pursuant to subss 4.8(1) and (2) of the PSA Act, the Commissioner \nof Police is responsible for the efficient and proper administration, management and functioning of the QPS in \naccordance with law. In discharging these prescribed responsibilities under the PSA Act, the Commissioner is \nauthorised to give, and cause to be issued, such written and oral directions to QPS employees that the \nCommissioner considers necessary or convenient for the efficient and proper functioning of the QPS: see s 4.9(1). \nThe principal source of the Commissioner\u2019s directions is the QPS Operational Procedures Manual (OPM). The \nobjective of the OPM is said to be to provide guidance and instructions in all aspects of operational policing.  In \nNovember 2004, \u201cIssue 24 \u2013 July 2004\u201d of the OPM was in force. Issue 24 of the OPM set out three levels of \ndirections by the Commissioner to QPS members: orders, policies and procedures. These terms were defined at p \n6 of the document as follows:ORDER\n\n [A]n order requires compliance with the course of action specified. Orders are not to be departed from.\n\n ...\n\n\n\n POLICY \n\n A policy outlines the Service attitude regarding a specific subject and must be complied with under ordinary \ncircumstances. Policy may only be departed from if there are good and sufficient reason(s) for doing so. Members \nmay be required to justify their decision to depart from policy.\n\n ...\n\n PROCEDURE \n\n A procedure outlines generally how an objective is achieved or a task performed, consistent with policies and \norders. A procedure may outline actions which are generally undertaken by persons or organisations external to the \nService.  While the parties agree that orders must be complied with, they differed on the force and effect of policies \nand procedures, although in my opinion the difference was really one of emphasis rather than any legal or practical \neffect. The applicants emphasised (and pleaded) that, in November 2004, the QPS \u201cordinarily complied\u201d with the \npolicies and procedures of the OPM, and any departure would occur only in extraordinary circumstances. In \ncontrast, the respondents emphasised the non-binding nature of these two kinds of directions, and that each left \nroom for departure in appropriate circumstances.  Although, as I set out at [725]-[739] below, I consider the aspect \nof the applicants\u2019 approach to s 9 whereby they argue that individual contraventions of the OPM can constitute \ndistinctions for the purposes of s 9 to be misconceived, that does not render the terms of the OPM irrelevant. I \naccept the orders, policies and procedures provide a framework within which QPS officers are expected to operate. \nTherefore, the subject matter dealt with in the OPM, and the standard of compliance required, assists in putting the \nimpugned conduct of QPS officers into an appropriate context.  Working sequentially through the OPM, the \nfollowing provisions should be noted.  The parties agreed that s 1.17 of the OPM is relevant to these proceedings. \nThat section was headed \u201cFatalities or serious injuries resulting from incidents involving members (Police related \nincidents)\u201d and provided directions in the form of orders and policies to follow when a \u201cpolice related incident\u201d \noccurs. The parties agreed Mulrunji\u2019s death in custody fell within the definition of a \u201cpolice related incident\u201d in this \nprovision. Section 1.17 contained generally applicable directions, directions applicable to multiple members of the \nQPS, and directions for individual members holding specific positions.  Section 1.17 contained an order that \ninvestigations of police related incidents be conducted \u201cexpeditiously and impartially\u201d with the \u201cpsychological \nwelfare of individuals considered.\u201d  It also relevantly provided the following policies applicable to first response \nofficers, regional duty officers and regional crime coordinators under the heading \u201cIntegrity of investigation\u201d:First \nresponse officers, regional duty officers and regional crime coordinators should ensure that the integrity of the \nindependent versions of members directly involved and members who are witnesses to a police related incident is \npreserved as far as practicable.\n\n In this regard, members directly involved in the incident or who are witnesses to the incident should be interviewed \nseparately and as soon as practicable following the incident. It is highly desirable that interviews occur prior to any \ncritical incident stress debriefing, including any defusing. Members directly involved in the incident or who are \nwitnesses to the incident should not discuss the incident amongst themselves prior to being interviewed.  Section \n1.17 assigned specific responsibilities to first response officers, in the form of orders. When a police related \nincident occurred, the first response officer was to:(i) assume command and control at the incident scene;\n\n (ii) make an immediate assessment of the situation and inquire as to the circumstances surrounding the incident;\n\n (iii) immediately notify the shift supervisor and the relevant regional duty officer in the region where the incident has \noccurred, and the appropriate police communications centre;\n\n (iv) contain and preserve the scene;\n\n\n\n (v) take possession of or safeguard exhibits;\n\n (vi) detain offenders;\n\n (vii) wherever practicable, ensure that members involved in the incident do not leave the scene; and\n\n (viii) wherever practicable, ensure that members who are involved in the incident, or who are witnesses to the \nincident, do not undertake, or continue to perform duties associated with the investigative process, or other duties at \nthe scene.  Section 1.17 imposed orders on the regional duty officer who was notified or who became aware of \nsuch an incident. Relevantly, the regional duty officer was directed to:(i) attend the scene, make an immediate \nassessment of the situation and make brief inquiries with persons at the scene, including members directly involved \nin the incident or who may be witnesses to the incident, as to the circumstances surrounding the incident;\n\n (ii) assume command and control of the situation pending the arrival or involvement of the regional crime \ncoordinator; \n\n ...\n\n (iv) cause the following officers or units to be immediately notified:...\n\n (h) the Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations); ...(v) wherever practicable, ensure that \nmembers who are involved in the incident, or who are witnesses to the incident, do not undertake, or continue to \nperform duties associated with the investigative process, or other duties at the scene; and\n\n (vi) wherever practicable ensure that members involved in the incident or who are witnesses to the incident are \navailable for interview by the regional crime coordinator, officers from the Crime and Misconduct Commission or the \nInternal Investigation Branch, Ethical Standards Command, as the circumstances require.  The regional crime \ncoordinator was assigned specific responsibilities under s 1.17. There was an order that:All police related incidents \nare to be investigated by or under the direction of the regional crime coordinator unless otherwise directed by the \nInternal Investigation Branch, Ethical Standards Command or the Crime and Misconduct Commission.  A policy in s \n1.17 concerning the role of the regional crime coordinator provided:When investigating police related incidents, a \nregional crime coordinator should contact the investigation or appoint an independent senior investigator with \nsufficient criminal investigation background to carry out investigations. Considerations by regional crime \ncoordinators in making any such appointments should include the gravity of the incident, the rank of the officers or \nthe level of seniority of the members who are directly involved in the incident (as opposed to witnesses), and the \nestablishment at which those officers or members directly involved in the incident are stationed. \n\n In cases involving custody police related incidents, a regional crime coordinator should appoint an investigator \nfrom a police establishment other than from where the incident occurred, or where the officers or members directly \ninvolved in the incident are stationed.\n\n Where the Crime and Misconduct Commission or Internal Investigation Branch, Ethical Standards Command, \noverviews an investigation of a police related incident, the regional crime coordinator retains responsibility for that \ninvestigation.  Further, under the heading \u201cRegional crime coordinator\u201d, there were orders that relevantly provided \nthat the regional crime coordinator was to:(i) be directly responsible for the investigation of a police related incident, \nunless otherwise directed by the Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations), or unless \nresponsibility for the investigation is assumed by the Internal Investigation Branch, Ethical Standards Command or \nthe Crime and Misconduct Commission;\n\n ...\n\n\n\n (iv) ensure that the members directly involved in the incident or who are witnesses to the incident are interviewed \nas soon as practicable and it is highly desirable that interviews occur prior to any critical incident stress debriefing, \nincluding any defusing; and\n\n (v) in cases of deaths in custody as defined in s. 16.24.1 ... ensure that where necessary the provisions of ss. \n16.24 to 16.24.5 ... are complied with.  Section 2.5 of the OPM was headed \u201cInvestigation\u201d and s 2.5.1 relevantly set \nout the following matters in relation to investigations:POLICY\n\n The investigation of offences and the management of incidents requiring police action are dependent on timely, \naccurate information being passed to investigating officers. Officers collecting such information should investigate \nthe facts and circumstances as completely as possible in order to obtain relevant, usable information. Investigating \nofficers who consider the assignment of an operation name to an investigation is appropriate should contact the \nDistrict Intelligence Officer for that purpose.\n\n To ensure investigations are conducted in a professional manner, members should cooperate to allow the effective \nuse of resources and to achieve desirable outcomes which reflect the needs and expectations of the community.\n\n In all investigations, officers should strictly adhere to first response procedures. The incident scene should be \npreserved and contained until the arrival of any specialists. Even so, primary investigation techniques should be \nfollowed in order to ensure that potential witnesses are identified and that complete information is obtained.\n\n ...\n\n PROCEDURE\n\n ...\n\n It is critical that primary investigations be carried out as completely as possible. Wherever possible, primary \ninvestigations should be undertaken by the first response officer.\n\n Activities undertaken during primary investigations may include:\n\n (i) identification of witnesses;\n\n (ii) identification of potential witnesses;\n\n (iii) interview of available witnesses;\n\n (iv) taking of statements from witnesses (suitable for court production);\n\n (v) collection and appropriate marking, recording and handling of physical evidence;\n\n (vi) listing observations made at the scene;\n\n (vii) noting geographic factors;\n\n (viii) noting demographic factors if appropriate;\n\n (ix) noting vehicles at the scene;\n\n\n\n (x) complete descriptions of offenders or suspects;\n\n (xi) complete descriptions of offender's or suspect's vehicles;\n\n (xii) complete description of the scene;\n\n (xiii) identifying and notifying appropriate support groups;\n\n (xiv) notifying appropriate specialist groups;\n\n (xv) notifying the commissioned duty officer;\n\n (xvi) arranging for necessary inquiries to be conducted by other members; and\n\n (xvii) recording of all activities undertaken and their outcomes.\n\n Information obtained during the primary investigation will assist in the decision regarding the priority to be given to \nthe investigation. Primary investigators should make recommendations in criminal offence reports for the \ninformation of supervisors.  Section 2.5.3 provided:Investigation and the community\n\n POLICY\n\n Police investigations often include contact with members of the public who have been adversely effected by \ncriminal activity or other major personal trauma. The attitude of officers carrying out investigations is critical to how \nthe Service is perceived by the community. Officers should therefore demonstrate professional behaviour at all \ntimes. Officers should refer to s. 2.12: \u2018Victims of crime\u2019 of this chapter.  The OPM contained provisions relevant to \nthe deployment and operations of the SERT. Section 2.26, headed \u201cSpecial Emergency Response Team (SERT)\u201d, \nprovided:2.26.1 Role of Special Emergency Response Team (SERT)\n\n The Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) is a specialist support unit, established to provide the Service \nwith the ability to respond to terrorist incidents state-wide.\n\n The primary role of the SERT is to:\n\n (i) respond to terrorist incidents within the arrangements agreed to under the State Antiterrorist Plan;\n\n (ii) provid [sic] specialist police capability to resolve high risk situations and incidents which are potentially violent \nand exceed normal police capabilities;\n\n (iii) provide assistance to all police with low risk tasks which require specialist equipment, skills or tactics; and\n\n (iv) provide a rescue function in incidents which require specialised recovery techniques.\n\n The primary unit of SERT is based in Brisbane and is under the direct control of the Inspector, SERT. SERT \nofficers are also located at Cairns under the management of the Chief Superintendent, Operations Coordinator, Far \nNorthern Region.\n\n\n\n Activation and deployment of SERT, including SERT officers at Cairns, and operational control and coordination is \nretained by the Superintendent, Specialist Services Branch.\n\n Whenever SERT Officers at Cairns are activated and or deployed, the Chief Superintendent, Operations \nCoordinator, Far Northern Region is to be advised by the Superintendent, Specialist Services Branch.\n\n 2.26.2 Authorisation of call out of the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT)\n\n ORDER\n\n The authority of the Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations), is required for the deployment of \nthe Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) in all high risk situations.\n\n In the absence of the Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations), the authority for deployment of \nthe SERT may be given by the Assistant Commissioner, Operations Support Command.\n\n In the event that an immediate response is required by the SERT to a high risk situation, the Superintendent, \nSpecialist Services Branch, can:\n\n (i) activate the SERT to a suitable staging area in preparation for deployment to a high risk situation;\n\n (ii) authorise the assistance of a SERT response to rescue functions; and\n\n (iii) activate the SERT to perform low risk tasks.\n\n 2.26.3 Call out procedure\n\n Officers should note that response time depends on the availability of Service aircraft and/or commercial flights. If \nroad travel is used, normal travelling times will apply.\n\n PROCEDURE\n\n An officer who considers that the services of SERT may be required for non-urgent operations should advise the \nRegional Duty Officer or other Commissioned Officer.\n\n Upon receipt of such advice, the relevant commissioned officer should assess the situation. If they decide the \nassistance of SERT is required, they should ensure, in the order listed, that:\n\n (i) a Special Emergency Response Team Request for Assistance form (QP377) is completed;\n\n (ii) their Chief Superintendent, Operations Co-ordinator is advised of the intended request;\n\n (iii) the Superintendent, Specialist Services Branch (SSB), is advised of the request by phone (the Superintendent, \nSSB, can be contacted by phone 24 hours a day. The contact number for this officer is available from the Duty \nOfficer, Police Communications Centre, Brisbane);\n\n (iv) the QP377 is faxed to the Superintendent, SSB; and\n\n\n\n (v) the original of the QP377 is forwarded to the Superintendent, SSB, via the QPS internal mail system.  Section \n2.13.1 of the OPM contained the following policy about taking statements:Statements form a written version of the \noral testimony of a witness and therefore should be as comprehensive as possible.\n\n ... Statements should be obtained at the earliest practicable opportunity ... In appropriate situations statements \nshould be obtained and should be accepted from suspects/offenders.  In relation to contemporaneous notes, s \n2.13.8 of the OPM provided:Members who may be required to give evidence of conversations, events or \noccurrences should compile relevant notes at a time during the conversation, event or occurrence, or as soon as \npracticable thereafter while details are still fresh in their mind.  The applicants relied on the provisions of the OPM \ndealing with interviewees and witnesses with special needs. Section 6.3.2 imposed the following order:When an \nofficer wishes to interview a person, the officer is to first establish whether a special need exists ... the officer is to \nevaluate the ability of the person to be interviewed to look after or manage their own interests and is to establish \nwhether the person meets the following conditions. The person is to be:\n\n (i) capable of understanding the questions posed;\n\n (ii) capable of effectively communicating answers;\n\n (iii) capable of understanding what is happening to him/her;\n\n (iv) fully aware of the reasons why the questions are being asked;\n\n (v) fully aware of the consequences which may result from questioning; and\n\n (vi) in the opinion of the investigating officer, capable of understanding his or her rights at law.\n\n In making an evaluation, the officer is to take into account the following factors:\n\n (i) the seriousness of the condition giving rise to the special need ...;\n\n (ii) the reason for which the person is being questioned, whether as a witness or in relation to their complicity in an \noffence. Where the information to be obtained may later be used in a court, it will be necessary to show that any \nspecial need was overcome;\n\n (iii) the complexity of the information sought from the person; and\n\n (iv) the age, standard of education, knowledge of the English language, cultural background and work history of the \nperson.\n\n When questioning anyone with a special need officers must comply with ss. 249 and 250 of the Police Powers and \nResponsibilities Act.  In s 6.3.6, a policy was set out to the effect that persons of Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander descent are to be considered people with special needs because of certain cultural and sociological \nconditions.  The OPM also provided instructions on specialised areas of policing relevant to this proceeding. For \nexample, s 6.4 of the OPM concerned cross-cultural issues relevant to policing in culturally diverse communities. \nRelevantly, it provided the following policy:To achieve the goals of the Service, strategies emphasising joint \ncommunity and police activities have been adopted. \n\n Officers should always consider cultural needs which exist within the community.  Section 6.4.7 provided a specific \npolicy for officers in charge of stations:Officers in charge of stations or establishments should, in managing the \nprovision of services, take into account the specific cultural and ethnic demographic characteristics of their area of \n\n\n\nresponsibility and the needs thereby created.  The terms \u201ccultural needs\u201d and \u201ccultural and ethnic demographic \ncharacteristics\u201d are not defined, and what is meant by these phrases is opaque. The applicants\u2019 pleadings and \nsubmissions repeatedly press a contention that the QPS failed to appreciate or recognise the \u201ccultural needs\u201d of the \nPalm Island community, but they give no real content to the phrase. The respondents are correct to criticise this \naspect of the applicants\u2019 case.  Section 6.4.8 of the OPM was headed \u201cCross Cultural Liaison Officers\u201d, and \nprovided:Cross cultural liaison officers are available in all regions. The role of a cross cultural liaison officer is to \nestablish and maintain effective liaison between police, Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and ethnic communities to \nidentify the needs of communities and enable appropriate policies and strategies to be developed to ensure the \ndelivery of an equitable service within the district or region.\n\n The principal responsibilities of cross cultural liaison officers include:\n\n (i) managing and coordinating cultural support activities in line with Service policy;\n\n (ii) developing and maintaining effective communication with Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander and ethnic \ncommunity representatives, colleagues and representatives of government departments and external agencies;\n\n (iii) developing and presenting community based policing programs in line with service policy; and\n\n (iv) providing operational support particularly in the investigation of crime in ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander communities.  Section 8.4 of the OPM dealt with reportable deaths, including deaths in custody. By s 8.4.1, \nQPS officers were ordered to assist the coroner involved in investigating a death in custody:Officers are to assist \ncoroners in the performance of a function, or exercise of a power, under the Coroners Act and are to comply with \nevery reasonable and lawful request, or direction of a coroner.  The duty to assist the coroner also had a legislative \nbasis: see s 447A of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 (Qld) (PPR Act).  It was agreed between the \nparties that s 8.4.3 of the OPM, headed \u201cResponsibilities of investigating officers\u201d applied to the QPS investigation \nteam investigating Mulrunji\u2019s death and to Inspector Williams of the Ethical Standards Command. It relevantly \nprovided:PROCEDURE\n\n Where initial enquiries indicate that a death is one that falls within the ambit of Part 3of the Coroners Act, the \nService is obliged to investigate and report on the cause of the death. The actions required to do so will vary from \ncase to case, dependent on the circumstances of the death. In all cases however, certain actions must be taken \nand certain reports must be completed. The following points provide a list of those reports and actions, and the \nsections that follow discuss those requirements in greater detail.\n\n POLICY\n\n In the case of any death which falls within the circumstances outlined in Part 3 of the Coroners Act the investigating \nofficer is responsible for:\n\n ...\n\n (v) completing a \u2018Police Report of a Death to a Coroner\u2019 (Form 1) then:(a) forwarding or delivering the original and \na copy of the Form 1 to the coroner and obtaining from that person an order for autopsy;\n\n (b) delivering the order for autopsy and another copy of the Form 1 to the Government Pathologist who is to \nperform the autopsy;\n\n ...\n\n\n\n (d) forwarding an electronic copy of the Form 1 to their respective Officer in Charge so that it is checked and \nforwarded via Email to the State Coroner\u2019s Police Support Unit ...\n\n (e) submitting a signed copy of the Form 1 to the respective Officer in Charge to be forwarded to the local \nCoroner;(vi) completing, where applicable, a Supplementary Form 1 (QP528). The Supplementary Form 1 is used \nto provide additional information to a coroner or State Coroner.\n\n (vii) attending and witnessing the autopsy, where applicable, or arranging for the attendance of another officer in \nline with local arrangements;\n\n ...\n\n (ix) where an inquest is to be held, ensuring that the following forms have been completed as fully as possible and \ncopies are available for submission to the coroner in compliance with s. 8.4.20 \u2018Statutory forms\u2019 of this chapter:(a) \nForm 1; ......\n\n ORDER\n\n ...\n\n In cases where additional or relevant information comes to hand that may assist a government pathologist in \ndetermining a cause of death at a time prior to an autopsy being conducted, investigating officers are to contact the \npathologist as a matter of urgency and provide that information on a Supplementary Form 1. The Supplementary \nForm 1 should also be completed and submitted in the same way as a Form 1. A copy of the Supplementary Form \n1 should also be forwarded to the relevant pathologist.  There was no dispute that s 8.4.8 \u2013 headed \u201cCompletion of \nForm 1\u201d \u2013 applied to the completion of the Form 1 in relation to Mulrunji\u2019s death. It provided procedures that:The \npurpose of the Form 1 is to assist the Coroner in deciding whether an autopsy should be ordered, and to assist the \npathologist performing the autopsy to establish the cause of death. Therefore the investigating officer should \ncomplete the relevant parts of the form as soon as possible.\n\n ...\n\n Where an officer has additional information that could not be included on the Form 1 at the time of submission, \nthey should provide this information on a Supplementary Form 1 (QP528).  Section 16.24.1 of the OPM, which was \nheaded \u201cInvestigation of death in custody\u201d, relevantly provided:A death in custody should be treated as a significant \nevent, and the provisions of s. 1.4.6: \u2018Regional Duty Officer\u2019 and s. 1.4.7: \u2018Shift Supervisor\u2019 of this Manual apply. \nThe first response or investigating officer as the case may be should notify the:\n\n (i) shift supervisor;\n\n (ii) regional duty officer;\n\n ...\n\n (iv) Officer in Charge, Cultural Advisory Unit, Office of the Commissioner.\n\n Where the Officer in Charge, Cultural Advisory Unit, Office of the Commissioner, is to be notified, such notification \nshould include the information outlined in parts (i) to (xiii) of s.16.24.3: \u2018Additional responsibilities of officers \ninvestigating deaths in custody\u2019 of this chapter where available. \n\n\n\n All deaths which occur while a person is \u2018in custody\u2019 or while any person is in the company of police, should be \nfully investigated in accordance with s. 1.17: \u2018Fatalities or serious injuries resulting from incidents involving \nmembers (Police related incidents)\u2019 of this Manual.\n\n Where responsibility for the investigation of a death in custody reverts to a commissioned officer pursuant to s. \n1.17: \u2018Fatalities or serious injuries resulting from incidents involving members (Police related incidents)\u2019 of this \nManual, the investigation should be carried out in line with the provisions of s. 2.4: \u2018Crime scene\u2019, s. 2.5: \n\u2018Investigation\u2019 and Chapter 8: \u2018Coronial Matters\u2019 of this Manual.  Section 16.24.3 of the OPM relevantly set out \n\u201cadditional responsibilities\u201d in relation to the investigation of a death in custody:PROCEDURE\n\n Where responsibility for the investigation of a death in custody or in police company reverts to a commissioned \nofficer pursuant to s.1.17 ... that commissioned officer should, as part of the investigation:\n\n ...\n\n (ii) not presume suicide or natural death regardless of whether it may appear likely;\n\n (iii) obtain statements from all witnesses, including police officers, as soon as practicable after the incident and \nprior to any debriefing session where practicable;\n\n (iv) include investigations into the general care, treatment and supervision of the deceased immediately before the \ndeath in line with Service policy, orders and procedures;\n\n (v) inquire fully into the circumstances of the arrest or apprehension including any relevant activities of the \ndeceased beforehand;\n\n (vi) immediately arrange for the next of kin or person previously nominated by the deceased to be notified. Cultural \ninterests of the person being notified should be respected by using the cross cultural liaison officer, if practicable. \nWhere the deceased is an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander and there is a delay or inability to notify the next of \nkin, efforts to notify the next of kin should be recorded;\n\n (vii) in circumstances where the deceased is an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander, notification should preferably \nbe assisted by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person known to those being notified;\n\n (viii) if the deceased is an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander, advise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal \nService or other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community organisation with responsibility for the area, as soon \nas possible, whether or not the relatives have been located;\n\n ...\n\n See also Chapter 8: \u2018Coronial Matters\u2019 and Appendix 16.4: \u2018Suggested format for reports on death in custody or in \npolice company\u2019 of this Manual.\n\nThe QPS Code of Conduct    Another relevant source of instructions for QPS officers is the QPS Code of Conduct. \nThe Code is another source of directions from the Commissioner under s 4.9 of the PSA Act. Section 15 of the \nPublic Sector Ethics Act 1994 (Qld) provides that \u201c[t]he chief executive officer of a public sector entity must ensure \nthat a code of conduct is prepared for the entity.\u201d The stated purpose of the Code is to provide all members of the \n\n\n\nQPS with a set of guiding principles and standards to assist them in determining acceptable standards of conduct. \nThe Code makes clear that QPS officers are required to observe the Code as \u201ca condition of appointment\u201d and that \na breach of the code without a valid reason will be dealt with in accordance with the applicable human resources \ncomplaint management procedures. In November 2004, the version of the Code dated 29 August 2003 was in \nforce. Section 9.3 of the Code \u2013 headed \u201cObligation: Integrity\u201d \u2013 provided that:In recognition that public office \ninvolves a public trust, a public official should seek to maintain and enhance public confidence in the integrity of \npublic administration and advance the common good of the community the official serves. Having regard to that \nobligation, a public official:  should not improperly use his or her official powers or position, or allow them to be \nimproperly used;\n  \n  should ensure that any conflict that may arise between the official\u2019s personal interests and official duties is \nresolved in favour of the public interest; and\n  \n\n  should disclose fraud, corruption, misconduct and maladministration of which the official becomes aware ...  \nSection 10.6 of the Code \u2013 headed \u201cConflict of Interests\u201d \u2013 is also relevant to the applicants\u2019 allegations. It \nprovided:Members of the service are expected to perform their duties in such a manner that public confidence and \ntrust in the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of the Queensland Police Service and its members is preserved.\n\n ... Further, members are to ensure as far as practicable there is no conflict between their personal interests and the \nimpartial fulfilment of their official duties and responsibilities.\n\n Members are to avoid both actual or apparent conflicts of interests in all matters relating to their employment with \nthe Service ... Where a conflict of interest does arise between the private interests of a member and the official \nduties or responsibilities of that member, the member is to disclose details of the conflict to their supervising \nExecutive Officer. All conflicts of interests relating to a member\u2019s employment with the Service will be resolved in \nfavour of the Service and the public interest.\n\nEmergency declaration powers    A significant aspect of the applicants\u2019 challenges in this proceeding relates to the \nmaking of an emergency declaration under the PSP Act on 26 November 2004 after the protests and fires. That Act \ndeals with two broad categories of events: \u201cemergency situation[s]\u201d and \u201cchemical, biological and radiological \nemergencies\u201d. Each category has its own suite of powers and procedures, although the Act has a much larger \nnumber of provisions dealing with the second category.  The evidence established, and it was not contested, that DI \nWebber made the emergency declaration. He relied on s 5 of the PSP Act. For the purposes of s 5(1), DI Webber \nwas the \u201cincident coordinator\u201d. Section 5 of the PSP Act provided:Declaration of emergency situation\n\n (1) Subject to section 6, if at any time a commissioned officer (the \u201cincident coordinator\u201d) is satisfied on reasonable \ngrounds that an emergency situation has arisen or is likely to arise the commissioned officer may declare that an \nemergency situation exists in respect of an area specified by the commissioned officer.\n\n (2) The incident coordinator, as soon as practicable after he or she declares that an emergency situation exists, \nshall issue a certificate to this effect signed by the incident coordinator which certificate shall set out the nature of \nthe emergency situation, the time and date it was declared to exist and the area in respect of which it exists.\n\n (3) The declaration that an emergency situation exists shall continue until revoked by the incident coordinator.\n\n (4) However, if an emergency situation is later declared to be a CBR emergency, the declaration of the emergency \nsituation has no effect for the period of the CBR emergency.Note\u2014\n\n CBR emergencies may be declared under section 12.(5) The incident coordinator shall as soon as practicable \nthereafter, note the time and date of the revocation on the certificate issued pursuant to subsection (2).\n\n\n\n (6) The certificate issued in respect of an emergency situation shall be forwarded to the office of the Commissioner \nof the Police Service within 14 days of the revocation of the declaration of the emergency situation and shall be \nheld in that office for a period of at least 6 years.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    The Dictionary to the PSP Act defined \u201cemergency situation\u201d as:(a) any explosion or fire; or\n\n (b) any oil or chemical spill; or\n\n (c) any escape of gas, radioactive material or flammable or combustible\n\n liquids; or\n\n (d) any accident involving an aircraft, or a train, vessel or vehicle; or\n\n (e) any incident involving a bomb or other explosive device or a firearm or other weapon; or\n\n (f) any other accident;\n\n that causes or may cause a danger of death, injury or distress to any person, a loss of or damage to any property \nor pollution of the environment, includes a situation arising from any report in respect of any of the matters referred \nto in paragraphs (a) to (f) which if proved to be correct would cause or may cause a danger of death, injury or \ndistress to any person, a loss of or damage to any property or pollution of the environment.  Section 6 of the PSP \nAct deals with the potential overlap with the exercise of emergency powers under another state Act, namely the \nDisaster Management Act 2003 (Qld):Disaster Management Act 2003\n\n (1) A declaration pursuant to section 5 shall not be made in respect of an emergency situation which is being dealt \nwith under a disaster situation under the Disaster Management Act 2003.\n\n (2) A declaration pursuant to section 5 which is in force when a disaster situation is declared under the Disaster \nManagement Act 2003, shall be revoked by the incident coordinator when the emergency situation can be \neffectively dealt with under that Act.  Section 13 of the Disaster Management Act defined \u201cdisaster\u201d for the purposes \nof that Act:(1) A disaster is a serious disruption in a community, caused by the impact of an event, that requires a \nsignificant coordinated response by the State and other entities to help the community recover from the disruption.\n\n (2) In this section\u2014serious disruption means\u2014\n\n (a) loss of human life, or illness or injury to humans; or\n\n (b) widespread or severe property loss or damage; or\n\n (c) widespread or severe damage to the environment.  I note both s 6 of the PSP Act and s 13 of the Disaster \nManagement Act for the purpose of giving some context to the kinds of circumstances with which an emergency \ndeclaration under s 5 of the PSP Act is intended to deal.  Section 8 of the PSP Act authorises the exercise of \ncertain coercive powers and is a critical provision in relation to some of the impugned QPS conduct:8 Powers of \nincident coordinator\n\n (1) Where during the period of and in the area specified in respect of an emergency situation the incident \ncoordinator is satisfied on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to effectively deal with that emergency situation \nhe or she (and any other police officer acting on his or her instructions) may\u2014(a) direct the owner or the person for \nthe time being in charge or in control of any resource to surrender it and place it under the incident coordinator\u2019s or \npolice officer\u2019s control (\u201cresource surrender direction\u201d);\n\n\n\n (b) take control of any resource, whether it is in the charge or control of any person or not;\n\n (c) in respect of any resource under the incident coordinator\u2019s or police officer\u2019s control, direct any person who is \ncapable of operating that resource to operate it as directed by him or her (\u201cresource operator direction\u201d);\n\n (d) direct the evacuation and exclusion of any person or persons from any premises and for this purpose may \nremove or cause to be removed (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any person who does not \ncomply with a direction to evacuate or any person who enters, attempts to enter or is found in or on any premises in \nrespect of which a direction for the exclusion of persons has been given;\n\n (e) close or cause to be closed to traffic and pedestrians, any road, street, motorway, private road, private way, \nservice lane, footway, right of way, access way or other way or close any place to which members of the public \nhave access whether on payment of a fee or otherwise;\n\n (f) enter or cause to be entered (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any premises;\n\n (g) search or cause to be searched (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any premises and anything \nfound therein or thereon;\n\n (h) remove or cause to be removed from any premises (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any \nanimal or anything;\n\n (i) direct any person to assist him or her in the manner specified by him or her (\u201chelp direction\u201d).(2) The incident \ncoordinator or police officer must not give a resource operator direction or a help direction to a person if giving the \ndirection would expose the person to imminent danger.\n\n (3) A person given a resource surrender direction, a resource operator direction or a help direction must comply \nwith the direction, unless the person has a reasonable excuse.\n\n Maximum penalty for subsection (3)\u201440 penalty units or 1 year\u2019s imprisonment.  Section 46 of the PSP Act \nprovides for the granting of compensation to persons who claim \u201cto have suffered financial loss because of the use, \ndamage or destruction of the property.\u201d The evidence reveals that several people whose houses were entered and \nsearched did complain to DS Robinson in particular about damage to their houses as a result of the entry and \nsearch. There is no evidence that DS Robinson or any other QPS officer, including DI Webber, directed those \npeople to the terms of s 46 of the PSP Act, or offered to assist them in making any compensation claims.  Section \n47 concerns protection from liability for conduct done in the exercise of powers under the Act. The State placed no \nreliance on this provision and it was not referred to by either party. I do not consider it further.\n\nLaw governing arrests    In 2004, the law governing arrests was found in the PPR Act. Section 198 of that Act set \nout the circumstances in which arrests could be made without first obtaining a warrant. Relevantly, it provided:(1) It \nis lawful for a police officer, without warrant, to arrest an adult the police officer reasonably suspects has \ncommitted or is committing an offence if it is reasonably necessary for 1 or more of the following reasons \u2013(a) to \nprevent the continuation or repetition of an offence or the commission of another offence;\n\n (b) to make inquiries to establish the person's identity;\n\n (c) to ensure the person's appearance before a court;\n\n\n\n (d) to obtain or preserve evidence relating to the offence;\n\n (e) to prevent the harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence relating to \nthe offence;\n\n (f) to prevent the fabrication of evidence;\n\n (g) to preserve the safety or welfare of any person, including the person arrested;\n\n (h) to prevent a person fleeing from a police officer or the location of an offence;\n\n (i) because the offence is an offence against section 444 or 445;\n\n (j) because the offence is an offence against the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 1989, section 80;\n\n (k) because of the nature and seriousness of the offence;\n\n (l) because the offence is\u2014(i) an offence against the Corrective Services Act 2000, section 103(3); or\n\n (ii) an offence to which the Corrective Services Act 2000, section 104 applies.(2) Also, it is lawful for a police \nofficer, without warrant, to arrest a person the police officer reasonably suspects has committed or is committing \nan indictable offence, for questioning the person about the offence, or investigating the offence, under chapter 7.\n\nRelevant offence provisions    On 26 November 2004, reprint 4N of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) was in force \nand contained the Queensland Criminal Code at Sch 1. The Criminal Code contained a number of offences in \nrelation to riots, with which various persons were charged after the events of 26 November 2004 on Palm Island.  \nChapter 9 of the Criminal Code was headed \u201cUnlawful Assemblies \u2013 Breaches of the Peace\u201d. Section 61(1) defined \nan \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d as follows:When 3 or more persons, with intent to carry out some common purpose, \nassemble in such a manner, or, being assembled, conduct themselves in such a manner, as to cause persons in \nthe neighbourhood to fear on reasonable grounds that the persons so assembled will tumultuously disturb the \npeace, or will by such assembly needlessly and without any reasonable occasion provoke other persons \ntumultuously to disturb the peace, they are an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d.  Section 61(2) provided that it was not \nnecessary for persons to have a \u201ccommon purpose\u201d to be engaged in an unlawful assembly. Section 61(4) \nprovided:When an unlawful assembly has begun to act in so tumultuous a manner as to disturb the peace, the \nassembly is called a \u201criot\u201d, and the persons assembled are said to be\u201criotously assembled\u201d.  \u201cDisturb the peace\u201d \nwas not defined.  Section 62 prohibited unlawful assembly:Punishment of unlawful assembly\n\n (1) Any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment \nfor 1 year.\n\n (2) The offender may be, and it is hereby declared that the offender always was liable to be, arrested without \nwarrant.  Section 63 prohibited taking part in a riot:Punishment of riot\n\n (1) Any person who takes part in a riot is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for 3 years.\n\n (2) The offender may be, and it is hereby declared that the offender always was liable to be, arrested without \nwarrant.  Section 64 created an offence of \u201cRioters remaining after proclamation ordering them to disperse\u201d. It is \ntherefore clear that the word \u201crioter\u201d was used in the Criminal Code to refer to a person engaged in the act of rioting.  \nSection 65 provided:Rioters demolishing buildings etc.\n\n\n\n Any persons who, being riotously assembled together, unlawfully pull down or destroy, or begin to pull down or \ndestroy\u2014\n\n (a) any building whatever; or\n\n (b) any machinery whatever, whether fixed or moveable; or\n\n (c) any structure used in farming land, or in carrying on any trade or manufacture, or in conducting the business of \na mine; or\n\n (d) any bridge, wagon-way, or trunk, for conveying materials from a mine;\n\n are guilty of a crime, and each of them is liable to imprisonment for life.  In these reasons, I refer to the offence \ncreated by s 65 as \u201crioting with destruction\u201d.  Section 66 provided:Rioters injuring building, machinery etc.\n\n Any persons who, being riotously assembled together, unlawfully damage any of the things in section 65 \nmentioned, are guilty of a crime, and each of them is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.  In these reasons, I refer to \nthe offence created by s 66 as \u201crioting with damage\u201d.  Sections 261 to 265 provided for circumstances in which it \nwas lawful for a person to suppress a riot, but those provisions are not material for present purposes. Sections 201 \nand 202 respectively created offences of officers neglecting to suppress a riot and any person neglecting to aid in \nsuppressing a riot, but they also are not material.  Section 398 of the Criminal Code prohibited stealing and \ncontained a number of sub-points for punishment in special cases, sub-point 13 of which relevantly prohibited \nstealing by looting in civil unrest:Stealing by looting\n\n If\u2014\n\n (a) the offence is committed during a natural disaster, civil unrest or an industrial dispute; or\n\n (b) the thing stolen is left unattended by the death or incapacity of the person in possession of the property;\n\n the offender is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.  Section 419 prohibited burglary, including entering a dwelling \nwith intent to commit an indictable offence and entering a dwelling and committing an indictable offence:Burglary\n\n (1) Any person who enters or is in the dwelling of another with intent to commit an indictable offence in the dwelling \ncommits a crime.Maximum penalty\u201414 years imprisonment.(2) If the offender enters the dwelling by means of any \nbreak, he or she is liable to imprisonment for life.\n\n (3) If\u2014(a) the offence is committed in the night; or\n\n (b) the offender\u2014(i) uses or threatens to use actual violence; or\n\n (ii) is or pretends to be armed with a dangerous or offensive weapon, instrument or noxious substance; or\n\n (iii) is in company with 1 or more persons; or\n\n (iv) damages, or threatens or attempts to damage, any property;the offender is liable to imprisonment for life.(4) \nAny person who enters or is in the dwelling of another and commits an indictable offence in the dwelling commits a \ncrime.Maximum penalty\u2014imprisonment for life.  Section 461 prohibited arson:Arson\n\n\n\n Any person who wilfully and unlawfully sets fire to any of the things following, that is to say\u2014\n\n (a) any building or structure whatever, whether completed or not;\n\n (b) any vessel, whether completed or not;\n\n (c) any stack of cultivated vegetable produce, or of mineral or vegetable fuel;\n\n (d) a mine, or the workings, fittings, or appliances of a mine;\n\n (e) any aircraft or motor vehicle;\n\n is guilty of a crime, and is liable to imprisonment for life.  Section 469 prohibited wilful damage of property:Wilful \ndamage\n\n Any person who wilfully and unlawfully destroys or damages any property is guilty of an offence which, unless \notherwise stated, is a misdemeanour, and the person is liable, if no other punishment is provided, to imprisonment \nfor 5 years.  All of these offence provisions are relevant to the arrests and charges laid against individuals which \nfollowed the protests and fires on 26 November 2004 on Palm Island.\n\nA DEATH IN CUSTODY    In this part of my reasons I set out the sequence of events concerning how Mulrunji \ncame to be in police custody on 19 November 2004, what happened to him once he was in custody on 19 \nNovember 2004, and the series of events that then unfolded on Palm Island through to approximately 28 \nNovember 2004, which is the point at which the applicants\u2019 allegations of racial discrimination cease in a \nchronological sense. Aspects of this sequence have been the subject of findings in other proceedings, and it is no \npart of the Court\u2019s task here to revisit those findings, nor, through the guise of allegations under s 9 of the RDA, to \ncall into question findings made by other persons and bodies, for other purposes. If it is necessary to go over, and \nmake findings about, factual matters which have been the subject of previous findings, that task is undertaken as \npart of this Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction to determine whether the applicants have made out their allegations of \ncontraventions of s 9 of the RDA.  This part of my reasons is based on the parties\u2019 second amended agreed \nstatement of facts, filed by the parties towards the end of the trial, and on what I understand to be either \nuncontentious, or unchallenged, evidence. There was a considerable body of evidence about which the \nrespondents in particular made no final submissions, other than generalised submissions that evidence was \nirrelevant or not probative. Contested factual issues relevant to the applicants\u2019 s 9 claims are dealt with in the \nResolution section of these reasons.  On the morning of 19 November 2004, Mulrunji was walking down Dee Street \non Palm Island. Dee Street was one of the places the Court visited on the view of Palm Island undertaken during \nthe trial. It is an ordinary suburban street, with houses on both sides. It is a short walk from the mall area and the \npolice station. There were people out and about, including Ms Gladys Nugent, who would later give an account of \nwhat she saw. The evidence of Ms Nugent, and the preliminary autopsy report that would be completed four days \nlater, suggest Mulrunji was affected by alcohol that morning.  SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo were in a police van, \nwhich had a locked cabin area in the back of it. They were in Dee Street at the request of Ms Nugent. She claimed \nto have been assaulted earlier that morning by her partner, Mr Roy Bramwell, and she had asked the police to \nescort her to the Bramwell house in Dee Street so she could collect her diabetes medication. In an interview with \ninvestigating officers later that day, SS Hurley stated that when they arrived at the house Mr Patrick Bramwell, Roy \nBramwell\u2019s nephew, was intoxicated and called out abuse to SS Hurley. SS Hurley arrested him for public nuisance \nand placed him in the back of the police van.  Mulrunji was present as SS Hurley was arresting Patrick Bramwell. \nHe called out to SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo. I return to the evidence about what Mulrunji said in more detail later \nin these reasons. SS Hurley arrested Mulrunji and placed him in the locked area of the police van with Patrick \nBramwell. The basis for the arrest was later said to be that Mulrunji had committed public nuisance by what he said \nto SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo.  SS Hurley drove the police van to the Palm Island Police Station on Main \nStreet. He parked the van in the back of the police station, where there was a partially covered parking area, which \nwas open to the lane behind the police station. This lane is called Police Lane. Ms Penny Sibley was standing in \n\n\n\nthe lane and saw Mulrunji and Patrick Bramwell being taken out of the back of the police van, as she described to \nthe investigating officers two days later. SS Hurley removed Mulrunji from the police van and a struggle ensued.  At \nthe time SS Hurley removed Mulrunji from the police van, Roy Bramwell was inside the police station. Constable \nKristopher Steadman was standing at the front passenger\u2019s side of the police van in a position where he was able \nto see, and did see, some of the events that occurred after SS Hurley removed Mulrunji from the police van to the \ntime when they entered through the door of the Police Station.  Sergeant Michael Leafe and PLO Bengaroo were \nalso present in the vicinity of the police van.  There was a door into the police station from the garage where the \npolice van was located. There was a step up into the police station from this area. On the way into the police \nstation, Mulrunji and SS Hurley fell through the rear door of the police station as they were entering it. There are \nvarious accounts of how this fall occurred and what it involved, including accounts by SS Hurley and by Mr \nBramwell.  Whatever occurred, Mulrunji ended up on the floor of the police station, in a corridor leading to the cells, \nwith his head facing towards the cells and his feet facing towards the door he and SS Hurley had entered through. \nThe parties agree he was limp and unresponsive by this stage.  While in that state, Mulrunji was dragged by \nSergeant Leafe and SS Hurley into a watchhouse cell. It was agreed that this occurred at approximately 10.26 am, \nbeing the time recorded in the police running sheet.  Patrick Bramwell was placed in the watchhouse cell with \nMulrunji. The video footage of the two men while they were in the cell was in evidence before me. It was agreed \nthat it was during this cell video footage that Mulrunji died. The time of his death was agreed to be approximately 11 \nam on 19 November 2004. I set out at [286] below what can be seen during the cell video until Sergeant Leafe, \nConstable Steadman and then SS Hurley all enter the cell upon Sergeant Leafe discovering that Mulrunji was not \nbreathing. The time shown on the video footage was not accurate due to a power outage, but nevertheless it \nestablishes that the period between the point at which the video starts (which was shortly after Mulrunji and Patrick \nBramwell were placed in the cell) and the point at which Mulrunji is found not to be breathing is 44 minutes. \nTherefore, just under an hour elapsed between when Mulrunji was placed in the cell and when he was discovered \nnot to be breathing.  An autopsy was carried out on the following Tuesday, 23 November 2004 and found the cause \nof Mulrunji\u2019s death was intra-abdominal haemorrhage due to a ruptured liver and portal vein. Mulrunji had also \nsustained four broken ribs. It is clear he did not enter custody less than an hour earlier with those injuries.  At \napproximately 11.19 am on 19 November 2004, SS Hurley telephoned the Queensland Ambulance Service and \nasked them to attend an emergency at the watchhouse. SS Hurley then made several calls notifying various people \nof Mulrunji\u2019s death. At approximately 11.23 am he telephoned Senior Sergeant Frank Jenkins at the Townsville \nDistrict Police Communications Centre and advised that Mulrunji might be deceased. At approximately 11.30 am, \nhe again called SS Jenkins and advised him that there had been a death in custody. At around the same time (the \nsequence of these calls is not clear) SS Hurley telephoned District Inspector Gregory Strohfeldt and advised him of \nthe death in custody. Inspector Strohfeldt was also told about Mulrunji\u2019s death by SS Jenkins shortly thereafter.  \nApproximately 15 minutes later (at approximately 11.45 am) SS Hurley telephoned Detective Sergeant Darren \nRobinson, who was stationed on Palm Island but temporarily in Townsville, and told him about Mulrunji\u2019s death. SS \nHurley was at this time DS Robinson\u2019s superior officer. DS Robinson was the second most senior officer on Palm \nIsland at the time, and had been stationed on the island for two years. SS Hurley had also been stationed on the \nisland for approximately two years and, as the Officer in Charge on Palm Island, he was also in charge of the \nwatchhouse and the cells at this time.\nGENERAL NARRATIVE OF EVENTS AFTER MULRUNJI\u2019S DEATH    As in the preceding section, I have based my \nfindings in this part of these reasons largely on the second amended agreed statement of facts, together with \nuncontentious or unchallenged aspects of the oral and documentary evidence where required.\n\nSummary of officers involved in the events of 19 to 28 November 2004    It is necessary, first, to give a brief \nsummary of the police officers mentioned in the evidence. The summary provides the rank and role of each officer \nas at November 2004, but quite a few of the officers have been promoted since that time. In the findings that follow, \nI use the rank of each officer as at November 2004 when addressing actions undertaken at that time, but when \naddressing the evidence given in this proceeding by certain of those officers I use their ranks at the time the \nevidence was taken (for the most part, in March 2016). Those officers who were called as witnesses are the subject \nof findings at [463] to [507] below. In relation to DS Robinson, who has left the police force, I have referred to him \nby the rank he held at the time of the events.  In November 2004, SS Hurley was the most senior QPS officer \nstationed on Palm Island. As such, he was the Officer in Charge of Palm Island Police Station, including its \nwatchhouse and cells. DS Robinson was the Officer in Charge of the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) on Palm \n\n\n\nIsland and he was the second most senior officer stationed on the island after SS Hurley. Sergeant Leafe was \nstationed on Palm Island under SS Hurley\u2019s command, as were Constable Steadman, Constable Benjamin \nTonges, Constable Gene Poole and Constable Timothy Hooker, although Constables Poole and Hooker were not \non Palm Island at the time of Mulrunji\u2019s death on 19 November 2004. PLO Bengaroo was also stationed on Palm \nIsland.  Inspector Strohfeldt was the QPS officer to whom SS Hurley was directly responsible. He was stationed in \nTownsville and had held the position of District Inspector there since 29 March 2004. During his time as District \nInspector, he had not been to Palm Island. However, as I note at [138] above, Inspector Strohfeldt was a member \nof the Steering Committee for the QPS review of policing in Aboriginal communities that highlighted the matters I \nhave set out in that paragraph.  DI Webber was the regional crime coordinator for the Northern Region, which \nincluded Palm Island. In the course of the investigation into the death of Mulrunji between 19 and 24 November \n2004, DI Webber was the commissioned officer responsible for the investigation for the purposes of s 1.17 of the \nOPM.  DSS Kitching was the Officer in Charge of the Townsville CIB. He travelled to Palm Island with DI Webber \nand DS Robinson on the day of Mulrunji\u2019s death, 19 November 2004. From then until 24 November 2004 he was \nthe primary investigator into the death, under the supervision of DI Webber. DS Robinson also assisted with the \ninvestigation.  Inspector Williams was a member of the Ethical Standards Command of the QPS and, after arriving \non Palm Island on 20 November 2004, he too participated in the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death. In the evidence, \nand in the other reports dealing with these events, Inspector Williams is sometimes identified as holding the rank of \nDetective Inspector. The weight of the evidence suggests, however, that it is correct to refer to him with the rank of \nInspector, and that is the rank I propose to use.  Senior Sergeant Roger Whyte was the Officer in Charge of \nDeeragun Police Division, Townsville. On 22 November 2004, he became Officer in Charge of the Palm Island \nPolice Station, replacing SS Hurley. However, SS Whyte performed that role under the command of Inspector \nBrian Richardson, who on 22 November 2004 was instructed by Acting Assistant Commissioner Roy Wall to take \ncharge of overall policing on Palm Island. Inspector Richardson\u2019s role was to have overarching command and to \nliaise with the QPS hierarchy.  Inspector Glenn Kachel was the Professional Practices Manager for the QPS \nNorthern Region and took over operational control of policing on Palm Island from Inspector Richardson after \narriving on the island on the afternoon of 26 November 2004. Detective Sergeant Gary Campbell was stationed at \nthe Townsville CIB and also travelled to Palm Island on 26 November 2004 to investigate possible offences \ncommitted during and after the protests and fires. Senior Sergeant David Dini was Officer in Charge of the \nTownsville Cross-Cultural Liaison Unit and also travelled to Palm Island on 26 November 2004.  Senior Sergeant \nDonald McKay was the Officer in Charge of the SERT unit for the QPS Far Northern Region. The SERT unit was \nbased in Cairns and was made up of two teams. Acting Sergeant Rodney Kruger was acting leader of one of those \nteams. Constable Wade Folpp was a member of A/S Kruger\u2019s team. Mr Folpp\u2019s rank is not revealed in the \nevidence, but I have applied the rank of \u201cConstable\u201d when referring to him based on the applicants\u2019 submissions. \nThe respondents\u2019 submissions do not mention Constable Folpp, but I have assumed that if this rank were incorrect \nthe respondents would have identified the mistake.  Inspector Steven Underwood was from what was described in \nthe evidence as the \u201cspecialist services branch\u201d of the QPS. He arrived on Palm Island at approximately 7.30 pm \non 26 November 2004 with the Public Safety Response Team (PSRT), of which he was the commanding officer. \nThe function of PSRT was to protect public safety in instances of confrontation or violence. Inspector Underwood \nwas also the most senior QPS officer to go on the operation that took place on 27 and 28 November 2004 and \nduring the entries and searches he had command of both SERT and PSRT, although it would appear from the \nevidence that SS McKay had what I might describe as \u201cpractical command\u201d over the SERT officers. It is fair to say \nthere was very little evidence adduced by the respondents about the interrelationship between the roles of the \nnumerous QPS officers.\n\nInitial response to Mulrunji\u2019s death by officers on the mainland    At some time between approximately 11.40 am \nand 12 noon on 19 November 2004, Inspector Strohfeldt notified DI Webber of Mulrunji\u2019s death. At this stage, DI \nWebber was in Townsville, as was Inspector Strohfeldt.  Also between approximately 11.40 am and 12 noon on 19 \nNovember 2004, DI Webber appointed DSS Kitching as the primary investigator in the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath and, therefore, the \u201cinvestigating officer\u201d under the OPM. Sometime shortly thereafter, DI Webber also \nappointed DS Robinson to assist with the investigation. As I have noted above, DS Robinson was in Townsville on \nthis day.  At 11.50 am, SS Jenkins advised Senior Sergeant Lilian Bensted, the Officer in Charge of the QPS \nCultural Advisory Unit (CAU), of Mulrunji\u2019s death. SS Bensted advised SS Jenkins about the relevant sections of the \nOPM that would need to be complied with during the investigation. She also advised that it was necessary to \n\n\n\ncontact the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service (ATSILS) in relation to the death.  At approximately \n12.10 pm the Ethical Standards Command was notified of the death in custody. Shortly after that time, DI Webber \nnotified Detective Inspector Gil Aspinall, the Officer in Charge of the Coronial Support Unit in Brisbane, of Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath. The State Coroner was then immediately notified of the death.  There is some evidence that, at \napproximately 1 pm, Mulrunji\u2019s partner, Tracey Twaddle, went to the Palm Island Police Station and inquired about \nMulrunji. Ms Twaddle had been Mulrunji\u2019s partner for approximately 10 years. The evidence is not especially clear \nwhether she went to the police station once or twice on that day. There was some cross-examination to the effect \nthat Ms Twaddle went to the police station at 1 pm, and DI Webber agreed that he learned at some stage (whether \non 19 November 2004 or otherwise was unclear) that \u201cshe had been told effectively to go home\u201d. However, the \nCMC stated in its report (at p 124) that Ms Twaddle went to the police station at 11.30 am as well:Some time after \n11.30 am on 19 November 2004, Mulrunji\u2019s partner, Tracey Twaddle, and her niece approached the police station, \nwhere an ambulance was in attendance. Her niece asked at the police station who the ambulance was for and was \ntold it was for Chris Hurley. Tracey Twaddle returned to the police station sometime after 1 pm to ask when \nMulrunji would be released. Hurley told her to come back at three o\u2019clock and did not advise her of Mulrunji\u2019s death.  \nAt the end of his interview with investigating officers given later that afternoon, SS Hurley said that Mulrunji\u2019s \u201cfamily \ncame up when he was in the cell and ah, you know I had to tell them to see us later on\u201d, but he did not state what \ntime that occurred, nor who he meant by Mulrunji\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d, nor whether they came to the station more than once.  \nThe only other relevant evidence in this proceeding comes from Mrs Agnes Wotton. She said:Well, my daughter, \nshe was very good friends with Cameron\u2019s de facto, and she came and told me that, you know, \u201cWe lost Cameron.\u201d \nAnd his de facto \u2013 her \u2013 yes, his de facto wanted to know what happened to him at that time, so I don\u2019t know \nwhether she got an answer around about 3 o\u2019clock that day \u2013 that afternoon but she didn\u2019t get it in the morning. She \nwent down to the police station: \u201cWhat happened to Cameron?\u201d  On the evidence before me (having regard to the \napproach I take to the CMC report: see [118] above) I am not able to make any findings about whether Ms Twaddle \nwent once or twice to the police station before she and Mulrunji\u2019s family were formally notified of his death later in \nthe afternoon by DI Webber. However, based on the concession by DI Webber in cross-examination, the statement \nby SS Hurley in his record of interview, and Mrs Wotton\u2019s evidence, I am prepared to find that Ms Twaddle went to \nthe police station at least once, and was turned away by SS Hurley himself, without being told her partner had died.\n\nArrival of investigating officers on Palm Island    At approximately 2.20 pm, DI Webber, DSS Kitching and DS \nRobinson travelled to Palm Island by charter aircraft, accompanied by police technical support staff (Senior \nSergeant Arthy, Constable Tibbey, Sergeant Bartulovich, two Constables and a Human Services Officer). The \narrival of these officers on Palm Island meant SS Hurley was no longer the most senior police officer on the \nisland. As regional crime coordinator, DI Webber was the officer in charge of DSS Kitching, although as I have \nnoted DSS Kitching was the primary investigating officer in the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death.  Palm Island \nairport is several kilometres from the area of the town where the mall, the Council offices, the police station and the \npolice barracks were located in November 2004. Near the airport is one of the three main settlements on the \nisland, which is known as Butler Bay.  SS Hurley and Sergeant Leafe met the arriving officers at the airport, \nbringing two vehicles to transport them and their support staff to the police station. Although neither Constable \nSteadman nor Constable Tonges were on duty at the time the officers arrived, the respondents did not dispute the \ncontention that they could have been asked to transport the officers from the airport to the police station, but were \nnot asked or directed to do so.  Instead, SS Hurley drove the officers back to the station. At that time, the \ninvestigating officers were not aware of any allegation that SS Hurley had assaulted Mulrunji. Allegations to that \neffect were subsequently made by Roy Bramwell and Penny Sibley, as I describe below. However, SS Hurley, DI \nWebber and DSS Kitching knew the types of matters required to be investigated following a death in custody, \nincluding the matters set out in s 16.24.3 of the OPM, which I have extracted at [182] above.  The settled part of \nPalm Island covers relatively confined areas on the island. It is a small community, with few roads. Anyone \ntravelling in a vehicle around Palm Island is highly visible. It would also have been obvious to those officers that \nsome members of the community were likely to see SS Hurley driving DI Webber and DSS Kitching from the airport \nto the police station. SS Hurley, having spent two years on the island by November 2004, would certainly have \nknown himself how visible he would be driving the investigation team. Neither DI Webber nor SS Hurley\u2019s \ncommanding officer Inspector Strohfeldt instructed SS Hurley not to discuss the circumstances surrounding the \ndeath in custody with other QPS officers.  What was said between SS Hurley and the investigating officers during \nthis drive was the subject of some oral evidence by Inspector Kitching, to the effect that they engaged in minor \n\n\n\nconversation about what was going to transpire, but no conversation about Mulrunji\u2019s death. DI Webber gave \nevidence that there was some discussion of the possibility of \u201cunrest or ill [will]\u201d in the community. In the absence of \nmore fulsome evidence about what occurred during that drive, I am not prepared to find that the extent of the \nconversation between the men in that vehicle was limited to what Inspector Kitching and DI Webber now recall. \nHowever, I am also not able on the evidence to make any positive findings about what was discussed.  The fact that \nSS Hurley went to the airport and drove the officers back to the police station is one of the events relied on by the \napplicants as demonstrating the lack of impartiality (both in fact and in appearance) in the investigation into \nMulrunji\u2019s death.\n\nNotification of next of kin    Shortly after DI Webber arrived on the island, he arranged to go to notify Mulrunji\u2019s next \nof kin that Mulrunji had died. The timing of this notification is impugned by the applicants as a contravention of s 9, \nand I return to it below. DI Webber took Mr Owen Marpoondin, who was at that time working for ATSILS, and \nSergeant Leafe from the police station. Sergeant Leafe drove the police vehicle. They went first (at approximately \n3.40 pm) to see Ms Twaddle to inform her of the death; then they went (at approximately 4 pm) to Mulrunji\u2019s \nmother\u2019s house to inform Mulrunji\u2019s mother.\n\nInterviews and re-enactments with witnesses    That same day, and while the next of kin were being notified, \nbetween approximately 4.04 pm and 4.36 pm DSS Kitching and DS Robinson interviewed SS Hurley. During the \ninterview, SS Hurley gave an account of what had happened which included an allegation that Mulrunji had struck \nhim in the face as SS Hurley was taking him out of the police van, and that SS Hurley had then grabbed hold of \nMulrunji and a \u201cstruggle\u201d had ensued, resulting in the two men falling through the door to the police station. SS \nHurley told the investigators that he and Sergeant Leafe had then dragged Mulrunji into the cell and that he had \nnoticed \u201ca small amount of blood\u201d coming from an injury above Mulrunji\u2019s right eye.  SS Hurley gave this description \nof the struggle and fall (\u201cH\u201d standing for SS Hurley and \u201cK\u201d standing for DSS Kitching):H ... Now from there what \nhappened was I opened the rear door of the police vehicle to get the two people in custody out. As I did this, \nCameron DOOMADGEE struck me with a closed fist \u2013 that was on the back side of his fist \u2013 he came across my \nface. I then took hold of him by grabbing him on the shirt \u2013 up close to where they ahh the V of the shirt \u2013 a struggle \nensued. What I was trying to do at the time was get a hold of \u2013 get a hold of one of his arms \u2013 but it was a confined \narea between the \u2013 police vehicle and the side wall of that police station \u2013 from there we ahh \u2013 the struggle moved \ninto the station where we were on the ground \u2013 because the step up\n\n K So you tripped over a step is that right\n\n H Over the step as we came in \u2013 there\u2019s a step there\n\n K How did you manage to fall on the ground\n\n H I fell to the left of him and he was to the right of me\n\n K What caused you to fall\n\n H Just coming into the station I was trying to grab him and he was trying to get away\n\n K Oh OK\n\n H From there \u2013 ahh \u2013 Sergeant LEAFE had closed the back door of the ahh \u2013 wagon\n\n K Where was umm \u2013 Patrick BRAMWELL at that stage\n\n H I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I\u2019m not sure whether Sergeant LEAFE had brought him into the station or whether he was still \noutside\n\n K OK\n\n\n\n H Anyway umm \u2013 Sergeant LEAFE then seeing the struggle went and opened up the watchhouse \u2013 the door to the \nwatchhouse so he didn\u2019t have to struggle (U/I) and then when there were two of us there \u2013 we took him by both \narms and we took him into the watchhouse \u2013 he\u2019d stopped um, he\u2019d stopped fighting us. Put him into the \nwatchhouse \u2013 there was two mattresses there \u2013 he didn\u2019t lie on any of the mattresses \u2013 he lay on the floor.\n\n ...\n\n K And when you said you got him out of the police vehicle \u2013 who assisted you [to] get him out of the police vehicle\n\n H Nobody\n\n K OK so you got him out by yourself\n\n H Yeah\n\n K OK and you said you had a struggle between the police vehicle and the wall of the police station\n\n H Yes\n\n K Ok umm \u2013 who assisted you to get him from the police vehicle to the police station\n\n H Nobody \u2013 I was the only one that was umm \u2013 wrestling with him\n\n K And you said as a result of the struggle you fell into the police station because of a step is that right\n\n H Yeah \u2013 I can only presume we fell over the step because when we were at the station I can remember that we \nwere on the ground\n\n K OK \u2013 and who was assisting you then\n\n H Nobody \u2013 I stood up (ui) Michael LEAFE came and ahh \u2013 assisted me to drag him into the cell\n\n ...\n\n K When you fell to the ground inside the station there did you receive any injuries yourself\n\n H No \u2013 no but I had noticed his \u2013 you know that, I\u2019ve been over that \u2013 just a tiny scratch on my arm there on the left \nhand arm there \u2013 probably from the ahh \u2013 the little wrestle that we had \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing I can see\n\n K And you didn\u2019t land on top of him\n\n H No I landed beside him on the ahh \u2013 on the ahh \u2013 what do you call it \u2013 the ahh lino\n\n K Did he ever complain of any medical injuries or\n\n H No\n\n\n\n K That he was aware of any injuries\n\n H I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t able to ask him the questions because of his aggression and because of the fact we \ntook him straight to the cell ...  SS Hurley said nothing about falling on top of Mulrunji, instead stating that he \n\u201clanded beside him\u201d. Nor did SS Hurley say anything about any heavy contact between himself and Mulrunji during \nthe fall, nor anything about hitting Mulrunji himself.  After interviewing SS Hurley, over the next two and a half hours \nor so (between approximately 4.50 pm and 7.10 pm) DSS Kitching and DS Robinson interviewed a number of other \npeople, in the following order: PLO Bengaroo; Gladys Nugent; and Patrick Bramwell.  Later that night (between \napproximately 7.50 pm and 8.12 pm) they interviewed Sergeant Leafe. He told them that, as SS Hurley was \nremoving Mulrunji from the police vehicle, he had heard SS Hurley cry out that Mulrunji had hit him; that he had \nthen seen SS Hurley \u201cscuffling\u201d with Mulrunji; and that a few seconds later, Mulrunji had been lying limp on the \nground of the police station and had felt like a \u201cdead weight\u201d as Sergeant Leafe and SS Hurley dragged him into \nthe cell.  A little later that evening (between approximately 8.22 pm and 8.35 pm) DSS Kitching and DS Robinson \nconducted a recorded interview with Edna Coolburra, who was a resident of Dee Street and saw Mulrunji being \narrested by SS Hurley.  After the interviews had been completed for the evening, DI Webber, DSS Kitching and DS \nRobinson ate a meal with SS Hurley at SS Hurley\u2019s residence. The meal was prepared by DS Robinson. The men \nconsumed a modest amount of beer. Sergeant Leafe and his wife (who was also a police officer) were present for \npart of this time. This event is another of the examples relied on by the applicants as demonstrating that the \ninvestigation lacked impartiality, both in fact and in appearance.  The next morning (20 November 2004), interviews \nbegan again. At approximately 8.15 am, DSS Kitching and DS Robinson conducted an interview with Roy \nBramwell, an Aboriginal man who lived on Palm Island. DSS Kitching and DS Robinson had driven to Roy \nBramwell\u2019s house at approximately 8 am that morning to bring him to the station for an interview, having received \ninformation the previous day that he had been inside the police station when SS Hurley brought Mulrunji into the \nstation. During his interview, Mr Bramwell alleged that he saw SS Hurley assault Mulrunji, including while Mulrunji \nwas lying on the floor after SS Hurley knocked him down. Mr Bramwell is recorded (at p 7 of his record of interview) \nas saying:They dragged him in ... Chris started punchin\u2019 him just in the hall there, Chris started punchin\u2019 him, you \nwant more Mr Doomadgee, (ui). You want more Mr Doomadgee hey that\u2019s enough for ya, just kept on going like \nthat, Chris (ui) sat down and (ui) I seen Mr Doomadgee legs sticking up.  Shortly after the interview, DS Robinson \nprepared a typed statement for Mr Bramwell, which he subsequently signed. DS Robinson had been typing up \nstatements for the other witness interviews as well, although there is no evidence before the Court that he prepared \nwitness statements recording what SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo said in their interviews. Transcripts of the \ninterviews with SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo were in evidence, however.  A little later in the morning (between \n9.16 am and 9.25 am) DSS Kitching also interviewed Gerald Kidner, who stated that he had seen SS Hurley arrest \nMulrunji in Dee Street the previous morning.  Inspector Williams arrived on Palm Island by plane about mid-\nmorning on Saturday, 20 November 2004. The parties agreed a fact that it was Inspector Williams\u2019 role to \n\u201coverview\u201d the investigation, as required by s 1.17 of the OPM and cl 7.2 of the Coroner\u2019s Guidelines, although DI \nWebber retained responsibility for the investigation as regional crime coordinator, and DSS Kitching remained the \nprincipal investigator. It is correct that the OPM and the Coroner\u2019s Guidelines use the verb \u201coverview\u201d but there was \nno real evidence or explanation before the Court about what this meant in practice. As I set out elsewhere in these \nreasons, it was the case that Inspector Williams took an active part in the interviews and re-enactments, and \ncertainly did more than simply supervise or have other officers report to him.  DI Webber gave Inspector Williams a \nbriefing, together with DSS Kitching and DS Robinson. Inspector Williams reviewed the interviews and witness \nstatements which were then in existence.  At approximately 10.52 am on 20 November 2004, Inspector Williams \nand DI Webber conducted a video re-enactment with Roy Bramwell of the events surrounding Mulrunji\u2019s death, \nduring which Mr Bramwell repeated his allegation that SS Hurley assaulted Mulrunji. This video re-enactment was \nin evidence before me, and was the best evidence before the Court of what the inside of the police station looked \nlike at the time.  The same officers, together with DSS Kitching and Constable Tibbey, then visited the site of \nMulrunji\u2019s arrest in Dee Street. SS Hurley drove the officers to and from Dee Street. Whilst at Dee Street, SS Hurley \ngave an account of what had occurred when he arrested Mulrunji. What occurred during this event was said by the \napplicants to contravene s 9 of the RDA in several ways, and I return to this in the Resolution section of these \nreasons. The officers did not take PLO Bengaroo with them, and so did not ask him to re-enact anything that \nhappened during the arrest at Dee Street.  After the visit to Dee Street, Inspector Williams and DI Webber \n\n\n\nconducted video re-enactments with SS Hurley, PLO Bengaroo and Sergeant Leafe, between approximately 11.53 \nam and 1.12 pm. These re-enactments were in evidence before me.  It will be recalled that PLO Bengaroo had \nbeen with SS Hurley when Mulrunji was arrested in Dee Street and had travelled with SS Hurley in the police van \nto the police station. He had been present when SS Hurley took Mulrunji out of the van and brought him into the \npolice station. In his re-enactment, PLO Bengaroo described seeing SS Hurley and Mulrunji go \u201cboth together\u201d \nthrough the doorway of the police station. He was asked what was happening as they both went through the \ndoorway and replied that they were \u201cboth still struggling\u201d. When asked what happened then, PLO Bengaroo \nrepeated that the men were struggling and then said they went down the hallway. Inspector Williams then asked \nwhether anything had happened \u201chere\u201d (indicating an area just inside the doorway where SS Hurley had said the \nmen fell). I infer that, given PLO Bengaroo had said nothing about any fall, Inspector Williams asked this because of \nwhat SS Hurley had said.  PLO Bengaroo did not answer Inspector Williams directly. He shifted around, looking \ndownwards and, I find, appearing uncomfortable. He looked at the other officers and then said \u201ccan\u2019t recall, no\u201d. \nInspector Williams then tried again, asking if the men \u201cwalked down the hallway\u201d. PLO Bengaroo repeated that they \nwere struggling. After a little more hesitation, PLO Bengaroo then said Mulrunji \u201cflopped against the floor\u201d and that \nSS Hurley \u201cfell down on him\u201d. He then said that \u201cChris was trying to pick him up\u201d. DI Webber reassured PLO \nBengaroo that he should take his time. Inspector Williams asked if he was saying Cameron fell down. DI Webber \nthen asked \u201cor did they both fall down\u201d. PLO Bengaroo replied that they both fell down. PLO Bengaroo then \ndescribed, with some prompting from the officers, how SS Hurley tried to pick up Mulrunji \u201cfrom behind\u201d. PLO \nBengaroo then confirmed that he did not go inside. He concluded this part of the re-enactment by saying he saw SS \nHurley and Sergeant Leafe dragging Mulrunji down the hallway.  PLO Bengaroo was asked by Inspector Williams \nwhether, after the fall, he was watching as SS Hurley and Sergeant Leafe dragged Mulrunji down the hallway in the \npolice station leading to the cells. PLO Bengaroo replied, \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t\u201d. Inspector Williams asked \u201cWhat were you \ndoing? What, how come you were standing there?\u201d. PLO Bengaroo replied \u201cI can\u2019t remember. I just stood there \nbecause I was thinking, um, if I see something I might get into trouble myself or something ... the family might \nharass me or something you know.\u201d Inspector Williams responded, \u201cOh, OK\u201d.  After that exchange, DI Webber and \nInspector Williams asked PLO Bengaroo about whether he saw SS Hurley do anything while Mulrunji was on the \nground and whether he saw SS Hurley punch Mulrunji. PLO Bengaroo replied that SS Hurley \u201cscruffed\u201d Mulrunji. As \nhe said this PLO Bengaroo raised his left arm, with his elbow at right angles, apparently indicating how he recalled \nSS Hurley \u201cscruffed\u201d Mulrunji. PLO Bengaroo was then asked whether he saw SS Hurley punch Mulrunji and he \nreplied \u201cI didn\u2019t, nah\u201d.  The applicants\u2019 case included allegations that the failure by DI Webber and Inspector \nWilliams to follow through with PLO Bengaroo about what he had said (and not said) during this re-enactment was \na key failure of the investigation. The implication the applicants sought to draw was that PLO Bengaroo had seen \nthings he did not wish to volunteer or talk about and this would have been obvious to any objective investigator. \nThey allege that this failure occurred because PLO Bengaroo was an Aboriginal man and therefore what he said \nwas not taken seriously, or that the investigators were not keen to focus on matters which might impugn SS Hurley.  \nAt approximately 1.10 pm on Saturday, 20 November 2004, DSS Kitching and Inspector Williams undertook a re-\nenactment with SS Hurley. This was the second time SS Hurley gave an account of what occurred. During the re-\nenactment SS Hurley described what occurred in the following terms (\u201cMW\u201d standing for Inspector Williams, \u201cWW\u201d \nstanding for DI Webber, and \u201cCH\u201d standing for SS Hurley):MW ... Chris what we\u2019d like you to do please is ah we\u2019re \ngonna video tape the re- enactment of how you um dealt with the deceased once we came back here to the the ah \nstation. What I\u2019d like you to do is um basically in slow motion we\u2019ll just go through each and every point as we run \nalong and if you can just explain as we go along um his demeanour your actions what was happening and who you \nsaw around you ah at the time is that Okay\n\n CH Yep, that\u2019s fine\n\n MW Beautiful\n\n CH Um, initially, we arrived that door, that door was shut. I got here and Sergeant LEAFE was standing here as \nwas the male person that male person was Roy BRAMWELL um there was also a lady there who is Penny SIBLEY \nI now know that. I didn\u2019t know SIBLEY at the time. Lloyd told me that\u2019s who it is. Um before opening the cage Sgt \nLEAFE told me that that was Roy BRAMWELL and I, I, was ah conducting initial investigation into ah three bodily \n\n\n\nharms from in the morning that Roy BRAMWELL was the suspect and ah LEAFE asked me what I want done with \nhim and ah I said put him in the on the yellow chair. The yellow chair is normally the chair we use for suspects \nbasically. Um, I can\u2019t remember whether he went in then or what happened. I turned and I opened up this um cage \nthe second person that was ah arrested was um Patrick NUGENT and NUGENT was more at the back there ah \nCameron DOOMADGEE was at the, at the front. So he came out first when I opened the when I opened the door I \nopened it to here or somewhere around there and I told them to come out and what happened then DOOMADGEE \nstepped out or started to step out and I got assaulted. I was like that ready to get in there and the punch wasn\u2019t like \nthat (sound of punch) it was like that (sound of punch) it was like type of backwards\n\n WW Backhand\n\n CH It was a type of backhand closed fist punch\n\n MW Okay\n\n CH Um, that ah that struck me like that anyway I\n\n MW So it struck your right jaw\n\n CH It struck my right jaw chin area\n\n MW Yep\n\n CH I didn\u2019t hit me up here he hit me down there anyway um I have then grabbed hold of him by the shirt and \nthere\u2019s been a tussle go on between us and that tussle continued to inside the building\n\n MW Now can you just, just slow down buddy and just explain to me how the tussle what, what sort of tussle did \nthat involve, getting him down to the ground\n\n CH Well when ...\n\n WW Mate, if I play the part ...\n\n WW Yep\n\n CH When, when he was coming out um I don\u2019t know how far out he was I can\u2019t recall that but straight away the \ntussle went on and I went straight for his shirt, to pull him towards me to stop that happening basically. The weight \nof him coming towards me, I was on the back and then I tried to heave him towards this way and we\u2019re in between \nus here. And basically because of the state of his intoxication he was also like lower than, just go a bit lower boss, \nhe was a lot lower than that and we were, we were tussling to try and get him there\n\n WW Did he have hold of you\n\n CH and he had a hold of me and I don\u2019t know particularly where, but I had a hold of his shirt and I kept onto his \nshirt like that the whole way in. I remember bouncing off the wall a couple of times. I remember I bounced into the \namplimesh a couple of times from the tussling that was going on.\n\n MW Yep\n\n CH And ah the tussling was you know whilst I can\u2019t remember exactly, the tussling was something similar to come \non, come come like this. Now what had happened was Lloyd BENGAROO the Police Liaison Officer, had opened \n\n\n\nthis door for me Um he had pinned it back like that. Now when I was tussling with um DOOMADGEE he was low \nI\u2019ve stepped like this and he\u2019s gone like that like that and we\u2019re both gone like like that. \n\n [I interpolate here that the video of the re-enactment shows SS Hurley demonstrating that he and Mulrunji fell \nthrough the door together with SS Hurley falling to the left and Mulrunji falling to the right. In the demonstration, SS \nHurley and DI Webber (who was playing the part of Mulrunji in the re-enactment) are in contact during and \nimmediately after the fall but they fall side by side rather than SS Hurley on top of DI Webber.]And that was the \nthing, his head was there and I recall that I was making sure it didn\u2019t hit there or there but his legs were more out, if l \ncan remember no his legs were more out the door at that time. He was kind of like that and then I\u2019ve, then I\u2019ve \nstood up and I can\u2019t remember whether he was on his stomach when he fell or on his back. But I can remember to \ntry to get him up, I had his shirt and I was going like that. Now he ended up that he wasWW You trying to lift him\n\n CH He was down like that he was down and his feet were he was more in and I don\u2019t know how he got from that \npoint to that point but I had tried to lift him when when he went near there I tried to lift him a couple of, sorry I tried to \nleft him a couple of occasions.\n\n MW Just take your time mate\n\n CH I tried to lift him a couple of occasions. Like this I\u2019m going get up Mr Doomadgee get up \n\n [I interpolate here that in the video of the re-enactment SS Hurley grabs DI Webber by the shirt and tugs at it \nseveral times to indicate an attempt to lift him up from the ground.]I said don\u2019t start it again you know. Anyway he \nwas down there and ah, he refused to get up. Now I can\u2019t I can\u2019t remember, I just asked Michael before .. um when \ndid he come through. That\u2019s ... I can\u2019t even remember Michael LEAFE coming through but Michael has come \nthrough here, past us, opened that wooden door and then opened the door of the watchhouse and come back and \nwe both grabbed a by this stage um DOOMADGEE was like that on his back I\u2019ve stepped over him like that, LEAFE \nwas on the other hand and by his wrists and like that we have dragged him then from there and we have dragged \nthis door was open and the watchhouse door was open. We have dragged him from there into the cell, into the cell \nand he just layed there thenWW When you say dragged, what with your arms under each armpit or\n\n CH No, dragged like he was laying on the ground and he just he was dragged backwards\n\n WW With his legs dragging\n\n CH With his legs dragging\n\n MW When you had Mr DOOMADGEE on the ground you said you were trying to pick him up, what, what happened \nas you were trying to pick him up did you pick him by the shirt.\n\n CH I picked him up like to a certain but his shirt kept ripping I picked him a couple of times.\n\n MW Can, can we just do that again. Can you just show us the movement you made as you tried to pick him up by \nthe shirt without ripping your shirt.\n\n CH Yeah well at the time I had him like this I was trying to pick him up like that.\n\n MW Yes\n\n CH Well you can hear that it just kept on ripping.\n\n MW What happens to your hand when it ripped.\n\n\n\n CH When it ripped it it went like that.\n\n MW Yep\n\n CH And just ripped. I had force on it but then it went like that because it ripped basically and then well you know \nwell I just didn\u2019t want to keep ripping his shirt off obviously. Um, a very short time later, Mick was back to help me \nand we dragged him into the cell\n\n MW When you try to lift people is the what\u2019s your standard way of lifting someone off the ground that\u2019s more or less \na dead drunken weight as Mr, Mr DOOMADGEE was at this time.\n\n CH If, if he had the clothing on that the Inspectors got on now I would have just gripped him by the belt and pulled \nhim up and one by the shirt. But ah he didn\u2019t he had the um type of um board shorts or whatever things on so I was \ntrying to grab him up by the things and get him onto the feet and then to walk him into the cell.\n\n MW We might just go through and show us how you put into the cell please.\n\n CH We won\u2019t um actually put him in the cell because we haven\u2019t cleaned it out\n\n MW No that\u2019s fine\n\n WW Cell door open or shut\n\n CH That was open\n\n WW It was open\n\n CH Yeah the cell door was open like that like how the cells are open there, cell was open and basically from here I \nhad I had the left arm and Michael had the right, Sergeant LEAFE had the right and we just dragged him into here \nand put him straight into the cell and um\n\n WW Backwards\n\n CH Backwards like that and put him straight in the cell and we put him on the left hand side of the cell where um he \nis on the video\n\n WW Alright I notice here a couple of steps right did was at any stage did anyone fall on the ground, or anything \nhere\n\n CH No No the only thing that um would have been uncomfortable for him was that his feet were dragging it would \nhave gone like that but there was nothing else\n\n WW Head\n\n CH No\n\n WW Never struck the ground\n\n CH No the head never struck the ground no\n\n MW Actually we won\u2019t talk in there because it seems to vibrate around a bit. Um could you just come back out \nhere. Um, did Mr DOOMADGEE\u2019s head strike the ground anywhere in this area.\n\n\n\n CH His head was on the ground it didn\u2019t strike either of here but um later on that\u2019s when we found him deceased I \nnoticed he had a, had a spot of blood there, um so there\u2019s obviously is a possibility that we\u2019ve come in, his head \nhas hit the ground or\n\n MW You more or less said you tripped as you come through the door\n\n CH Because of the fact that um, well most likely because of the fact two of us trying to get through the door and ah, \nI ended up on my knees beside him and he was here\n\n MW Okay you described Mr DOOMADGEE as being down low can you just indicate height wise here for us how, \nhow low he was before he actually came down onto the ground.\n\n CH Um, well probably about the height of if you have a look at that, from that type of distance because yeah, he \nwas, and he was low because of his state of intoxication and because of the fact that um well probably, probably \njust the fact that he was resisting and just didn\u2019t want to come in.\n\n MW Okay, but when you were on the ground who could you see around at that point.\n\n CH Ah nobody to tell you the truth, Oh I didn\u2019t only from hindsight and from speaking to the people found out that \nLloyd was the one that opened the door and um, um, BRAMWELL was over there. But I was aware I told Michael to \nbring BRAMWELL in, but I couldn\u2019t see BRAMWELL. I didn\u2019t know whether he was there there or not. But ah, I \nknew Michael was there and I knew Mrs SIBLEY, Penny SIBLEY was out there and Lloyd was around this area \nsomewhere. Like everybody was around. Um but I didn\u2019t like try and mentally picture it I did see them you know. I \nwas more concerned about what you know having the tussle with DOOMADGEE.\n\n WW In physical stature how would you describe the deceased more like myself or more like Inspector WILLIAMS\n\n CH More like the Inspector here um he had a bit of strength about him\n\n WW Well putting on a struggle\n\n CH Well the thing that surprised me is I when he hit me out the back of the um van, I said \u201che hit me, he punched \nme\u201d. Because that\u2019s not normal here, you know and ah it shocked me basically. Um, so yeah that\u2019s when I grabbed \nhim and I knew there\u2019d be a tussle on to get him inside if he is going to hit the copper\n\n MW Did he make any complaint to you at all as he was going through about anything.\n\n CH He was objecting about being in custody. Like I can\u2019t recall what he was saying but I remember him objecting \nabout you know getting locked up\n\n MW Anything else Inspector\n\n WW Not that I can.\n\n MW Just cover one more small thing when he was lying on the ground, what position, what side, back, front how \nwas he lying on the ground just here\n\n CH Initially I remember when we both came in, I was down, he was he had his right side that way. And then ah, \nthat was when we first came in. And then when we ended up dragging him into the cell he was on his back.\n\n MW So basically laying on his right side when he was here\n\n\n\n CH On his right side initially when he came in I can remember\n\n MW Yeah and then onto his back\n\n CH And then onto his back yeah.\n\n MW Okay. Was he still ah, conscious\n\n CH Yes\n\n MW At this time. Was he still moving at this time, as you were dragging him, was he still what was he doing as you \nwere dragging him in was he still talking ah or wasn\u2019t he talking.\n\n CH No he wasn\u2019t particularly talking\n\n MW Was, was he moving\n\n CH Yes, yes\n\n WW Did he was he trying to get say when he was moving, what what were his actions.\n\n CH Oh he was moving his legs and whatever but he wasn\u2019t ah, I think he was resound [sic; \u201cresigned\u201d] to the fact \nthat he was going in there and\n\n WW Was he trying to stand was he trying to move forward\n\n CH No, he didn\u2019t stand he, he refused to stand when I tried to get him up on a number of occasions. So listen I just \nsaid to Mick lets drag him in  The applicants made allegations about how SS Hurley changed the account he gave \nin this second interview from the one given on the Friday. The applicants attributed the changes to SS Hurley being \npermitted to remain in the police station and (they alleged) overhear what others were saying, as well as SS Hurley \nbeing permitted to talk to other officers.  The final interview conducted by DSS Kitching during this period was an \ninterview with Ms Florence \u201cPenny\u201d Sibley conducted in Ingham (which is on the mainland, approximately 45 km \nwest of Palm Island) between 7.50 am and 8.05 am on 21 November 2004. Ms Sibley is an Aboriginal woman. On \nher account of what she saw outside the police station on 19 November 2004, after Mulrunji had been taken out of \nthe police van, he punched SS Hurley and Ms Sibley then saw SS Hurley hit Mulrunji.  By this stage all relevant \nofficers had been interviewed except Constable Steadman. Constable Steadman had been sent to Palm Island \nonly a couple of days before Mulrunji\u2019s death. Nevertheless, he was present at many critical events, including \nchecking on Mulrunji in the cell. In the watchhouse cell video which is in evidence, Constable Steadman is the \nperson in plain clothes, as he was off duty at this time. He was not interviewed by the investigating officers before \nthe CMC took over the investigation on 24 November 2004. Instead, he was interviewed by CMC investigators on 8 \nDecember 2004. The applicants make allegations concerning the failure to interview Constable Steadman in a \ntimely fashion, and I deal with these below.  Whether one speaks of a fall (on SS Hurley\u2019s account), a \u201cscruffing\u201d (on \nPLO Bengaroo\u2019s account) a \u201chit\u201d (on Ms Sibley\u2019s account) or repeated punches (on Mr Bramwell\u2019s account), on any \nview the investigating officers knew it was SS Hurley who was the person with Mulrunji in the events leading up to \nhim being dragged, limp, into the cell and dying there. Despite this, SS Hurley was not suspended from duty on 19 \nor 20 November 2004. He was on duty for the remainder of 19 November and was also on duty on 20 November. \nHe was not asked to stay at home. Nor was he asked to leave the island. On Sunday, 21 November 2004, SS \nHurley had a rostered day off. There is no evidence about what he did during this day. He resumed duty on the \nmorning of Monday, 22 November 2004.  On the Saturday (20 November 2004), the original investigation team left \nthe island: namely, DI Webber, DSS Kitching and Inspector Williams. DI Webber\u2019s explanation was that they had \n\n\n\ncompleted all necessary interviews, apart from that of Penny Sibley, and that there were no other lines of inquiry to \nfollow on the island at that point in time.\n\nPolice conduct in relation to the first autopsy    Sometime in the afternoon of Friday, 19 November 2004, Mulrunji\u2019s \nbody had been taken from the police station to the Palm Island hospital, which is located a short distance away, no \nmore than a few hundred metres. From there, his body was taken off Palm Island for the purpose of an autopsy \nbeing conducted in Cairns. The autopsy occurred on Tuesday, 23 November 2004. A second autopsy was \nconducted on 30 November 2004, and thereafter Mulrunji\u2019s body was returned to Palm Island. He was buried on \nPalm Island on 11 December 2004. The police logs suggest the State Coroner may have delayed releasing \nMulrunji\u2019s body back to his family pending \u201cadvice\u201d in relation to the second autopsy. What this \u201cadvice\u201d might have \nbeen is not revealed on the evidence.  In order for an autopsy to be conducted, the police officers on Palm Island \nhad to first complete what is known as a \u201cForm 1\u201d certificate for the pathologist who was to conduct the autopsy. In \nNovember 2004, this form was required pursuant to s 7(3) of the Coroners Act 2003 (Qld) and constituted formal \nnotification to a coroner of a \u201creportable death\u201d, which included deaths in custody. The Form 1 was also required \nunder s 8.4.8 of the OPM. The version of the form that is relevant to this case was entitled \u201cPolice Notification of \nDeath to Coroner\u201d and was published in the Queensland Gazette on 21 November 2003 pursuant to theCoroners \nAct. The applicants\u2019 case included allegations that critical information from two Aboriginal witnesses (Mr Bramwell \nand Ms Sibley) was left out of the Form 1 by DSS Kitching. They also alleged that unsubstantiated information, \nadverse to Mulrunji, was given to the coroner. I deal with these matters below.  DSS Kitching prepared a Form 1 on \nthe night of Friday, 19 November 2004 at approximately 8.58 pm, and forwarded it to DI Webber that night. DI \nWebber examined the Form 1 on the same evening and did not make any amendments to it, nor did he instruct \nDSS Kitching to forward the Form 1 to any person. The Form 1 was not sent to the State Coroner, the Government \nPathologist, the State Coroner\u2019s Police Support Unit or the local coroner on 19 November 2004. Indeed, it was not \nsent until Monday, 22 November 2004. On the morning of 22 November 2004, the Form 1 was emailed to the State \nCoroner at 7.43 am and then also sent by facsimile to the State Coroner at 10.40 am. The Form 1 remained as it \nhad been filled out by DSS Kitching on the evening of 19 November 2004, despite further information coming to \nlight during the interviews over the weekend.  Under the heading \u201cSummary of Incident\u201d on the Form 1, DSS \nKitching wrote:The deceased was arrested by Senior Sergeant HURLEY of Palm Island Police at approximately \n10.15am on the morning of the 19th November 2004 in Dee Street Palm Island for an offence of Breaching of the \npeace. At that time the decease [sic] was aggressive and was restrained and placed in the rear of a caged police \nvehicle. The deceased was then transported to the Palm Island Police Station where he again became aggressive \nwhen police attmepted [sic] to remove him from the rear of the police vehicle. At that time the deceased is alleged \nto have assaulted Senior Sergeant HURLEY. The deceased was then physically restrained and placed in Cell 2 of \nthe Palm Island Police Watchhouse and charged at 10.26am. At that time the deceased laid on the floor of the cell \nand went to sleep immediately. A physical inspection was conducted of the deceased at 10.55am and he was \nasleep and breathing at that time. A further physical inspection of the deceased was conducted at 11.23 am. At that \ntime police could not see the deceased breathing and could find no pulse. Queensland Ambulance Service was \ncontacted immediately and attended the Palm Island Watchhouse and resusicitation [sic] was not possible.  Any \nperson familiar with the information available at the time the Form 1 was sent on Monday, 22 November 2004 would \nbe able to see this account is inaccurate and incomplete in several key respects.  Both DI Webber and DSS \nKitching had watched the cell video on 19 November 2004 before interviewing SS Hurley, although the entire video \nup to the point that Mulrunji is discovered not to be breathing goes for 44 minutes and it is unclear on the evidence \nwhether either or both of them watched all of it at this stage, or subsequently. It is also not clear whether they \nwatched it together or separately. There are some discrepancies in specified times as between the cell video and \nthe Form 1, but these appear explicable at least in part by the technical issues with the time stamp on the video. It \nappears the check of Mulrunji occurred closer to 10.45 am than 10.55 am; and that Mulrunji was found not to be \nbreathing by Sergeant Leafe at just after 11.15 am, rather than 11.23 am. Nothing turns on these discrepancies. \nThe key timing fact for the purposes of the investigation was that there is only just under an hour between when \nMulrunji was dragged into the cell by SS Hurley and Sergeant Leafe, and when he was found by Sergeant Leafe \nnot to be breathing.  More critically, and contrary to the impression created by the Form 1, the cell video shows \nclearly that Mulrunji was not asleep during the period before he was found dead. What the cell video shows is \nMulrunji rolling slowly from side to side, and moving his limbs from time to time, while lying down. He calls out from \nthe start of the tape at 10:18:52 (by the time stamp on the video). There is a brief check at 10:30:35 by SS Hurley, it \n\n\n\nwould appear in response to a loud call from Mulrunji at 10:30:00. SS Hurley is only there for a few seconds and \ndoes not bend down. Mulrunji is still while SS Hurley is in the room, but then continues to move after SS Hurley \nleaves.  What is said in the Form 1 is however more consistent with what SS Hurley said in his record of interview. \nIn that interview, he stated that when he checked the prisoners \u201cboth were asleep and both were snoring\u201d. Having \nnow watched the cell video many times, I am unable to see how any objective investigator could have accepted SS \nHurley\u2019s description if the investigator watched (and listened to) the cell video.  The cell video then shows Sergeant \nLeafe checking Mulrunji and Patrick Bramwell at 11:02:53. Sergeant Leafe checks Mulrunji for some time and pats \nhim, apparently trying to wake him up, before leaving at 11:04 and returning briefly a few seconds later. SS Hurley \nthen enters the cell and crouches over Mulrunji for several seconds, apparently checking for signs of life. He leaves, \nbut returns and repeats that process at 11:05:50, staying for more than a minute. At 11:09, Sergeant Leafe and \nConstable Steadman enter the cell again, followed by SS Hurley. By this time it is clear Mulrunji is dead.  The Form \n1 is also inaccurate and incomplete in other key respects. It says nothing about PLO Bengaroo\u2019s statement that SS \nHurley fell on Mulrunji when the two men entered the police station. It says nothing about Mulrunji being dragged \nlimp and a \u201cdead weight\u201d (according to Sergeant Leafe) into the watchhouse cell, after having been vigorously \nstruggling from the point at which he was taken out of the police van and brought inside until the point at which he \nended up on the floor of the police station. It says nothing about Mr Roy Bramwell\u2019s allegations, nor those of Ms \nSibley. It suggests Mulrunji laid himself down on the floor of the cell, which is patently wrong. As I have said above, \nit suggests Mulrunji \u201cwent to sleep\u201d in the cell, when it is clear from the cell video that he was rolling and moving \naround, making audible noises.  Under the heading \u201cPr233;cis of Statements\u201d DSS Kitching wrote in the Form \n1:Senior Sergeant Christopher James HURLEY has been interviewed by Detective Senior Sergeant KITCHING of \nthe Townsville CIB. HURLEY stated that he arrested the deceased in Dee Street, Palm Island. At that time the \ndeceased was aggressive and abusive towards police and was physically placed in the rear of a caged police \nvehicle. HURLEY states that upon arrival at the police station he opened the door on the cage of the police vehicle \nand at that time the deceased became aggressive and punched HURLEY in the side of the face. HURLEY then \nphysically restrained the deceased and struggled with him to the rear door of the police station where they both fell \nto the ground. Another police officer Sergeant Michael LEAFE then assisted Senior Sergeant HURLEY place [sic] \nthe deceased into the watchhouse cell by dragging him with both arms. He was charged at 10.26am. HURLEY then \nconducted a physical inspection of the deceased at 10.55am and he was asleep and breathing. A further inspection \nwas conducted by Sergeant LEAFE at 11.23am and the deceased was not breathing and had no pulse. HURLEY \nstates that QAS attended the watchhouse and resusicitation [sic] was not possible. Dr IBE of the Palm Island \nHospital later attended the watchhouse and pronounced life extinct. HURLEY noticed a small abrasion to the right \neye of the deceasedafter [sic] he was found to be deceased. This injury was brought to the attention of HURLEY by \nthe QAS. This was the only injury identified on the deceased.  It can be seen that this summary is more consistent \nwith the account given by SS Hurley to DSS Kitching. It does mention the fall. Somewhat extraordinarily, it records \nMulrunji being \u201ccharged\u201d after he was dragged into the cell, in a condition the parties agreed could be described as \n\u201climp and unresponsive\u201d. However, again, there is no reference to the statements of Mr Roy Bramwell and Ms \nSibley. There is also no reference at all in the original Form 1 to how Mulrunji appeared in the cell video, which I \nhave described at [286] above.  Thus, for the purposes of the chronology, the steps necessary for the autopsy to be \nundertaken and a report given by the coroner did not occur until Monday, 22 November 2004. Further, although \nthere were provisions in the OPM requiring a Supplementary Form 1 to be filled in and sent to the coroner where \nnew or different information arose after the completion of the original Form 1, no such form was prepared or \nsubmitted by the investigating officers.\n\nPolice conduct and interactions with the Palm Island community between 22 and 25 November 2004  \n\nEvents of Monday, 22 November 2004  SS Hurley returned to duty on the morning of 22 November 2004. By this \nstage Inspector Williams, DI Webber and DSS Kitching had left the island (having left on the Saturday), apparently \ncontent for SS Hurley to remain on the island, in charge and on duty. At some point shortly after mid-morning, a \ncommunity meeting was held in the mall area not far from the police station. During this meeting, local people were \ncalling for SS Hurley to be held accountable for what had happened and asking why he had not been arrested.  \nSubsequently, there was an exchange of words between SS Hurley and Lex Wotton in Police Lane, at the rear of \nthe police station near where Mulrunji had been brought in the police van. SS Hurley was driving a police van with \nDS Robinson next to him. PLO Bengaroo, and another uniformed officer were in the back. A Palm Island resident, \n\n\n\nTony Palmer, was in the locked part of the van. Mr Palmer yelled \u201cGet me out of here. Otherwise I\u2019m going to be the \nnext one\u201d, and the considerable crowd of people around the police station, estimated by Mr Wotton to be between \n150 to 200 people, began to get stirred up. They began to call out abuse to the officers. I return to these events in \nmore detail in the Resolution section.  It appears that after this exchange, a decision was taken by the QPS that SS \nHurley should leave the island. It is unsatisfactory that the respondents, who had knowledge of these matters, \nchose to lead no clear evidence about this significant event. SS Whyte could not recall anything much of what \noccurred on that day (he had just arrived on Palm Island), and no other QPS officer who was present was called as \na witness. I deal at [389] with the failure of the respondents to call a number of significant witnesses.  SS Hurley left \nPalm Island on the afternoon of Monday, 22 November 2004. There is no direct evidence in this proceeding \nwhether he was ordered to leave, or left voluntarily. In my opinion, the evidence favours a finding that he was \ndirected to leave: see [1035] below. On that same day, SS Whyte arrived on the island with Inspector Richardson \nand SS Whyte replaced SS Hurley as the Officer in Charge of the police station.  By Monday, 22 November 2004, \ntensions were still high in the Palm Island community. There was no news available about how Mulrunji had died, \nas the autopsy had not yet been conducted. At this time, the Palm Island Council included the Mayor, Ms Erykah \nKyle, the Deputy Mayor, Mr Zacchias Sam, the CEO, Mr Barry Moyle, and Ms Denise Geia, an employee of the \nCouncil who later in the week became acting CEO. The Council were involved in trying to gather and convey \ninformation to the community about the autopsy process and the investigation. They were also attempting to \nprovide representation of the community to the police and to other government agencies, as well as attempting to \nquell tensions within the community. It is clear from the contemporaneous video footage that different views where \nheld within the community about how well the Council performed these roles. On any view however, Mayor Kyle \nwas a constant and highly visible presence in the contemporaneous video footage.  There was a debate between \nthe parties about how much interaction there was between the QPS and the Palm Island Council members, how \nmuch consultation occurred, and how much assistance the QPS sought from the Council. I deal with these matters \nin the Resolution section. Although the QPS had members identified as \u201cCross Cultural Liaison Officers\u201d (CCLOs), it \ndoes not appear that such an officer was sent to Palm Island until SS Dini arrived on 26 November 2004. CCLOs \nhave specific roles, including to improve relations and provide effective liaison between members of the QPS and \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community groups; to identify the needs of those communities; to enable \nappropriate policies and strategies to be developed; and to ensure that the police deliver an equitable service \nwithin the region. This is a different role from the role performed by the QPS Cultural Advisory Unit which was \nbased in Brisbane and reported to and advised the Police Commissioner. That unit had a broader policy role. \nCCLOs were avowedly intended to be used in everyday policing situations, and to provide assistance in that \ncontext.  SS Dini was a CCLO based in Townsville, who was familiar with Palm Island. He was on holidays at the \ntime of the death of Mulrunji and did not return to work until 26 November 2004. There was no acting CCLO while \nhe was away. On the morning of his return to work, he was sent to Palm Island. I return to the role he played in the \nResolution section.  At 2.30 pm on 22 November 2004, a second public meeting occurred in the mall area next to \nthe Palm Island Council Chambers. Estimates in the evidence of how many people were at that meeting varied, but \nI accept Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence that it was in the region of 150 people. DS Robinson, Inspector Richardson and SS \nWhyte also attended the meeting. During the meeting, some community members expressed their dissatisfaction to \nInspector Richardson, SS Whyte and DS Robinson about Mulrunji\u2019s death. It seems that little, if any, information \nabout progress in the investigation was passed to the community at the meeting, nor was any information passed \non about the progress of the autopsy. From the footage it appears community members believed SS Hurley was \nstill the Officer in Charge of Palm Island Police Station, and still on the island. Perhaps for that reason, the \nevidence shows that Inspector Richardson addressed the meeting and told the community SS Hurley was no \nlonger the officer in charge of policing on Palm Island and that he and SS Whyte were now the officers in charge. \nMr Wotton made demands at this meeting that SS Hurley should be arrested and in custody. I return to what was \nsaid in the meeting in more detail in the Resolution section of these reasons.  There were incidents demonstrating \nthat tensions remained, at least in relation to some Palm Island residents. For example, the police running log \nrecords that, during the Monday night and the following night, rocks were thrown at police vehicles and at the \npolice station, causing damage to the vehicles that included a broken windscreen and a dented door.  It appears \nthat sometime after the community meeting on the Monday afternoon, police reinforcements were flown to the \nisland, increasing the police numbers on the island from seven officers on 19 November 2004 to 20 officers on 22 \nNovember 2004. That is, more than one police officer for every 100 residents, if one includes the elderly and \nchildren.\n\n\n\nEvents of Tuesday, 23 November 2004  The next day (23 November 2004) there was another meeting in the mall, \nat approximately 10.30 am. SS Whyte did not attend this meeting, but sent a Senior Sergeant Bennett to observe it. \nApproximately 150 Palm Island community members were present at the meeting. From the video footage it \nappears many were deliberately there for the meeting, but many were also there because they were at the island \nshop, or passing through and stopped to listen. The evidence shows that Mr Wotton spoke at this meeting, as did \nMr Roy Bramwell. Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence (which I accept) was that he and Mr Bulsey picked up Mr Bramwell and \ntook him to the meeting. They explained to Mr Bramwell that the meeting was an opportunity to inform the \ncommunity about what Mr Bramwell said he saw, because there were rumours in the community. Mr Wotton said \nthis was \u201can opportunity for Roy to say things\u201d. Mr Bramwell did speak to the assembled crowd, as did Mayor Kyle.  \nWhen he spoke to the meeting, Mr Bramwell gave an account of what he had seen in the police station on Friday, \n19 November 2004. It was a relatively matter of fact account that reflected what he had told the police on 20 \nNovember 2004, including that SS Hurley struck Mulrunji several times while Mulrunji was on the ground while \nsaying words to the effect of \u201cDo you want more, Mr Doomadgee? Have you had enough?\u201d. Towards the end of the \nmeeting, Mr Wotton spoke about his understanding of what was in the report of the RIADIC. In the video footage, \nthere is a visible level of agitation, concern and anxiety apparent in many of the community members, including \nthose who spoke, but there is no sign of violence or unrest beyond this.  At approximately 2.30 pm on 23 November \n2004, DS Robinson received a report from a person described in the evidence as a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d that \ncertain persons were going to fire bomb the police station and barracks. DS Robinson subsequently spoke with a \ncouple of residents of the island, Dwayne Blanket and Frank Conway, about these threats. The police log records \nthat they told DS Robinson they had no intention to fire bomb the police station or the barracks. However, there \nwas clearly some heightened concern amongst QPS officers and, approximately an hour after the information was \nreported to DS Robinson, A/AC Wall directed that police officers on Palm Island take their weapons to their \nsleeping quarters with them. How many officers complied with this direction was, again, not the subject of any \nevidence. Later that afternoon, police officers arranged for units of the rural fire brigade to be on standby to attend \nthe police station compound if required. SS Whyte drew up a fire evacuation plan for the police station.  Also on \n23 November 2004, and apparently before the meeting at 10.30 am, Inspector Richardson gave what I consider to \nbe an ill-judged and somewhat inflammatory media interview which was dismissive of the concerns of Palm Island \nresidents, despite those concerns being in my opinion both understandable and justified. In his comments, \nInspector Richardson engaged in the kind of stereotyping of Palm Islanders, and Aboriginal communities, which I \nfind was a consistent feature of the attitudes of QPS officers during these events on Palm Island. The video of the \nmedia interview was in evidence before me. The relevant part of what Inspector Richardson said was as follows:On \nFriday, the investigation team, as I said, have arrived here and conducted the investigation through to Saturday, \nand I understand the island was very quiet, the people were, there wasn\u2019t any real concerns at that time. All of a \nsudden, yesterday, there was concerns raised in relation to his death. A lot of questions are being asked. From \nwhat I can make of it a lot of the questions they\u2019re asking are based on rumours. They\u2019re not factual. It\u2019s what \npeople are saying. We had a meeting with them yesterday \u2013 a public meeting yesterday and I explained to the \npeople that they need to sit back and wait and let us put the investigation together, to tie it together, wait for the \npost-mortem to take place and then let\u2019s see what happens from there. Then they can ask their questions once they \nget all the facts. \n\n ...\n\n These community problems frequently arise when there\u2019s been a death in custody. The Aboriginal communities, \nthe people in there tend to, they are emotional about the deaths of course \u2013 especially when there\u2019s police involved \n\u2013 and quite often they become very personal against the officers. There\u2019s attacks made and allegations made. The \nmajority of it is unfounded but it\u2019s developed through rumours which are spreading throughout the community.\n\n ... \n\n The investigations at this stage have shown no improper police practice. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see now what \nhappens with the post-mortem, which is being conducted in Cairns today.\n\n\n\n ...\n\n Yes, we did [bring reinforcements to the island] yesterday as a result of, I think there was about 200 to 300 people \noutside the Police Station here demanding a meeting and asking questions with the officer in charge at the time, it \nhad become very uncomfortable here on the island and, when you take into consideration the history of the island, \nwe have to take all measures to ensure everyone is safe.  What Inspector Richardson meant by \u201cwhen you take into \nconsideration the history of the island\u201d was not explained in the evidence. On any view, it characterised all Palm \nIslanders, as a group, in a negative way. There were, on the evidence, no measures taken to ensure Palm \nIslanders were safe.  At 1 pm on Tuesday, 23 November 2004, an autopsy of Mulrunji\u2019s body was conducted by \npathologist Dr Guy Lampe in Cairns. DSS Kitching attended the autopsy. At some point during the conduct of the \nautopsy DSS Kitching told Dr Lampe that Mulrunji may have been sniffing petrol or drinking bleach prior to his \narrest by SS Hurley. In oral evidence, Inspector Kitching claimed he received this information from DS Robinson. \nHe was not able adequately to explain why he passed on this information, which he characterised as \u201cunconfirmed \nstories\u201d, to the coroner but did not pass on the allegations made by Ms Sibley and Mr Bramwell.\n\nEvents of Wednesday, 24 November 2004  During the autopsy on 23 November 2004, Dr Lampe told DSS Kitching \nthat the cause of death was intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to ruptured liver and portal vein. In his \u201cPreliminary \nAutopsy Report\u201d dated 24 November 2004, Dr Lampe found that Mulrunji\u2019s death was \u201cas a result of haemorrhage \ninto his abdominal cavity\u201d, which occurred \u201csecondary to a rupture of the liver (which virtually cleaved the liver in \ntwo), as well as from a hole in the portal vein\u201d. Dr Lampe further found that the degree of liver rupture and injury to \nsoft tissues was \u201cindicative of a moderate to severe compressive force applied to the upper abdomen\u201d and that \n\u201cthere is nothing to suggest that this man has drunk any bleach or other caustic substance\u201d. During the autopsy, Dr \nLampe had made it clear to DSS Kitching that Mulrunji\u2019s death was not from natural causes and that, in addition to \nthe intra-abdominal haemorrhage due to ruptured liver and portal vein, Mulrunji had four broken ribs.  Although this \nwas not an agreed fact, DI Webber accepted in cross-examination that on Wednesday, 24 November 2004, Dr \nLampe informed him that the State Coroner, Michael Barnes, had requested the word \u201cfall\u201d be removed from \nMulrunji\u2019s autopsy certificate so that it did not appear that the pathologist was assisting the police in a \u201ccover-up\u201d.  \nNotwithstanding this comment, and despite the completion of the autopsy on 23 November 2004 with DSS Kitching \nin attendance, it seems that on 24 November 2004, neither Inspector Richardson nor SS Whyte were informed \nabout the injuries Mulrunji had sustained prior to his death whilst in police custody, nor were they informed of the \ncause of death, including the fact that Mulrunji\u2019s liver had been ruptured. Nor were they told of the fact that Mulrunji \nhad sustained four broken ribs whilst in QPS custody. In his evidence DI Webber said that DSS Kitching had \ntelephoned him on the afternoon of Tuesday, 23 November 2004 and outlined the findings of the autopsy. He also \nstated that he informed the Assistant Commissioner immediately afterwards, whom he understood then made a \nnumber of telephone calls to other officers. DI Webber agreed that, during the telephone call with DSS Kitching, it \nbecame clear that Mulrunji had not died from natural causes. He agreed that DSS Kitching had informed him that \nMulrunji had died as a result of haemorrhaging in his abdominal cavity that was secondary to a rupture of the liver. \nHe also agreed that DSS Kitching told him about the four broken ribs. By this time, DI Webber had not been on \nPalm Island for several days, having considered the investigation on the island complete by Saturday, 20 \nNovember 2004.  There continued to be unrest on the island. Although the QPS had the autopsy results by the \nafternoon of 23 November 2004, no-one had communicated those results to Mulrunji\u2019s family, nor to the Palm \nIsland community. The police log records that, on the evening of 24 November 2004, rocks and bricks were thrown \nat the police station and the adjacent police barracks. The log records that the windows of the barracks were \nsmashed by a \u201clarge gathering\u201d of persons outside and that \u201c991 [a police car] moved to intercept [but was] forced \nback by [the] mob\u201d. However, the log also records that there was \u201cNil damage to vehicles or injuries to officers at \nthis time\u201d.  The State Coroner\u2019s office gave the preliminary autopsy report dated 24 November 2004 to the CMC, \nwhich had, on that date, assumed responsibility for the investigation. It is unclear, on the evidence before this Court, \nhow the report was transmitted, to whom, and when. That the CMC had taken over the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath appears to have occurred as a result of a request from the QPS. However, what that request was, who made \nit, and how the decision was made for the CMC to take over the investigation were also not the subject of evidence \nbefore me. Inspector Ken Bemi from the CMC formally took over responsibility for the conduct of the investigation, \n\n\n\nassisted by Inspector Williams from the Ethical Standards Command. It will be recalled that Inspector Williams had \nbeen on Palm Island over the weekend, conducting interviews with the QPS, in his capacity as the officer \nrepresenting the Internal Investigation Branch, Ethical Standards Command for the purposes of s 1.17 of the OPM.\n\nEvents of Thursday, 25 November 2004  On Thursday, 25 November 2004, in the early evening near 6 pm, SS \nWhyte spoke to Ms Denise Geia, who was by then the acting CEO of the Palm Island Council. Ms Geia told SS \nWhyte that Mayor Kyle was inside the Palm Island Council Chambers with members of Mulrunji\u2019s family, speaking \nwith the family about the autopsy report. It would seem that by this time, the Mayor and the family had some \ninformation about the autopsy report, but what they had and how they received it is not revealed by the evidence. \nThe only evidence I have been able to find is what was said by Mayor Kyle at the public meeting the following day \n(Friday, 26 November 2004), where she spoke of a phone call to the State Coroner regarding what information \ncould be released to the community.  After speaking with Ms Geia, SS Whyte reported to Inspector Richardson the \ninformation Ms Geia had provided to him. It appears from the evidence that SS Whyte understood that there was \n\u201cargument about whether the full or partial results of the autopsy (were to be) released in the public meeting on the \nFriday\u201d. It does not appear that either Inspector Richardson or SS Whyte took any steps to inform themselves about \nwhat the autopsy report said.  Shortly after this, A/AC Wall called Inspector Richardson and told him that the results \nof the autopsy upon Mulrunji had either been delivered to the family of Mulrunji or were about to be delivered to the \nfamily. This led Inspector Richardson to warn the QPS members on the island to \u201cbe on your toes and be on the \nlook out, you know things could turn a bit hostile\u201d.  Notwithstanding these events, the evidence does not suggest \nanything untoward occurred on the evening of 25 November 2004.\n\nThe protests and fires on 26 November 2004    The next morning, on 26 November 2004, another community \nmeeting was held in the mall area. At approximately 12.30 pm Mayor Kyle spoke to the people there, who \nnumbered approximately 150 to 200. There is video footage in evidence of Mayor Kyle speaking to the assembled \ncommunity members. Mayor Kyle said that the report revealed that there had been \u201can accident somewhere around \nthe cell\u201d and that Mulrunji had sustained injuries from a \u201cfall\u201d. She also told the crowd that the doctor explained that \nthere was a compressive force on Mulrunji\u2019s body where four ribs were broken and that caused a rupture to his \nliver, which caused heavy internal bleeding. However, what she said omitted several important elements of the \npreliminary autopsy report, including that the pathologist also said SS Hurley\u2019s added weight might provide \u201ca \nsatisfactory explanation\u201d for the injuries Mulrunji sustained if SS Hurley had fallen on top of him, and that while there \nwas no evidence to suggest the use of direct force it also could not be excluded. Mayor Kyle\u2019s comments may also \nhave conveyed the impression that the conclusions in the report were final and that no further inquiries would be \nmade by either the State Coroner or the QPS. I return below to why Mayor Kyle\u2019s comments may not have \nconveyed a correct impression of the autopsy results to those listening.  The video footage shows the distress \nMayor Kyle felt at what she was conveying and the distress in those listening can also be heard. People made \ncomments about SS Hurley\u2019s responsibility for Mulrunji\u2019s death. There is no evidence that any police officer or \nother official representative attended or addressed the crowd during the meeting. Inspector Whyte\u2019s evidence was \nthat he thought even his attendance \u201cmay have incited problems because if they wanted us at the meeting they \nwould have invited us to the meeting\u201d.  After Mayor Kyle finished speaking, a series of other individuals spoke, \nincluding David Bulsey and Mr Wotton. They, and others in the crowd, expressed disbelief that Mulrunji could have \ndied from a fall and anger at the police for failing to arrest SS Hurley. I describe what was said more fully at [774] \nbelow. Not long after the meeting, just outside the police station, SS Whyte encountered Mr Wotton, who was with \nsome other local people. They had a heated and somewhat aggressive conversation, the details of which were \ncontested and about which I make findings below.  At approximately 1 pm, the crowd\u2019s unrest increased and a \nnumber of people moved from the mall area to the police station, including Mr Wotton. Rocks were thrown at the \npolice station; the courthouse, the police station and the police residence of SS Hurley were set on fire; a police \nvehicle was set on fire; and some members of the community yelled threats and obscenities.  The police left the \npolice station and went to the police barracks across Police Lane. As locals saw the police moving, a crowd of \nlocals followed the police to the barracks, a distance of approximately 50 metres, and still close to the mall. The \ndistances between these places, it must be recalled, are quite small.  As the crowd arrived at the barracks, SS \nWhyte, who was outside the barracks (but behind the fenced area fronting onto Mango Avenue) called out to speak \nto Mr Wotton. Mr Wotton told him the community had heard the results of the autopsy report and wanted the police \nto leave the island within an hour and that he would escort the police so that they were not harmed. There is a \n\n\n\ndispute on the evidence of the two men about who said what, and about the outcome of the conversation. I deal \nwith this below. What was not contested by Inspector Whyte was that, at some time after their conversation, Mr \nWotton told the crowd to stop throwing rocks, and the crowd dispersed soon after.  After the crowd dispersed, the \npolice then moved, as a group, from the barracks to the hospital. The evidence suggests this was done in the belief \nthere would be greater safety for the officers at the hospital. Some video footage of the officers moving along \nMango Avenue is in evidence. There are few if any local people visible, and not much noise can be heard. \nHowever, at this stage, the police station and SS Hurley\u2019s home were still burning. The evidence suggests the fire \nbrigade arrived at approximately 1.34 pm, approximately 43 minutes before the police left the barracks for the \nhospital at 2.21 pm. The fire brigade officers do not appear to have had any difficulty moving through the groups of \nlocal people to put out the fires.  Once at the hospital, the police lined up outside the front of the hospital, facing \nthe sea. There is video footage of this event in evidence. There was a line of approximately 20 police officers, \nmostly in uniform. One officer had a large police dog, which was barking at the crowd. Several officers had firearms \nin their holsters. The crowd of locals gathered in front of the hospital may have numbered 100. They were seated or \nstanding in small groups at various points in front of the hospital. There were a number of older people, women and \nchildren present. A few people were calling out. No local people appear to be carrying anything, despite DI \nWebber\u2019s evidence that he saw locals carrying sticks and spears. Inspector Whyte\u2019s evidence was that he did not \nsee anyone carrying sticks or spears. Again, the evidence is somewhat sparse regarding how this situation was \nresolved, but it appears that after some discussions which seemed to have involved, at least, Mayor Kyle, Mr \nWotton and several officers, the local people simply dispersed and went about their business at some point after 3 \npm. It thus appears the \u2018standoff\u2019 outside the hospital may have lasted an hour or so.  On the evidence, the whole \nsequence of events \u2013 from the announcement by Mayor Kyle of the autopsy results, to the confrontation at the \npolice compound, to the fires, to the arrival of the fire brigade (who then had the fire promptly under control), to \nthe police lining up outside the hospital \u2013 took place over the course of approximately three hours.  The police \nstation and SS Hurley\u2019s house were destroyed in the fire.\n\nThe emergency declaration and the arrival of police reinforcements, including SERT and PSRT    Exactly how and \nwhen the QPS on the mainland were informed about the events on the island was not the subject of much \nevidence. However, it is clear from a combination of the police logs and DI Webber\u2019s evidence that A/AC Wall \nadvised DI Webber of the fires and the general situation on the island more or less as those events occurred. At \nthat point, A/AC Wall and DI Webber were both at the Mundingburra Police Station in Townsville. DI Webber then \nmade a number of telephone calls to arrange for officers to go to Townsville Airport in order to fly to Palm Island. \nHaving done so, DI Webber went to the airport himself in order to fly to the island with the other officers.  While he \nwas at the airport, and at approximately 1.45 pm, DI Webber made a declaration of an emergency situation under s \n5(1) of the PSP Act (\u2018the emergency declaration\u2019). The effects of such a declaration were, in summary, to enable \nthe use by police (and special police operations teams such as SERT) of a variety of coercive powers, and powers \nof entry, search and seizure, which otherwise would not be available to them without warrant. Those powers were \npurportedly exercised throughout Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday morning. It was common ground that no \n\u2018Certificate relating to the Declaration of an Emergency Situation\u2019 under s 5(2) of the PSP Act was issued or caused \nto be issued on 26 November 2004. Rather, the evidence is that the Emergency Declaration Certificate was not \ncompleted by DI Webber until two days\u2019 later, at around 8.50 am on Sunday, 28 November 2004.  DI Webber \nrevoked the emergency declaration at 8.10 am on Sunday, 28 November 2004. Thus, the Emergency Declaration \nCertificate was completed more or less contemporaneously with the revocation by DI Webber of the emergency \ndeclaration. A certificate concerning the revocation (and noting the time of revocation as 8.10 am) was faxed to the \nQPS in Townsville at approximately 9.15 am on 28 November 2004.  No attempt was made by QPS officers to \ninform the local community on Palm Island about the making of the emergency declaration on 26 November 2004. \nNor is there any evidence the community was informed when it was revoked.  Whether because of the emergency \ndeclaration, or because of the events that occurred on the afternoon of 26 November 2004 (including the burning \ndown of the police station and SS Hurley\u2019s house), or both, a large contingent of police officers was despatched \nfrom Townsville to Palm Island. This included, during the afternoon and evening of 26 November 2004: 11 QPS \nofficers and one police dog at approximately 2.15 pm via Police Airwing; four QPS officers at approximately 3 pm \nvia an unknown aircraft; one QPS officer at approximately 3.20 pm via Queensland Emergency Services helicopter; \n13 QPS officers and one police dog at approximately 3.37 pm via an unknown aircraft; six QPS officers at \napproximately 4 pm via an unknown aircraft; 10 QPS officers at approximately 4.40 pm via Police Airwing; one \n\n\n\nQPS officer between 5.30 pm and 6 pm via Queensland Emergency Services helicopter; and approximately seven \nQPS officers at unknown times via unknown aircraft. The next day (Saturday, 27 November 2004) another seven \nofficers arrived during the morning by Police Airwing. It was an agreed fact that over the course of the period \ncovered by the emergency declaration there were between approximately 59 and 82 QPS officers (non-SERT or \nPSRT) on Palm Island.  The situation on Friday, 26 November 2004, and the emergency declaration, also resulted \nin a decision to send specialist police officers to Palm Island. These officers were drawn from two specialist teams \nwithin the QPS: SERT and PSRT. The role of SERT, as set out in s 2.26 of the OPM, was to operate as a specialist \nsupport unit, established to provide the QPS with the ability to respond to terrorist incidents across Queensland, \nwhose primary functions were: to respond to terrorist incidents within the arrangements agreed to under the State \nAntiterrorist Plan; to provide specialist police capability to resolve high risk situations and incidents that were \npotentially violent and exceeded normal capabilities of the QPS; to provide assistance to all officers of the QPS with \nlow risk tasks which required specialist equipment, skills or tactics; and to provide a rescue function in incidents \nwhich required specialised recovery techniques. The role of PSRT, as set out in 2.24 of the OPM, was to provide a \nunit of specially trained, centralised QPS officers who were equipped to respond in the interest of public safety to \ninstances of confrontation, violence and other specialist duties which exceeded normal police capabilities.  It is not \nentirely clear from the evidence when the SERT and PSRT officers arrived on Palm Island, nor who decided they \nshould be sent and why. There was an unsatisfactory gap in the evidence on these issues. Inspector McKay\u2019s \nevidence was that SERT could be deployed \u201cverbally in an urgent-response capability\u201d. He described his \nunderstanding of how that verbal communication occurs through the QPS chain of command but his evidence was \nnot specific to the deployment of SERT and PSRT to Palm Island. When asked whether he had any role in \norganising the attendance on Palm Island of SERT or PSRT officers, DI Webber answered:Well, when I declared \nthe emergency situation to exist, I suppose that initiated an activation plan for them - for them to actually attend to \nassist other officers. At the actual determination of what involvement \u2013 I suppose \u2013 they have, it has to be \u2013 I \nsuppose \u2013 agreed to by one of the deputy commissioners.  DI Webber confirmed that he had signed a written \nrequest for SERT assistance, but that he had done so after he returned from Palm Island on the afternoon of \nMonday, 29 November 2004, not on 26 November 2004 when it appears the decision to deploy SERT was made. \nThe written request was in evidence and is titled \u201cSpecial Emergency Response Team Request for Assistance \nForm (Section 2.26 of the Operational Procedures Manual)\u201d. Despite DI Webber\u2019s evidence that it was not filled out \nuntil 29 November 2004, the form is dated 26 November 2004 and states that DI Webber was the officer making the \nrequest. In it, DI Webber outlined the situation on Palm Island as follows:1. Outline Situation or Incident:\n\n At approximately 12 midday on Friday the 26th of November 2004 a large crowd of approximately 200 people \ngathered in the Mall area on Palm Island to discuss the findings of the post mortem report into the death of in \ncustody [sic] of Cameron DOOMADGEE. After the results were publicised a male person using a public address \nsystem addressed the crowd, and in an emotionally charged speech accused the Police of \u2018cold blooded murder.\u201d \nThis male person went on and said, \u201cThey\u2019re inciting a riot them cops. They\u2019re inciting. The want it to happen \n....Why should he get away with fucking murder and walk around free. If you don\u2019t stand up, it\u2019ll happen again, \nmaybe to one of your children. It\u2019s cold blooded murder and this man is still free.\u201d The crowd responded with \napplause and clapping after this person had finished.\n\n At the conclusion of this address, the large crowd moved to the Palm Island Police Station. Emotions remained \nstrained at the Police Station with people calling to kill police and burn the station. The crowd then reputed \n[\u201cerupted\u201d] into a violent frenzy that saw the Police Station being pelted with rocks, bricks and other objects, police \nbeing threatened and damaged [sic] caused.\n\n As the situation escalated, Police Officers were in grave fear of their safety and were present in the police station \nwhen it was being doused with petrol and set alight. Police officers have then fled and came under further rock \nthrowing attacks prior to barricading themselves in the Police barracks. They were again targeted [by] a large \ncrowd who continued to throw rocks and other objects at them as the crowd attempted to gain access into the \n\n\n\nbarrack compound. Another Police residence was then set alight and was totally destroyed by fire. The remaining \npolice residences were then looted by the crowd and property was destroyed and stolen.\n\n Police later sought refuge in the local hospital until re-enforcements from Townsville arrived. The crowd then \nfollowed police to the hospital and again confronted them and demanded officers leave the Island. Upon the arrival \nof re-enforcements the crowd dispersed and left the area.\n\n An Emergency Situation was declared at 1345hrs on 26/11/04 for the entire Palm Island.\n\n Urgent assistance from S.E.R.T. members is required to provide protection for policing operations on the island. \nAssistance is likely to be required for some time until normal policing operations can be restored.\n\n Persons on the island are capable of using lethal force including rocks, molotov cocktails and have access to other \nweapons including knives, machetes, spears and possibly stolen police firearms. A number of armed offenders will \nneed to be apprehended as part of the investigations into the civil disorder. These offenders will pose a serious \nthreat to police officers and good order on the island.\n\n 2. Who or what is the subject of the request?\n\n 2.1 Offender/Suspect(s) details:\n\n The subject of the request is to assist conventionally equipped police officers to maintain a policing presence on \nPalm Island and the secure the safety of all Palm Island residents. Assistance is also sought to search for and \napprehend persons who took part in the riot and arson of Police property. These persons may be armed with \nweapons and pose a serious threat to the life and safety of police members.\n\n The identity of individual offenders will be provided on an ongoing basis for operational planning.\n\n 2.2 Other possible occupants and their relevant criminal histories? (including women and children.):\n\n Actions by SERT and other members will be assessed on an individual basis subject to individual collection plans.\n\n 2.3 Particulars of Vehicles used:\n\n N/A\n\n 2.4 Particulars of weapons the offender may be in possession of or have access to:\n\n It is suspected a QPS Mini-14 rifle may have been looted from the Police Barracks prior to it being burnt down. \nOffenders have shown a propensity to use rocks, molotov cocktails and iron bars as weapons. Offenders have \nready access to other weapons including knives, machetes, and spears.\n\n 3. SERT is requested to:\n\n\n\n X Provide a specialist police capability to resolve a high risk situation which is potentially violent and exceed \nnormal police capabilities; (i.e. defeat fortification, detain armed high risk offenders).\n\n ...\n\n MISSION\n\n 4. SERT is requested to:\n\n SERT to travel to Palm Island and undertake the following tasks:\n\n a) To provide security to police members on Palm Island and regain control of public order on the Island.\n\n b) To assist investigators to locate and detain wanted persons and associates by tactical methods.\n\n c) To assist in provision of ongoing policing of Palm Island and to provide security and protection of QPS \nemployees and property on Palm Island.\n\n 5. Legislative Authority\n\n Is there a warrant in existence: Yes - No X Pending -\n\n Warrant type: P.S.P.A. Declaration\n\n ...\n\n 7. Intelligence\n\n The intelligence for this application is accurate as at 1400 on 26/11/2004.\n\n How has the intelligence been verified?\n\n Intelligence will be collected and provided as it becomes available.\n\n ...  In addition to the date of 26 November 2004 given on the front page, the form is signed by DI Webber with a \ntime and date of 2 pm on 26 November 2004 written next to his signature. Beneath DI Webber\u2019s signature is a \nsigned statement from Superintendent Casey of the Specialist Services Branch, Operations Support Command \nrecommending to Chief Superintendent Henderson of Operations Support Command that the request be granted. \nBeneath that recommendation is a second signed statement from CS Henderson to Deputy Commissioner Conder, \nwhich again recommends that the request be granted and states:Members of the BNE + FNR SERT to support \nPSRT in a crowd management role. To have less lethal capabilities i.e. taser, OC spray + bean bag rounds. \nPropensity for violence exhibited - police rifle missing.  Beneath CS Henderson\u2019s recommendation is an \nauthorisation for the deployment of SERT signed by DC Conder. The recommendation from Superintendent Casey \nto CS Henderson, the recommendation from CS Henderson to DC Conder, and DC Conder\u2019s authorisation for the \ndeployment of SERT are each dated 14 December 2004.  In cross-examination, DI Webber accepted that an \n\u201cuninitiated reader\u201d would mistakenly think, based on the dates on the form, that he had requested the deployment \nof SERT in writing on 26 November 2004 when this was not the case. He also gave evidence that he typed the \ndocument himself. He could not recall exactly when he signed it, but when shown a memorandum dated 9 \nDecember 2004 that he wrote recommending that the form be forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner, \n\n\n\nOperations Support Command, he agreed that he must have signed it at some point between 29 November and 9 \nDecember 2004. When asked why he had completed the form quite some time after the events referred to in it, and \nwhy he had backdated the form to 26 November 2004, DI Webber\u2019s evidence was that the form was \u201cfor record \npurposes. It was for filing purposes. It wasn\u2019t an action document\u201d. He also agreed that by the time he completed \nthe form he knew that no armed offenders had been arrested on Palm Island, despite the statement on the form \nthat \u201cA number of armed offenders will need to be apprehended\u201d.  There are a number of inaccuracies in what DI \nWebber wrote on this form, some serious. There is no evidence before the Court of many of the assertions he \nmakes in it, including no evidence from him about those matters. The document contains matters that DI Webber \nclearly did not know on Friday afternoon when a decision was made to deploy SERT to the island.  There is little if \nany evidence to support the proposition that the document completed by DI Webber reflects the process by which \nthe request to deploy SERT was made and the decision to deploy SERT was taken. Indeed it is unclear whether \nthere even was a \u201crequest\u201d or whether one or more QPS officers simply decided SERT would be deployed. The \nevidence of the SERT operatives who were witnesses in the proceeding does not shed any further light on the \nquestion, although they did make clear that they were mobilised to travel to Palm Island on the afternoon or early \nevening of Friday, 26 November 2004. Again, this is an area of evidence about which the respondents appear to \nhave consciously decided to remain silent. The fact that the deployment of SERT is not specifically pleaded as a \ncontravention of s 9 of the RDA is no explanation: SERT\u2019s actions while on Palm Island were the subject of detailed \npleading and I infer that the absence of evidence from the respondents about how SERT came to be on the island \nis the result of a forensic choice.  By the time SERT commenced its operation early on the morning of Saturday, 27 \nNovember 2004, there were 14 SERT officers and seven PSRT officers on Palm Island, and another four from \neach team arrived during the day, making a total of 18 SERT officers and 11 PSRT officers who were sent to Palm \nIsland over the 24-hour period.  Other police actions were also quickly implemented. A police headquarters was \nestablished at the local high school, Bwgcolman Community School. Classrooms were used for various planning \nand interview purposes, and QPS officers also slept in them. Communications to and from Palm Island came \nthrough this headquarters by telephone and fax, although at least initially there was no police computer system in \noperation there.  The local school bus from St Michael\u2019s Catholic Primary School was commandeered for police \nuse. This was the subject of specific allegations by the applicants, to which I return in the Resolution section. On the \nFriday (26 November 2004), despite the emergency declaration, the QPS arranged for a ferry to be available from \nPalm Island to Townsville. Some teachers and service providers on the island left Palm Island on this ferry. There \nwas an issue in this proceeding about who was able to leave the island, and whether only non-Aboriginal people \nwere able to leave, or were informed there was a way they could get off the island if they were fearful for their \nsafety. The QPS also arranged for the evacuation of some patients (including some Indigenous patients) from the \nPalm Island hospital to Townsville by Queensland Emergency Services helicopter. The evacuation of some \npatients can be seen on the video footage in evidence.  Between 1.45 pm on 26 November 2004 and 1.30 pm on \n27 November 2004, all commercial flights to and from Palm Island were suspended. During that period, all persons \non Palm Island were unable to leave the island on commercial flights. In that respect, the arrangements by the \nQPS for the special ferry departure assumed particular significance. It does not appear to have been considered \nwhether there would be Palm Islanders in Townsville who might, on hearing of the situation, have wanted to return \nto their families on Palm Island. In any event, no arrangements were made for them to do so and, as I have noted, \nin fact the opposite occurred and the island was shut down.  Mr Campbell gave evidence that, on the evening of 26 \nNovember 2004, he and DS Robinson \u201cstarted formulating, like, a master list of persons of interest or suspects\u201d in \nrelation to the protests and fires. This led, it appears, on the evening of Friday, 26 November 2004, to the \nformulation of an \u201caction plan\u201d about how those suspected of involvement in the protests and fires would be \nidentified and apprehended. DI Webber was one of the officers responsible for formulating this plan, together with \nInspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel.  The plan was as follows. It does not appear to have been committed \nto writing other than on a whiteboard at the school, where (as I have noted above) the QPS operations were based. \nPhotos of the suspects, their addresses and their names, were put up on the boards. DS Robinson was to identify \nthe addresses \u201cof interest\u201d and provide them to the SERT and PSRT officers; SERT and PSRT officers were to go \nto each address of interest with DS Robinson; DS Robinson was to enter each residence and identify persons of \ninterest; and DS Robinson and the SERT and PSRT officers would apprehend the person or persons of interest \nwith the minimum force necessary, secure the person or persons, and then take them from the residence. The \naction plan noted that, if doors were locked and secured, SERT would use force to gain entry. Other occupants \nwithin the dwellings were not to be disturbed, if possible. The team would then move on to the next address. I note \n\n\n\nthat the evidence of the \u2018plan\u2019 left it unclear as to who would be the arresting officer. The identity of the arresting \nofficer is a matter I deal with in the Resolution section below.  DSS David Miles, a QPS officer stationed in \nTownsville, was responsible for compiling a list of persons to be arrested. A/AC Wall, also in Townsville, approved \nthe list. How closely A/AC Wall was involved in formulating the whole action plan is unclear, and it is unclear \nwhether he \u201capproved\u201d the whole plan.\n\nThe arrests, searches and entries on 27 and 28 November 2004    The arrests, searches and entries began at 5 am \non the morning of 27 November 2004. The evidence showed that SERT teams would usually operate earlier in the \nmorning than 5 am \u2013 often more like 3 am \u2013 in order to optimise the chances of suspects being asleep. The \nevidence was that, because it was clear some or all of the houses would be occupied by other people, including \nwomen and children, it was decided that these entries and searches would start somewhat later in the morning.  In \nany event, at least some of those whose houses were to be entered and searched were expecting to be arrested. \nThat was certainly the case with Mr Wotton. He had told his partner and family the night before that he expected to \nbe arrested on the Saturday, and that the police would come for him. There is no evidence he realised a SERT \nteam would be sent to apprehend him, nor that he anticipated being apprehended in the way he was.  The arrests, \nentries and searches were conducted between approximately 5 am and 8.10 am on 27 November 2004; between \napproximately 12 pm and 12.15 pm on 27 November 2004; between approximately 6.15 pm and 6.35 pm on 27 \nNovember 2004; and periodically during the morning of 28 November 2004.  The following properties were entered \nand searched:(1) The Wotton house, in the Farm area of Palm Island, at around 5 am on 27 November 2004. Mr \nWotton was apprehended there. A/S Kruger tasered Mr Wotton in the course of the arrest.\n\n (2) The Clay house, also in the Farm area, at 5.10 am. The police were looking for Shane Robertson but he was \nnot apprehended there.\n\n (3) The Norman house, also in the Farm area, at 5.15 am. The police were looking for a juvenile offender (whose \nidentity is protected). The juvenile offender was not apprehended but another target, Garrison Sibley, was \napprehended.\n\n (4) The Parker house, also in the Farm area, at 5.25 am. The police were looking for Russell Wayne Parker \n(Russell Parker Senior) and he was apprehended there.\n\n (5) The Bulsey house, at 5.45 am. The police were looking for David Bulsey and he was apprehended there. Mr \nBulsey was not fully clothed when he was apprehended.\n\n (6) The Poynter house, in the Top End area, at 6 am. The police were looking for Lincoln Poynter and Jason \nPoynter, but neither was apprehended there. The evidence does not reveal when Lincoln Poynter was arrested, but \nhe was subsequently charged with and pleaded guilty to rioting.\n\n (7) Berna Poynter\u2019s house, also in the Top End area, at 6.02 am. The police were looking for Jason Poynter, but \nhe was not apprehended there.\n\n (8) The Walsh house, in the Butler Bay area, at 6.05 am. The police were looking for Jason Poynter, but he was \nnot apprehended there.\n\n (9) The Clumpoint house, also in the Butler Bay area, at 6.15 am. The police were looking for John Clumpoint and \nhe was apprehended there.\n\n\n\n (10) The Obah unit, also in the Butler Bay area, at 6.25 am. The police were looking for Jason Poynter, but he was \nnot apprehended there. Mr Poynter was proving somewhat elusive.\n\n (11) The Barry House, in the Top End area, at 6.35 am. The police were looking for Jason Poynter, but he was not \napprehended there. The police apprehended Solomon Nona on an outstanding warrant that was unrelated to the \nevents of 26 November 2004. Mr Nona was not on the QPS list of targets.\n\n (12) Alberta Poynter\u2019s house, also in the Top End area, at 6.40 am. The police were looking for Jason Poynter. \nJason Poynter was not apprehended but another target, Lance Poynter, was apprehended there.\n\n (13) The Sibley house, in the Bottom End area, at 8 am. The police were looking for Shane Robertson and he was \napprehended there.\n\n (14) The Nugent house, in Dee Street, at 12 pm. The police were looking for a Ruger Mini-14 rifle that was \nbelieved to be missing from the police barracks. The rifle was not found at the house, and in fact it was still locked \nin a cupboard in the police barracks, where it was found on or about 8 December 2004.\n\n (15) Agnes Wotton\u2019s house at 6.15 pm. The police were looking for Richard Poynter and he was apprehended \nthere. Mr Poynter was in the shower at the time he was apprehended.\n\n (16) The Blackman/Oui house, in the Butler Bay area, at 6.30 pm. The police were looking for William Blackman \nSenior but he was not apprehended there. Mr Blackman saw the police coming and ran from his house in an \nattempt to lead them away from his family. He escaped, but he subsequently turned himself in later that night at the \nschool, where he was arrested.\n\n (17) The Biara house, in the Cooktown area, at 5.20 am on 28 November 2004 and again at 4.45 am on 29 \nNovember 2004 (although there was very little evidence about the latter). The police were looking for Russell \nEdward Elias Parker (Russell Parker Junior) but he was not apprehended during either search.\n\n (18) The Pearson house, at 5.36 am on 28 November 2004. The police were looking for Russell Parker Junior but \nhe was not apprehended there.  The final operation was conducted at Wallaby Point at 6.20 am on 29 November \n2004. The police were looking for Russell Parker Junior and Robert Nugent and both were apprehended there.  \nThe applicants make a series of allegations about the conduct of the entries and searches, and I make findings on \nthose allegations in the Resolution section. Several matters should be noted here.  First, none of the arrests (with \nthe exception of the arrest of Mr Nona) were made with a warrant. Nor were warrants obtained for the entries and \nsearches of the houses.  Second, the evidence is that the two primary suspects after the protests and fires were \nLex Wotton and Erykah Kyle. Ms Kyle\u2019s name was later removed from the list of wanted persons and she was not \narrested or charged at all in the course of the police operation. There is no explanation in the evidence for why that \noccurred, or what grounded the original suspicion of her as a prime suspect.  Third, one of the targets was a 13-\nyear-old boy. SS McKay\u2019s evidence was that in his career of some 24 years he could not recall ever being sent as a \nSERT team member to apprehend a 13-year-old. I return to this below.  Fourth, women, children, and men who \nwere not suspects were present in many of the homes that were entered and searched. Evidence was given by \nnine of them. There is no doubt those who gave evidence were terrorised and permanently scarred by what \nhappened to them. I accept that similar effects are likely to have been suffered by some who did not give evidence. \n\n\n\nThe disproportionate nature of the police response, and the manner in which the entries and searches were \ninevitably conducted once it had been decided that SERT would be used to conduct them, has had long lasting \nconsequences for many members of the Palm Island community.  Fifth, there is some disputed evidence about \nother conduct engaged in by SERT and, or alternatively, PSRT while on the island, such as marching in groups \ndown residential streets. These matters are contested and I deal with them below.  Finally, the manner in which the \nSERT and PSRT officers were armed and dressed should be noted. It was a key feature of the evidence of group \nmembers who were terrified by the entries and searches. Each SERT officer was wearing a dark blue police \nuniform with a ballistic vest and a load-bearing over-vest. Each officer wore a ballistic helmet and a fire retardant \nbalaclava (which covered his face), as well as goggles. The SERT officers were equipped with gas masks and \nsound and flash distraction devices. As their primary weapon they were armed with assault rifles with light sources \nand they had as secondary weapons a pistol also with a light source. Officers also carried oleoresin capsicum (OC) \nspray, a baton and handcuffs. Some SERT officers were further equipped with tasers (the model of which has since \nbeen superseded) and what was described as \u2018method of entry equipment\u2019 for breaking down doors and the like if \nnecessary, together with a \u2018less lethal\u2019 shotgun and extended range impact munitions. Inspector McKay gave the \nfollowing evidence about extended range impact munitions and the use of a \u201cless lethal\u201d shotgun:An extended \nrange impact weapon gives you that ability from an extended range. For example, if someone is armed with an \nedged weapon like a knife, they\u2019re \u2013 initially \u2013 the initial teaching was that it was \u2013 you had to be 21 feet away from \nthe person. Then it was 10 metres, and now the \u2013 the teaching is there\u2019s no safe distance being away from \nsomeone armed with an edged weapon. So obviously, inappropriate for you to move close enough to be able to \nstrike someone with a baton if someone is armed with an edged weapon, but with an extent \u2013 but if you had that \nability to strike them in the same way as you would with a baton from an extended range using extended range \nimpact weapons, then that\u2019s where the benefit of that capability comes in. So, currently within the service we have \nthat ability in a 12 gauge capacity which is a shotgun round. Now, the munitions come in a variety of manners. \nSome of them are a canvas sack that is filled with lead shot that fires from the weapon, strikes the person and \ncauses pain and incapacitation, hopefully, and getting them to stop what they\u2019re doing.  The PSRT officers each \nhad a dark blue police uniform, with a \u2018public order vest\u2019 with (non-ballistic) arm and leg protection, a \u2018public order \nhelmet\u2019 with visor and flash hood, and cut resistant gloves. The PSRT officers were equipped with riot shields and \npistols, as well as OC spray, baton and handcuffs. One of the key differences between PSRT and SERT was that \nthe former did not wear balaclavas.  After the arrests were complete (except for those at Wallaby Point), at 8.10 am \non Sunday, 28 November 2004 DI Webber revoked the emergency declaration in relation to Palm Island. The \nlength of time during which the Palm Island community was subject to the emergency declaration is also a matter \nchallenged by the applicants as unlawful race discrimination. The revocation meant that ordinary travel between the \nisland and the mainland could resume, and it also led to the departure of most of the additional police officers then \non Palm Island. Inspector Dini\u2019s evidence was: that there was still a \u201ccommand post\u201d on 29 November 2004 and \nthat on that day the \u201ccommand group\u201d was \u201cdoing rosters, organising resources, getting, you know, supplies to the \nisland, flying police over, taking police out\u201d and that the police were \u201c[m]aintaining a presence at four or five other \nsites around the island\u201d. He also said that he himself left the island on 30 November 2004 for a debrief and \nreturned to the island on 1 December 2004, staying for approximately a week. On any view, there appeared to be \ngreatly reduced concerns on behalf of the QPS about the need for extra policing in the Palm Island community, or \nabout police safety.  The evidence does not disclose when those non-Aboriginal people (for example, teaching staff \nfrom the schools) who left the island on the specially arranged ferry returned to the island. The evidence shows St \nMichael\u2019s did not get its school bus back for approximately a week: why it took that long is not explained in the \nevidence.\n\nSubsequent events, including court proceedings and inquiries    The applicants\u2019 RDA case substantially ends at this \npoint in the chronology, and accordingly, there was very little evidence about the aftermath on Palm Island after the \nSERT and PSRT teams left. Some of the applicants\u2019 witnesses gave evidence about the charges against various \nindividuals and their outcomes. Ultimately, those matters were agreed between the parties and I set them out \nbelow.  There was, however, evidence about the aftermath of these events insofar as official investigations and \ninquiries were concerned, of which there were several.  On 27 September 2006, Acting State Coroner Christine \nClements delivered her report in her inquest into the death of Mulrunji. Acting State Coroner Clements was \nappointed to continue the inquest after the first coroner \u2013 State Coroner Barnes \u2013 recused himself. In her report, \nActing State Coroner Clements concluded that the actions of SS Hurley caused Mulrunji\u2019s fatal injuries. However, \n\n\n\nthe whole of Acting State Coroner Clements\u2019 finding as to how Mulrunji died was set aside on 16 June 2009 by the \nQueensland Court of Appeal on the basis that her finding was not reasonably open on the evidence: Hurley v \nClements [2009] QCA 167;[2010] 1 Qd R 215 at [48] (the Court). The Court ordered that the inquest be re-opened \nby another coroner: at [57].  On 19 December 2006, in response to comments made by Acting State Coroner \nClements in her finding (and before the finding was set aside), the Commissioner of Police formed an Investigation \nReview Team (IRT) to examine in detail any criticisms of the QPS and its members arising from the inquest and the \nActing State Coroner\u2019s finding. The Commissioner also requested the CMC to review the internal investigation. In \nNovember 2008, the IRT delivered the three-volume report of its internal investigation, entitled \u2018Palm Island \nReview\u2019, to the CMC.  On 5 February 2007, SS Hurley was charged with manslaughter and common assault. By \nthis time, the charges against some of the persons arrested for offences relating to the protests and fires on 26 \nNovember 2004 had been discontinued or finalised, while the charges against others were still ongoing.  In June \n2007, SS Hurley was acquitted by a jury of the charges against him.  On 29 May 2006 (that is, before any inquest \nfindings had been delivered and before SS Hurley was charged), Chief Superintendent Wall (who had been Acting \nAssistant Commissioner in November 2004) recommended that a number of officers involved in the events on Palm \nIsland should receive awards ranging from a Commissioner\u2019s Certificate or higher award to an Assistant \nCommissioner\u2019s Certificate or Letter of Appreciation. Those recommended for awards included: all 19 of the officers \nwho were in the police station when the protests and fires began, with Inspector Richardson, SS Whyte and DS \nRobinson identified as deserving particular praise; five officers who were involved in the subsequent identification of \nsuspects, including DI Webber; eight officers who were in the Major Incident Room in Townsville, including DSS \nKitching; and several officers involved in the \u201coverall strategic management\u201d of the events, including CS Wall \nhimself. In cross-examination, each of DI Webber, Inspector Kitching and Inspector Whyte confirmed that he \nreceived a framed award as a result of those recommendations, with Inspector Kitching and Inspector Whyte stating \nthat their awards were conferred at a formal ceremony. Mr Campbell\u2019s evidence was that he did not receive an \naward despite being recommended for one. On 3 November 2008, DS Robinson was awarded the Queensland \nPolice Service Valour Award, for his conduct in responding to the events of 26 November 2004. This award is the \nhighest commendation the QPS can bestow on an officer, for acts of bravery in hazardous circumstances. QPS \nofficers who had been involved in the events on the island, including some of those called as witnesses, also \nsubsequently received promotions. The applicants rely on those facts as part of their damages case and I address \nthem in the damages section of these reasons.  In total, 27 people were charged with offences in connection with \nthe events of 26 November 2004. Of those, 16 people were convicted of at least one offence and the remaining 11 \nwere either acquitted or had their charges withdrawn.  The agreed facts concerning the charges laid against \nindividuals who were eventually convicted of at least one offence were as follows:(1) Cedric Barry was charged \nwith: (i) entering a dwelling and committing an indictable offence; (ii) stealing by looting in civil unrest; and (iii) \nentering a dwelling with intent. The first charge was withdrawn and Mr Barry pleaded guilty to the latter two charges. \nOn 9 December 2004, he was sentenced to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second charge and 6 months\u2019 \nimprisonment on the third charge.\n\n (2) George Coolwell was charged with: (i) entering a dwelling and committing an indictable offence; (ii) stealing by \nlooting in civil unrest; and (iii) entering a dwelling with intent. The first charge was withdrawn and Mr Coolwell \npleaded guilty to the latter two charges. On 1 December 2004, he was sentenced to 2 months\u2019 imprisonment on the \nsecond charge and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment on the third charge, suspended for 2 years after 4 months.\n\n (3) Terrence Kidner was charged with three counts of rioting with damage and two counts of arson of a structure or \nbuilding. A nolle prosequi was entered for two of the rioting with damage counts and both of the arson counts. Mr \nKidner pleaded guilty to the third rioting with damage count and on 8 May 2007 he was sentenced to 4 years\u2019 \nimprisonment suspended for 4 years after 16 months (with 166 days of pre-sentence custody).\n\n (4) Alissa Norman was charged with rioting with damage. She pleaded guilty and on 28 July 2006 she was \nsentenced to 12 months on an intensive correction order, but on appeal this was increased on 8 December 2006 to \n18 months\u2019 imprisonment with a parole release date of 8 April 2007.\n\n\n\n (5) A juvenile whose identity is protected under the Youth Justice Act 1992 (Qld) was charged with three counts of \nrioting with damage. A nolle prosequi was entered for two of the counts and the juvenile pleaded guilty to the third \ncount. On 28 July 2006, the juvenile was sentenced to 150 hours of community service.\n\n (6) Robert Nugent was charged with: (i) rioting with damage; (ii) arson of a structure or building; and (iii) stealing by \nlooting in civil unrest. A nolle prosequi was entered for each of the first two charges and Mr Nugent pleaded guilty to \nthe third charge. On 1 March 2007, he was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment with 125 days of pre-sentence \ncustody and a parole release date of 1 March 2007.\n\n (7) Russell Parker Junior was charged with: (i) two counts of arson of a structure or building; (ii) one count of rioting \nwith damage; and (iii) one count of stealing by looting in civil unrest. A nolle prosequi was entered for each of the \narson charges and for the rioting with damage charge. Mr Parker pleaded guilty to the looting charge and on 28 July \n2006 he was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment (with 9 days of pre-sentence custody).\n\n (8) Russell Parker Senior was charged with two counts of rioting with damage. A nolle prosequi was entered for the \nfirst count and he pleaded guilty to the second count. On 28 July 2006, he was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 \nimprisonment suspended for 3 years after 6 months (with 9 days of pre-sentence custody), but on appeal this was \nincreased on 8 December 2006 to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment with a parole release date of 8 April 2007.\n\n (9) Jason Poynter was charged with two counts of rioting. A nolle prosequi was entered for one count and he \npleaded guilty to the other count. On 28 July 2006, he was sentenced to 12 months on an intensive correction order \n(with 8 days of pre-sentence custody), but on appeal this was increased on 8 December 2006 to 15 months\u2019 \nimprisonment with a parole release date of 8 May 2007.\n\n (10) Lincoln Poynter was charged with two counts of rioting. A nolle prosequi was entered for one count and he \npleaded guilty to the other count. On 24 August 2006, he was sentenced to 4 months\u2019 imprisonment suspended for \n1 year after 10 days (having already served 10 days of pre-sentence custody).\n\n (11) David Shepherd was charged with rioting with damage. He pleaded guilty and on 1 March 2007 he was \nsentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment with a parole release dated of 1 July 2007 (with 6 days of pre-sentence \ncustody).\n\n (12) Garrison Sibley was charged with: (i) rioting with damage; (ii) arson of an aircraft or motor vehicle; and (iii) \nstealing by looting in civil unrest. A nolle prosequi was entered for each of the first two charges and Mr Sibley \npleaded guilty to the third charge. On 28 July 2006, he was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment (with 88 days of \npre-sentence custody).\n\n (13) Anthony Thompson was charged with wilful damage and pleaded guilty. On 21 June 2006 he was sentenced \nto 80 hours of community service.\n\n (14) Joseph Watson was charged with: (i) entering a dwelling and committing an indictable offence; (ii) stealing by \nlooting in civil unrest; and (iii) entering a dwelling with intent. The first charge was withdrawn and Mr Watson \npleaded guilty to the latter two charges. On 1 December 2004, he was sentenced to 2 months\u2019 imprisonment on the \nlooting charge and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment suspended for 2 years after 4 months on the enter dwelling with intent \ncharge.\n\n (15) Thomas Wilson was charged with wilful damage and pleaded guilty. On 21 June 2006, he was sentenced to \n80 hours of community service.\n\n (16) It was agreed that Lex Wotton was charged with: (i) one count of wilful damage; (i) four counts of rioting with \ndamage; (ii) three counts of arson of a structure or building; (iii) two counts of rioting; and (iv) one count of arson of \n\n\n\nan aircraft or motor vehicle. It was agreed that the prosecution offered no evidence on the wilful damage count and \na nolle prosequi was entered for each of the other counts except for one count of rioting with damage, to which Mr \nWotton pleaded not guilty. After a trial, Mr Wotton was found guilty by a jury. On 7 November 2008, he was \nsentenced to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment with 110 days of pre-sentence custody and a parole eligibility date of 18 July \n2010.  The provisions of the Criminal Code relevant to the charges laid are set out at [195] above. When a \ncomparison is undertaken between these provisions and the agreed facts, some difficulties emerge. The words \n\u201cinjuring\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d appear in s 66, while s 65 deals with rioting that \u201cdemolishes\u201d or \u201cdestroys\u201d the things to \nwhich it refers. It is the latter provision which carries life imprisonment. The agreed facts use the words \u201cinjuring\u201d \nand \u201cdamaging\u201d when referring to various charges. They do not use \u201cdemolish\u201d or \u201cdestroy\u201d. The charge with which \nMr Wotton was convicted is described in the agreed facts as \u201cRioters Injuring Building or Machinery etc\u201d, which can \nonly be a reference to rioting with damage. However, having regard to both the sentencing remarks for Mr Wotton \n(which were in evidence) and the High Court\u2019s decision in Wotton v Queensland [2012] HCA 2; 246 CLR 1 at [4], it \nseems clear that Mr Wotton was charged with and convicted of rioting with destruction under s 65 of the Criminal \nCode, not the lesser offence of rioting with damage under s 66. Further, it is clear from Bulsey v State of \nQueensland (unreported, Sup Ct, Qld, North J, 20 February 2015) at [48] (Bulsey trial judgment) that David Bulsey \nwas also charged with rioting with destruction contrary to s 65, although the agreed facts do not reflect this. \nNotwithstanding these discrepancies, I have inferred that, where the agreed facts use the word \u201cdamaging\u201d or \n\u201cinjuring\u201d they refer to the lesser offence of rioting with damage under s 66. I have therefore taken it that it was this \noffence with which persons were charged in connection with the protests and fires, except for the charge with \nwhich Mr Wotton was convicted and which was laid against Mr Bulsey, about which there is other and, I find, better \nevidence.  The charges that were laid against individuals who were ultimately not convicted of any offence were as \nfollows:(1) William Blackman was charged with three counts of rioting with damage.

Mr Wotton brought a constitutional challenge to the bail \nconditions imposed on him, which required him not to attend public meetings on Palm Island without the prior \napproval of a corrective services officer, not to speak to or have any interaction whatsoever with the media, and not \nto receive any direct or indirect payment or benefit from the media: see Wotton v Queensland [2012] HCA 2; 246 \nCLR 1. That challenge was unsuccessful, although the Parole Board removed the condition about speaking with the \nmedia during the currency of Mr Wotton\u2019s action in the High Court.  No member of the QPS, other than SS Hurley, \nwas charged with a criminal offence in relation to Mulrunji\u2019s injuries or death, the subsequent investigation, the \nentries and searches of the houses or the property damage arising from them.  On 14 May 2010, some three years \nafter SS Hurley\u2019s acquittal, the Coroner (Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine) found that Mulrunji died of fatal injuries \nwhich resulted from some force to his abdomen. Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine found that these injuries occurred \neither accidentally as Mulrunji and SS Hurley fell into the police station, or by deliberate action of SS Hurley in the \nfew seconds after they landed. He concluded that it was not possible to ascertain whether the force was \ndeliberately inflicted or accidentally applied.  In reaching those conclusions, Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine made the \nfollowing findings. First, that Mulrunji was not suffering from any injury when the police van arrived at the station (at \n[95] of the findings). Second, that Mulrunji was seriously intoxicated at that time, with a blood alcohol level of \n292mg/100mL (0.292), and therefore his co-ordination would have been significantly affected such that he would \nhave been less able to protect himself in a fall (at [104]). Third, that the medical evidence established that Mulrunji\u2019s \ninternal injuries were likely to have been caused by a single blow involving \u201cthe application of a very considerable \nforce\u201d to the torso while the torso was \u201cotherwise immobilised\u201d against an object or surface such as the floor, rather \nthan being caused by several blows (at [110]). Fourth, that on the medical evidence alone (before taking other \nevidence into account) it could not be excluded that the single blow might have been accidentally inflicted: (at [110], \n[132]). Fifth, that Mulrunji struck SS Hurley while SS Hurley was attempting to remove him from the police van (at \n[124]) and that SS Hurley responded by striking Mulrunji (at [179]). Sixth, that SS Hurley fell onto Mulrunji as they \ncame through the door of the police station (at [354]). Seventh, that Mulrunji\u2019s internal injuries could have been \ncaused by the application of direct crushing pressure by SS Hurley\u2019s elbow, shoulder or hip during the fall and were \nnot necessarily caused by SS Hurley\u2019s knee (at [358]-[359]). Eighth, that there was no medical evidence to suggest \nthat the internal injuries were caused by punching, kicking or stomping (at [360]). Ninth, that it could not positively \nbe concluded that SS Hurley deliberately applied the force that caused the internal injuries (at [363]). Tenth, that it \nalso could not positively be concluded that the force that caused the internal injuries was applied accidentally (at \n[367]). Eleventh, that after the fall SS Hurley punched Mulrunji three times to the face before dragging him limp into \nthe cells (at [365]).  Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine summarised his finding about how Mulrunji died as follows:The \ndeceased died of fatal injuries which resulted from some force to the abdomen of the deceased either accidentally \nas the deceased and Christopher Hurley fell into the Palm Island watchhouse or by deliberate actions of Hurley in \nthe few seconds after they landed, but it is not possible to ascertain whether the force was deliberately inflicted or \naccidentally suffered. The four fractured ribs, liver laceration and portal vein rupture occurred as a result of this \nsingle injury.  In June 2010, shortly after the Deputy Chief Magistrate handed down his finding, the CMC handed \ndown a report entitled \u2018CMC Review of the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island Review\u2019. It was critical of the \nQPS. It found the evidence was insufficient to support consideration of any criminal prosecution proceedings, but it \nrecommended disciplinary proceedings against a number of individual officers: DI Webber; DSS Kitching; DS \nRobinson; and Inspector Williams. None of these officers were disciplined.  On 19 August 2010, the Supreme Court \nof Queensland declared that the Commissioner of Police was disqualified from giving any personal consideration to \ncommencing disciplinary proceedings but was not prevented from delegating the consideration of the \ncommencement of disciplinary proceedings to a prescribed officer as defined in s 7.4 of the PSA Act: see Kitching v \nQueensland Commissioner of Police[2010] QSC 303. As the title of this proceeding suggests, it was commenced \nby Inspector Kitching. DS Robinson was the second applicant.  The Commissioner delegated to Deputy \nCommissioner Rynders as a prescribed officer the task of considering the recommendations in the CMC Report and \ndetermining any disciplinary issues.  The CMC, by letter dated 10 September 2010 to the Commissioner, advised \nthat the matter was considered appropriate for consideration at the Deputy Commissioner level.  On 7 January \n2011, DC Rynders handed down a 405-page report entitled \u2018Report in Response to the \u201cCMC Review of the \n\n\n\nQueensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island Review\u201d\u2019. In her report, DC Rynders decided that the key officers \ninvolved should not face disciplinary proceedings, but should be given what was called \u201cmanagerial guidance\u201d in \nrelation to some (but not all) of their conduct on Palm Island during the period 19 to 28 November 2004. That \nfinding applied to Inspector Williams, DI Webber and DSS Kitching. It appears DC Rynders concluded that not even \nmanagerial guidance should be given to any other officers, including, somewhat remarkably it might be thought, SS \nHurley. This might be explained on the basis that the scope of DC Rynders\u2019 report was determined by the CMC \nreview, which focused on certain officers and limited its examination of SS Hurley\u2019s conduct pending legal \nproceedings which included the third inquest, as the IRT had done before it in the Palm Island Review. \nNevertheless, given SS Hurley\u2019s acquittal some four years earlier, I remain of the view that the failure of DC \nRynders\u2019 report to deal with SS Hurley\u2019s conduct is something of a glaring omission.  Copies of the documents \ndirected towards these three officers were in evidence, although not copies which had any \u201cresponses\u201d from those \nofficers filled in at points in the document where a response was suggested. Aside from reciting the sequence of \nevents leading up to the giving of managerial guidance, the actual managerial guidance appears to be contained in \nseveral paragraphs in each document. I shall take the document directed at DI Webber as an example (at \nparagraphs 9 to 15 of the document):By statute, the Commissioner has the prescribed responsibility to ensure the \nService is managed efficiently and effectively in accordance with law and there are expectations by the broader \ncommunity that police officers undertake their official duties with due diligence having regard to legislation, hence \nthe promulgation of Service policy and procedures.\n\n You have an obligation to the Service and wider Queensland community to perform your official duties ethically and \nprofessionally at all times. There is no room for complacency. Service policy and procedures exist to enhance \npublic confidence in our day-to-day official duties. Police officers must perform their duties with a high degree \ntransparency and be accountable for their actions. In your case, and despite this incident having occurred some \ntime ago, still leaves some questions concerning the integrity of the initial investigation on Palm Island in November \n2004 at the expense of the reputation of the Service, its broader membership and community confidence.\n\n You hold the rank of Inspector and obviously have a supervisory role within your work environment. I have no \ndoubt that you have learnt from your failings and the perceptions it has created; I sincerely hope that you will take \npositive steps in the future to avoid any similar adverse perceptions. As a supervisor, your reputation is at stake, \nyou have the responsibility to ensure your subordinates conduct their official duties appropriately and comply with \nService directions and guidelines. Should there be a further or similar occurrence of the kind particularised in the \nDirection Notice, you render yourself liable to disciplinary action.\n\n Do you fully understand the significance of your failings and the likely consequences that may follow?\n\n RESPONSE\n\n Before I conclude, is there anything you wish to say?\n\n RESPONSE\n\n You have been given managerial guidance and I will notify the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner, \nEthical Standards Command accordingly. I consider the matters against you arising from the Review of the \nQueensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island Review now finalised.  The CMC could have, but did not, appeal against \nor seek review of the findings of DC Rynders in her report.  The evidence revealed, and many of the parties\u2019 \nwitnesses accepted, that there have been some positive changes on Palm Island since the events of November \n2004, due to increased focus on education, social and cultural needs, and building a stronger community. \nNevertheless, as Professor Altman\u2019s evidence demonstrated, it remains one of the most disadvantaged \ncommunities in Queensland. It seems an obvious but necessary observation that the amount of public legal, \nfinancial and human resources which have been spent on the investigations and inquiries I have recounted \u2013 if \napplied instead to Palm Island itself \u2013 could have fundamentally and permanently transformed the lives of the entire \n\n\n\nPalm Island community.  In 2007, David Bulsey and his partner, Yvette Lenoy, commenced a proceeding in the \nSupreme Court of Queensland claiming damages (including aggravated and exemplary damages) for the tort of \ntrespass to the person (assault and false imprisonment, and in Mr Bulsey\u2019s case also battery) in connection with Mr \nBulsey\u2019s arrest and detention on 27 November 2004. Their claims were dismissed at first instance (see Bulsey trial \njudgment), but succeeded on appeal: see Bulsey v State of Queensland [2015] QCA 187 (Bulsey). The evidence at \ntrial was that it was DSS Miles in the Major Incident Room in Townsville who had ultimately decided which persons \nshould be arrested: Bulsey trial judgment at [46]. The evidence in this proceeding was less clear about precisely \nwho made those decisions and I return to those matters below. In his leading judgment on the appeal in Bulsey, \nFraser JA held (at [19]-[22]) that Mr Bulsey\u2019s arrest was unlawful because the officers who apprehended Mr Bulsey \ndid not reasonably suspect that he had committed an offence. His Honour held it was irrelevant whether DSS Miles \nin Townsville held such a suspicion. Mr Bulsey was awarded $165,000 in damages, including aggravated damages, \ncomprising $60,000 for assault, battery and false imprisonment, $100,000 for false imprisonment after the wrongful \narrest, and general damages of $5,000 for personal injury. Ms Lenoy was awarded damages of $70,000 for assault \nand false imprisonment. Interest was payable on both awards. I return to the Court of Appeal decision in more detail \nat [1305] below, as it is directly relevant to the applicants\u2019 claims in this proceeding.  While the inquiries and \ninvestigations into the events of November 2004 continued over these seven or so years (if one excludes the \nBulsey appeal \u2013 otherwise, the period is 11 years), other litigation was brought about the treatment of Aboriginal \npeople on Palm Island. In May 2008, Ms Joan Maloney, another Palm Island resident, was found in possession of \na bottle of bourbon and a bottle of rum in a car in a public place on Palm Island. She was charged and convicted in \nthe Queensland Magistrates Court of an offence under s 168B of the Liquor Act 1992 (Qld). At the time of the \noffence, just as at the time of the events in November 2004, there were restrictions on possession of alcohol in \npublic places on Palm Island (and in other Aboriginal communities in Queensland) imposed by the Liquor Act and \nits associated regulations. Ms Maloney sought to have her conviction set aside on the basis that the relevant \nlegislative and regulatory provisions were invalid under s 109 of the Commonwealth Constitution by reason of \ninconsistency with s 10of the RDA. The High Court in Maloney [2013] HCA 28; 252 CLR 168 found that the \nlegislative and regulatory provisions were a \u201cspecial measure\u201d within the meaning of that term in s 8(1) of the RDA, \nbut a majority of the Court (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Bell and Gageler JJ, Kiefel J contra) found that if they had \nnot been a special measure they would have been inconsistent with s 10 of the RDA for the reason that they had \ndiscriminatory effects on Ms Maloney\u2019s right to own property (that is, in substance, to possess liquor she had \npurchased). Maloney is an important decision in the consideration of some of the legal principles that are applicable \nto the applicants\u2019 claims in this proceeding.\nEVIDENCE ON CONTESTED ISSUES  \n\nKey participants in the events of November 2004 who were not called to give evidence    Some of the key people \nwho feature in the narrative I have set out above were not called as witnesses in this proceeding. They include SS \nHurley, DS Robinson, Inspector Williams, Inspector Richardson, Inspector Underwood, Inspector Kachel, Constable \nSteadman, Sergeant Leafe, PLO Bengaroo, the other SERT team members, Erykah Kyle, and David Bulsey. There \nwere also people such as Constable Craig Robertson, who took video of the protests and fires that occurred on 26 \nNovember 2004, who were absent. I found it somewhat remarkable that neither DSS Miles nor A/AC Wall were \ncalled as witnesses. DSS Miles was the QPS officer who was responsible for identifying the suspects to be \narrested. A/AC Wall had an overall command role and made such decisions as the one on Monday, 22 November \n2004 to remove SS Hurley from the island. He was also the author of the 2006 memorandum in which a long list of \nQPS officers were recommended of a range of bravery, valour and service awards. This conduct, and the \nmemorandum, were significant aspects of the applicants\u2019 case and yet the author and apparent decision-maker was \nnot called. There was no evidence adduced to explain his absence.  The applicants submit that in drawing \ninferences about whether the conduct was based on race, the Court can and should consider what they describe as \nthe respondents\u2019 \u201celection\u201d not to call evidence that could potentially be relied upon to resist the drawing of adverse \ninferences about the racial basis for QPS conduct. The applicants rely on the following passage from the judgment \nof Menzies J in Jones v Dunkel[1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298 at 312:where an inference is open from facts proved by \ndirect evidence and the question is whether it should be drawn, the circumstance that the defendant disputing it \nmight have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is properly to be taken into account as a \ncircumstance in favour of drawing the inference.  The respondents submit this rule does not operate to require a \nparty to give cumulative evidence. Referring to JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence (9th Australian ed, LexisNexis \n\n\n\nButterworths, 2013) at p 40, they submit that they were not required to explain or contradict any of the matters on \nwhich the applicants invite the Court to draw inferences, so the rule has no operation. Referring again to Cross on \nEvidence at p 38, the respondents submit the rule cannot be used to fill gaps in the evidence or to convert \nconjecture and suspicion into inference.  I accept the respondents\u2019 submissions in general. The applicants bear the \nonus of proof in this proceeding. How that burden was to be discharged was a matter for the applicants, and the \nrespondents were not obliged to assist the applicants by providing witnesses whose evidence might fill any gaps in \nthe applicants\u2019 case. The \u201ctrue complexion on the facts relied on as the ground for\u201d an inference (see Jones v \nDunkel at 308 (Kitto J)) may, or may not, have been revealed by the calling of one or more of the many QPS \nofficers not called. In a case with as broad a factual base as this, where witnesses\u2019 evidence ranged over so many \nevents, a broad-based submission invoking Jones v Dunkel cannot succeed.  The Court takes the evidence before \nit and makes findings on the balance of probabilities accordingly. There may have been evidence before other \ncourts, persons and entities examining these events which was not before this Court. There may have been \nevidence before this Court that was not before those other courts, persons and entities. The state of the evidence is \nthe result of the parties\u2019 forensic choices. The correct approach is set out in Australian Securities and Investments \nCommission v Hellicar [2012] HCA 17;247 CLR 345 at [165] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and \nBell JJ):Disputed questions of fact must be decided by a court according to the evidence that the parties adduce, \nnot according to some speculation about what other evidence might possibly have been led.  The respondents\u2019 \nforensic choices about which individuals they chose to call as witnesses have had some consequences for my fact \nfinding, but not as a result of the application of Jones v Dunkel. Rather, they have meant there is, in relation to \nsome aspects of my fact finding, no countervailing evidence to be considered other than that upon which the \napplicants rely. The contemporaneous video evidence is one example: although the respondents tendered one \npiece of video footage, they led almost no evidence seeking to give any context to what could be seen in the video \nevidence, to contradict it, or to qualify it. That is true even of the video taken by Constable Robertson.  A similar \nobservation can be made about the applicants\u2019 forensic choices: on some matters there is insufficient evidence for \nthe Court to be satisfied the applicants have discharged their burden of proof. For example, they alleged that QPS \nofficers behaved in a \u2018militaristic\u2019 manner in the course of their activities on Palm Island following the protests and \nfires. While a substantial amount of evidence was led about the arrests, entries and searches that occurred in the \ncourse of the SERT operations, it was insufficient to prove on the balance of probabilities that the general behaviour \nof the police on Palm Island could be described as \u2018militaristic\u2019 (see [1267] below).  Ms Andrea Sailor gave a short \nexplanation regarding why her mother, Erykah Kyle, did not give evidence in this proceeding. I need not set out that \nexplanation: the respondents accepted that Ms Kyle was unable to give evidence. The Court has the benefit of \ncontemporaneous video evidence of her speaking on many occasions, including an interview with her. Ms Kyle had \na pivotal leadership role in the Palm Island community during these events. While it was also clear, from some of \nwhat can be heard in the contemporaneous video evidence, that some members of the Palm Island community \nwere dissatisfied with the leadership she provided, for my own part I was impressed by how she worked to hold her \ncommunity together at such a difficult time. The circumstances were especially difficult because Ms Kyle had lost a \nson in a death in custody situation. The video evidence also makes clear that Ms Kyle sought to engage with QPS \nofficers on the island, albeit relatively unsuccessfully.\n\nThe documentary evidence    A wide range of documents, photographs, videos and audio recordings were in \nevidence, tendered principally by the applicants but also by the respondents. The documentary evidence \nincludes:(a) video footage of Mulrunji in the watchhouse cell of the Palm Island Police Station on 19 November \n2004, and the response of QPS officers when he was found dead;\n\n (b) transcripts, video recordings and witness statements from the interviews and re-enactments conducted by the \nQPS investigating officers on Palm Island on 19 and 20 November 2004 (and in Ingham on 21 November 2004);\n\n (c) documents relating to the coronial functions following Mulrunji\u2019s death, including the Form 1 and preliminary \nautopsy report, as well as the final autopsy report dated 21 January 2005 and the findings of the coronial inquests \nwhich followed in 2006 and 2010; \n\n\n\n (d) videos depicting various public meetings held on Palm Island during the week of 22 November 2004;\n\n (e) videos depicting the protests and fires that occurred on Palm Island on 26 November 2004;\n\n (f) videos depicting media interviews with QPS officers from the week of 22 November 2004;\n\n (g) QPS media releases and news reports about the events on Palm Island in November 2004;\n\n (h) QPS executive and ministerial briefing notes about the situation on Palm Island in November 2004;\n\n (i) QPS logs and running sheets recording events on Palm Island between 19 November 2004 and 13 December \n2004, including what was referred to in the running sheets as \u201cOperation CHARLIE CLOVER \u2013 \u2018State of Emergency \nPalm Island\u2019\u201d;\n\n (j) photographs depicting the planning and aftermath of the arrests, entries and searches, and depicting SERT and \nPSRT officers during the period of the entries and searches;\n\n (k) the OPM and related documents, such as the applicable versions of the Queensland Police Service Code of \nConduct and the National Guidelines for the Police Use of Lethal Force and Deployment of Police in High Risk \nSituations;\n\n (l) documents relating to \u201cManagerial Guidance\u201d given to various QPS officers involved in the events on Palm \nIsland;\n\n (m) reports of various bodies about the events on Palm Island, including the QPS\u2019s November 2008 \u2018Palm Island \nReview\u2019 and the CMC\u2019s June 2010 \u2018CMC Review of the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island Review\u2019;\n\n (n) various reports on policing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities generally, including the report \nof the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) and the regional report of that Royal \nCommission regarding Queensland;\n\n (o) witness statements of QPS officers involved in the events of November 2004, some taken at the time of the \nevents and some taken afterwards;\n\n (p) sentencing remarks of the District Court of Queensland in relation to those persons who were charged with \noffences arising from the protests and fires that took place on Palm Island on 26 November 2004; and\n\n (q) audio of interviews conducted by DS Robinson on 28 and 29 November 2004 with persons affected by the \narrests, entries and searches.  The video footage of witness interviews which were taken at the time (that is, on or \naround 19 November 2004) were taken largely by Constable Tibbey, who accompanied DI Webber to Palm Island \non the afternoon of 19 November 2004. The witness statement made by Constable Tibbey for the purposes of the \ncriminal trial of SS Hurley was in evidence in this proceeding. Constable Tibbey refers also to photographs he took, \nbut they were not in evidence in this proceeding. No objection was taken to that statement and I am satisfied it \n\n\n\nprovides the necessary proof of the authenticity and contemporaneity of the video footage and photographs taken \nby Constable Tibbey.\n\nThe witnesses called by the parties in this proceeding    My assessment of the witnesses in this proceeding is \ncritical for some issues that must be determined and less critical for others. Much of the sequence of events that \nforms the basis of the applicants\u2019 claims is not disputed, so that individual differences in accounts of those events \nare not, in my opinion, critical to the findings to be made. That is especially so when Palm Island community \nmembers and police officers were clearly approaching the sequence of events from such different perspectives, \ndifferently informed, with different priorities and concerns, and with different sets of assumptions. Generally, \nalthough their different perspectives informed their evidence, I did not see the differences as affecting the views I \nformed about the factual findings necessary for the purposes of s 9(1).  The issues where the witness evidence \nreally matters were the following. First, my impression of the police officers did inform my findings about whether \nthe pleaded conduct was based on race. That is not so much because individual officers exhibited behaviour, \nopinions or language which could be described as racist (although a few did). Rather it was because their oral \nevidence provided a clear picture of the perspective they brought to the discharge of their policing role and \nresponsibilities on Palm Island during the claim period.  Second, the evidence of the witnesses from the Palm \nIsland community had two particular impacts on my findings. The first is that their evidence, including how they \npresented as witnesses, assisted me to understand what it was like to be living on Palm Island during these events, \nand what the Palm Island community was like. It bore little resemblance to the perceptions exhibited by members \nof the QPS about the Palm Island community. The second is that the evidence of those witnesses who were still \nchildren during the entries and searches was profoundly affecting. I describe my impressions in more detail as I \ndeal with each witness. The terror instilled in those witnesses who were children at the time of these events was \npalpable and continuing during their evidence in this proceeding.  I deal with the witnesses in the order in which \nthey were called. Where I describe relationships between individuals, I use familial descriptors without \ndistinguishing between biological and non-biological relationships. It seems to me this is consistent with how the \nAboriginal witnesses described their relationships and, for the purposes of this proceeding, whether a relationship \nwas biological or not was of no consequence. What matters was the existence of family, and extended family, \nrelationships and living arrangements.  Although the respondents did test the accounts given by the applicants\u2019 \nwitnesses about the arrests, entries and searches, in my opinion the vast bulk of the eyewitness evidence should \nbe treated as reliable. These individuals experienced something that was out of their normal range of experiences, \nand which terrified them. They have lived with those experiences ever since and in my opinion their recollections \nhave remained good because of the heightened states induced by what they saw and experienced. I did not detect \nany particular exaggerations or reconstructions.  In contrast, the respondents either called no eyewitnesses, or they \ncalled officers who were physically distant from many of the events although present in the vicinity. An example is \nInspector McKay, who was present during the arrests, entries and searches but did not go up to or into the houses. \nOf the SERT officers called (Superintendent Kruger and Sergeant Folpp), these men were giving evidence about \nevents that occurred a long time ago, in circumstances where each of them had attended many other SERT \ncallouts both before and after those events. In terms of detail, I am not satisfied their recollections would be as \nreliable as the applicants\u2019 eyewitnesses. It did not strike me that either of these witnesses had found their task on \nPalm Island anything much out of the ordinary, and they did not appear to have any special recollections of it. They \nwere able accurately to describe what they were trained to do in such situations, how they were trained to think, and \ntherefore gave evidence about how they were likely to have behaved. That kind of evidence, as given by them, can \nbe accepted. However where there is a direct conflict with the applicants\u2019 eyewitnesses who were, so to speak, on \nthe receiving end of the SERT conduct, I prefer the evidence of the applicants\u2019 witnesses because in my opinion the \nuniqueness of those experiences for them means they are more likely to recall the events rather than reconstruct \nthem. As I have said, it is my firm impression that what they experienced has stayed with them and has had lasting \nadverse effects on them.  There were, I regret to say, many leading questions asked of the applicants\u2019 witnesses. \nThe irony of that occurring in a trial where the applicants led expert evidence about the susceptibility of Aboriginal \npeople to gratuitous concurrence should not be overlooked. Where I considered a witness\u2019s evidence was affected \nby the leading nature of a question or questions, I have not given any weight to that evidence. The result is that the \nevidence of some witnesses, such as Mr Clumpoint, is not of high probative value. Nevertheless, there were large \nand important parts of much of the witness evidence for the applicants that were not affected by this problem.\nThe applicants\u2019 witnesses  \n\n\n\nTuesday, 22 September 2015\n\nMs Andrea Sailor  Ms Sailor has lived on Palm Island all of her life. She is the daughter of Ms Erykah Kyle, the \nformer mayor of Palm Island, who features in much of the witness evidence and the video evidence from \nNovember 2004. At the time of giving her evidence, Ms Sailor was employed as a field officer for the Department of \nCorrective Services on Palm Island. Between 2002 and 2005, Ms Sailor was employed as a field officer with \nATSILS on Palm Island. Her role at ATSILS included attending court, attending the watchhouse when a person \nwas taken into custody, and sitting in on police interviews with clients in custody.  Ms Sailor was a careful and \nmeasured witness. She was clear in what she could recall and what she could not. Of the matters she did recall, I \nam satisfied her evidence is reliable and accurate, in particular her evidence about what she observed from her \nhome in Butler Bay on 27 November 2004, when the SERT teams arrived in that area looking for the suspects they \nhad been instructed to apprehend.\n\nMr Owen Marpoondin  Mr Marpoondin has lived on Palm Island since he was four years old. He was a board \nmember of ATSILS on Palm Island from 2002-2006. As part of his duties as a board member of ATSILS, he \ntransported people to court in the ATSILS car and assisted the legal and field officers to provide other services to \nthe community. During this time, he worked with Ms Sailor. Mr Marpoondin had known Mulrunji since they were \nchildren, as they both grew up on Palm Island. His evidence related to his attendance at the police station with Ms \nSailor after they found out about Mulrunji\u2019s death and his attendance at the houses of Mulrunji\u2019s partner, Ms Tracy \nTwaddle, and mother, Ms Doris Doomadgee, with DI Webber and other police officers for the purpose of informing \nthe family of Mulrunji\u2019s death.  I found Mr Marpoondin gave fairly straightforward answers to the questions he was \nasked. Although his answers were often brief, I am satisfied his evidence was reliable.\n\nMr Albert Wotton  Mr Albert Wotton is the son of Mr Lex Wotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton. He has lived on Palm \nIsland all of his life. At the time of giving his evidence, he was a trainee health worker at the Joyce Palmer Medical \nCentre on Palm Island. His evidence primarily related to the entry and search of his home by police on 27 \nNovember 2004. He was 12 years old at the time of the entry and search.  Mr Albert Wotton was a quietly spoken \nwitness, but I found his evidence sincere and carefully given. I accept that he remains afraid of the police, and this \ncame through very much in his oral evidence. Although his evidence about the precise sequence of events when \nthe SERT officers came to the Wotton house was challenged in cross-examination, on the whole I found his \nevidence reliable. If there were some small inaccuracies in his recollection of the sequence of events, this did not \naffect the reliability of his key evidence.\n\nMs Krysten Harvey  Ms Harvey is the niece of Mr Lex Wotton and the granddaughter of Mrs Agnes Wotton. She \nhas also lived on Palm Island all of her life. Until around September 2014, when she gave birth to her son, Ms \nHarvey was employed as a teacher\u2019s aide at St Michael\u2019s Primary School on Palm Island. At the time of the events \nin issue in this proceeding, Ms Harvey was sixteen years old. She was at Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house on the day of \nthe arrests, entries and searches and her evidence relates predominantly to her experiences during the entry and \nsearch of Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house.  I found Ms Harvey to be a most straightforward witness, with a good \nrecollection of the events she recounted. Reliving those events prompted some distress in her, which was obviously \ngenuine. Where her evidence differs from the evidence or submissions put by the respondents about what \nhappened inside Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house, I prefer her evidence. I am satisfied what happened in Agnes Wotton\u2019s \nhouse was a singular and terrifying experience for Ms Harvey, and she has neither forgotten what occurred, nor \nmistakenly reconstructed aspects of it.\nWednesday, 23 September 2015\n\nMrs Agnes Wotton  Mrs Agnes Wotton is the second applicant in this matter and the mother of the first applicant, \nLex Wotton. Mrs Wotton is a resident of Palm Island and has lived there since approximately 1957, when she was \nforcibly relocated to the island at the age of around 13 years. She lived in one of the dormitories in the \u2018Mission\u2019 \narea of the island between the age of 13 until her marriage at the age of 17 years. I set out the evidence about the \ndormitories at [33] to [39] above. Mrs Wotton became a Palm Island Councillor in the 1970s and was a member of \nthe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the early 1980s. She became a land rights activist in the \nmid-1980s and an advocate for the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into \nAboriginal Deaths in Custody after the Commission handed down its final report in 1991. It is clear she has been a \n\n\n\nprominent member of the Palm Island community for many years. Her evidence related to her personal \nexperiences growing up on Palm Island, what she observed and heard at community meetings after Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath, and the events surrounding the arrest of Mr Lex Wotton.  Although she is now in her seventies and not in the \nbest of health, I accept Mrs Wotton is a senior and respected member of the Palm Island community. Her personal \nstory of how she came to Palm Island is a sadly typical example of the removal of young Aboriginal children from \ntheir families and communities in the mid-20th century. Her evidence was carefully given, and I accept her as an \nhonest witness, although there were parts of her evidence when her memory failed her. She gave sincere evidence \nabout the impact of being prevented from attending Mulrunji\u2019s funeral. She was prevented from attending the \nfuneral because she was required to stay in Townsville for six to eight weeks after she was charged with rioting with \ndamage in connection with the events on Palm Island. The charges against her were later dropped.\n\nMs Schanara Bulsey  Ms Bulsey is the daughter of Mr Lex Wotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton. She has lived on Palm \nIsland most of her life. Ms Bulsey recently spent eight years living in Townsville, before returning to Palm Island. \nMs Bulsey\u2019s grandfather is Mr David Bulsey. When she gave her evidence in September 2015, Ms Bulsey had been \nemployed as an administrative officer at the Joyce Palmer Hospital on Palm Island for five months. Ms Bulsey was \nat the home of Mr Lex Wotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton on the night of the police entry and search of their house, \nwhen her father was arrested.  I am satisfied Ms Bulsey gave honest evidence about what she could recollect. In \nparts, she was able to provide considerable detail, which I accept was from genuine recollection. In other parts, her \nrecollection was less clear. Given the events she described were traumatic for her, it is unsurprising her recollection \nof detail is varied. Her distress, more than a decade later, was obvious and still raw. In cross-examination she made \nappropriate concessions, but in general I accept her evidence, including where it differs from, or conflicts with, the \nevidence given on behalf of the respondents.\n\nMr William Neville Blackman (Mr Blackman Senior)  Mr Blackman Senior has lived on Palm Island since he was 16 \nor 17 years of age. At the time of giving his evidence, Mr Blackman Senior was working in a diversion program \nfunded by the Palm Island Community Company. Mr Blackman Senior stated that he was a close friend of Mulrunji. \nHe gave evidence that he became friends with Mulrunji when they were both children and they grew up together. Mr \nBlackman Senior\u2019s grandfather arrived on Palm Island in 1918. His grandmother was brought to Palm Island as a \nchild, where she resided in the girls\u2019 dormitory on Palm Island. Mr Blackman Senior was arrested and charged with \nrioting with damage in connection with the events of 26 November 2004. As part of his bail conditions, he was \nprohibited from staying on Palm Island in the time leading up to the hearing of his charges. Consequently, he \nstayed in Townsville for a period of around six months and like Mrs Wotton was unable to attend Mulrunji\u2019s funeral. \nTwo of the charges against him were subsequently dropped and he was found not guilty of a third.  Having \ndescribed himself as a \u201cclose mate\u201d of Mulrunji, a decade later his anger and frustration about Mulrunji\u2019s death was \nstill evident. His evidence about the sequence of events when police came to his house and his subsequent \nsurrender to police was given in a straightforward manner. The impact of not attending Mulrunji\u2019s funeral was clear \nin his evidence. In cross-examination, he made appropriate concessions about factual issues. Despite being \nchallenged in cross-examination, he was firm in his evidence that his mother came with him when he gave himself \nup to police. I found his evidence reliable.\n\nMs Mersane Oui  Ms Oui is the de facto partner of Mr Blackman Senior. This was also the case in November 2004. \nShe gave evidence about the evening the SERT teams came to their home.  Ms Oui appeared to me to have a \ngood recollection of the entry and search of her house by police. Although she was not as emotional during her \nevidence as some of the witnesses (albeit that she was visibly upset), it was apparent the incident was frightening \nand distressing for her. Like the other witnesses called by the applicants, my impression is that the entry and search \nwas a singular event in her life that has had lasting consequences.\n\nMr William Lloyd Blackman (Mr Blackman Junior)  Mr Blackman Junior is the son of Mr Blackman Senior. Mr \nBlackman Junior was born on Palm Island and has spent all of his life on Palm Island. He gave evidence about the \npolice entries and searches and their effect on him. He was about 12 years old at the time.  I found Mr Blackman \nJunior to be quite a reticent witness, who gave what I consider to be reasonably reliable evidence about the SERT \nentry and search of his family home and its effect on him. Given his age at the time, his evidence was \nunsurprisingly limited to a few critical aspects of that event as it directly related to him. On occasions, he showed \n\n\n\nsomething of a steady resolve under questioning, especially in cross-examination. For example, when pressed \nabout the use of alcohol, he responded \u201ceverybody drinks, not just on Palm Island\u201d. I accept his evidence.\nThursday, 24 September 2015\n\nMr John Clumpoint  Mr Clumpoint has lived on Palm Island since he was 10 years old. He is a carpenter by trade \nand has four children. In his evidence, Mr Clumpoint said that he was related to Mulrunji and knew him very well. \nHe referred to Mulrunji as his \u201clittle brother\u201d. Mr Clumpoint was told about Mulrunji\u2019s death by Mulrunji\u2019s partner, \nTracey Twaddle. He gave evidence about, among other things, how Mulrunji\u2019s death affected him and the events on \nthe day of the entry and search. He was one of the suspects arrested on 27 November 2004, and spent time in \ncustody as a result although two of the charges against him were dropped and he was acquitted of a third.  Mr \nClumpoint presented as something of a broken man. The causes of this could be many and varied. There were \nsome real difficulties in the way his evidence was adduced, because leading questions were regularly employed. In \na general sense, it may be accepted that the way he was treated in his sudden arrest and his inability to return to \nlive and work on Palm Island had a material effect on the breakdown of his family relationships. Under cross-\nexamination he became stronger in his answers and he adhered quite adamantly to his account of events when \nchallenged. Ultimately, I am satisfied he attempted to give honest evidence, but he was somewhat confused about \nwhat happened on the day of the entry and search.\n\nMr Chevez Morton  Mr Morton has lived on Palm Island all of his life. He has previously been employed as a \npainter with the local Council although he was not employed at the time of giving evidence. Mrs Agnes Wotton is Mr \nMorton\u2019s great aunt. He was at Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house, playing hide and seek, at the time of the SERT entry \nand search. He was nine years old at the time.  When he came to give evidence, Mr Morton was tense and \nappeared extremely nervous. He took deep breaths from time to time and tended to stare straight ahead of him, \nrather than look at anybody in the room. He appeared frightened \u2013 his hands were visibly shaking. A considerable \npart of his obvious fear related to the events he was being asked to recall and relate. I found his evidence vivid and \ncompelling, and I accept he was relating genuine recollections of what happened to him. His evidence about his \nongoing fear of police was poignant. He withstood challenges to his version of events under cross-examination.\n\nMs Collette Wotton  Ms Collette Wotton is the daughter of Mrs Agnes Wotton and the sister of Mr Lex Wotton. She \nhas lived on Palm Island her whole life. She has three other siblings: Gerald, Lance and Anthony. She has four \nchildren of her own and five grandchildren. Ms Wotton had previously worked at St Michael\u2019s Primary School for 20 \nyears in administration, as a parent liaison and as a community Indigenous support worker. That is where she was \nemployed in November 2004. She gave evidence about the community meetings after Mulrunji\u2019s death, her \nconversation with her niece Ms Krysten Harvey after Ms Harvey\u2019s experiences with the SERT entry and search at \nMrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house, and the entry and search of her own house.  Ms Wotton presented as a very sincere \nperson dedicated to her family but also to the Palm Island community. Her roots in this community are clearly deep: \nfor example, her evidence about hearing of Mulrunji\u2019s death while on an overnight stay in Townsville and that she \ncould not wait to get back home to her family. It was plain she still feels considerable resentment towards the police \nand the way they conducted themselves in the days after Mulrunji\u2019s death. She was able to give her own narrative \nof the events of 19 to 24 November 2004, but her evidence had an air of generality about it which led me to place \nless weight on her narrative than on some of the other witnesses. It appeared to me that some of that narrative may \nnot have been actual recollections of what she saw and what she heard, but could well have been based on what \nshe has subsequently learned. She became somewhat combative under cross-examination, but I find that is \nexplicable by the degree of anger she still has towards the QPS. Nevertheless, her evidence conveyed a strong \nsense of injustice about how the QPS dealt with the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death, their failure to work closely \nwith the community in the days and weeks following that event, and what she saw as heavy-handed policing.\n\nMr Zacchias Sam  Mr Sam is a pensioner and has lived on Palm Island all of his life. In 2004, he was the CEO and \nthen Deputy Mayor of the Council. He said he saw Mulrunji grow up as he used to visit Mulrunji\u2019s parents\u2019 house \nregularly. He gave evidence about the community and Council meetings he attended after Mulrunji\u2019s death.  He \nexhibited a genuine focus on community welfare, but Mr Sam\u2019s recollection of specific events was not strong and I \nam unable to place much weight on his evidence.\n\n\n\nMs Cecilia Wotton  Ms Cecilia Wotton is married to Mr Lex Wotton and gave her evidence over 24, 25 and 28 \nSeptember 2015. She and Mr Wotton have been in a relationship for 20 years. At the time of giving her evidence, \nshe was working as a cleaner at the Joyce Palmer Health Service on Palm Island. Her family has a significant \nhistory on Palm Island: her grandfather was a Palm Islander and her uncle was involved in the 1957 strike. Ms \nWotton had a close relationship with Mulrunji\u2019s elder sister, Claudelle, who lived with Ms Wotton and her family for a \nperiod of time. While Claudelle was living with Ms Wotton, Mulrunji would often visit Ms Wotton\u2019s family house and \nspend time with Ms Wotton\u2019s family. In November 2004, Lex Wotton and Ms Wotton had a number of children living \nwith them, including their own. Ms Wotton gave evidence about, among other things, the police entries and \nsearches after the protests and fires, and the effects that Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest and imprisonment had on her and her \nfamily.  Ms Wotton was a fragile witness. Recalling the events of the entries and searches was distressing for her. \nMy impression was she was reluctant to say out loud too much of what she remembered. Her evidence about the \neffects and aftermath of Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was circumscribed, although in part this was due to the manner of \nexamination in chief, which was again peppered with leading questions. Her answers in cross-examination \ndisclosed a firmness about her recollection which I found reliable. She was honest in answering questions in cross-\nexamination about her struggles in day-to-day life, while accepting in what I found to be a stoic way that she could \nget through the day. She is obviously a self-reliant kind of person. Her quiet nature and her tendency for stoicism \nled, in my opinion, to something of an under-emphasis in her descriptions of how traumatic the events of November \n2004 and their aftermath had been for her and her family.\nMonday, 28 September 2015\n\nMr Anthony Koch  Mr Koch is a retired journalist. His experience ranged from working in the Queensland Justice \nDepartment in Brisbane for 10 years as a shorthand court reporter, to working for the Courier Mail for 22 years first \nas a political reporter and later an associate editor. He was also a chief reporter with The Australian newspaper for \n10 years, where he focused on Indigenous affairs. Mr Koch has been awarded a Walkley award for journalism five \ntimes, along with numerous other local and international awards.  While he was with The Australian, he described \nworking hard to obtain the trust of the Palm Island community, so that he was able to report on various stories from \nthe island. On 26 November 2004, Mr Koch received a telephone call from a Palm Island community member, who \ntold him about the fires and the protests. He travelled to Palm Island the next day. His evidence related to his \nexperiences and observations reporting on Palm Island and talking to community members in the days after his \narrival.  I found Mr Koch to be a down to earth kind of man, with a wide range of life experience. He is clearly an \nexperienced and distinguished journalist. As chief reporter for The Australian, I accept he had a leading role in \nreporting on Indigenous affairs. He had been to Palm Island at least 12 times prior to November 2004 and his \nparticular interests in, and familiarity with, Palm Island gave him a perspective of, and level of experience about, \nthe island which was well beyond any other non-Aboriginal witness in this proceeding. He exhibited a clear \nindependent streak, evident in his account of how he chose to go to Palm Island during the unrest. This was his \nevidence:Yes. Yes. I decided to \u2013 I spoke to ..... and I got on a plane and came to Townsville that night. I had \u2013 I \nwas then contacted by Murandoo Yanner, who\u2019s a very outspoken Aboriginal activist, if you like, from Burketown. \nBut he had very strong connections with Palm Island. He \u2013and people were in touch with him, and he said that I \nshould meet up in the morning with a local man called Brad Foster \u2013 I didn\u2019t know Brad \u2013 and that he would, you \nknow, introduce me to people and look after me on the island, and \u2013 and so I did. I met Foster the next morning, \nand we or I hired a helicopter and \u2013 and we went over to the island, because I had been told then \u2013 by that time, I \nhad been told that any planes that were leaving on the island with journalists on that police were meeting them \nand then shepherding them into the school there, where they were \u2013 well, the term used was \u201cembedded\u201d, but \nwhere they were to stay, but they were under the eye of the police. I mean, they weren\u2019t held there against their will \nor anything, but they didn\u2019t have free access to the island.\n\n And what was your view about that?---Well, that wouldn\u2019t have suited me, so the arrangement was that we fly to \nthe island and \u2013 and hopefully get \u2013 and stay in the Foster home, out \u2013 just up from the general store there.\n\n So in the central part of - - -?---Yes, so I would have free access, yes, to island to speak to people. Yes.\n\n\n\n And is that what happened?---Yes. That\u2019s what happened.\n\n And you stayed in the Foster home, it sounds like - - -?---I did for the whole period. I think I was there for eight or \n10 days. Yes.  I consider Mr Koch was conscientiously recalling what he could from 27 November 2004 onwards \nand was attempting to be accurate, although in cross-examination some assumptions and glosses on his evidence \nwere exposed. There were some aspects of his evidence that disclosed a sense of the legacy of Palm Island\u2019s \nhistory on the community in November 2004. Two examples will suffice.  First, Mr Koch gave evidence that at about \n2 am on 28 November 2004, while he was driving around the island and talking to people, he was approached by \nMrs Renata Pryor (whose name was also sometimes spelled \u201cPrior\u201d in the materials in evidence), the mother of \nWilliam Blackman Senior. Mrs Pryor recognised Mr Koch because five years earlier he had interviewed Mrs Pryor\u2019s \nfather, Peter Prior. Peter Prior was the man who had shot Superintendent Robert Curry in 1930 in the incident I \ndescribe at [36] above and was about 90 years old at the time of the interview with Mr Koch. During the interview, \nMr Prior had told Mr Koch that, immediately after the murder charge against him in relation to Mr Curry\u2019s death was \ndropped and Mr Prior was released from prison, the police arrested and imprisoned him again, without charge, on \nthe pretext that it was for his own protection because Superintendent Curry\u2019s brother wanted to kill him. Against the \nbackground of that experience, Mrs Pryor was extremely worried for her son, Mr Blackman, who at that time was \nhiding from the police. Mr Koch and Mrs Pryor drove around and eventually found Mr Blackman. At Mrs Pryor\u2019s \nrequest, Mr Koch photographed Mr Blackman\u2019s body in an attempt to record that he did not have any bruises or \nbullet holes in him because Mrs Pryor and Mr Blackman were afraid that he would be injured by the police.  \nSecond, Mr Koch gave evidence indicating that, as in other Aboriginal communities, the Palm Island Council was \nvery influential on Palm Island and could have assisted the QPS with apprehending people in a less confrontational \nmanner. His evidence was that Mr Robert Blackley, who had previously been Mayor of Palm Island, had told him \nthat if the police wanted to arrest people all they had to do was go to the Council and ask that those people make \nthemselves available and the Council could make that happen. Mr Koch\u2019s evidence was that he found Mr Blackley\u2019s \nopinion to be reasonable based on his own observations about the power and influence of elected councils in \nAboriginal communities.  By reason of the perspective he brought, I found Mr Koch\u2019s evidence to be more balanced \nthan that of many of the respondents\u2019 witnesses, which I found defensive and without appreciation of the history \nand nature of the Palm Island community. Therefore, I gave considerable weight to his evidence about what he \nsaw in the time after 26 November 2004.\n\nDr Rosalind Kidd  Dr Kidd gave evidence via video link. She is an academic historian who graduated with a Doctor \nof Philosophy from Griffith University, Brisbane in 1995. She specialises in Indigenous affairs and, throughout her \ncareer, has submitted reports to numerous inquiries and committees relating to Indigenous affairs. Dr Kidd was \nretained by the applicants to provide a historical report on Palm Island including an overview of how the settlement \non Palm Island came to be established, the strike of 1957 and historical policing on Palm Island. Her report was \nan annexure to her affidavit sworn on 16 June 2015.  Dr Kidd began her oral evidence as a careful witness making \nappropriate concessions and qualifications. But as her cross-examination tended to show, her method was not as \nrigorous as it should have been. For example, at [3.2.26] of Dr Kidd\u2019s report, she states that: \u201creports during 1970 \nshowed only 165 houses for 1300 people on the island, resulting in gross overcrowding and unhealthy home \nconditions caused by the impossibility of keeping the houses clean.\u201d In the footnote to this statement, Dr Kidd cites \na document at pages 118-119 of the extracts to her report headed \u201cTraining officer\u2019s comments on L/O\u2019s reports\u201d \nand dated November 1969 to March 1970. However, that particular source document does not support a statement \nthat the conditions of homes on Palm Island were \u201cunhealthy\u201d. The only negative statements about the conditions \nof homes on Palm Island in that document are that there was an overcrowding problem (and the population \nstatistics and the number of homes Dr Kidd uses are stated) and that \u201c[i]n several homes, the wives have done their \nbest to keep their homes clean, but due to the lack of room, it has been impossible for them to keep their homes as \nwe expect them to.\u201d  This statement at [3.2.29] of Dr Kidd\u2019s report was also challenged during cross-\nexamination:Yet another gastroenteritis epidemic struck, killing one child and hospitalising a further 55. Ten of the \nmost critically ill children were sent to Townsville Hospital where the medical superintendent said chronic severe \nmalnutrition on the Island left many children looking like \u2018starved Biafrans\u2019.  The source Dr Kidd cites to support this \nstatement, a newspaper article titled \u201cGastro Victims \u2018Like Biafrans\u2019\u201d \u2013 which appears to be from the Townsville \nDaily Bulletin on 21 September 1973 \u2013 actually states:Many of the Palm Island children who were admitted to \n\n\n\nhospital with gastro-enteritis were like \u201cnewspaper photographs we have seen of starving Biafran children,\u201d the \nMedical Superintendent of the Townsville General Hospital, Dr. D. Bowler, said yesterday. \n\n \u201cThe extreme undernourishment of many of the children made them especially susceptible to the many bugs on the \nisland which could have caused the epidemic,\u201d he said.  I agree with senior counsel for the respondents that Dr \nKidd did not accurately summarise the medical superintendent\u2019s statement\u00b8 in that his statement was about the \nappearance of children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis rather than children on the island generally.  I \nconsider that at various points in her report, Dr Kidd was given to imposing some glosses and exaggeration on the \nhistorical record. That is not to diminish the underlying subject matter of her report, which disclosed terrible \nconditions on Palm Island and the attitude of state and federal authorities in forcibly removing individuals, families, \nand parts of families to Palm Island and then virtually imprisoning them there.  However, none of the broad \nopinions she expressed were subject to any challenge under cross-examination. The historical material attached \nand referred to in her report, which was not challenged, provides insight into the historical conditions on Palm \nIsland and the attitude of the authorities to Aboriginal people living there. I have relied on this material at [23] to [59] \nabove, and on some of Dr Kidd\u2019s opinions, where I found them to be well-founded in the historical material to which \nshe referred.\n\nMs Jacinta Barry  Ms Barry came forward during the hearings on Palm Island. Leave was granted to the applicants \nto add her as a witness and she was called on 28 and 29 September 2015. Ms Barry has lived on Palm Island all of \nher life. She is mother to seven children and Mulrunji was her first cousin. It was Ms Barry\u2019s evidence that she knew \nMulrunji very well and that she spent considerable time with him when she was younger. Ms Barry\u2019s house was \nentered and searched by SERT officers on 27 November 2004 and her evidence related mostly to that incident.  Ms \nBarry\u2019s position as, in substance, a \u201cvolunteer\u201d witness who put herself forward is of some significance. Her \nevidence of the entry and search of her house by SERT officers was vivid and believable. She spoke about the \nimpact of the entry and search, in terms of her fear of the police. I accept her fear is genuine, although I consider \nMrs Barry may have exaggerated it a little in her evidence. There is no doubt she is focused on the entries and \nsearches as the source of her anxiety and difficulties in life. The evidence was insufficient to reach any conclusion \non that issue, nor is any such conclusion necessary because these reasons do not address relief in relation to \nmembers of the subgroup.\nTuesday, 29 September 2015\n\nEmeritus Professor Jon Altman  Professor Altman, who is an economist and anthropologist, gave evidence via \nvideo link from the Court\u2019s Sydney Registry. He is an Emeritus Professor and Visiting Fellow at the Australian \nNational University\u2019s Regulatory Institution Network, a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia \nand an adjunct Professorial Fellow at the Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods at Charles Darwin \nUniversity in Darwin. The respondents did not challenge his qualifications or his experience in working with \nIndigenous people, and in working on a variety of Indigenous policy issues with federal and state governments, \nAboriginal and Torre Strait Islander organisations and communities, and non-government organisations.  Professor \nAltman was engaged by the applicant\u2019s solicitors to provide information on the extent of the socio-economic \ndeprivation on Palm Island. Professor Altman produced a report with his colleague Dr Nicholas Biddle, which was \nannexed to his affidavit dated 3 September 2015. There was also no challenge by the respondents to Dr Biddle\u2019s \nexpertise.  Professor Altman was a measured and impressive witness. His explanations for the use of the 2006 \ncensus data in relation to the circumstances on Palm Island in 2004 were persuasive, even though the data post-\ndates those circumstances, and I had no difficulty in relying on that material. His evidence was of limited relevance \nto the issues I have to decide, but it was of high quality.\n\nMr Lex Wotton  Mr Wotton is the lead applicant in this proceeding. He gave oral evidence on 29 and 30 September \nand 1 October 2015. He has lived his whole life on Palm Island, aside from a year at Townsville while in high \nschool, and time he was forced to spend away from Palm Island as a result of the charges and subsequent \nconviction arising out of the events of 26 November 2004. His partner is Ms Cecilia Wotton and, as I have indicated, \nthey have a number of children. He is a plumber by trade and, at the time of giving his evidence, was employed by \nthe Palm Island Council. Mr Wotton was convicted of rioting with destruction and was sentenced to a term of six \nyears\u2019 imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years, and allowance of 110 days for time served. After his \n\n\n\nconviction he spent 20 months in custody.  In some respects, I found Mr Wotton a difficult witness to assess. He \ninitially gave his evidence in monotone, seeming to have something of a forced calmness of attitude about him. His \nevidence in chief tended to be somewhat rambling and lacked focus. I do not wish to be unduly critical of him, \nbecause I accept this was a testing experience for him and it is the case that little control was exercised over his \nevidence in chief. At various times, his evidence tended to be irrelevant to the issues in the proceeding. An example \nof this was how he interrupted his own narrative of the events that took place on Palm Island on Tuesday, 23 \nNovember 2004 to commence a long discourse about the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. On \noccasion, he seemed determined to say what he wanted to say, irrespective of the questions asked by his counsel. \nIn cross-examination, Mr Wotton also seemed determined at times not to answer a question unless it was \ncompletely non-controversial. He asked for clarification of questions that were straightforward, including where the \nanswers he may have had to give were not necessarily going to reflect well on him. Thus, I find there was some \nevasiveness in his evidence.  However, when he started describing what happened at the community meetings that \ntook place on Monday, 22 November 2004 and thereafter, his account became more animated and appeared to be \nmore composed of actual recollection. That said, it is my opinion he sought to downplay his role at the meetings \nand protests, and he certainly downplayed matters such as the kind of language used. I prefer to rely on the \ncontemporaneous video footage for my conclusions about these events, as I also found Inspector Whyte\u2019s evidence \nexaggerated, one-sided, unduly emotive and unreliable.  How Mr Wotton presented in the witness box was in stark \ncontrast to the angry, confrontational man who can be seen in the video footage. My sense was he was working \nhard to be measured and controlled in his evidence. That does not mean I found his emotions when speaking about \nthe arrests, entries and searches not to be genuine, but I am not confident that his evidence disclosed the whole of \nhis personality, and therefore I am not confident about how reliable his evidence is in terms of the level of impact he \ncontends these events had on him. The significant contrast between how he appears in the video footage and his \ndemeanour and attitude in this proceeding must be taken into account, allowing of course for the fact that no \nindividual is one-dimensional. That said, I did find Mr Wotton\u2019s account of how he was tasered and arrested, how he \nheard his children \u2018singing\u2019 out, and how frightened he observed them to be, to be a genuine account.  I have made \nalmost all my findings in this proceeding without needing to rely heavily on Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence. That is because, \nwhere possible, I have preferred to rely on the contemporaneous documentary and video evidence. However, I \nfound his evidence about the sizes of the crowds on various occasions, and the general sequence of events, to be \nreliable. I also found his account of what occurred at his home when he was arrested to be reliable.  Where his \nevidence must be squarely confronted is in his damages claim. It is in this aspect of the proceeding that I have been \nunable to give full force and effect to all he said in oral evidence. In contrast to his partner, Ms Cecilia Wotton, I \nsimply did not find his evidence wholly persuasive. I have no doubt that his arrest and imprisonment have \noccasioned significant hardship for him, as well as for his family. However, I also consider that Mr Wotton is a \nparticularly tough and resilient individual, and an individual who is capable of being highly assertive and \nconfrontational. Therefore, I cannot wholly accept the picture of a highly controlled, softly spoken, measured \nindividual that he presented in this proceeding. I consider there are other, tougher, dimensions to his personality \nwhich were apparent on 26 November 2004, and which reduce the likelihood that he suffered the same kind of \ndebilitating, long term impact from the arrests, entries and searches and his arrest that Ms Cecilia Wotton suffered, \nto take one example.\nWednesday, 30 September 2015\n\nDr Diana Eades  At the time of giving her evidence, Dr Eades was a consultant sociolinguist and Adjunct Professor \nin the School of Behavioural, Cognitive and Social Sciences at the University of New England. In 2010, Dr Eades \nwas elected as a Fellow to the Australian Academy of the Humanities and, at the time of giving her evidence, was \nhead of Section of Linguistics Fellows. Dr Eades was retained by the applicants to review the interviews conducted \nby non-Indigenous police officers with Aboriginal witnesses. Her brief included, amongst other things, providing an \nexpert opinion on the issues of language and culture that arise when interviewing or taking evidence from Aboriginal \nwitnesses, the circumstances in which a support person would be required to attend an interview with an Aboriginal \nwitness, and whether there were any issues or difficulties with the way interviews with certain Aboriginal witnesses \nwere conducted in this case. In answering the latter question, Dr Eades was asked to provide her opinion on \nspecific excerpts from the interview transcripts, which she did.  Dr Eades was an impressive witness. I found her \nthorough and measured in her evidence, which was also objective and well-balanced. The respondents did not \n\n\n\nchallenge her expertise or experience, which were impeccable. Overall, she was a knowledgeable and helpful \nwitness.\n\nMr Stephen Ralph  At the time of giving his evidence, Mr Ralph was a consultant Forensic Psychologist. He has a \nMaster of Arts (Hons) in Psychology from the University of Sydney. Mr Ralph was retained by the applicants to \nprovide an assessment of whether Lex Wotton, Cecilia Wotton and Agnes Wotton suffered any psychological harm \nas a result of the conduct of the police in relation to the Palm Island riots and their aftermath. Mr Ralph\u2019s report \nincludes details on each individual\u2019s history, any treatment or counselling received, the individual\u2019s condition and \nany associated disabilities, the likely cause of that condition, the prognosis (including the likely duration of the \ncondition) and any further treatment or rehabilitation the individual might benefit from. Although he produced a \nsingle report, each of the three individuals he reported on were separately interviewed, and did not see those parts \nof his report relating to the others.  I found Mr Ralph to be a careful witness, who moderated what he said in an \nappropriate way. I found his evidence insightful. The weight of his evidence, however, may be affected by \ninaccuracies and inconsistencies in some of the history given to him by Ms Cecilia Wotton, as well as (he frankly \nconceded) matters that Ms Wotton apparently chose not to tell him. The respondents\u2019 challenge in cross-\nexamination \u2013 namely, that his focus was rather narrow \u2013 has force. Mr Ralph took no substantial medical history \nand obtained no medical records for any of the three individuals. He did not consider or examine events in their \nlives prior to Mulrunji\u2019s death in custody and he did not much examine the possible effects of events after November \n2004. It does seem, for example, that Mr Ralph may have paid insufficient regard to the 18 months the Wottons \nspent in Townsville while Mr Wotton\u2019s criminal process was underway. Nevertheless, I consider his opinions about \nMs Cecilia Wotton and Mr Wotton should be given some weight. I also consider there was force in his reasoning \nabout the effects of an apology for each of the applicants. I return to these issues in more detail in the Relief section \nof these reasons.\nThe respondents\u2019 witnesses  \nFriday, 2 October 2015\n\nInspector David Dini  At the time of giving his evidence, Inspector Dini was the Officer in Charge of the QPS Far \nNorth District Cross-Cultural Liaison Patrol Group based in Cairns. In November 2004, Inspector Dini was a Senior \nSergeant employed by the QPS performing the role of Officer in Charge of the Townsville Cross-Cultural Liaison \nUnit. His evidence relates to his experiences on Palm Island after his arrival there on 26 November 2004.  \nInspector Dini began as a relatively straightforward witness. However, there were some aspects of his recollection \nwhich were puzzling \u2013 such as that he was unable to recall a group of children around where he and other officers \nwere standing on Reservoir Ridge when he arrived on Palm Island, looking down toward the fires at the Police \nStation. In the video evidence, these children are visible and noisy. While I accept his focus at the time was on the \nfires and what was happening at the police barracks, as his evidence went on, it had something of a rehearsed \nquality to it and it seemed to me he was unprepared for questions about matters he had not anticipated.  In \ncommon with several QPS witnesses, I found his descriptions of events tended to be self-serving, particularly in the \nway he described the level of risk and threat on Palm Island during this time. For example, his evidence concerning \nwhat was happening when QPS officers were lined up outside the hospital involved a description by him of \n\u201cmissiles\u201d being thrown at police officers. The lengthy videos of that event that were in evidence do not show any \nlocal people throwing anything. An express question was put to Mr Wotton in cross-examination whether he saw \nrocks being thrown at police officers outside the hospital, to which he gave a firm \u2018no\u2019. In contrast, Mr Wotton \nadmitted he saw people throwing rocks outside the barracks. There was nothing visible in the video evidence that \nwould fit the description of a \u201cmissile\u201d, and no more precise evidence was adduced by the respondents to support \nassertions of this kind. When he was pressed in cross-examination, some of Inspector Dini\u2019s answers tended to be \nless clear and he tended to answer with denials. For example, he was cross-examined about a conversation it was \nalleged he had with Ms Sailor, which he firmly denied. As I have set out, I found Ms Sailor a reliable witness: in my \nopinion, it is more likely Inspector Dini has forgotten this conversation. My impression is that he was not focused at \nall on the local residents; he was focused on the police operations. I gave his evidence limited weight.\nMonday, 7 March 2016\n\nDr Jill Reddan  Dr Reddan is a Consultant Psychiatrist who currently practices privately from consultancy suites in \nBrisbane, as well as at the Prison Mental Health Service at West Moreton Hospital and Health Service in Wacol, \n\n\n\nQueensland. Dr Reddan was retained by the solicitors for the respondents to provide a medico-legal report in \nrelation to Ms Cecilia Wotton \u201con the papers\u201d \u2013 that is, without any examination of Ms Wotton. The respondents\u2019 \nsolicitors also requested that Dr Reddan assess Mr Ralph\u2019s Forensic Psychological Report on Ms Wotton.  Dr \nReddan produced a report dated 21 July 2015, which was limited to an assessment of Mr Ralph\u2019s report; she did \nnot provide an assessment of Ms Wotton on the papers. Dr Reddan\u2019s report highlights a number of weaknesses of \nMr Ralph\u2019s assessment process and report. In evidence in chief, Dr Reddan\u2019s affidavit dated 4 August 2015 was \ntendered, attaching her report. In cross-examination, Dr Reddan accepted that specialised skills are required to \nwork in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health and admitted that she has never worked in Aboriginal \ncommunities. She has only been to Palm Island once, in 1988 or 1989, and only for a couple of days. She pointed \nout, however, that she spends 60% of her working time in prisons and sees many Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander clients in that capacity.  I found Dr Reddan to be quite a defensive witness, and some of her opinions \nseemed rather too absolute. I did not find her evidence particularly helpful, and I found her criticisms of Mr Ralph to \nbe somewhat technical. Even putting these reservations to one side, what she did was conduct a \u2018desktop\u2019 review \nof Mr Ralph\u2019s reports, having never met the Wottons herself. In assessing damages, I am not inclined to give much \nweight to expert medical evidence of that kind.\n\nDetective Inspector Warren Webber  DI Webber gave evidence on 7, 8 and 9 March 2016. At the time of giving his \nevidence, he had approximately 40 years policing experience and was working in the state intelligence unit at QPS \npolice headquarters in Brisbane, holding the positions of Inspector and Operations Manager. At the time of \nMulrunji\u2019s death in November 2004, he was the regional crime coordinator for the Northern Region, which included \nPalm Island. As regional crime coordinator, his duties and responsibilities included the investigation of police-\nrelated incidents and the oversight of major criminal investigations in the Northern Region. He told the Court that \nthe position of regional crime coordinator was independent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, or CIB.  After being \ninformed of Mulrunji\u2019s death in custody on 19 November 2004, it was DI Webber\u2019s task to assemble a team of \npeople to travel with him to Palm Island to carry out an investigation. His evidence related to the nature and \nprocess of this investigation and the people involved, up until 24 November 2004, when the CMC took over \nresponsibility for the investigation.  DI Webber presented with a matter of fact demeanour, giving quite formal and \nbrief answers to questions. I found in his evidence he tended to emphasise the possibility of unrest in the \ncommunity, rather than exhibit any understanding about the effect of Mulrunji\u2019s death on local people. I also found \nthat, in common with other police witnesses, he sought to emphasise \u2018weapons\u2019 that local residents had. For \nexample, in answer to a question from the Court, he replied that he saw some local people with spears when they \nwere gathered in front of the line of police outside the hospital. He also gave some rather vague evidence about \nhaving seen Mr Wotton on a verandah of a house in between the hospital and the school with spears. It appears \nthis information also made its way into an executive briefing note drafted that day, which stated that Mr Wotton had \n\u201cencircled himself with supporters armed with spears, chains and other make shift weapons\u201d. Contrary to this kind \nof evidence, there was no cross-examination of the applicants\u2019 witnesses to confirm such views. There was, in \ncontrast, ample evidence about how local people used spears for fishing.  There is no contemporaneous video \nevidence showing any indication that any local people had spears. It was not put to Mr Wotton in cross-examination \nthat he or anyone he was with at any material time before or during 26 November 2004 were carrying spears. Both \nMr Wotton and Mr Marpoondin gave evidence about local men (including Mulrunji) going spear fishing, but that was \nthe extent of the evidence. I do not accept DI Webber\u2019s evidence, or the evidence of any other police witness, \nabout local people carrying spears at the meetings or gatherings during the week after Mulrunji\u2019s death. Whether \nofficers such as DI Webber mistook what they saw, I do not know. In contrast, during events such as the line-up at \nthe hospital, the police were fully armed and had police dogs.  DI Webber was quite frank in accepting the \ncriticisms that have been made of his conduct in the investigation by other bodies such as the CMC and in coronial \nfindings. From time to time in his evidence he accepted that some conduct was inappropriate \u2013 for example, he \nmade this concession about his decision to have a meal and beer with SS Hurley on the night of 19 November \n2004. At other times, he qualified his concession with an acknowledgement that, with the benefit of hindsight, he \ncould have done things differently. Overall, however, of all the respondents\u2019 witnesses, he was the officer most \nprepared to make reasonable concessions about the clear failures in aspects of QPS conduct during the events \nwith which this proceeding is concerned.  I found DI Webber to be a more reliable witness than Inspector Whyte, in \nterms of his account of what happened on and after 26 November 2004. That said, his evidence was to my mind \nstill carefully expressed so as to emphasise a level of threat supporting the views of QPS officers at the time, and \n\n\n\n(so far as I can ascertain) the consistent position of the QPS since 2004 in every inquiry or proceeding concerning \nthe level of threat to the physical safety of QPS officers. I set out my findings about that at various points below, \nincluding at [792]-[815].\nWednesday, 9 March 2016\n\nInspector Joe Kitching  Inspector Kitching gave his evidence on 9, 10 and 11 March 2016. At this time, he held the \nrank of Inspector of Operations (Northern Region) in the QPS. In November 2004, he held the rank of Detective \nSenior Sergeant, Officer in Charge of the Townsville CIB. He has approximately 30 years policing experience and, \nin November 2004, had been a detective for approximately 16 years. He was the most senior officer at the \nTownsville CIB at that time.  Inspector Kitching was appointed by DI Webber as the primary investigator into \nMulrunji\u2019s death. His evidence related to his role as primary investigator and the conduct of the investigations. He \nwas the officer primarily responsible for recording events in the police logs. These logs were more or less \ncontemporaneous records kept by the QPS and they assume some significance in aspects of the applicants\u2019 \nclaims.  Inspector Kitching gave quite matter of fact answers in his oral evidence. He presented as efficient, and \nsure of what he had and had not done. However, he also appeared quite agitated throughout his evidence and was \noften anxious to defend himself. That is to some extent understandable as he (like other officers such as DI \nWebber) has been through a series of inquiries and proceedings about these events on Palm Island, often aimed at \nscrutinising police conduct. He emphasised in his answers that whatever criticisms might be made of his conduct, \nor QPS conduct more generally, those criticisms could only be made with the benefit of hindsight. He was \npersistently reluctant to express any agreement with criticism of his conduct. For example the following finding of \nDeputy Chief Magistrate Hine (at [8] of the coronial report) was put to Inspector Kitching:The investigation of the \ndeath of Mulrunji by officers who knew Senior Sergeant Hurley and/or were from within Townsville District \nCommand was, in my view, unsatisfactory and inappropriate. The involvement of such officers undermined the \ncredibility of the investigation and its appearance of independence and impartiality. The conduct of investigating \nofficers and of Senior Sergeant Hurley during the first day of the investigation exacerbated this problem, in \nparticular the perception of collusion.  Inspector Kitching\u2019s response to this was:I suggest to you that that\u2019s an \naccurate representation of the position, isn\u2019t it?---That\u2019s what was found, yes.\n\n It\u2019s a fair reading of the facts?---That\u2019s what was found, yes.\n\n No. Listen to the question: it\u2019s a fair reading of the facts, would you agree?---That\u2019s what was commented on, yes, \nthat\u2019s correct. I understand. That\u2019s right.\n\n It\u2019s a fair reading of the facts, isn\u2019t it?---That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s how it was reported by Coroner Hine.  In this sense, I \nfound him a more defensive witness than DI Webber \u2013 at times, disproportionately defensive. There were aspects \nof his conduct which, even putting to one side whether they contravened s 9 of the RDA, were plainly open to \nlegitimate criticism. These include his failure to include a range of critical information on the Form 1 for the autopsy \nand his repeated failure to bring a number of allegations and circumstances about Mulrunji\u2019s death to the attention \nof the pathologist in any other way. However, Inspector Kitching was, unlike DI Webber, unprepared to make any \nconcessions about how his conduct might have been less than adequate. To that extent I am not prepared to place \ngreat reliance on his evidence where it was in conflict with, or different from, other witnesses, or different from the \ncontemporaneous evidence.\nFriday, 11 March 2016\n\nMr Gary Campbell  At the time he gave his evidence, Mr Gary Campbell was a senior investigator with the \nAustralian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. He was formerly employed by the QPS as a Detective Senior \nSergeant until March 2015. In November and December 2004, he was a Detective Sergeant employed by the QPS \nat the Townsville CIB. Mr Campbell was not on Palm Island, and had no involvement in any events occurring there, \nduring the period of 19 to 26 November 2004. Mr Campbell was directed to attend Palm Island after the protests \nand fires and was in charge, jointly with DS Robinson, of the on-island investigations into possible offences \ncommitted during the riot, under the oversight of the Townsville Major Incident Room (MIR). He gave evidence \nabout how he came to assume this role, how he and DS Robinson conducted their investigations, how they \ndeveloped the list of persons of interest to the criminal investigation into the protests and fires, their provision of this \n\n\n\nlist to SERT, and the instructions he gave to investigators once the persons of interest were apprehended.  Mr \nCampbell was a straightforward witness who spoke frankly about his role in the events on Palm Island in November \n2004. He staunchly defended the use of SERT teams. His response to a suggestion in cross-examination that \ncalling in SERT was \u201coverkill\u201d, and was done because it was an Aboriginal community was:I believe it was entirely \nappropriate on the back of the acts of extreme violence and property destruction that had occurred.  He referred \nagain to extreme violence when describing the events of 26 November 2004.  Consistently with the findings I have \nmade at [792]-[815], Mr Campbell\u2019s descriptions of the level of violence is not borne out by the contemporaneous \nevidence. In his case, he was not on the island at the time of these events and so does not fall into the category of \na QPS officer whom I accept may have had a subjective fear for her or his own safety, whether well-founded or not.\nMonday, 14 March 2016\n\nInspector Donald McKay (SERT Operative 1)  Inspector McKay gave evidence on 14 and 15 March 2016. At that \ntime, he was employed as an Inspector in the QPS, stationed in the Cairns SERT. He explained in his evidence that \nhe now has a \u201ccommission rank\u201d in SERT, so while he is still attached to SERT, he is no longer an operational \nmember. In November 2004, he was a Senior Sergeant in the QPS, performing the role of Officer in Charge of the \nFar Northern Region SERT. He has been a member of SERT since 1992. In the documentary evidence about the \nentries and searches, Inspector McKay is often referred to as SERT Operative 1. During the entries and searches, \nInspector McKay played an oversight and coordination role, which meant that he generally remained outside the \nresidences attended by the SERT teams.  He gave evidence about the nature of SERT, how SERT operations are \ngenerally run, and the details of this particular SERT operation. In relation to the latter, he gave evidence about the \ninformation and directions that were provided to SERT in their briefing, the actions of SERT upon arrival at the \nresidence of each person of interest, the equipment and weapons SERT officers carried, and SERT\u2019s activities at \nthe Wotton residence (including an account of the tasering of Mr Wotton).  Inspector MacKay\u2019s evidence was \ncouched in terms of \u2018tasks\u2019, and he presented himself very much as a functionary in that sense \u2013 doing the job he \nwas ordered to do, so as to achieve \u2018the outcome\u2019 those orders were directed at achieving. His evidence about the \ntasering of Mr Wotton was given in a clinical and positive way, despite Mr Wotton being present in court. If Inspector \nMackay had any insight into the effects of his actions, and the actions of the SERT team, on the individuals they \ninteracted with on Palm Island, it was not at all apparent in the way in which he gave his evidence. That said, I \nfound his evidence reasonably reliable in terms of the narrative of events.\nTuesday, 15 March 2016\n\nInspector Roger Whyte  Inspector Whyte gave his evidence on 15 and 16 March 2016. He has been employed by \nthe QPS for approximately 32 years and, at the time of giving his evidence, was working as an Inspector in the \nTownsville Patrol Group. In and around November 2004, he was a Senior Sergeant in the QPS, performing the role \nof Officer in Charge of Deeragun Police Division, Townsville. He gave evidence that between 1987 and 1997, he \nworked in Aboriginal communities in the Cape York region, including communities in Weipa, Aurukun, Kowanyama, \nLockhart River, Bamaga, Thursday Island and Pormpuraaw. He arrived on Palm Island on 22 November 2004 to \nact in SS Hurley\u2019s position as Officer in Charge of the Palm Island Police Station until further notice. He remained \nin that position until 26 November 2004.  Inspector Whyte gave evidence about what occurred after he arrived on \nPalm Island, leading up to 26 November 2004, and then what occurred during the protests and fires. He described \nan encounter between himself and Mr Wotton at the police station before the protests and fires, his negotiations \nwith Mr Wotton and his attempts to calm and talk to the crowd. He also gave evidence about the advice and \ninstructions he gave to the QPS officers under his command during the protests and fires, and events at the QPS \nbarracks and the hospital during the protests and fires.  Inspector Whyte presented as rather a nervous witness to \nbegin with, but became more assertive, especially on the second day of his evidence. I accept Inspector Whyte \nseems to have been personally affected by what happened on 26 November 2004, and that therefore giving \nevidence in this proceeding was not easy for him. Those difficulties may account for some of his confrontational and \nexaggerated evidence. However, in my opinion, they do not account for all of it. From what I observed of him in the \nwitness box and in the contemporaneous video evidence, Inspector Whyte\u2019s personality was such that he was \ngiven to aggression and confrontation as his \u2018default\u2019 positions for managing conflict or tense situations. I found \nInspector Whyte\u2019s evidence to be the most exaggerated and defensive of all the respondents\u2019 witnesses, and for \nthose reasons also the most unreliable.  This was the submission made by the applicants about Inspector Whyte in \ntheir closing submissions, citing his evidence in this proceeding and a police interview with him that occurred on 26 \n\n\n\nNovember 2004, after the protests and fires:[T]he Applicants note that SS Whyte was sent to Palm Island on 22 \nNovember 2004 to be the officer in charge of the station and Insp Richardson was sent in order to oversee the \npolicing operations. In respect of SS Whyte, the Applicants submit that his training in culturally sensitive policing \nwas wholly inadequate and rely on the following matters in that regard:  his description in his interview of 26 \nNovember 2004 of Mr Wotton as \u201cnot blackie blackie half cast\u201d and of David Bulsey as a \u201cskinny fella, half caste \nfella\u201d;\n  \n  his statements in that same interview that Aboriginal people \u201cwill turn on you when they\u2019re drinking alcohol\u201d and \nwill \u201cturn on you if they\u2019ve got something that, ah, really makes them go off\u201d;\n  \n  his attempt in his evidence to justify the remark that Aboriginal people will \u201cturn on you when they\u2019re drinking \nalcohol\u201d on the basis that, after he was \u201cpromoted to the rank of sergeant to take charge of the Pormpuraaw \nAboriginal community\u201d, of the 600 Aboriginal people in the Pormpuraaw community, there were \u201ctwo people that \ndidn\u2019t consume alcohol, to [his] knowledge\u201d;\n  \n  his disrespectful remark in the 26 November 2004 interview that \u201cthis is obviously the death of Doomadgee person \nmade them go off\u201d;\n  \n  his description during his evidence to the committal hearing of Lance Poynter being an \u201cugly looking fellow\u201d;\n  \n\n  the pride that he apparently took in having told Mr Wotton to \u201cfuck off\u201d outside the police barracks on 26 \nNovember 2004; and\n  \n\n  his remarks on 26 November 2004 in the police barracks to the other police officers that:it may be the case that \nyou have to discharge a few fuckin\u2019 rounds in the air to scare the shit out of these cunts. I don\u2019t know about you, but \nthat\u2019s fuckin\u2019 it, that\u2019s just ridiculous. There\u2019s not one court in the land, not one cunt anywhere in Australia that\u2019s \ngonna fuckin\u2019 put up with all this.\n(Footnotes omitted.)    The respondents accepted that Inspector Whyte could be described as having an \u201cus-and-\nthem mentality\u201d, but submitted that his evidence was \u201ccoloured by his experiences during the riot\u201d and that he was \nan \u201cold-school policeman ... from a different era brought up in a different general milieu [or] approach to things\u201d. In \nclosing submissions, senior counsel for the respondents made the following submissions in response to questions \nfrom the Court:HER HONOUR: - - - Mr Whyte, this us and them mentality. I mean, is the fear coming from the fact \nthat they are facing a group of black people?\n\n MR HINSON: We submit not. It\u2019s a group of people, armed with rocks, making threats who set fire to the police \nstation. It wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s what caused the fear. It\u2019s, we would submit \u2013 well, one can\u2019t \nreally \u2013 one can\u2019t think of a real life comparator and it\u2019s difficult to think of a hypothetical \u2013 this is an actual situation \nthat evolved and in terms of - - -\n\n HER HONOUR: Well, there were some riots in the middle of Melbourne not very long ago down on the street at \nFederation Square and Flinders Street Station where, no doubt, there were lots of police and there were lots of \nthings, as I understand the media reports, being thrown and there were ordinary policemen down there and women \ndealing with that situation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not sure why you say it\u2019s something so far out of the ordinary \nexperience of a police officer. They have a very dangerous job.\n\n MR HINSON: They do. But it\u2019s \u2013 an earlier version of the statement of claim described the riot as an \n\u201cunprecedented event\u201d which was - - -\n\n\n\n HER HONOUR: Well, it was clearly unprecedented on Palm Island, wasn\u2019t it?\n\n MR HINSON: Well, we would submit it was unprecedented more broadly than that.  Senior counsel for the \nrespondents also submitted that the language used by SS Whyte in his 26 November 2004 interview could be \nexplained on the basis that \u201cthis was an interview given by Mr Whyte late at night \u2013 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 after a long day \u2013 a \nlong and frightening day \u2013 and there\u2019s no basis for treating what he said on that occasion in those circumstances \nhas being his typical behaviour\u201d.  In my opinion, the applicants\u2019 submissions about Inspector Whyte are soundly \nbased, although the difficulty in Inspector Whyte\u2019s attitude went beyond a lack of training in \u201cculturally sensitive \npolicing\u201d. There were so many examples through his evidence, and from evidence of what he said and did while he \nwas on Palm Island in November 2004, that I am comfortable reaching a conclusion that Inspector Whyte brought a \nnegative attitude to his interactions with Aboriginal people, and he had a clear and regular propensity to stereotype \nthem, and to stereotype their lifestyles, attitudes and tendencies. Insofar as the respondents\u2019 submissions sought to \nminimise or excuse that attitude, or to suggest that it was simply the result of the circumstances on Palm Island in \nNovember 2004, I do not accept them.  When Inspector Whyte was asked in cross-examination about the kind of \nlanguage he can be heard using in a video from 26 November 2004, calling local people \u201ccunts\u201d, this was his \nresponse:at the time it was language used to enhance morale of my people.  There is some truth in this answer, but \nnot for the reason I consider Inspector Whyte intended to convey. When one watches and listens to the video in \nwhich these statements are made by Inspector Whyte, it is as if there is a battle in progress, between non-\nAboriginal (and mostly, if not only, white) police officers, and those who are perceived as their enemies. This was \nthe impression I had from a great deal of Inspector Whyte\u2019s evidence \u2013 Aboriginal people were the enemies, the \n\u2018other\u2019, the ones who could not be trusted, who needed overt and forceful policing and controlling. When he spoke \nabout his work in Aboriginal communities, as the applicants submitted, it had a controlling flavour to it: he gave no \nsense of co-operation or intention to work with communities he was policing. Indeed, as the applicants submitted, \nthe way Inspector Whyte expressed his earlier work in communities was not without significance:I was promoted to \nthe rank of sergeant, to take charge of the Pormpuraaw Aboriginal community.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Language can tell us much about the attitudes of individuals. In my opinion, this language \nreflects Inspector Whyte\u2019s attitudes to Aboriginal people. I have noted at [490] above his rather astonishing and \nsweeping assertion about the level of alcohol abuse in the Pormpuraaw Aboriginal community. How he came to \ngive that evidence should be placed in its full context. Inspector Whyte was being cross-examined about the record \nof interview he gave shortly after the protests and fires on Palm Island. The interview was conducted by Detective \nSergeant Michael Walker at the Palm Island school between 9.55 pm and 10.54 pm on 26 November 2004. It was \nduring this interview that he made the \u201cblackie blackie\u201d and \u201chalf caste\u201d comments to which I have referred above.  \nThe cross-examination concerned another statement in that interview where Inspector Whyte had said:look, I have \nno problems with the Aboriginal people at all \u2013 none whatsoever. You know, at the end of the day, um, they will turn \non you when they\u2019re drinking alcohol and they\u2019ll turn on you if they\u2019ve got something that ah really makes them go \noff and this is obviously the death of Doomadgee person made them go off.  It was in the context of being \nchallenged about the reasons he made these remarks, that in this proceeding Inspector Whyte said:When I was \u2013 \nwhen I was the officer in charge of Pormpuraaw police division there were 600 Aboriginal people. There were two \npeople that didn\u2019t consume alcohol, to my knowledge ... in that community. My wife and I and our two boys lived in \nthat community for three years, so I have an idea about Indigenous communities. I have an idea \u2013 a very big idea \u2013 \nabout the issues alcohol causes communities and people.  With further questioning, the exaggeration inherent in \nthis statement became obvious \u2013 Inspector Whyte had swept into his generalisation all people living in that \ncommunity, including children. That is, he had been prepared, in his sworn evidence, to speak about a community, \nwhose entire population was 600, as all drinking alcohol except for two people. He did so in an attempt to defend \nhis earlier comments (as I set them out at [497]) which were grossly stereotypical, and pejorative, of Aboriginal \npeople. This is no overzealous scrutiny of his evidence. In my opinion, these aspects of his evidence are revealing. \nInspector Whyte was well aware of the seriousness of these proceedings, and of the circumstances in which he \nwas giving evidence. He is also an experienced and long-serving police officer. That he was prepared to \ngeneralise \u2013 so obviously incorrectly \u2013 about an Aboriginal community as part of an attempt to justify his previous \nevidence about Aboriginal people and alcohol reveals the prejudices that he carries, consciously or unconsciously.  \nAs I have said, language can be informative, especially unguarded language. Inspector Whyte\u2019s language on 26 \n\n\n\nNovember 2004 as recorded in the video footage was unguarded. So was his language in his record of interview, \nwhere he felt, I find, comfortable and comforted in speaking to a fellow white police officer. He felt safe to use \nlanguage that revealed his attitudes to Aboriginal people: \u201cblackie blackie\u201d, \u201chalf caste\u201d and the like. Those attitudes \nare derogatory as well as being racially discriminatory. It is obvious that, if asked to describe an Anglo-Australian \nsuspect, Inspector Whyte would not say \u201cwhitey whitey\u201d.  I am unable to place weight on Inspector Whyte\u2019s \nevidence in relation to any issues of substantial contest or controversy.\nWednesday, 16 March 2016\n\nSuperintendent Rodney Kruger (SERT Operative 3)  Superintendent Kruger gave evidence on 16 and 17 March \n2016. At that time, he was employed as a Superintendent in the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Prior to his \nemployment with the AFP, he was an Acting Sergeant in the QPS SERT unit based in Cairns. He was employed by \nthe QPS from 1994 until he joined the AFP in 2005. In November 2004, he had been a SERT officer for \napproximately eight years and was in the position of Acting Sergeant and acting team leader. He is referred to in \nthe documentary evidence by the codename SERT Operative 3. He was involved in the arrest of Mr Wotton and \nwas the SERT officer who tasered Mr Wotton.  His evidence related to the training he received as a SERT officer \nand his experiences and actions as a SERT officer during the operation on Palm Island. He gave an account of \nwhat occurred at Mr Wotton\u2019s residence, including the tasering incident. He also gave evidence about his role in the \narrests, entries and searches on a number of the other houses.  Superintendent Kruger was a careful and \nmeasured witness. He had little recollection of the details of the entries and searches, which is unsurprising given \nhis ongoing role in SERT and the passage of time since November 2004. He accepted, properly, that SERT officers \nwould appear intimidating to lay people caught up in an entry and search. Beyond this kind of concession, his \nevidence reflected his professional role and experience as a SERT officer, which is understandable. This example \nfrom his cross-examination about the tasering of Mr Wotton provides an illustration:He told you, yes, he was Lex \nWotton?---Yes.\n\n And he had asked you why you wanted him to go on his knees?---I think so, yes.\n\n And you didn\u2019t answer him, did you?---I again asked him to get on his knees and put his hands above his head.\n\n You repeated it, in a very loud voice?---Yes.\n\n \u201cGet on your knees\u201d?---Yes.\n\n And he had asked you why. That\u2019s a fair enough question, isn\u2019t it? He has got people pointing guns at him. Fair \nenough question to know why you want him to go on his knees?--- ..... sorry, is that a question?\n\n Yes. It\u2019s a fair enough question for him to ask, isn\u2019t it?---I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I directed him on three \nseparate occasions, at least, to get on his knees and put his hands above his head. He did neither.\n\n And he asked you a perfectly reasonable question, and you didn\u2019t answer him. That\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it?---What would \nI \u2013 what would I have said?\n\n He asked you a perfectly reasonable question, i.e. why did you want him to get on his knees, and you didn\u2019t \nanswer him. Your answer was to taser him. That\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it?---No. My answer was to ask him again to get on \nhis knees, and put his hands above his head, and again.\n\n To shout at him?---To ask him in a loud voice.\n\n Yes?---A clear, loud voice.\n\n Yes. You agree that there\u2019s no police power to direct people to lie down on private property?---I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\n You don\u2019t know?---No.\n\n Well, you\u2019re demanding someone does something, and tasering them for not doing it?---No. I tasered him because \nI formed the assumption that he was going to attempt to flee being arrested.  When giving this evidence, it was \napparent to me that Superintendent Kruger did not really comprehend how it could be \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d for a \nsuspect he had been instructed to arrest to ask any question. Superintendent Kruger plainly believed that the \nsuspect was to comply with what the suspect was ordered to do, and would be forced to comply if he did not do so \nvoluntarily. That was how Superintendent Kruger had been trained to approach these situations, and that is how he \ndid approach them. There was no room for debate, or for nuance. Undefined notions of \u2018fairness\u2019 were simply not \npart of the performance of his professional task. As far as he was concerned, all control lay with him and he would \ndo what was necessary to apprehend Mr Wotton in as short a time and in as effective a way as could be done. That \nwas what he had been instructed to do. Contrary to the applicants\u2019 submissions, I do not consider there is a basis \nfor criticism of Superintendent Kruger in this regard: he cannot be criticised for acting in accordance with the way he \nhad been trained as a SERT officer. The problem, as I have set out elsewhere in these reasons, was having SERT \nofficers undertaking these arrests at all.\nThursday, 17 March 2016\n\nSergeant Wade Folpp (SERT Operative 4)  Sergeant Folpp was, at the time of giving evidence, a sergeant with the \nAFP. He has been employed by the AFP since 2005. In and around November 2004, he was an officer in the QPS \nCairns SERT unit. He had been a SERT officer for approximately two and a half years at that time. His team leader \nin the unit was Acting Sergeant Kruger. Sergeant Folpp\u2019s evidence related to the events of the SERT operation on \nPalm Island, including, notably, the tasering and arrest of Mr Wotton by Sergeant Kruger and Sergeant Folpp\u2019s own \ninteraction with Ms Krysten Harvey during the entries and searches.  Sergeant Folpp was a very clear witness, who \nseemed well experienced in giving evidence. I found him more forthcoming than Superintendent Kruger, and he \nseemed more relaxed, with an open demeanour. However, like Superintendent Kruger, his evidence was structured \naround what he was trained to do in the circumstances of the entries and searches. His account of what he did \nwhen inside Agnes Wotton\u2019s house was given in a plausible way, and I accept that he may well have done things \nsuch as lower his weapon and remove his balaclava, as he related he did. As I set out elsewhere, even if that was \nthe case I do not consider it materially reduced or altered the terror which was induced in Krysten Harvey.\nTHE RDA: RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES    It is as well to begin this section of these reasons by extracting the \nprovisions of the RDA that are of principal relevance to the discussion that follows. The extracted provisions are the \nsame today as they were in November 2004.  Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the RDA are contained in Pt II of the Act, \nwhich is headed \u201cProhibition of racial discrimination\u201d. The term \u201cConvention\u201d is defined in the Act to mean the \nICERD. By s 7, approval is given to ratification by Australia of the ICERD, the text of which is set out in a Schedule \nto the Act.  Section 9 provides, in full:Racial discrimination to be unlawful\n\n (1) It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on \nrace, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the \nrecognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, \neconomic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\n\n (1A) Where:(a) a person requires another person to comply with a term, condition or requirement which is not \nreasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case; and\n\n (b) the other person does not or cannot comply with the term, condition or requirement; and\n\n (c) the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or \nexercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the other \nperson, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of \npublic life;the act of requiring such compliance is to be treated, for the purposes of this Part, as an act involving a \n\n\n\ndistinction based on, or an act done by reason of, the other person\u2019s race, colour, descent or national or ethnic \norigin.\n\n (2) A reference in this section to a human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or \nany other field of public life includes any right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention.\n\n (3) This section does not apply in respect of the employment, or an application for the employment, of a person on \na ship or aircraft (not being an Australian ship or aircraft) if that person was engaged, or applied, for that \nemployment outside Australia.\n\n (4) The succeeding provisions of this Part do not limit the generality of this section.  The text of s 9(1) closely tracks \nthe definition of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d in Art 1(1) of the ICERD, which provides:In this Convention, the term \u201cracial \ndiscrimination\u201d shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or \nnational or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or \nexercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural \nor any other field of public life.  Article 2(1) then provides for a range of ways in which states parties to the ICERD \nundertake to eliminate racial discrimination:States Parties condemn racial discrimination and undertake to pursue \nby all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and promoting \nunderstanding among all races, and, to this end:\n\n (a) Each State Party undertakes to engage in no act or practice of racial discrimination against persons, groups of \npersons or institutions and to ensure that all public authorities and public institutions, national and local, shall act in \nconformity with this obligation;\n\n (b) Each State Party undertakes not to sponsor, defend or support racial discrimination by any persons or \norganizations;\n\n (c) Each State Party shall take effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies, and to \namend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial \ndiscrimination wherever it exists;\n\n (d) Each State Party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required \nby circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or organization;\n\n (e) Each State Party undertakes to encourage, where appropriate, integrationist multi-racial organizations and \nmovements and other means of eliminating barriers between races, and to discourage anything which tends to \nstrengthen racial division.  Section 10 of the RDA provides:Rights to equality before the law\n\n (1) If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a \nparticular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, \ncolour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons of another race, colour or \nnational or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first-mentioned race, colour or \nnational or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other \nrace, colour or national or ethnic origin.\n\n (2) A reference in subsection (1) to a right includes a reference to a right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the \nConvention.\n\n (3) Where a law contains a provision that:(a) authorizes property owned by an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander \nto be managed by another person without the consent of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander; or\n\n\n\n (b) prevents or restricts an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander from terminating the management by another \nperson of property owned by the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander;\n\n not being a provision that applies to persons generally without regard to their race, colour or national or ethnic \norigin, that provision shall be deemed to be a provision in relation to which subsection (1) applies and a reference in \nthat subsection to a right includes a reference to a right of a person to manage property owned by the person.  \nSection 8 relevantly provides:Exceptions\n\n (1) This Part does not apply to, or in relation to the application of, special measures to which paragraph 4 of Article \n1 of the Convention applies except measures in relation to which subsection 10(1) applies by virtue of subsection \n10(3).\n\n ...  Article 1(4) of the ICERD deals with \u201cspecial measures\u201d and provides:Special measures taken for the sole \npurpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such \nprotection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination, provided, however, that such \nmeasures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that \nthey shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.  More so than \nprovisions in other federal anti-discrimination statutes, s 9 is textually based on human rights law. Together with ss \n8 and 10, it is unique amongst federal anti-discrimination statutes in its fidelity \u2013 in text, purpose and structure \u2013 to \nthe international instrument which it implements: the ICERD. That fidelity has, in my opinion, at least two \nconsequences. First, its general language, apt for an agreement between nation states in the field of international \nlaw, must nevertheless be given meaning capable of clear application to the determination and enforcement of \nprivate rights between persons under domestic law. See similar observations by Gummow J in Applicant A v \nMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4; 190 CLR 225 at 275; Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11; \n159 CLR 70 at 86 (Gibbs CJ); and Maloney v The Queen [2013] HCA 28; 252 CLR 168 at [15] (French CJ).  \nSecond, ss 8, 9 and 10 attract the well-established principle that, to the extent their text, context and purpose \npermits, they should be construed consistently with the ICERD: see Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen[1982] HCA 27; 153 \nCLR 168 at 264-65 (Brennan J); Applicant A at 230-31 (Brennan CJ), 239-40 (Dawson J), 251-52 (McHugh J), 272 \n(Gummow J), 292 (Kirby J); Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 \n[2006] HCA 53; 231 CLR 1 at [34] (Gummow ACJ, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ); Plaintiff M61/2010E v \nCommonwealth [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 at [27] (the Court); TCL Air Conditioner (Zhongshan) Co Ltd v Judges \nof the Federal Court of Australia [2013] HCA 5; 251 CLR 533 at [8](French CJ and Gageler J); Maloney at [14] \n(French CJ), [235] (Bell J).  This is a different point from the issue raised by Gleeson CJ in Coleman v Power [2004] \nHCA 39; 220 CLR 1 at[17]- [24], where his Honour exposed the difficulties in an argument which sought to have the \n1931 Queensland legislation in issue in that proceeding interpreted consistently with the subsequent ICCPR. That \nissue does not arise in the present proceeding.  Rather, the question is, in giving effect to the constructional \nassumption to which I have referred at [517] above, what kinds of materials can inform a conclusion on the meaning \nof the international text, and thus inform the constructional choices available in the statutory text? Two particular \nlimitations arising fromMaloney should be mentioned. In Maloney, the application of these principles was important \nbecause submissions were made about the nature and operation of s 8 of the RDA \u2013 what constituted a \u2018special \nmeasure\u2019 for the purposes of s 8, and whether conduct could not be a special measure unless there had been \nadequate consultation with the community affected by the conduct. The submissions of the appellant and one of the \ninterveners supporting the appellant relied on General Recommendation 32 of the Committee on the Elimination of \nRacial Discrimination (2009) and an opinion issued by another body established by the United Nations Human \nRights Council: the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Four justices (French CJ at [23]-[24]; \nCrennan J at [134]; Kiefel J at [175]-[176] and Bell J at [235]) did not favour reliance on materials of this kind when \nthere was little or no support in the text of either the ICERD or, more importantly, in ss 8, 9 and 10, for the approach \nbeing advanced. The consultation argument in Maloney was characterised by the Court as seeking to import into \nthe ICERD (and as a consequence, it was said, into s 8) requirements, limits, or other meanings that the text \u201cwill \nnot bear\u201d: see for example French CJ at [24].  The applicants in this proceeding made no arguments of that kind, \n\n\n\nnor did the respondents submit that the applicants had done so. That is, in relation to the construction of s 9, the \napplicants did not advance any construction of that provision dependent on decisions or opinions of international \nbodies which was said to be more than the \u2018text of s 9 can bear\u2019. The controversies between the parties about the \nconstruction of s 9, such as they are (and they are in reality quite nuanced), can be resolved by an orthodox \napproach to the construction of the provision, taking into account the constructional assumption to which I have \nreferred at [517] above. By far the larger sphere of debate between the parties concerns the application of s 9 to the \nevidence.  The second, but connected, limitation concerns the manner in which the decisions of international bodies \n(and perhaps also domestic courts in other jurisdictions) postdating the enactment of the RDA \u2013 but dealing with its \ninterpretation \u2013 can be used to inform constructional choices about ss 8, 9 and 10.  In Maloney at [61] Hayne J \nsaid:The Convention to which these provisions refer is the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \nof Racial Discrimination, which was opened for signature on 21 December 1965 and entered into force on 2 \nJanuary 1969 (the Convention). The preamble to the RDA recites that the RDA \u201cmake[s] provision for giving effect \nto the Convention\u201d and this Court has held that the RDA is a valid enactment of the Parliament because it \nimplements Australia\u2019s obligations under the Convention. Of course, resort may be had to the Convention in \ninterpreting provisions of the RDA. But, because an Act like the RDA is to be interpreted \u201cby the application of \nordinary principles of statutory interpretation\u201d, the only extrinsic materials that may bear upon that task are materials \nof a relevant kind that existed at the time the RDA was enacted. Material published later, such as subsequent \nreports of United Nations Committees, may usefully direct attention to possible arguments about how the RDA \nshould be construed but any debate about its construction is not concluded by reference to or reliance upon \nmaterial of that kind.\n(Footnotes omitted.)    His Honour then appears to apply this opinion by rejecting the consultation arguments at \n[91]. Paragraph [61] ends with a \u201ccf.\u201d footnote reference to Gleeson CJ\u2019s remarks in Coleman v Power but, as I \nhave noted, Gleeson CJ was dealing with a different aspect of the use of international and comparative decisions in \nstatutory construction.  It would appear that a different approach was taken by Bell J (at [236]) and Gageler J (at \n[324]-[328]), each Justice indicating that in construing ss 8 and 10 it was appropriate to examine the contemporary \ninternational understanding of the ICERD.  I respectfully agree with the approaches of Bell and Gageler JJ in \nMaloney. No submission was made by the respondents relying on reasoning such as that of Hayne J. Again, it does \nnot seem to me that the parties have raised competing constructional choices about s 9 which can only be solved \nby reference to international or comparative decisions which postdate the enactment of the RDA. It is true that in \nsome of the submissions concerning the content of various human rights relied on by the applicants, resort needs to \nbe had to international and comparative decisions. I see no difficulty in that occurring, because s 9 itself gives \nrelevance in Australian law to the content of those human rights. Their nature and content has not been rewritten or \ncodified into Australian law. Rather, the international human rights themselves are incorporated by reference. That \nbeing the case, it is not only appropriate but, in my opinion, necessary to have regard to international and \ncomparative decisions concerning the content of those rights. In Maloneyat [236] Bell J said that \u201cin light of the \nRDA\u2019s object ... it is appropriate to give weight to the construction that the international community places upon the \nConvention\u201d, referring to the statement in Queensland v Commonwealth [1989] HCA 36; 167 CLR 232 at 240 \n(Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) that:The existence of an international duty \ndepends upon the construction which the international community would attribute to the Convention and on the \noperation which the international community would accord to it in particular circumstances.\n\nI respectfully agree with both observations and I consider they apply to s 9.    In final submissions, there was some \nattention paid to the series of recent cases in Queensland, and in the High Court, concerning the application of the \nRDA to Aboriginal communities in relation to the scope and operation of Queensland\u2019s liquor legislation. These \ncases are Maloney, Morton v Queensland Police Service[2010] QCA 160; 240 FLR 269 and Aurukun Shire Council \nv Chief Executive Officer, Office of Liquor Gaming and Racing in the Department of Treasury [2010] QCA 37; 1 Qd \nR 1. These decisions are important to a proper understanding of the RDA and its application in this case, especially \nMaloney. That is so notwithstanding they are all cases concerning s 10 of the RDA, together with s 8, rather than s \n9. Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the RDA together comprise the core of the Parliament\u2019s implementation of the ICERD: \nalthough each has its sphere of operation, when one examines the purpose and construction of any of these three \nsections, the other two must be considered.  In Maloney at [278], Gageler J commenced his analysis of the RDA \nwith the ICERD and two antecedents to the ICERD. The first antecedent is the Charter of the United Nations, which, \nin Art 1(3), contains express reference to the purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and \n\n\n\nfundamental freedoms \u201cwithout distinction as to race\u201d. The second antecedent is the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights (UDHR), which also emphasises the entitlement of all people to enjoy the rights and freedoms set \nout in the UDHR \u201cwithout distinction of any kind, such as race\u201d. His Honour then noted (at [280]) that both the \nICCPR and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) did not open for \nsignature until after the ICERD opened for signature, although they had each existed in draft form since 1954. \nGageler J\u2019s description of the United Nations General Assembly resolution which preceded the ICERD should, with \nrespect, be noted (at [281]):The Convention was preceded in 1963 by a resolution of the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations known as the \u201cUnited Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\u201d \n(the Racial Discrimination Declaration). The Racial Discrimination Declaration affirmed both \u201cthe necessity of \nspeedily eliminating racial discrimination throughout the world, in all its forms and manifestations, and of securing \nunderstanding of and respect for the dignity of the human person\u201d and \u201cthe necessity of adopting national and \ninternational measures to that end\u201d in order to secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of \nprinciples it went on to proclaim (paras 1-2). At the forefront of those principles were that \u201c[d]iscrimination between \nhuman beings on the ground of race ... is an offence to human dignity\u201d (Art 1) and that \u201c[n]o State ... shall make any \ndiscrimination whatsoever in matters of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the treatment of persons ... on \nthe ground of race ...\u201d (Art 2(1)).\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    In Koowarta at 260, Brennan J expressed the opinion that \u201cI should think that the \nimplementing of that Convention by Australia must be of the first importance to the conduct of Australia\u2019s relations \nwith its neighbours, if not indeed to Australia\u2019s credibility as a member of the community of nations.\u201d  It is critical, as \nAllsop J observed in Baird v Queensland [2006] FCAFC 162; 156 FCR 451 at [37], that provisions such as s 9(1) \nnot be dissected into small pieces so that their intended holistic operation and meaning are lost. To describe s 9(1) \nin terms of a series of \u201celements\u201d, as the respondents\u2019 submissions do, is to take a step along the path to \ndissection. Nevertheless, s 9(1) can be seen as having a conduct-based limb and an outcome-based limb. First, \nthere must be an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on race, colour, \ndescent or national or ethnic origin. This is the conduct-based limb. Second, the act (in the expanded character \ngiven to it by the first limb) must have either the purpose or the effect of nullifying or impairing a human right. This \ndirects attention to the actual outcome of the act, if \u201ceffect\u201d is the focus; or on what was intended, in a purposive \nsense, to be the outcome, if \u201cpurpose\u201d is the focus.  The first limb looks to what happened, and its connection with \nrace. The second limb looks to the outcome or consequences (actual or intended) of what happened.  The breadth \nof s 9(1) is clear from its source in the ICERD and its text, and is recognised in the authorities. Some textual matters \nmay be emphasised. The provision attaches to \u201cany\u201d act, which emphasises its breadth, as does the reference to \n\u201cany\u201d human right or fundamental freedom. In examining the outcome or consequences of the impugned act, the \ntext of s 9(1) requires a qualitative assessment of the impact of conduct because it deals not only with human rights \nwhich have been nullified, but human rights which are \u201cimpaired\u201d. The provision is not confined to facilitating the \nexercise of human rights; it is protective of the rights themselves. Like the international instruments to which it owes \nits origins, s 9 is concerned with the inherent dignity and equality of all people in the Australian community. By \nrequiring that each person has her or his rights recognised and protected \u201con an equal footing\u201d, s 9(1) is concerned \nwith substantive equality. Special measures to achieve substantive equality are, as Gageler J pointed out in \nMaloney (at [327]), not properly seen as an exception to the non-discrimination principle enshrined in ss 9 and 10, \nbut rather as \u201cintegral to its meaning\u201d.  What is comprehended by an \u201cact\u201d for the purposes of s 9 should also be \nbroadly construed. Read with s 3(3) (\u201crefusing or failing to do an act shall be deemed to be the doing of an act and \na reference to an act includes a reference to such a refusal or failure\u201d), it extends to the kind of conduct pleaded by \nthe applicants in the present proceeding, which often focuses on the failures of the QPS to do what the applicants \ncontend should have been done. Section 3(4) further confirms that breadth by providing that an \u201cact\u201d includes \u201cthe \ndoing of an act by a person in association with other persons\u201d.  The phrase \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or \npreference\u201d involves the concept of differential treatment. That is the sense in which Brennan J in Koowarta \ncharacterised these four matters as proscriptions (at 265):The recognition, enjoyment and exercise of human rights \nand fundamental freedoms by all persons on an equal footing irrespective of race, colour, descent or national or \nethnic origin is the purpose of the Convention to which Art. 1, cl. 1, in conjunction with other Articles (especially \nArts. 2 and 5), gives effect. The denial or impairment of such recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights \nand fundamental freedoms is proscribed (\u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d).  Similarly, in Gerhardy \nat 117-19 and also at 127-28, Brennan J described the operative concept in ss 9 and 10 of the RDA as being \n\n\n\ndifference in treatment, or differential treatment, based on race.  In Hagan v Trustees of the Toowoomba Sports \nGround Trust [2000] FCA 1615, Drummond J said of s 9 (at [38]):This section is not directed to protecting the \npersonal sensitivities of individuals. It makes unlawful acts which are detrimental to individuals, but only where \nthose acts involve treating the individual differently and less advantageously to other persons who do not share \nmembership of the complainant\u2019s racial, national or ethnic group and then only where that differential treatment has \nthe effect or purpose of impairing the recognition etc of every human being\u2019s entitlement to all the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms listed in Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination or basic human rights similar to those listed in Article 5.\n(Emphasis added.)    In Baird, Dowsett J at first instance ([2005] FCA 495; 224 ALR 541) said (at [114]):The \nallegation of employment by the Government is critical to the engagement of s 15 of RDA in these proceedings. \nHowever the allegation is also of importance in connection with s 9. That section applies to an act \u2018involving\u2019 a \n\u2018distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u2019 which is \u2018based on\u2019 race [emphasis in original]. In practice, each of \nthe words \u201cdistinction\u201d, \u201cexclusion\u201d, \u201crestriction\u201d and \u201cpreference\u201d implies differential treatment of at least one person \nas compared to the treatment of at least one other [emphasis added].  In Qantas Airways v Gama [2008] FCAFC \n69; 167 FCR 537, French and Jacobson JJ, with whom Branson J agreed, held that the act in that case \u2013 Mr \nGama\u2019s supervisor making remarks to him in the presence of his colleagues \u2013 involved a \u201cdistinction.\u201d That was \nbecause Mr Gama, who was born in India and was of colour, was singled out for these remarks, while other \ncolleagues around him were not. At [76], French and Jacobson JJ stated:The making of a remark is an act. It may \nbe that the remark involves a distinction because it is made to a particular person and not to others ... Where the \nremark, critical of one person in a group but not others, expressly or by implication links the criticism or denigration \nto that person\u2019s race then that linkage establishes both the distinction and its basis upon race. That was the present \ncase.\n(Emphasis added.)    Although as Allsop J noted in Baird, s 9 does not require a comparator in the way that some \nfederal and state anti-discrimination statutes do, that is not to gainsay the need for comparison. As Gleeson CJ said \nin Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment [2008] HCA 20; 235 CLR 232 at [7]:Discrimination is \njudged by making comparisons.  The presence of the words \u201con an equal footing\u201d in both Art 1(1) of the ICERD and \ns 9 of the RDA also requires some comparative analysis of the circumstances, albeit one that is not constrained by \nthe complex comparator structure found in other federal anti-discrimination statutes.  The applicants forcefully \ndisclaimed the need for a comparator, but I consider that disclaimer mistaken. Each case will vary in how the terms \nof s 9 are to be applied. Baird dealt with the payment of wages to Aboriginal people, and only to Aboriginal people. \nNevertheless, the Court\u2019s reasoning in Baird is not devoid of comparison: comparisons are made between what \nwas paid and what should have been paid (see, eg, at [69] per Allsop J: \u201cthe acts of calculating and paying the \ngrants involved a distinction by the calculation of the grants based on below-award wages, rather than award \nwages\u201d). To observe, as Gleeson CJ did in Griffiths, that discrimination is about comparisons is not the same as \ncontending that a \u201ccomparator\u201d must be identified and defined for discrimination to be shown. The point is also \nmade by the following extract from the reasons of Black CJ in Australian Medical Council v Wilson [1996] FCA \n1618; 68 FCR 46 at 48 (cited with approval by Allsop J in Baird at [60], Spender J and Edmonds J agreeing), in \nwhich Black CJ highlights the language of \u201con an equal footing\u201d appearing in s 9 of the RDA and Art 1(1) of the \nICERD:the concept used in s 9(1) and in s 9(lA) of impairing the enjoyment of a right on an equal footing must be \ntaken to be a broad one that involves looking at the footing upon which rights are enjoyed by those sections of the \ncommunity at large who do not suffer from the racial discrimination and the other like types of discrimination that the \nAct aims to eliminate. The language used in s 9 does not point to any narrower operation, in my view, and nor does \nthe evident policy of the Act.  The respondents suggested some comparison was required and, in my view, that \nsubmission is correct.  In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14; 210 CLR 1 at \n[78], McHugh and Gummow JJ described aspects of the concept of discrimination for the purposes of refugee law \nand drew parallels with the concept of discrimination in s 117 of the Constitution:The selective enforcement of a law \nof general application may result in discrimination between complainants which produces, in the legal sense, \ndiscrimination against one group of complainants. In Street v Queensland Bar Association, when dealing with the \nphrase \u201cdisability or discrimination\u201d in s 117 of the Constitution, Gaudron J said:\u201cAlthough in its primary sense \n\u2018discrimination\u2019 refers to the process of differentiating between persons or things possessing different properties, in \nlegal usage it signifies the process by which different treatment is accorded to persons or things by reference to \nconsiderations which are irrelevant to the object to be attained. The primary sense of the word is \u2018discrimination \nbetween\u2019; the legal sense is \u2018discrimination against\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Footnotes omitted, emphasis in original.)    This same approach \u2013 differential treatment without justification \u2013 is \nintegral to the ICERD, and to ss 8, 9and 10. Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the RDA, and the ICERD, are at base \nconcerned with eliminating the unjustified differential treatment of people on the basis of race. It is the assessment \nof the difference in treatment and its basis in race which is the gravamen of the prohibitions. In Maloney, Gageler J \nemphasised this in the following passage (at [335]):A difference in the extent of enjoyment of a human right is \nsimilarly a question of degree. In the context of s 10 of the RDA, it is a question of degree to be answered in light of \nthe principles and objectives of the Convention. Construed against the background of those principles and \nobjectives, persons of one race will enjoy a human right \u201cto a more limited extent\u201d than persons of another race \nwhere a difference in their relative enjoyment of a human right is of such a degree as to be inconsistent with \npersons of those two races being afforded equal dignity and respect. The relevant indignity or want of respect lies in \nthe difference in the levels of enjoyment of a human right by persons of the two races rather than in the absolute \nlevel of enjoyment by persons of the disadvantaged race. The significance of a difference can be affected by \ncontextual factors, which may include racial targeting or presumptions about the characteristics of racial groups just \nas they may include ignorance or lack of consideration of the characteristics of racial groups.  Although Gageler J \nemploys the language of s 10 (\u201cto a more limited extent\u201d) rather than the language of s 9(\u201cnullifying or impairing the \nrecognition ... on an equal footing\u201d), the point is the same. The lack of dignity and respect that inheres in treating \npeople in particular ways based on race lies in the difference between how the human rights and freedoms of those \npeople are recognised and enjoyed and how the human rights and freedoms of people of other races are \nrecognised and enjoyed. To answer the whole of the question posed by s 9(1), one must ask not only whether race \nis the reference point for the differential treatment, but also what is the nature and extent of the difference.  \u201cRace\u201d \nand the related attributes in s 9 are not defined in the RDA or the ICERD. Australian courts have relied heavily on \nthe decisions of foreign courts in determining the meaning of these terms. In Eatock v Bolt[2011] FCA 1103; 197 \nFCR 261, Bromberg J considered the meaning of the terms \u201crace, ethnic origin, and colour\u201d in determining whether \nAustralian Aboriginal people are a race and have common ethnic origins for the purposes of the RDA. In doing so, \nhis Honour canvassed some of the central foreign cases which examine the meaning of these terms (at [312]):In \nKing-Ansell, the New Zealand Court of Appeal (Richmond P, Woodhouse and Richardson JJ) was asked to \nconstrue s 25(1) of the Race Relations Act 1971 (NZ). An element of an offence under that section included intent \nto excite hostility or ill will against a group of persons on the grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin of \nthat group. The Race Relations Act 1971 was enacted including in order to implement CERD. In that context, \nRichardson J considered the meaning of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnic origin\u201d and stated at 542:Race is clearly used in its \npopular meaning. So are the other words. The real test is whether the individuals or the group regard themselves \nand are regarded by others in the community as having a particular historical identity in terms of their colour or their \nracial, national or ethnic origin. That must be based on a belief shared by members of the group.and at 543:... a \ngroup is identifiable in terms of its ethnic origins if it is a segment of the population distinguished from others by a \nsufficient combination of shared customs, beliefs, traditions and characteristics derived from a common or \npresumed common past, even if not drawn from what in biological terms is a common racial stock. It is that \ncombination which gives them an historically determined social identity in their own eyes and in the eyes of those \noutside the group. They have a distinct social identity based not simply on group cohesion and solidarity but also on \ntheir belief as to their historical antecedents.Those passages were approved by the House of Lords in Mandla at \n564.  His Honour then discussed the House of Lords decision in Mandla v Dowell Lee [1982] UKHL 7; [1983] 2 AC \n548 where, in considering whether Sikhs were to be regarded as an \u201cethnic group\u201d for the purposes of the Race \nRelations Act 1976 (UK), the Court stated:For a group to constitute an ethnic group in the sense of the Act of 1976, \nit must, in my opinion, regard itself, and be regarded by others, as a distinct community by virtue of certain \ncharacteristics. Some of these characteristics are essential; others are not essential but one or more of them will \ncommonly be found and will help to distinguish the group from the surrounding community. The conditions which \nappear to me to be essential are these: (1) a long shared history, of which the group is conscious as distinguishing \nit from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive; (2) a cultural tradition of its own, including family and \nsocial customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance. In addition to those \ntwo essential characteristics the following characteristics are, in my opinion, relevant; (3) either a common \ngeographical origin, or descent from a small number of common ancestors; (4) a common language, not \nnecessarily peculiar to the group; (5) a common literature peculiar to the group; (6) a common religion different from \nthat of neighbouring groups or from the general community surrounding it; (7) being a minority or being an \noppressed or a dominant group within a larger community, for example a conquered people ...  His Honour \n\n\n\nconcluded that Australian Aboriginal people were a race (at [314]):They are a group of people who regard \nthemselves and are regarded by others as having the two essential distinguishing conditions referred to by Lord \nFraser in Mandla \u2014 a long shared history and a culture distinctly of their own. An act done because a person or a \ngroup of people are Aboriginal people is, in the terms of s 18C(1)(b), done because of the race or ethnic origin of \nthe person or group.  I respectfully agree. In the present proceeding, the respondents did not dispute that Aboriginal \npeople are a \u201crace\u201d within ss 8-10 of the RDA. Similarly, Torres Strait Islander people may also be a \u201crace\u201d for the \npurposes of s 9, although the question is not critical to the determination of this proceeding. There was no \ndiscussion of the meaning of \u201crace\u201d in Maloney, Morton or Aurukun.  It may be significant for the purposes of this \nproceeding in particular to note that the listed attributes in s 9 (race, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin) \nare not linked \u2013 in the terms of the provision \u2013 to an individual. In other words, for s 9 to be contravened, one need \nnot identify the race (or related attribute) of a particular person as the basis for the impugned conduct. \nCircumstances can be imagined where the person who does the s 9 act has no particular individual in mind, or in \ncontemplation. A sign on the door to a gym which says \u2018Japanese people not welcome here\u2019 involves a distinction \nbased on national origin, even if the person who erected the sign had no particular Japanese person in mind, or \nknowledge about whether a Japanese person was soon to come to the gym. To the extent in this case that the \napplicants\u2019 pleadings appear to assume there is a need to prove that the respondents\u2019 conduct involved a \ndistinction or restriction based on the race of a particular individual, they assume the responsibility to prove more \nthan s 9 requires. Unless the context otherwise suggests, I have not approached the question of contravention \nthrough the prism of the need to identify any particular individual as a member of the race (here, Aboriginal) said to \nbe the basis for the distinctions and restrictions.  As I have said above, it is well-established that the phrase \u201cbased \non race\u201d in s 9 does not imply any causal requirement but connotes that the act involving the distinction, exclusion, \nrestriction, or preference be done, or undertaken, by reference to race: see Macedonian Teachers\u2019 Association at \n29-30 (Weinberg J), approved by the Full Court on appeal ([1999] FCA [1999] FCA 1287; 1287; 91 FCR 47 at [8]). \nAlthough the principle is not in doubt, the connection between race and the conduct of the QPS in this case was \nsometimes either simply asserted by the applicants, or said to be obvious. More than assertion is required: the \nsearch is for the basis of the impugned conduct. On what does the conduct turn? In asking that question, the basis \nof the impugned conduct must not be conflated with intention or subjective purpose. It is useful to recall how \nWeinberg J illustrated the difference in Macedonian Teachers:To read the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d in s 9(1) as meaning \nonly a relationship of cause and effect would be likely to significantly diminish the scope for protection which is \nafforded by that subsection. It is always possible to argue that the sole reason why the impugned conduct occurred \nhad nothing to do with its essentially discriminatory nature, but resulted from some wholly laudatory motive. To take \nbut one example, during the Second World War, after Pearl Harbour, President Roosevelt signed an Executive \norder requiring all Americans of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast of the United States to be interned in \nwhat the President himself later described as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d. Congress gave this order the force of statute. \nThe motive behind this edict was to ensure that in the event of an invasion by Japan, the defence forces would not \nbe hampered by the invaders donning civilian clothes in order to remain undetected. The validity of this statute was \nupheld in Korematsu v United States [1945] USSC 43; (1944) 323 US 214 by a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court.\n\n It is difficult to see how, or why, a law which operates in terms against a single ethnic group only, and which \nrequires tens of thousands of their number to be interned for no reason other than their ethnic origin, should not be \nsaid to violate a provision such as s 9(1) of the Act. Merely because the motive for, and hence the \u201ccause\u201d of the \nmaking of, such an order is said to be military necessity, rather than a desire to discriminate, provides no \njustification for excluding such conduct from the ambit of such legislation. It is of course possible that the statute \nitself will provide for a defence of reasonable justification, as s 9(1A) does, where indirect discrimination only is in \nissue. Section 9 makes no provision, however, for any such defence in the context of direct discrimination under s \n9(1). It is a nice question whether in an appropriate case the doctrine of necessity would operate to dispense with \nthe obligation to comply with the terms of the statute: see F Bennion, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed, 1997), p 882. \nKorematsu seems not to have been such a case.\n\nKorematsu is generally regarded as one of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s less distinguished contributions to \njurisprudence. One can readily think of other, less extreme, examples where laudatory motives might be invoked to \njustify acts which are essentially discriminatory in nature. This can be done simply by adopting an analysis which \n\n\n\nfocuses upon the \u201ccause\u201d of the impugned conduct which is then found to be something other than race. Almost of \nnecessity questions of motive are thereby introduced, notwithstanding the admonition, repeatedly stressed, that the \nintent or motive with which an essentially discriminatory act is performed is irrelevant.\n\n An example of the dangers of permitting questions of motive to intrude into proscriptions against discrimination \nbased on race is to be found in Buchanan v Warley[1916] USSC 116; (1917) 245 US 60. There the Supreme Court \noverturned the Court of Appeals of Kentucky and invalidated a law forbidding negroes from buying homes in white \nneighbourhoods. The Court observed (at 81):\u201cIt is urged that this proposed segregation will promote the public \npeace by preventing race conflict. Desirable as this is, and important as is the preservation of the public peace, this \naim cannot be accomplished by laws or ordinances which deny rights created or protected by the \nFederalConstitution.\u201dIn Banovic at 176 their Honours Deane and Gaudron JJ demonstrated that they were acutely \nconscious of the dangers of permitting intention or motive to intrude into the determination of whether acts, \nessentially discriminatory in their nature, breach anti-discrimination legislation. They cited with approval certain \nobservations of Lord Goff in R v Birmingham City Council; Ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1989] AC \n1155at 1193-1194. In rejecting as irrelevant intention or motive as a condition of liability his Lordship explained that \nif it were otherwise:it would be a good defence for an employer to show that he discriminated against women not \nbecause he intended to do so but (for example) because of customer preference, or to save money, or even to \navoid controversy\u201d.  Weinberg J continued (at 40-41):It is not correct, in my view, to say that in assessing the \u201ctrue \nbasis\u201d of the distinction brought about by the directive it is relevant to consider the second respondent\u2019s purpose in \nhaving issued it. That simply draws the assessment back to motive. It is an approach which conflicts with the views \nexpressed by Mason CJ and Gaudron J inWaters; by Kirby J in IW v City of Perth; by Deane, Gaudron and Dawson \nJJ in Banovic, and by Sackville J in Australian Medical Council v Wilson.  I have quoted from Weinberg J\u2019s \njudgment at length because it is pertinent in the present proceeding to bear in mind the distinctions his Honour \ndraws. In the present case, there may have been laudable motives, appreciable difficulties or understandable \ndilemmas attending some of the conduct and behaviour of the QPS officers in the circumstances they faced. The \nexistence of laudable motives, appreciable difficulties or understandable dilemmas will not prevent or preclude a \ncontravention of s 9 where it can nevertheless be said that the impugned conduct involved a distinction, exclusion, \nrestriction or preference that was based on race.  Assuming some matters in their favour, but bearing in mind this is \na class action, one aspect of s 9(1) which must be carefully addressed is how the applicants can, or cannot, \nestablish a connection between an act involving a distinction based on race and the impairment of a relevant \nhuman right or freedom enjoyed by the Palm Island group members. That is, it must be the impugned conduct \nwhich impairs the human right or freedom: see, eg, Qantas Airways v Gama at [77]. In relation to many of the \nallegations, especially some of the more singular or detailed ones, it is difficult to see the requisite connection \nbetween the impugned act and the impairment of a human right or freedom enjoyed by the Palm Island group \nmembers. The respondents have made this point in their written submissions, and it has considerable force in \nrelation to certain of the applicants\u2019 allegations.  These matters also raise the question whether, in the formulation of \nthe first limb of s 9(1), it is the act that must be based on race, or the distinction, restriction, exclusion or preference. \nIn considering the answer, the use of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d in s 9(1) is important.  The Macquarie Dictionary (6th ed, \n2013) relevantly gives these meanings for the verb \u201cinvolve\u201d:     to include as a necessary circumstance, condition, \nor consequence; imply; entail.   to affect, as something within the scope of operation.   to include, contain, or \ncomprehend within itself or its scope.   to bring into an intricate or complicated form or condition.   to cause to be \ninextricably associated or concerned, as in something embarrassing or unfavourable.   to implicate, as in guilt or \ncrime, or in any matter or affair.      Meanings of this kind were noted by Habersberger J in Rimanic v Business \nLicensing Authority [2001] VSC 400, where the question was whether a threat to kill was \u201can offence involving \nviolence\u201d and therefore a \u201cserious offence\u201d within the meaning of s 3(1) of the Motor Car Traders Act 1986 (Vic). In \nthat case, his Honour concluded that because one of the dictionary meanings of \u201cinvolving\u201d was \u201cimplying\u201d, it could \nbe said that a threat to kill \u201cinvolved\u201d violence. Of course, Habersberger J made that constructional choice about \nthe meaning of the verb \u201cinvolve\u201d in a different statutory context, but one further observation by his Honour is of \nsome significance. His Honour said (at [48]):It is important to note that the definition of \u201cserious offence\u201d in s.3(1) of \nthe MCTA is, relevantly, \u201can offence involving violence\u201d. That is, it is something less than an offence of violence \n(Pollard) or an offence one of the essential ingredients of which is violence (McCrossen).  The observation is that \nthe use of the preposition \u201cof\u201d gives the phrase \u201coffence of violence\u201d a narrower meaning, requiring that violence be \n\n\n\nan essential ingredient, or form part of the offence. Textually, there could be no such substitution in the language in \ns 9(1) but this observation is helpful in illustrating that the function of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d in the composite phrase \ncontained in the first limb of s 9(1) is connecting rather than definitional.  Whichever of the dictionary meanings is \nused, and bearing in mind the authorities to which I have referred, when used in the phrase \u201cact involving a \ndistinction\u201d the use of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d requires the examination of more than just the impugned act, or conduct. \nThe use of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d requires there to be an examination of what is bound up with or included in the \nimpugned conduct, what are the consequences of the conduct, what is associated with the conduct. All these \nsubstitute expressions indicate, in my opinion, the appropriate construction of the composite phrase \u201cact involving a \ndistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d. That this is the function of the verb in s 9(1) is also illustrated by the \nfollowing extract from the Full Court in Qantas Airways v Gama (at [76]):The making of a remark is an act. It may be \nthat the remark involves a distinction because it is made to a particular person and not to others. The remark may \nconvey no express or implicit reference to the person\u2019s race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. \nNevertheless, a linkage may be drawn between the distinction effected by the remark and the person\u2019s race or \nother relevant characteristic by reason of the circumstances in which the remark was made or the fact that it was \npart of a pattern of remarks directed to that person and not to others of a different race or relevant characteristic. \nWhere the remark, critical of one person in a group but not others, expressly or by implication links the criticism or \ndenigration to that person\u2019s race then that linkage establishes both the distinction and its basis upon race.\n(Emphasis added.)    A \u201cremark\u201d can be distinguished from a threat of violence, which explicitly refers to violence \nand therefore \u201cinvolves\u201d it in the sense (as Habersberger J found) of implying it. As this passage from Qantas \nAirways v Gama illustrates, if a remark were the \u201cact\u201d for the purposes of s 9(1), what the remark must involve, for \nthe purposes of s 9(1), is a distinction. In assessing whether it does involve a distinction, the objective \ncircumstances in which the remark was made become highly relevant. The Court makes an objective assessment \nof what, objectively (including the surrounding circumstances and consequences), was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the act in order \nto ascertain whether the act has the character or quality required by s 9(1).  To summarise, the impugned act must \nbe one which involves a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference. Read purposively and as a composite \nphrase, the \u201cact involving a distinction\u201d is the differential treatment. The gravamen of this part of s 9 \u2013 to express it \nin alternative language \u2013 is that it is the differential treatment which must be based on race. This construction gives \nbetter effect to the purposes of the RDA \u2013 and s 9 in particular \u2013 and to the ICERD, those purposes being to \neliminate the treatment of people, without justification, in different ways by reference to an irrelevancy: namely their \nrace, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. That said, this is but one example where undue parsing of s 9 is \ncounterproductive. The phrase \u201cact involving a distinction\u201d cannot be neatly, or appropriately, separated. Nor can it \nbe replaced with a descriptor such as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. In Baird at [70]-[71], Allsop J set out the correct approach:In \n[134] of his reasons, the primary judge said that the grants were based on race in the sense that they were made to \nassist indigenous people. The appellants submitted that such a finding is sufficient to satisfy s 9. I disagree. One \ndoes not look at the act divorced from the relevant distinction etc in assessing the relationship with race. It is the \npart of the act that is the distinction etc or the act involving the distinction that must be based on race.\n\n It is the act involving the distinction (not \u201cany discrimination\u201d, being the phrase used by the primary judge) that must \nbe based on race, that is, be done by reference to race.\n(Emphasis added.)    The issue is of significance in this case because of the somewhat complex analysis required \nto address the applicants\u2019 identification of the impugned \u201cacts\u201d of QPS officers and the range of alleged distinctions, \nexclusions, restrictions, or preferences upon which the applicants rely. I return to these matters at [1141] below.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS RELIED ON BY THE APPLICANTS \nFOR THE PURPOSES OF S 9    In Gerhardy at 125-26, Brennan J described the nature and importance, for the \noperation of the RDA, of the phrase \u201chuman rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d:The recognition and observance of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms by a State involves a restraint on the untrammelled exercise of its \nsovereign powers in order to ensure that the dignity of human beings within each State is respected and that \nequality among human beings prevails. Clearly enough, human rights and fundamental freedoms are not to be \nunderstood as the rights and freedoms which a person has under a particular legal system; they are rights and \nfreedoms which every legal system ought to recognize and observe. They are inalienable rights and freedoms that \na human being possesses simply in virtue of his humanity, independently of any society to which he belongs, \nindependently of the legal regime which governs it, and independently of any right or freedom that he might acquire \n\n\n\nby entering into a special relationship with another. The term connotes the rights and freedoms which must be \nrecognized and observed, and which a person must be able to enjoy and exercise, if he is to live as he was born \u2013 \n\u201cfree and equal in dignity and rights\u201d, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims. The State and other \npersons are bound morally, though not legally, to recognize and observe those rights and freedoms. What is their \ncontent? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains a general statement of human rights, and particular \nexamples (some relating, perhaps, to private fields of life) are set out in Art. 5 of the Convention. But an attempt to \ndefine human rights and fundamental freedoms exhaustively is bound to fail, for the respective religious, cultural \nand political systems of the world would attribute differing contents to the notions of freedom and dignity and would \nperceive at least some differences in the rights and freedoms that are conducive to their attainment: see Donnelly, \n\u201cHuman Rights and Human Dignity\u201d, American Political Science Review (1982), vol.76, p. 303.  As I have set out at \n[89] above, the applicants contend that the conduct of QPS officers nullified or impaired the recognition, enjoyment \nor exercise by the Palm Island group members of the following rights or freedoms:(a) to equality before the law and \nequal protection of the law (ICCPR Art 26);\n\n (b) to equal treatment before organs administering justice (ICERD Art 5(a));\n\n (c) to access public services (ICERD Art 5(f));\n\n (d) to enjoyment of property without unlawful interference (said to be a customary or general international law \nright);\n\n (e) not to be subjected to unlawful interference with privacy, family or home (ICCPR Art 17);\n\n (f) to liberty and security of person (ICERD Art 5(b) and ICCPR Art 9); and\n\n (g) not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment (ICCPR Art 7).  In relation to the right to equality before \nthe law, the applicants also rely on that right as they contend it exists under customary international law, including \nwhat they contend is a \u201csubsidiary right to equal protection by law enforcement agencies\u201d.  As the respondents \npoint out, some of the rights and freedoms on which the applicants rely can only be applicable in relation to the \nsubgroup members, because they relate to impugned conduct which affected only those subgroup members. The \nrights and freedoms in this category are those set out at (d)-(g) above.  In relation to the rights and freedoms in Art \n5(a) and (f) of the ICERD, the respondents do not contest, in substance, the existence or content of those rights, \nbut submit they are not engaged on the facts of this case.  The respondents do contest the proposition that Art 26 of \nthe ICCPR confers an autonomous human right, and that it has independent content.  Before descending into a \ndiscussion of the rights listed above, it is as well to set out the entirety of Art 5 of the ICERD:In compliance with the \nfundamental obligations laid down in article 2 of this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to \neliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, \ncolour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: \n\n (a) The right to equal treatment before the tribunals and all other organs administering justice; \n\n (b) The right to security of person and protection by the State against violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted by \ngovernment officials or by any individual group or institution; \n\n (c) Political rights, in particular the right to participate in elections \u2013 to vote and to stand for election \u2013 on the basis \nof universal and equal suffrage, to take part in the Government as well as in the conduct of public affairs at any \nlevel and to have equal access to public service; \n\n (d) Other civil rights, in particular:(i) The right to freedom of movement and residence within the border of the State; \n\n (ii) The right to leave any country, including one\u2019s own, and to return to one\u2019s country; \n\n\n\n (iii) The right to nationality; \n\n (iv) The right to marriage and choice of spouse; \n\n (v) The right to own property alone as well as in association with others; \n\n (vi) The right to inherit; \n\n (vii) The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; \n\n (viii) The right to freedom of opinion and expression; \n\n (ix) The right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association;(e) Economic, social and cultural rights, in \nparticular:(i) The rights to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to \nprotection against unemployment, to equal pay for equal work, to just and favourable remuneration; \n\n (ii) The right to form and join trade unions; \n\n (iii) The right to housing; \n\n (iv) The right to public health, medical care, social security and social services; \n\n (v) The right to education and training; \n\n (vi) The right to equal participation in cultural activities;(f) The right of access to any place or service intended for \nuse by the general public, such as transport, hotels, restaurants, cafes, theatres and parks.\n\nArticle 5(a) of the ICERD: the right to equal treatment before tribunals and all other organs administering justice    \nThe debate between the parties is whether the QPS can be said to be an \u201corgan administering justice\u201d. A somewhat \ntentatively expressed view to this effect was made by Chesterman JA (Holmes JA agreeing) in Morton. Morton, like \nMaloney and Aurukun, was a case invoking s 10 of the RDA in relation to liquor restrictions imposed in Aboriginal \ncommunities in Queensland, although each case was argued differently. Chesterman JA and Holmes JA held that s \n10 did not apply to s 168B(1) of the Liquor Act 1992 (Qld), which, read with other provisions of that Act and the \nLiquor Regulation 2002 (Qld), prohibited a person in a public place on Palm Island from possessing more than a \nprescribed quantity of a type of liquor. Having noted at [79] that the Court was \u201cnot referred to any case which has \nconsidered the ambit of the Art 5(a) right, and [his Honour\u2019s] own researches ha[d] been fruitless\u201d, Chesterman JA \nsaid, relevantly, at [80]:The subject matter of that right would seem to be the equal application of municipal laws to \nall persons regardless of race etc. It suggests, to my mind at least, a requirement of non-discriminatory conduct by \ntribunals and courts, and such like institutions, which make decisions affecting the persons with whom they deal. It \nprobably extends to the executive enforcement of laws, for example by police officers. Constable Tabuai, who \nmade the complaint, and the magistrate who convicted the applicant, may each have been an organ or tribunal \nadministering justice, but their conduct is not complained of. Anyway s 10 does not apply to them. It applies to laws \nwhich have the described effect. Parliament, when it passed the Liquor Act, was not a tribunal or organ \nadministering justice.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    The applicant in Morton had been charged with and convicted of one count of possessing \u2013 in \na restricted area \u2013 more than the prescribed quantity of liquor for that area, contrary to the prohibition contained in s \n168B(1). I assume Chesterman JA referred to Constable Tabuai in the above passage because his Honour saw the \ncharging of an individual, and thus the beginning of a process which could end in a court (clearly, an organ \nadministering justice) as sufficiently connected with the criminal justice process to fall within Art 5(a). However his \nHonour went on to find (at [81]) that Art 5(a) did not assist because it did not confer upon the applicant a right \u201cto \ncontrol Parliament with respect to the laws it passes, or a right to be unaffected by any law made by Parliament \nwhich, by its terms, applies to her\u201d. Insofar as the RDA could affect laws passed by a state parliament this was, \n\n\n\nChesterman JA held, achieved by the operation of s 10 of the RDA.  Thus, when [80] and [81] of Morton are read \ntogether, it can be seen that Chesterman JA acknowledged the kind of argument now put on behalf of the \napplicants but, because Morton concerned s 10 and Art 5(a) was employed differently before the Court of Appeal, \ndid not further consider or determine the issue.  McMurdo P, although in dissent on the application of s 10 in \nMorton, did not expressly say the scope of Art 5(a) included police officers responsible for the charging of the \napplicant. Her Honour did, however, appear to conclude (at [21]) that Art 5(a) was engaged on the facts, in the \nfollowing way:When parliament enacts laws, the practical effect of which is to create an offence which \ndisproportionately affects Aboriginal Australians, Aboriginal Australians are precluded from enjoying the right to \nequality before the law in the equal treatment before tribunals or other organs administering justice to the same \nextent as non-Aboriginal Australians. In my opinion, Art 5(a) means that such laws enacted by a State or Territory \ncannot escape the consequences of s 10.  Whatever support might be gained from Morton for the applicants\u2019 \nargument is minimal. Whether Art 5(a) extends to the role of police officers in a prosecution process need not be \ndetermined in this proceeding. The applicants do not contend that the prosecution processes which followed the \nevents with which this proceeding is concerned involved any contraventions of s 9.  The applicants do not rely on \nany other authority to support their contention that the police officers involved in the four broad categories of \nconduct they impugn (the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death, the intervening week conduct, the emergency \ndeclaration, and the arrests, entries and searches) were, in any or all of those categories of conduct, acting as \norgans administering justice.  Article 5(a) was one of the rights relied on in Maloney. No member of the Court was \npersuaded the Article had any application. French CJ (at [36]) did not consider the right had any application \nbecause the appellant was not complaining about how the Liquor Act (and the Liquor Regulation) required a court \nto treat her. Hayne J (at [73]) expressed doubts which might be seen as aligning with the view of French CJ. Kiefel \nJ considered the Article was concerned with what her Honour described as \u201cprocedural equality\u201d (at [151]). Bell J \ntook a similar approach, stating that Art 5(a) was akin to Art 14 of the ICCPR and was to be understood as a right to \nequality of access to courts and other adjudicative bodies: at [215]. Gageler J also drew a parallel between Art 5(a) \nand Art 14 of the ICCPR (at [287]), and found that Art 5(a) was \u201cmore narrowly focussed\u201d than Art 26 of the ICCPR \nand Art 7 of the UDHR. It was, his Honour found (at [336]), focussed on \u201cthe administration and enforcement of \nlaws by courts and tribunals rather than on the content of laws more generally\u201d.  In my opinion, there is no room for \nthe application of Art 5(a) to the impugned conduct of QPS officers in this proceeding. Even taking a simply textual \napproach to Art 5(a) and allowing, in the applicants\u2019 favour, that a police service could be described as an \u201corgan\u201d \nin the sense it is a body of persons formed by the executive to perform public functions and exercise public power, it \nis not properly characterised as an organ administering justice. The concept of \u201cadministering justice\u201d is, in the \ncommentaries on Art 5(a) and its broad equivalent in the ICCPR (Art 14), viewed as a function performed by courts \nand tribunals: see M Nowak, U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: CCPR Commentary (2nd ed, NP Engel, \n2005) at pp 307-09; N Lerner, The U.N. Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination (Sijthoff & \nNoordhoff, 1980) at p 56.  For the same reasons, the applicants\u2019 submissions about the application of Art 5(a) to \nwhat they contend to have been denials of natural justice by the QPS cannot succeed.  There was a faint attempt, \nin written submissions, to rely further on Art 5(a) by the submission that the Queensland Coroner was an \u201corgan \nadministering justice\u201d within the terms of Art 5(a). The consequence of this, it was submitted, is that the failure of \nQPS officers to conduct an impartial inquiry impacted substantially on the ability of the Coroner to make findings as \nrequired under the Coroners Act and the Coroner\u2019s Guidelines. Some reliance was placed by the applicants on \n\u201cremarks\u201d made by both Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine and Acting State Coroner Clements about QPS officers in \ntheir respective reports. I have found elsewhere in these reasons that the conduct of DSS Kitching in relation to the \npreparation of the Form 1 for the Coroner, and in relation to the nature of the information provided (and not \nprovided) to the Coroner, contravened s 9 of the RDA. The right I have found impaired is the Art 5(f) \u201cservices\u201d right, \nwhich I discuss below. The corresponding duty and responsibility which inhere in that services right attached to \nDSS Kitching in his role as an investigator.  In contrast, Art 5(a) is directed towards the treatment of people by \ntribunals and other organs administering justice. It may also extend to the conduct of other actors in the \nproceedings or processes of such tribunals, as the obiter comments in Morton suggest. I need not decide that \nquestion.  None of the conduct of QPS officers impugned in this proceeding occurred during any of the coronial \ninquests. Certainly, there is no suggestion that Palm Island group members were treated differently during the \ninquests, by QPS officers or anyone else. The corresponding duties or responsibilities for Art 5(a) attached to the \nCoroners, and to those participating in the inquests. None of the conduct impugned in this proceeding is conduct of \nthat nature.\n\n\n\nArticle 5(f) of the ICERD: the right to access public services    Specific provision is made in s 13 of the RDA for \ndiscrimination based on race in the provision of goods and services. The applicants do not rely on s 13, and instead \nrely on Art 5(f) as part of the general non-discrimination prohibition in s 9. As the applicants submit, the terms of s \n9(4) of the RDA contemplate such an approach. The respondents, correctly, do not submit that Art 5(f) is \nunavailable (by reason of s 13) as part of an alleged contravention of s 9.  In their written closing submissions, the \napplicants relied on just one case (Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Service v Estate Edward John Russell \n[2001] NSWSC 745) to make good their submissions that the nature of the right in Art 5(f) includes a right inhering \nin the general public to have police services provided. They also referred to R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A \nCrim R 174 in their reply. They make little or no specific submissions about the content of the right. Relying, it would \nseem, on their general allegations about non-compliance by the QPS with their obligations under the PSA Act and \nthe OPM, I understand their submission to be that if the \u201cQPS Failures\u201d, or some of them, are made out then the \napplicants\u2019 rights under Art 5(f) have been nullified or impaired.  It is, I might say, unsatisfactory in a case of this \nsize and importance, with the significant opportunities the applicants have been given to make submissions and the \nlengthy submissions they have in fact made, for such a central aspect of their case to be so thinly presented.  The \nrespondents also identified two decisions of relevance to the nature and content of the Art 5(f) right. One was Farah \nv Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1996] EWCA Civ 684; [1998] QB 65, and the other Commissioner of \nPolice (NSW) v Mohamed [2009] NSWCA 432; 262 ALR 519. I return to those decisions below. The respondents \ndo not submit the nature and content of this right precludes the applicants relying on it in the present proceedings. \nThey do submit, however, that some of the circumstances in respect of which it is relied upon are not circumstances \nwhich concern policing services provided to the general public, and therefore to the Palm Island group members. \nAn example they give is the alleged failure to notify Mulrunji\u2019s next of kin.  Farah was a decision of the UK Court of \nAppeal concerning the Race Relations Act 1976 (UK). Ms Farah was a Somali woman who, with her 10-year-old \ncousin, had been attacked by some white youths and their dog, and had called the police \u2018999\u2019 number for \nassistance. When the police arrived, instead of assisting her, they arrested her and charged her with affray, \ncommon assault and causing unnecessary suffering to the dog, then released her. When she appeared to answer \nthe charges, no evidence was offered and she was acquitted. In her claim against police, an issue arose whether \nthe duties of police officers in responding to her call for assistance fell within s 20(1) of the Race Relations Act, \nwhich provided:It is unlawful for any person concerned with the provision (for payment or not) of goods, facilities or \nservices to the public or a section of the public to discriminate against a person who seeks to obtain or use those \ngoods, facilities or services \u2013 \n\n (a) by refusing or deliberately omitting to provide him with any of them; or \n\n (b) by refusing or deliberately omitting to provide him with goods, facilities or services of the like quality, in the like \nmanner and on the like terms as are normal in the first-mentioned person\u2019s case in relation to other members of the \npublic or (where the person so seeking belongs to a section of the public) to other members of that section.  Noting \n(at 78) that it was open to Parliament to remove or impinge upon whatever common law immunity police officers \nmight enjoy concerning the discharge of their public duties, Hutchison LJ accepted that the terms of s 20(1) were \nwide enough to capture at least some of the duties performed by police officers. One of the duties his Lordship \nexpressly saw as included was the duty of officers to protect members of the public (at 78). His Lordship added at \n79:Taking the view I do on construction, I do not consider that there is any basis for entertaining Mr. Seabrook\u2019s \npolicy arguments. I would observe, however, that (as the judgment of Templeman L.J. recognised) there are in any \nevent powerful arguments on each side of the public policy issue and I do not find the spectre of claims of racial \ndiscrimination against the police, with the inconvenience and expense that that may involve, to be more disturbing \nthan the prospect that a member of the public who, seeking assistance in dire need, has been the subject of racial \ndiscrimination, should be without remedy.  Otton LJ (at 83) expressed a similar view:Like Templeman L.J. in Savjani \nv. Inland Revenue Commissioners [1981] Q.B. 458 I should be slow to find that the effect of something which is \nhumiliatingly discriminatory in racial matters falls outside the ambit of the Act. I accept that the police officers \nperform duties in order to prevent and detect crime and to bring offenders to justice. They are also vested with \npowers to enable them to perform those duties. While performing duties and exercising powers they also provide \nservices in providing protection to the victims of crimes of violence.  The context in Farah (and also in Savjani, to \nwhich it refers) was obviously different from the present proceeding. In those cases, the impugned conduct related \n\n\n\nto the way officers behaved vis-a-vis a particular individual. Some of the allegations here might be seen to fit into \nthat category but, if they do, then (putting the subgroup claims to one side) without more they cannot be sustained, \nbecause the relevant rights impaired or nullified are not those of the Palm Island group members but rather of the \nindividual concerned. For example, PLO Bengaroo does not, as an individual, complain of his treatment at the \nhands of QPS officers. His treatment is, however, one of the categories of impugned conduct about which the \napplicants complain. Demonstrating how their human rights were impaired or nullified by the treatment of PLO \nBengaroo (assuming in the applicants\u2019 favour the remainder of s 9 is made out) is a matter which presents some \ndifficulties for the applicants\u2019 case, unless it is seen as part of a pattern of conduct by QPS officers in relation to \nAboriginal people. I deal with these issues in detail below when considering each category of impugned conduct.  \nThe second case is Mohamed. In that case, the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered questions of law \narising from a decision of the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal (ADT). The respondent alleged \nthat, upon complaining to police that she and her family had been abused and assaulted by members of a \nneighbouring family, two officers attended the respondent\u2019s family home, but were rude and failed to take their \ncomplaint seriously. It was alleged that the basis for the officers\u2019 reactions and behaviour was the race of the \nrespondent and her family. The Commissioner had sought to have questions of law referred to the Court of Appeal. \nIt is fair to say that in its reasons the Court of Appeal was critical of the Commissioner\u2019s litigious and confrontational \napproach to the respondent\u2019s complaint in the ADT, including the referral of matters for decision by the Court of \nAppeal without a substratum of facts having been established. Those reservations expressed by the Court of \nAppeal should be borne in mind when considering its reasons.  At [21], in noting the difficulties with one of the \nCommissioner\u2019s questions of law as formulated, Basten JA (with whom Spigelman CJ agreed) reformulated the \nquestion, which is the one of relevance in the present proceeding. His Honour\u2019s reformulation was:Can the \ndetection and prevention of crime, as defined by s 6(3) of the Police Act 1990(NSW) constitute a \u201cservice\u201d within \nthe meaning of s 19 of the Anti-Discrimination Act?  Basten JA noted (at [23]) the limits on the scope and structure \nof the New South Wales anti-discrimination legislation, by reference to the observations of the High Court in IW v \nCity of Perth [1997] HCA 30; 191 CLR 1at 14-15 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J. His Honour described the scope in \nthe following way:Generally speaking, the areas in which the prohibitions operate seek to exclude entirely private \nactivities, not having a broader public element to them.  His Honour examined (from [31] onwards) the \u201cmission\u201d \nand \u201cfunctions\u201d of the New South Wales Police Force as they were set out in s 6 of the Police Act 1990 (NSW). In \ns 6(3), there was a definition of a statutory phrase \u201cpolice services\u201d. That subsection provided:In this section:\n\npolice services includes:\n\n (a) services by way of prevention and detection of crime, and\n\n (b) the protection of persons from injury or death, and property from damage, whether arising from criminal acts or \nin any other way, and\n\n (c) the provision of essential services in emergencies, and\n\n (d) any other service prescribed by the regulations.  The Commissioner\u2019s argument (of some assistance in itself to \nthe applicants in the present proceeding) was that the \u201cservices\u201d provided by the New South Wales Police were not \nservices provided to individuals, but rather to the general public.  At [36], in a passage with which I respectfully \nagree, Basten JA found that the duties performed by police officers fell within the concept of services as that term \nwas employed in the New South Wales anti-discrimination legislation:There is nothing surprising about the \nproposition that the police owe individual members of the community a duty to exercise their powers and carry out \ntheir functions on a non-discriminatory basis. Such a duty is recognised in international law, which may uphold a \nclaim for refugee status on the part of a person denied protection from violence on the basis of a protected \ncharacteristic, in his or her country of nationality: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar \n(2002) 210 CLR 1; 187 ALR 574; 67 ALD 577; [2002] HCA 14. Indeed, the fact that an authority is required to \nprovide a public service implies that the service is to be provided without discrimination across all sectors of the \ncommunity. To withdraw such a service from a particular group on the basis of a characteristic protected under \n\n\n\nhuman rights law is not to default on any obligation to the public at large, but in relation to members of that group. \nThere is no reason why members who suffer individually as a result of such conduct should not have a basis for \ncomplaint under appropriate legislation, including the Anti-Discrimination Act.  Dealing with the Commissioner\u2019s \nsubmissions that there was some inconsistency, or incongruity, in exposing police officers to the prohibitions in \nanti-discrimination legislation while at the same time not imposing a common law duty of care on officers in relation \nto all those functions, Basten JA said (at [48]):However one characterises the cause of action under the Anti-\nDiscrimination Act, it does not involve the creation of a general law duty of care, of the kind discussed in Hill, Tame \nand Sullivan. Nor does it give rise to the kind of policy questions which affect the scope of such a duty. Rather, its \nscope is to be identified as a matter of statutory interpretation. If the Parliament seeks to subject the Police Force to \nstatutory prohibitions, with civil remedies for breach, the courts must apply the statute, which is not in any sense \ncontingent upon the existence of a general law duty of care, nor on matters of legal principle which underlie the \nexistence or absence of such a duty. Accordingly, submissions based on these authorities should be rejected.  \nAgain, I respectfully agree with the opinions expressed by Basten JA in this passage.  Although later in his \njudgment (at [87], but cf [90]), Handley AJA was careful to allow for a different characterisation about functions such \nas the discretion to prosecute, his Honour reached similar conclusions about police activities involving initial \ninvestigations and prevention of unlawful conduct, stating at [78]-[79]:If the maintenance of order by Police at a \nsporting or entertainment event is a service to the organisers it is not apparent why the maintenance of order in a \nneighbourhood is not a service to those affected by the disorder.\n\n Nor is it apparent why the prevention and detection of crime, and the protection of the respondents from injury and \nthe protection of their property from damage which are services within s 6(3) of the 1990 Act are not services to \nthem within s 19 of the 1977 Act.  Both judgments in Mohamed approved and applied the Court of Appeal\u2019s \ndecision in Farah. The High Court\u2019s decision of IW v City of Perth also referred to Farah with approval: see [1997] \nHCA 30; 191 CLR 1 at 14 (Brennan CJ and McHugh J), 23 (Dawson and Gaudron JJ), 29 (Toohey J), 44 (Gummow \nJ), 74 (Kirby J).  There is also the decision of Russell. I propose to refer to the first instance judgment of Sully J \nbecause, although the matter did go on appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal, the service issue was not \nconsidered by the Court of Appeal.  Mr and Mrs Russell, and their son Mr Edward Russell, who was deceased by \nthe time of the case before the ADT, were Aboriginal. Mr and Mrs Russell continued the prosecution of their son\u2019s \nproceeding in the ADT after his death. Mr Edward Russell had alleged that, in December 1993, he was arrested by \na large group of police officers (approximately 10) and during the arrest was treated in a way (including by the \nlanguage used by the arresting officers) that was racially discriminatory and vilified him on the ground of his \nAboriginal race. Mr Russell also alleged that, during his police interview, he complained about being assaulted and \nvilified during his arrest and the interviewing officer did not refer his complaint to the appropriate, or any, \ninvestigating authorities. He alleged this failure was based on his race.  One of the questions of law referred to the \nCourt by the ADT in Russell was whether the conduct of an individual police officer in the course of the pursuit and \narrest of Mr Russell amounted to the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s 19 of the Anti-Discrimination \nAct 1997 (NSW), recalling that in the New South Wales legislation the relevant services had to be provided by a \n\u201cpublic authority\u201d. Sully J held that the New South Wales Police Service was a public authority for the purposes of \nthe Anti-Discrimination Act, chiefly by reference to the mission and functions of the Police Service as set out in s 6 \nof the Police Service Act 1990 (NSW), but also by reference to the \u201cStatement of Values\u201d set out in s 7 of that Act. \nThe Police Service Act was renamed the Police Act 1990 (NSW) in 2002, which is why the references to the Act \ninMohammed are different.  Subsections 6(3)(a) and 6(3)(b) of the New South Wales Police Service Act were in the \nsame form as they were when considered by the Court in Mohamed. I have extracted them above at [593]. Sully J \nheld at [44] that a correct assessment of the police officers\u2019 conduct in relation to Mr Edward Russell was:[1] The \npolice officers who took part in the pursuit of Mr. Russell were providing to the community at large services of the \nkind described in section 6(3)(a) and (b) of the Police Service Act.\n\n [2] The police who took part in the arrest of the late Mr. Russell were also thereby providing to the community at \nlarge services of those two kinds.\n\n\n\n [3] As soon as the late Mr. Russell had been formally arrested, and had passed thereupon into police custody, the \narresting police, and any police officer who had any part at all in the way in which Mr. Russell was subsequently \nhandled; or who witnessed the way in which Mr. Russell was handled; became thereupon charged with a public \nduty to provide to the late Mr. Russell police services by way of the protection of his person from injury or death, \nand the protection of his property from damage, \u201cwhether arising from criminal acts or in any other way\u201d.\n\n [4] All of the police officers mentioned in [3] above wholly failed, on the facts as found by the Equal Opportunity \nDivision, to provide the services which they were bound to provide to Mr. Russell pursuant to section 6(3)(b).\n\n [5] To say that what the individual police officers did, or suffered to be done, to the late Mr. Russell amounted to \nthe provision by them to him of police services, but on a basis discriminatory in the sense contemplated by section \n19(b), seems to me to be a wholly artificial perception, given the facts found by the Equal Opportunity Division. The \npolice officers involved did not, in my opinion, provide imperfectly to the late Mr. Russell the services which they \nwere duty bound to provide to him. They did not provide those services at all.\n\n(Original emphasis.)    It can be seen that the kinds of services which Sully J found to have been provided were \ntwofold. First, services to the public or community at large, which were connected with the detection of crime and \nthe apprehension of persons suspected of breaking the law. Second, services provided to the individual who was \nthe subject of police action, which were connected with ensuring his safety and wellbeing, and the protection of his \nproperty while in police custody.  I emphasise this aspect of Sully J\u2019s findings because it supports the contentions \nadvanced by the applicants that police officers may provide services of different kinds, to different groups, and also \nto individuals. To accept those contentions is not to accept that in every circumstance where police powers or \nfunctions are exercised or performed in relation to an individual, a \u201cservice\u201d is being provided to that individual: see, \neg, the findings of Yates J in Robinson v Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Force [2012] FCA 770; 292 ALR \n702at [168]- [169] and [178], which were not challenged on appeal (see Robinson v Commissioner of Police, New \nSouth Wales Police Force [2013] FCAFC 64 at [145]).  In the present proceeding, of course, the difficulty with any \ncontention that QPS officers were providing services to particular individuals is that this is a class action and the \ncause of action must rely on services provided to the Palm Island group members or, at least, an identified \nsubgroup of them. The only identified subgroup is the one comprising the people whose properties and homes were \nentered by SERT officers on 27 and 28 November 2004 and those present during the entries and searches.  \nAlthough these authorities are of assistance in confirming that, in the context of other statutory regimes dealing with \nanti-discrimination, the functions performed by police officers (or at least some of them) have been held to be \ncapable of being characterised as services for the purposes of the prohibitions in those regimes, the existence of \nsuch authorities does not automatically answer the question posed by the applicants\u2019 contentions in this \nproceeding. That question is (expressed in summary form) whether the conduct of QPS officers in investigating the \ndeath of Mulrunji, in policing Palm Island in the week after his death, and in their policing reaction to the events of \n26 November 2004 should, separately or collectively, be characterised as the provision of services. There is then \nalso the question of to whom those services were provided.  There is a definition of \u201cservices\u201d in s 3 of the RDA, but \nsince it is a statutory definition it can be seen as applicable only to provisions such as s 13, where the term \n\u201cservices\u201d is used. It does not assist in identifying the scope and content of the right in Art 5(f).  Bell J dealt briefly \nwith the content of Art 5(f) in Maloney, noting (at [225]) that the right it confers is not one found in other international \nhuman rights instruments. It may be that the particular history of nations that had notorious segregation practices \nand denials of access to places and services for persons of particular races informed the express identification of a \nright such as this: see T Meron, \u201cThe Meaning and Reach of the International Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Racial Discrimination\u201d (1985) 79 AJIL 283-84; see also Maloney at [287] (Gageler J).  In Maloney, the \nservice identified for the purposes of the Art 5(f) right was access to the supply of alcohol at licensed premises. Bell \nJ concluded (at [227]) that, by reason of the liquor restrictions, Aboriginal persons on Palm Island enjoyed the right \nin Art 5(f) to a more limited extent than persons of other races elsewhere in Queensland. Her Honour\u2019s conclusions \nare, of course, expressed in the context of s 10 of the RDA rather than s 9, but they are nevertheless important to \nrepeat (at [225] and [227]):Article 5(f) recognises a right of access not only to any place intended for use by the \ngeneral public but also to any service intended for public use. The right of access to places and services recognised \n\n\n\nby the Convention is not found in other international human rights instruments. The right of all persons of access \nwithout distinction based on race to places and services intended for use by the public is an important aspect of the \nability to live in full dignity and enjoy the public benefits of the society.\n\n ...\n\n By reason of the liquor restrictions, Aboriginal persons on Palm Island enjoy the rights under Art 5(d)(v) and (f) to a \nmore limited extent than persons of another race present elsewhere in Queensland. It follows that s 10(1) is \nengaged subject to consideration of whether the liquor restrictions qualify as special measures under s 8(1). If they \ndo not, they will be invalidated because they impose a discriminatory burden.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Where, as in Queensland, statute codifies the role and functions of the police service in a \nparticular jurisdiction, the Court\u2019s task of describing the role and function of the police can largely be taken from \nsuch a statutory source. That is what the Court in Russell did, in relation to New South Wales.  For the purposes of \nthis proceeding, the version of s 2.3 of the PSA Act in force in November 2004 set out the functions of the QPS:The \nfunctions of the police service are\u2014\n\n (a) the preservation of peace and good order\u2014(i) in all areas of the State; and\n\n (ii) in all areas outside the State where the laws of the State may lawfully be applied, when occasion demands;(b) \nthe protection of all communities in the State and all members thereof\u2014(i) from unlawful disruption of peace and \ngood order that results, or is likely to result, from\u2014(A) actions of criminal offenders;\n\n (B) actions or omissions of other persons;(ii) from commission of offences against the law generally;(c) the \nprevention of crime;\n\n (d) the detection of offenders and bringing of offenders to justice;\n\n (e) the upholding of the law generally;\n\n (f) the administration, in a responsible, fair and efficient manner and subject to due process of law and directions of \nthe commissioner, of\u2014(i) the provisions of the Criminal Code;\n\n (ii) the provisions of all other Acts or laws for the time being committed to the responsibility of the service;\n\n (iii) the powers, duties and discretions prescribed for officers by any Act;(g) the provision of the services, and the \nrendering of help reasonably sought, in an emergency or otherwise, as are\u2014(i) required of officers under any Act or \nlaw or the reasonable expectations of the community; or\n\n (ii) reasonably sought of officers by members of the community.  Numerous features of this provision fit comfortably \nwithin the concept of a service \u201cintended for use by the general public\u201d as set out in Art 5(f). The word \u201cintended\u201d \nshould also be understood to mean objectively intended: cf Colyer v State of Victoria [1998] 3 VR 759 at 769-74; \nRichardson v ACT Health and Community Care Service [2000] FCA 654; 100 FCR 1 at [26]. I consider these \nauthorities are distinguishable on the basis of the text and purpose of the particular exemption in issue. In Colyer, \nthe exemption was s 82 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic), which provided:(1) Nothing in Part 3 applies to \nanything done in relation to the provision to people with a particular attribute of special services, benefits or facilities \nthat are designed\u2014(a) to meet the special needs of those people; or\n\n (b) to prevent or reduce a disadvantage suffered by those people in relation to their education, accommodation, \ntraining or welfare.(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (l) \u2014(a) a person may grant a woman any right, \nprivilege or benefit in relation to pregnancy or childbirth;\n\n\n\n (b) a person may provide, or restrict the offering of, holiday tours to people of a particular age or age group.  In \nRichardson, the exemption was contained in s 27(b) of the Discrimination Act 1991 (ACT), which at the relevant \ntime provided:Nothing in Part III renders it unlawful to do an act a purpose of which is \u2014\n\n ...\n\n (b) to afford members of a relevant class of persons access to facilities, services or opportunities to meet their \nspecial needs.  Exemptions of this kind direct attention, at least as one consideration, to the purpose or object of the \nservice-provider.  There does not appear to be any international or comparative judicial decisions on the meaning of \n\u201cintended\u201d in the context of Art 5(f). In comparable domestic human rights instruments, rights of access to services \nare expressed without reference to intention. For example, s 44(1) of the Human Rights Act 1993 (NZ) provides:It \nshall be unlawful for any person who supplies goods, facilities, or services to the public or to any section of the \npublic\u2014\n\n (a) to refuse or fail on demand to provide any other person with those goods, facilities, or services; or\n\n (b) to treat any other person less favourably in connection with the provision of those goods, facilities, or services \nthan would otherwise be the case,\u2014\n\n by reason of any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination.  Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act 1977 is \nexpressed as follows:It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation \ncustomarily available to the general public\n\n (a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n\n (b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, \n\n on a prohibited ground of discrimination.  Section 29(1) of the Equality Act 2010 (UK) provides:A person (a \n\u201cservice-provider\u201d) concerned with the provision of a service to the public or a section of the public (for payment or \nnot) must not discriminate against a person requiring the service by not providing the person with the service.  \nWithout needing to refer to any particular domestic laws, in Khawar at [85], McHugh and Gummow JJ described \nprotection by the State of Pakistan as a:fundamental right otherwise enjoyed by Pakistani nationals, namely access \nto law enforcement authorities to secure a measure of protection against violence to the person.  While the issue is \nnot free from doubt, in my opinion the preferable approach, particularly with functions which have been codified, as \nthe functions of police officers have in Queensland, is to discern the meaning of \u201cintention\u201d consistently with the \napproach taken to Parliament\u2019s intention in the context of statutory interpretation. That approach is set out by the \nHigh Court in Lacey v Attorney-General for the State of Queensland [2011] HCA 10; 242 CLR 573 at [43]- [44] \n(French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ):The objective of statutory construction was defined in \nProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority as giving to the words of a statutory provision the meaning \nwhich the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. An example of a canon of construction directed to that \nobjective and given in Project Blue Sky is \u201cthe presumption that, in the absence of unmistakable and unambiguous \nlanguage, the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms or immunities\u201d. That is frequently \ncalled the principle of legality. The legislative intention there referred to is not an objective collective mental state. \nSuch a state is a fiction which serves no useful purpose. Ascertainment of legislative intention is asserted as a \nstatement of compliance with the rules of construction, common law and statutory, which have been applied to \nreach the preferred results and which are known to parliamentary drafters and the courts. As this Court said \nrecently in Zheng v Cai:\u201cIt has been said that to attribute an intention to the legislature is to apply something of a \nfiction. However, what is involved here is not the attribution of a collective mental state to legislators. That would be \na misleading use of metaphor. Rather, judicial findings as to legislative intention are an expression of the \nconstitutional relationship between the arms of government with respect to the making, interpretation and \n\n\n\napplication of laws. As explained in NAAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the \npreferred construction by the court of the statute in question is reached by the application of rules of interpretation \naccepted by all arms of government in the system of representative democracy.\u201dThe application of the rules will \nproperly involve the identification of a statutory purpose, which may appear from an express statement in the \nrelevant statute, by inference from its terms and by appropriate reference to extrinsic materials. The purpose of a \nstatute is not something which exists outside the statute. It resides in its text and structure, albeit it may be identified \nby reference to common law and statutory rules of construction.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    On that approach, it is to the PSA Act that one must look to determine whether the functions \nto be performed by QPS officers are properly characterised as \u201cservices\u201d intended for use by the general public. To \nsay that a service is \u201cintended for use\u201d by the general public is another way of identifying the activity as one to \nwhich the general public is intended to have \u201caccess\u201d; the right in Art 5(f) being initially described as a right of \naccess.  That these activities are described in s 2.3 as \u201cfunctions\u201d lends support to their characterisation as \nactivities to which the public is intended to have \u201caccess\u201d. In some cases that \u201caccess\u201d may be active \u2013 see for \nexample s 2.3(g)(ii) which expressly contemplates that members of the public will seek out assistance from police \nofficers. On other occasions, the \u201caccess\u201d will be consequential on the performance of the function, rather than as a \nresult of any interaction between identified members of the public and identified police officers \u2013 see, for example s \n2.3(a)(i): the preservation of good order within the state. It is still intended, in my opinion, that members of the \npolice force perform this function as a service to the community \u2013 that is, as something of benefit and helpful to \nthem, or of advantage to their welfare: see IW v City of Perth at 11 (Brennan CJ and McHugh J), 41 (Gummow J). \nThe preservation of peace and good order is a service to which it is intended that all members of (relevantly here) \nthe Queensland community have access.  To focus on statutory intention when determining whether the exercise of \na public power or function is a \u201cservice\u201d is not to deny that the particular circumstances of its exercise may be \nrelevant to whether it can be characterised in that way. It may be that a power or function is expressed in sufficiently \nbroad terms that some instances of its exercise will meet the description of a \u201cservice\u201d while other instances will not. \nFor example, a power to do all things necessary to ensure the proper functioning of a city\u2019s water mains might entail \nsome functions that could properly be described as services intended for use by the general public (such as fixing \nburst pipes to restore water flow to homes) and others that could not (such as entering contracts to purchase new \npipes). In those cases, \u201cintention\u201d is still to be determined objectively by reference to the intention of the legislature, \nbut the intention of the legislature may be described as being that some exercises of the power will be a service \nwhile others will not. Whether a particular exercise of a power of that nature is a service must be determined by \nreference to the facts of the case.  While the functions in s 2.3 are broad, in my opinion they are sufficiently specific \nthat conclusions can be reached regarding whether they are intended to be services. For example, s 2.3(d) \u2013 the \ndetection of offenders and the bringing of them to justice \u2013 was a function, and a service, of critical importance on \nPalm Island following the death of Mulrunji. His death in custody required investigation and required, as s 2.3(d) \nexpressly provides, that any person who was an \u201coffender\u201d in relation to that death be brought to justice. The \nfunction in s 2.3(e) of upholding the law generally was also important. Part of upholding the law in the investigation \ninto Mulrunji\u2019s death was to ensure the investigation was impartial and independent both in fact and appearance. \nDetermining who was responsible for the destruction of public property on Palm Island on 26 November 2004 was \nalso important in upholding the law, as well as (returning to s 2.3(d)) in detecting offenders. In investigating who \nwas responsible for the destruction of that property, or for inciting the destruction of that property, the QPS was \nproviding a service intended to be used by all members of the Queensland community. All members of the \nQueensland community had an interest in those responsible for the destruction of public property on the island, \nand inciting its destruction, being brought to justice.  Section 2.3(b) \u2013 the protection of all communities in the State \nand all members thereof \u2013 is no doubt a function the respondents would emphasise in the role of the QPS on Palm \nIsland in the aftermath of Mulrunji\u2019s death and then after the burning of public buildings (including SS Hurley\u2019s \nhouse, which was part of the police compound) on Friday, 26 November 2004. As I note later, on the evidence \nbefore me, I find that the perception of QPS officers about who was in need of protection on Palm Island was, in \npart, based on race. The applicants did not rely heavily on the protective functions of the QPS and that is \nunderstandable. Their contention, which again I accept in part, is that the level of threat assessed to be present on \nPalm Island was exaggerated and overemphasised, in order to justify a heavy-handed and disproportionate \nresponse to public protests against police, including protests by way of setting fire to public buildings. There was \nno sense in the evidence that I heard from Palm Island residents, nor in the contemporaneous evidence tendered \n\n\n\nat trial (either through witness statements or videos) that Palm Islanders felt under threat from anyone but the \npolice. Some of the attributes which the applicants submit should attend the conduct of police officers are apparent \nin the terms of s 2.3(f) \u2013 in particular, responsibility and fairness. Attributes of this kind describe, or fill out, the \nnature of the service which is provided to the general public. The QPS must administer (for example) the powers \nand duties set out in the OPM responsibly and with fairness. It is a service with those attributes which is intended to \nbe provided to the general public.  What should be made of the use in Art 5(f) of the term \u201caccess\u201d in the phrase \n\u201cright of access\u201d? Should this be construed as limiting the content of the right in Art 5(f)? In my opinion, it would be \ninconsistent with the approach set out in many authorities to the interpretation of the terms of international human \nrights instruments to take a narrow view of the meaning of access.  The word \u201cright\u201d in Art 5(f) does not involve a \nprivate legal right, separately enforceable under domestic law. In provisions such as Art 5(f), the word \u201cright\u201d is \nrather used as a descriptor of the universally recognised entitlements that inhere in all people, so as to achieve the \nequality and dignity contemplated by the UDHR and the international human rights instruments which have followed \nit: see, for example, Gerhardy at 101-102 (Mason J).  The text and context of Art 5(f) must also be borne in mind. \nThe right with which the provision deals is not just a right to access services: it is a right of \u201caccess to any place or \nservice\u201d intended for use by the general public. It is not directed at services available only to a selection of people: \nits purpose is to ensure equality for people of all races so that \u2013 as members of the community (the \u201cgeneral public\u201d) \n\u2013 they can be treated with substantive equality.  On one view, access to a place connotes actively seeking to enter \nand remain in a particular location \u2013 be it a cinema, a public square, a sporting ground, a hotel or a university. If Art \n5(f) were given content dependent on activities by persons affected, the mere placing of a sign at the front of a \ncinema which said \u2018no Indians\u2019 may not contravene Art 5(f) unless and until an Indian person sought entry. That \nwould not give effect to the purposes of the ICERD, because racially discriminatory conduct would already have \noccurred by the placement of the sign, and by the purpose and effect of the placement of the sign. The imperative \nto treat all persons equally in their entitlement to go to the cinema would already have been defeated. Indian people \nmay be discouraged simply by the presence of the sign. Whether that occurs or not, the mere placement of the sign \nis incompatible with the values of equality and dignity Art 5(f) is designed to protect. This example illustrates why \nthe better view is that the word \u201caccess\u201d in Art 5(f) includes entitlements to access, not only the activity of seeking \naccess to a place, or to a service. This approach is also consistent with the whole of the introductory phrase in Art \n5(f) \u2013 \u201cthe right of access.\u201d  That said, there are some relevant limits to the content of the Art 5(f) right. The use of \nthe verb \u201caccess\u201d connotes, as I have said, an entitlement of all individuals to benefit from (or be assisted by) public \nfacilities and functions in substantively the same way and to substantively the same extent and effect, without \ndistinction as to race: that is, without race being the basis on which differential treatment turns. However, there is in \nthe choice of the word \u201caccess\u201d a connotation that individuals will use facilities, or be the beneficiaries of the \nperformance of functions or activities. In some sense, the individuals to whom Art 5(f) gives rights of access to \nplaces and services must be in the contemplation of those who make facilities and places available, or perform the \nservices. Individuals may not need to be the direct recipients on identifiable occasions of access to a place, or \naccess to a service, but the place or activity must still be one which is available for access, or capable of being \naccessed.  That may mean that some of the functions in a provision such as s 2.3 of the PSA Act do not fall within \nthe concept of \u201cthe right of access to any ... service\u201d for the purposes of Art 5(f). In my opinion, functions such as \nthe one in s 2.3(c) (the prevention of crime) may be such a function. Insofar as it is not subsumed within the other \nfunctions set out in s 2.3, crime prevention is not a \u201cservice\u201d which it is intended the general public should use, for \nthe purposes of Art 5(f). To be clear, a situation such as a complaint made to police about the commission of an \noffence would in my opinion be covered by s 2.3(d), and what the police did, or should have done, in response to a \ncomplaint would constitute a service which it is intended the general public use. However, \u201cprevention of crime\u201d \ncould include a wide range of activities, such as strategic decision-making, coordination between police and other \nlaw enforcement agencies, and advocacy by police to government concerning changes in the law. These kinds of \nactivities, in my opinion, are not activities which Art 5(f) is apt to protect. By conferring this function on the QPS, the \nQueensland Parliament did not intend that the general public \u201cuse\u201d this kind of activity. Nor could it be said \nobjectively that the prevention of crime, itself, is a service which the public is intended to use: cf subss 2.3(d), (f) \nand (g).  Describing functions such as those set out in s 2.3 as inherently public functions is consistent with the \ncommon law\u2019s characterisation of the role of the police. For example, in Glasbrook Bros Ltd v Glamorgan County \nCouncil [1924] UKHL 3; [1925] AC 270 at 277, Viscount Cave LC said:there is an absolute and unconditional \nobligation binding the police authorities to take all steps which appear to them to be necessary for keeping the \npeace, for preventing crime, or for protecting property from criminal injury; and the public, who pay for this \n\n\n\nprotection through the rates and taxes, cannot lawfully be called upon to make a further payment for that which is \ntheir right.  It is also consistent with the constitutional framework at state and federal level in Australia, which can be \nsaid to contemplate that there will be mechanisms by which the rule of law will be upheld and enforced for the \nbenefit of the whole community, in a way which itself is consistent with core values of independence, impartiality \nand reasonableness: see, generally, Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5;83 CLR 1 at 193 \n(Dixon J); Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; 189 CLR 520 at 564 (the Court); Plaintiff \nS157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2; 211 CLR 476 at [103]- [104] (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and \nHayne JJ); APLA Limited v Legal Services Commissioner (NSW) [2005] HCA 44; 224 CLR 322 at [30] (Gleeson CJ \nand Heydon J); Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 at [61](Gummow and Crennan JJ); South \nAustralia v Totani [2010] HCA 39; 242 CLR 1 at [61]- [62] (French CJ); Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] \nHCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [103] (Gaudron J); Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332 at [23] (French CJ), [64] (Hayne, \nKiefel, and Bell JJ), [88]-[89] (Gageler J).  Accordingly, I have concluded that most of the QPS functions on which \nthe applicants rely are properly characterised as a service intended for use by the general public within Art 5(f).\n\nArticle 26 of the ICCPR: equality before the law    There was considerable debate between the parties about the \nnature and content of this right. The applicants contend Art 26 establishes an \u201cautonomous\u201d human right, which in \nits content has three aspects: equality before the law and the entitlement without discrimination to equal protection \nof the law; the entitlement to a guarantee of equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground; \nand entitlement to a guarantee of non-discrimination through prohibitions in the law.  The respondents contend Art \n26 is not a freestanding right, and has no content independent of, or separate to, other Articles in the ICCPR. They \nsubmit Art 26 expresses an \u201cobjective\u201d to which the ICERD and the RDA are addressed. The respondents do \nappear to accept that Art 26 imposes an obligation on states parties in relation to their domestic legislation and the \noperation of that domestic legislation.  This issue assumes some significance because some of the conduct of QPS \nofficers that I have identified as contravening the first limb of s 9(1) will not result in a contravention of s 9 itself \nunless there is some independent content to the Art 26 right. That is because I have not accepted the applicants\u2019 \nsubmissions that the other human rights they relied on were nullified or impaired by that conduct: see [1481]-[1485] \nbelow.  Both parties rely on various obiter statements in Maloney and Aurukun to support their respective \narguments. I now turn to those decisions.  In Maloney, two justices expressly found that the Art 26 right could not \nitself be a \u201cright\u201d for the purposes of s 10 of the RDA, nor for the purposes of s 8 where the impugned law for the \npurposes of s 10 is said to be a special measure (as it was in Maloney). To understand their Honours\u2019 reasoning, it \nis worth recalling the terms of s 10(1) of the RDA, which provides:If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the \nCommonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not \nenjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more \nlimited extent than persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that \nlaw, persons of the first-mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that \nright to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.  At [159]-[162], Kiefel J \nexplained why, in her Honour\u2019s opinion, it would render s 10 (and s 8, where relevant to the operation of s 10) of the \nRDA \u201cunnecessary\u201d if Art 26 was given substantive content. The context of her Honour\u2019s observations must be \nnoted. At [159], her Honour observed that the freedom under consideration was the freedom to possess alcohol for \nconsumption. This was not, in her Honour\u2019s opinion, a fundamental freedom of the kind to which the ICERD was \naddressed, but the freedom to possess and consume alcohol was nevertheless a freedom enjoyed by \u201cmany other \npersons in Queensland and in Australia ... to a greater extent than that enjoyed by Aboriginal persons on Palm \nIsland\u201d. In that context, her Honour acknowledged reliance by the appellant, and by the Australian Human Rights \nCommission in its intervening submissions, on rights such as Art 26 (and also Art 5(a) of the ICERD), as the basis \nfor the contention that the \u201cright\u201d for the purposes of s 10 was the right to be protected from the practical \n(discriminatory) effect of domestic laws. It was in this context that her Honour expressed the view (at [160]) that this \nwas not the kind of right upon which s 10 could operate, and that these Articles (that is, Art 26 of the ICCPR and Art \n5(a) of the ICERD) were to be seen as \u201cbroader objectives\u201d to which the ICERD and the RDA are addressed. For \nthis reason, her Honour concluded (at [161]) that s 10 \u201ccannot operate in the manner intended with respect to a \nbroad right not to be discriminated against\u201d.  Gageler J expressed a similar opinion, but by reference to what his \nHonour saw as the circularity in an argument relying on Art 26 of the ICCPR. At [336], his Honour accepted that \nhuman rights within the scope of s 10, not being limited to those in Art 5 of the ICERD, \u201cencompass the full gamut of \nthe civil, political, economic and social rights recognised in the Universal Declaration and in the ICESCR and \n\n\n\nICCPR\u201d. Gageler J then continued:However, the analysis required to determine whether or not the first component \nof the condition for the application of s 10 is satisfied is not readily assisted by focusing on the free-standing right to \nequality before the law or equal protection of the law expressed in Art 7 of the Universal Declaration and Art 26 of \nthe ICCPR. That is because it is in the nature of such a right that a question about its enjoyment requires the \nundertaking of an analysis that mirrors the very analysis that s 10 requires to be undertaken with respect to the \nhuman rights to which it refers. To inquire for the purposes of s 10 into whether there is by reason of a law unequal \nenjoyment of a human right to equality before the law or equal protection of the law is to become mired in \nunproductive circularity. The right referred to in Art 5(a) of the Convention (to equal treatment before the tribunals \nand all other organs administering justice) is not properly equated to a right to equal protection of the law in Art 7 of \nthe Universal Declaration and Art 26 of the ICCPR. Like Art 14 of the ICCPR, Art 5(a) of the Convention is more \nnarrowly focused: on the administration and enforcement of laws by courts and tribunals rather than on the content \nof laws more generally.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    French CJ did not consider the issue, focussing on the Art 5 rights relied on by the appellant: \nat [35]. Hayne J declined to determine the issue: at [72]. Crennan J generally agreed with the reasons of Hayne J, \nand wrote separately only on the special measures issue, so her Honour did not address the debate about the \ncontent of Art 26 and its role (or not) in s 10 of the RDA.  Although Bell J accepted that Art 26 (and its equivalent in \nArt 7 of the UDHR) were rights \u201cprotected by\u201d the ICERD and formed part of the customary law of nations (see \n[219]), her Honour expressly refrained determining the content of the Art 26 right or how s 10(1) might be said to \nprotect it (at [223]). Her Honour did however point out that the content of Art 26 is described by some commentators \nas controversial, and noted what was said on behalf of Australia at the time of Australia\u2019s ratification of the ICCPR. \nHer Honour said (at [222]):Australia\u2019s acceptance of Art 26 was \u201con the basis that the object of the provision is to \nconfirm the right of each person to equal treatment in the application of the law\u201d, an understanding that Australia\u2019s \nrepresentative suggested was more in keeping with the original intention of the framers of the ICCPR.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Her Honour referred to the discussion of Australia\u2019s position in Meron\u2019s article on the ICERD \n(see [609] above) at p 292. Meron refers to what was said on behalf of Australia as an illustration of the difficulty Art \n26 might pose in its application to \u201cnongovernmental\u201d actors. That, it seems to me, is a different issue from the one \npresented in Maloney, and the one presented in this proceeding. QPS officers were, it is conceded by the \nrespondents, acting on behalf of the State.  The important points emerging from Bell J\u2019s reasons for present \npurposes are, first, that Art 26 (like Art 7 of the UDHR) is an autonomous human right and forms part of customary \ninternational law; and second, that its content includes, at least, the right to equal treatment in the application of the \nlaw.  Keane J, who did not sit on Maloney, had taken the same approach to Art 26 as that taken by Kiefel J and \nGageler J in Maloney when his Honour was a member of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Aurukun. In Aurukun, \nhis Honour said at [147] that Art 26 is:simply a paraphrase of the purpose of s 10 of the RDA. As I have said, to \nassert this \u201cright\u201d is not to identify the content of the right said to be protected by s 10 of the RDA. To rely upon the \npurpose and effect of s 10 of the RDA as itself the \u201cright\u201d protected by it is to fail altogether to address the need to \nidentify the content of the \u201cright\u201d protected by s 10 of the RDA.  The majority in Morton (Chesterman JA, with whom \nHolmes JA agreed) also took this approach. At [85], Chesterman JA made it clear that, although he accepted the \ncorrectness of the decision in Aurukun(McMurdo P and Philippides J constituting the majority on this issue), he did \nnot accept that Aurukuncorrectly enunciated the effect of s 10. His Honour said at [86]:If the applicant\u2019s submission \nwere right there would have been no need to distinguish between human rights and fundamental freedoms and \nother rights. It would have been sufficient to decide that there was discrimination on the ground of race. The subject \nmatter of the discrimination would not have mattered, yet the cases proceeded by declaring that s 10 applied to \n\u201chuman rights\u201d and then identifying the right in question to determine if it fell within that category.  At [89]-[92], his \nHonour said of Art 26 itself:The right \u201cwithout any discrimination to the equal protection of the law\u201d, is elusive in \nmeaning and content. It is the expression of an ideal, or high moral principle, lacking any indication of how it is to be \nachieved, or more profoundly, what it means.\n\n ...\n\n It is, I think, obvious that s 10 itself confers a right on persons of all races to be treated equally by the law. It does \nso by the particular mechanism described in the section. It is not obvious to me that the object sought by Art 26 is \nnot achieved by the enactment of s 10. \n\n\n\n The focus of Art 26 is on equal treatment before the law, or equal protection of the law. Section 10, it seems to me, \nis a provision which aims to achieve that very goal. It does not do so by saying that no law may discriminate on the \nground of race with regard to any subject matter. The subjects of legislation which may be discriminatory will be few \nin number because of the width of the definition of human rights in the Convention, but it is the case that some \nsubject matter will not be caught.\n\n To make the suggested substitution in s 10 involves a degree of circularity. Section 10 confers a right to equal \nprotection of the law. If one answers the question: \u201cwhat is the right it confers?\u201d by saying it is the right to equal \nprotection of the law without discrimination, one has not got a satisfactory answer, nor got to the point of saying that \nit is a right not to be discriminated against in any respect under any circumstances.  In contrast, McMurdo P in \nMorton appeared to contemplate that Art 26 was one of the human rights and freedoms to which s 10 could apply: \nsee [18] and [24]. Her Honour did not address the circularity, or logical inconsistencies, to which Kiefel J and \nGageler J in Maloney referred, and to which Chesterman JA in Mortonand Keane J in Aurukun also referred.  \nPhilippides J in Aurukun (at [240]-[243]) also concluded that Art 26 was a right to which s 10 could apply. Adopting \nthe language of the Human Rights Committee (HRC) to the effect that Art 26 involves an autonomous human right, \nher Honour said (at [242]) that a broad construction of s 10:leads to the conclusion that the right to equality before \nthe law includes, as a fundamental right, a right to \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d, which operates to nullify legislation \nthat is racially discriminatory \u201cin any field regulated and protected by public authorities\u201d.  Similarly, McMurdo P was \nprepared to accept (at [34]) that \u201cArt 26 exists as a free standing right against discriminatory laws in \u2018any field \nregulated and protected by public authorities\u2019\u201d.  There may be a narrow preponderance of judicial opinion from \nthese authorities favouring the proposition that, in considering the application of s 10 of the RDA, the right \nexpressed in Art 26 of the ICCPR is not a \u201cright\u201d upon which s 10 can operate. The judicial reasoning to which I \nhave referred describes the purpose, and reason for existence, of s 10 as to implement Australia\u2019s obligations \nunder Art 26, amongst other generally expressed provisions (such as Arts 2 and 3 of the ICCPR and Art 2 of the \nICERD). In that sense the terms of s 10 as the Australian Parliament has chosen to enact them are the \nimplementation in Australian domestic law of Australia\u2019s obligation (see Art 2 of the ICERD) to \u201camend, rescind or \nnullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it \nexists\u201d.  Therefore, the second and third aspects of the Art 26 right upon which the applicants rely (see [635] above) \nare likely to be seen as implemented in Australia through s 10. I do not consider the same can be said of the first \naspect (equality before the law) which encompasses the application of the law without discrimination.  In this \nproceeding, the respondents extrapolate the observations in Maloney about the overlap between Art 26 and s 10 \n(especially those of Gageler J) from s 10 to s 9. The applicants submit they should not be so extrapolated. I agree \nwith the applicants. Whether or not Art 26 has any independent operation in the context of s 10 is not a matter on \nwhich I need express a view.  There is no doubt that Art 26, as it has been interpreted by the HRC, does not \nduplicate the guarantees given in Art 2 of the ICCPR, which is plainly about implementation of ICCPR rights into \ndomestic law. Art 26 derives from the equal protection principle in Art 7 of the UDHR and is concerned with the \nobligations imposed on states in regard to their legislation and the application of that legislation: see Human Rights \nCommittee, Views: Communication No 172/1984, 29th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/OP/2 (1990) (\u2018Broeks v The \nNetherlands\u2019). It is the latter aspect of Art 26 (the application of domestic law) which tends to give the right it \nenshrines greater content than simply being a commitment by states about the kind of legislation they will enact, or \nretain, domestically.  If one examines the decisions of the HRC about Art 26, one sees the wide-ranging operation it \nhas been given. This operation, in addition to the express statements of the HRC, establishes that, at least so far as \nthe HRC is concerned, Art 26 has a separate and autonomous operation which extends beyond the enactment, \namendment or retention of domestic legislation so as to make it compliant with the obligations assumed by states \nunder the ICCPR (or, for that matter, the ICERD). A few examples of that jurisprudence will suffice.  Broeks v The \nNetherlands was one of the early HRC decisions which emphasised the independent role of Art 26. It concerned \nentitlements under Netherlands legislation to unemployment benefits. Mrs Broeks claimed her entitlement was \ndifferent because she was a woman, and married. It should be noted that the impugned law was retrospectively \namended to remove the discrimination, but the amendment did not cover all of the period of Mrs Broeks\u2019 claims. \nThe Netherlands opposed the complaint by submitting, amongst other things, that Art 26 did not provide protection \nagainst discrimination in relation to economic, social and cultural rights \u2013 only civil and political rights. This \n\n\n\nsubmission nevertheless did recognise an independent operation for Art 26. The Committee\u2019s decision included the \nfollowing summary of its approach to Art 26:12.3. For the purpose of determining the scope of article 26, the \nCommittee has taken into account the \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 of each element of the article in its context and in the light \nof its object and purpose (art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). The Committee begins by \nnoting that article 26 does not merely duplicate the guarantees already provided for in article 2. It derives from the \nprinciple of equal protection of the law without discrimination, as contained in article 7 of the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, which prohibits discrimination in law or in practice in any field regulated and protected by public \nauthorities. Article 26 is thus concerned with the obligations imposed on States in regard to their legislation and the \napplication thereof.\n\n 12.4. Although article 26 requires that legislation should prohibit discrimination, it does not of itself contain any \nobligation with respect to the matters that may be provided for by legislation. Thus it does not, for example, require \nany State to enact legislation to provide for social security. However, when such legislation is adopted in the \nexercise of a State\u2019s sovereign power, then such legislation must comply with article 26 of the Covenant.\n\n 12.5. The Committee observes in this connection that what is at issue is not whether or not social security should \nbe progressively established in the Netherlands but whether the legislation providing for social security violates the \nprohibition against discrimination contained in article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \nand the guarantee given therein to all persons regarding equal and effective protection against discrimination.\n\n 13. The right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the law without any discrimination does not make \nall differences of treatment discriminatory. A differentiation based on reasonable and objective criteria does not \namount to prohibited discrimination within the meaning of article 26.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Other HRC decisions have followed Broeks v The Netherlands, and applied this approach to \nthe payment of a wide range of social benefits, insurance and subsidies by states parties: see the list of cases set \nout in S Joseph and M Castan, The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (3rd ed, Oxford University \nPress, 2013) at [23.18]. This line of cases includes a case against Australia, alleging contraventions of Art 26 in \nrelation to the non-payment of Veterans Entitlement pensions to a same-sex couple: see Human Rights Committee, \nViews: Communication No 941/2000, 78th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/78/D/941/2000 (2003) (\u2018Young v Australia\u2019). \nOther cases include a successful claim by a Jewish parent about what was said to be the preferential funding of \nRoman Catholic schools in Canada (Human Rights Committee, Views: Communication No 694/1996, 67th sess, \nUN Doc CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 (1999) (\u2018Waldman v Canada\u2019)).  The success of this claim before the HRC had no \ndomestic effect in Canada, the Ontario Government refusing to implement the decision because of the alleged \neffect on its budget (if all religious schools needed to be funded), on its secular model of education (if it needed to \npermit education for religious groups in public schools) or on its constitutional obligations (see s 93 of the \nConstitution Act 1867 (UK) and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Adler v Ontario [1996] 3 SCR 609). \nNevertheless, it can be seen the impugned funding decisions were the application of various statutory provisions to \nindividuals.  Article 26 has also been successfully applied to the failure of a state party to provide in a post-colonial \nconstitution for languages other than English to become official languages: see Human Rights Committee, Views: \nCommunication No 760/1997, 69th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/69/D/760/1997 (2000) (\u2018Diergaardt v Namibia\u2019) in \nrelation to the use of the Afrikaans language.  Joseph and Castan note (at [23.15] and [23.19]) there have also \nbeen strong dissents from this approach, based on the significant intrusion into the priorities of states parties in the \nimplementation of economic, social and cultural rights. That debate is not relevant to the issues to be determined in \nthis proceeding. Although these cases support the general position that Art 26 is a freestanding right, and its \ncontent includes the manner in which domestic law is applied to individuals, the overlap with the purpose and \noperation of s 10 of the RDA is apparent. The content of Art 26 which does not, in my opinion, overlap with or \nduplicate s 10 is the application of domestic law to an individual or individuals where there is some decisional \nfreedom about how the law is applied. The focus of s 10 of the RDA is on the operation of domestic law itself. \nWhere domestic law confers powers or functions, so that repositories have a choice about how to exercise those \npowers or perform those functions, then in my opinion there is room for the content of Art 26 to apply. In any given \nsituation, the work that the content of the Art 26 right has to do may depend on the application of other, more \n\n\n\nparticularly expressed, human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Article 26 has been applied to executive or \nadministrative action. An example is Human Rights Committee, Views: Communication No 1306/2004, 91st sess, \nUN Doc CCPR/C/87/D/1306/2004 (2007) (\u2018Haraldsson and Sveinsson v Iceland\u2019), which dealt with the way the \nIcelandic government allocated fishing rights through a quota system. The HRC held that Iceland had not \ndemonstrated that the quota system implemented, which distinguished between existing fishers and new entrants to \nthe fishery, was based on objective and reasonable grounds. There were significant dissents in this case, which \nessentially preferred to leave the complex policy issues involved in allocation of fishing rights to the Icelandic \nexecutive.  In some cases, the political context of a decision has meant the HRC has decided not to uphold a \ncomplaint, especially where a broad executive discretion is involved. That was the case in Human Rights \nCommittee, Views: Communication No 1314/2004, 87th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/87/D/1314/2004 (2006) (\u2018O\u2019Neill \nand Quinn v Ireland\u2019), which concerned decisions made under Irish legislation about the early release of members \nof the Irish Republican Army (IRA) convicted of serious offences, including murder. The authors, who had been \nconvicted of a particularly notorious IRA-organised killing of a police officer, were excluded from the scheme. The \nHRC found the criteria for participation in the scheme were developed in a political context concerning the ending of \nthe long-standing conflict in Northern Ireland and the state party\u2019s assessment of those criteria should stand. One \nmember of the majority expressed the rationale for the decision this way:Article 26 does not allow the Committee to \nsit as an administrative court, reviewing every government decision, in the same fashion as a national \nadministrative tribunal. This is a point especially important in the management of our decisional capacity under the \nFirst Optional Protocol.  There is at least one HRC case which is more closely applicable to the present proceeding. \nHuman Rights Committee, Views: Communication No 1493/2006, 96th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/96/D/1493/2006 \n(\u2018Lecraft v Spain\u2019) involved a woman who complained she had been stopped by police at Valladolid railway station \nand asked for identity papers on the basis of her racial characteristics, because police had been instructed to carry \nout checks on \u201ccoloured people\u201d. The HRC found Spain was in breach of Art 26:7.2 The Committee must decide \nwhether being subjected to an identity check by the police means that the author suffered racial discrimination. The \nCommittee considers that identity checks carried out for public security or crime prevention purposes in general, or \nto control illegal immigration, serve a legitimate purpose. However, when the authorities carry out such checks, the \nphysical or ethnic characteristics of the persons subjected thereto should not by themselves be deemed indicative \nof their possible illegal presence in the country. Nor should they be carried out in such a way as to target only \npersons with specific physical or ethnic characteristics. To act otherwise would not only negatively affect the dignity \nof the persons concerned, but would also contribute to the spread of xenophobic attitudes in the public at large and \nwould run counter to an effective policy aimed at combating racial discrimination.\n\n ...\n\n 7.4 In the present case, it can be inferred from the file that the identity check in question was of a general nature. \nThe author alleges that no one else in her immediate vicinity had their identity checked and that the police officer \nwho stopped and questioned her referred to her physical features in order to explain why she, and no one else in \nthe vicinity, was being asked to show her identity papers. These claims were not refuted by the administrative and \njudicial bodies before which the author submitted her case, or in the proceedings before the Committee. In the \ncircumstances, the Committee can only conclude that the author was singled out for the identity check in question \nsolely on the ground of her racial characteristics and that these characteristics were the decisive factor in her being \nsuspected of unlawful conduct. Furthermore, the Committee recalls its jurisprudence that not every differentiation \nof treatment will constitute discrimination, if the criteria for such differentiation are reasonable and objective and if \nthe aim is to achieve a purpose which is legitimate under the Covenant. In the case under consideration, the \nCommittee is of the view that the criteria of reasonableness and objectivity were not met. Moreover, the author has \nbeen offered no satisfaction, for example, by way of apology as a remedy.  The HRC concluded (at [8]):In the light \nof the foregoing, the Human Rights Committee, acting under article 5, paragraph 4, of the Optional Protocol to the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is of the view that the facts before it disclose a violation of \narticle 26, read in conjunction with article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant.  Although it is fair to say that a number of \nHRC cases do concern the operation and effect of domestic legislation, in a way which may well be covered by s 10 \nof the RDA so far as Australian law is concerned, it is also apparent that Art 26 can extend to the protection of \nindividuals from discriminatory executive or administrative action. In particular, as Lecraft v Spain demonstrates, the \n\n\n\nprotection of Art 26 has been found to extend to the activities of police officers as agents of the state, in relation to \ntheir conduct against an individual.  The HRC is established under Art 28 of the ICCPR, with its 18 members drawn \nfrom states parties to the ICCPR, although they do not sit as representatives of their respective governments: Art \n28(3). One of its functions is to issue General Comments which explain the meaning of the ICCPR. Another of its \nfunctions is to hear and determine individual complaints brought under the First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. \nAustralia is a signatory to the First Optional Protocol and has been subject to HRC decisions: see, eg, Human \nRights Committee, Views: Communication No 488/1992, 50th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (\u2018Toonen v \nAustralia\u2019).  It may be accepted that domestic statutes based on or referable to the implementation of Australia\u2019s \ninternational obligations should be construed, so far as their language permits, conformably with established rules \nof international law and conformably with the treaty they are said to implement (see the authorities cited at [517] \nabove). It may also be accepted that this principle does not permit the elevation of \u201cextraneous materials\u201d (such as \nHRC decisions) over the text of an international treaty: see Maloney at [134] (Crennan J).  That principle, or \napproach, is qualitatively different from the issue in the present proceeding about Art 26 and its content. The \nquestion of the content of Art 26 of the ICCPR is not a question about the construction of a provision in a domestic \nstatute. It is, as Brennan J explained in Gerhardy, in the extract I have reproduced at [563] above, a question about \nthe content to be given to inalienable rights and freedoms possessed by every human being. As Brennan J \nobserved, different religious, cultural and political systems (and, one might add, legal systems) may attribute \ndifferent content to various rights. Nevertheless, they are rights recognised under international law and, through a \nprovision such as s 9, given effect in domestic law. In my respectful opinion, and in contrast to the construction of s \n9 itself, decisions of the HRC, and decisions of other courts interpreting Art 26 or similar human rights, can and \nshould inform a choice by an Australian court about the content of such rights.  It is permissible, and appropriate, in \nascertaining the content of a right set out in the ICCPR to examine the decisions of the HRC, as the body \nconstituted by the ICCPR to interpret the treaty and to determine complaints brought under the Optional Protocol. \nSuch decisions are not extraneous to the ICCPR; they are integral to and contemplated by it. The HRC has been \nestablished by the treaty to interpret it, and to rule (under the Optional Protocol) on individual complaints brought \nunder it.  It should be noted that the location of Art 26 in the ICCPR confirms it is intended to have an independent \noperation. Articles 22-25 are located before it, and Art 27 after it, each of those provisions dealing with independent \nhuman rights with independent content. The fact that many of the ICCPR Articles concern principles of non-\ndiscrimination does not itself suggest Art 26 can be given no independent content. The ICCPR Articles which, in \ntheir content, may operate on discriminatory treatment do so because, as Joseph and Castan have observed, \nunjustified discriminatory treatment is often at the root of human rights abuses. Such treatment may arise because \nof the operation of a domestic law (directly or indirectly), in which case this may be addressed in Australian federal \nlaw by s 10 of the RDA; or it may arise because of executive or administrative action, in which case s 9 of the RDA \nmay have application.  It is to be expected that the RDA would pick up, as examples of the kinds of human rights to \nwhich it applies, the specific human rights listed in the ICERD which the RDA implements. It does so in s 9(2), \nwhich provides that the rights referred to in s 9 include any right of a kind referred to in Art 5 of the ICERD. It is well-\nestablished (and incontrovertible from its language, and the language of s 9(1)) that s 9(2) is not intended to be \nexhaustive. There is no debate that s 9 (and s 10) can operate on rights set out in the ICCPR and the ICESCR: see, \nfor example, Illiafi at [62] (Kenny J); Aurukun at [33] (McMurdo P), [240] (Philippides J). However, the RDA is \nimplementing Australia\u2019s obligations under the ICERD, not under the ICCPR.  Article 26 is no different from the \nother Articles which surround it in the ICCPR. There may often be overlap between various human rights as \nexpressed (and the overlap between Art 5 of the ICERD and Art 26 is an example), but the existence of overlap \ndoes not deprive each of them of independent content. The second sentence in Art 26 (dealing with the obligation \nof states to ensure their laws provide the guarantee set out in the first sentence) is but one aspect of the right set \nout in the first sentence.  There will be circumstances (such as the sample of HRC cases given above) where an \nindividual\u2019s right to equality before the law without distinction as to race may be impaired or nullified not by a \ndomestic statute, but by its application, including its discretionary application, or the exercise of discretionary \nauthority under a statute. Further, there may be circumstances in which the common law is the basis for the \ntreatment of a person in a way which does not give the person equality before the law. Article 26 can operate in \nboth situations: indeed, in relation to police officers and matters such as common law powers of arrest, one finds \nan example.  It seems to me that the exercise of discretionary statutory powers is another likely example. The law \nconferring the discretion may not be discriminatory either in its direct or indirect operation. But the manner in which \na discretion is exercised may well be. The exercise of that discretion will be an \u201cact\u201d involving a distinction, \n\n\n\nexclusion, restriction or preference for the purpose of s 9 if the effect of the exercise of the discretion is to impair the \nprotection the law should afford to that person on an equal footing with persons of other races. Take, for example, \nthe discretionary decision whether to remove a child from her parents on the ground that her health and safety are \nunder threat. If it could be shown that discretion was exercised by reference to race, her right to equal protection of \nthe law may be found to have been impaired. The child may also have other human rights which have also been \nimpaired. However that is not to deny that her Art 26 right may be one of the impaired rights.  It may well be the \ncase that where the scope and operation of a law, on its face, is concerned, the terms of s 10 will leave no work for \nthe right in Art 26. That can be determined on a case-by-case basis. To say as much is distinct from the proposition \nthat Art 26 has no content or is not an independent human right. It is also distinct from the proposition that s 10 is a \nparaphrase of Art 26. All those statements are, with respect, too broad.  In the present proceeding, the way the \napplicants invoke Art 26, differently to the other human rights they rely on, is not well developed. There was some \nmixing of submissions on Art 26 with submissions on Art 5(f) of the ICERD.  In relation to the conduct relating to the \ninvestigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death until approximately 24 November 2004 (including matters such as notification of \nnext of kin), the applicants\u2019 written submissions put the matter in the following way:a failure by the police to carry \nout their prescribed functions constitutes a failure to preserve peace and good order and a breach of the rights of \ncitizens to go about their affairs in peace.\n\n As submitted above, the right to equality before the law and equal protection under the law without discrimination is \nan autonomous right which prevents both the enactment of discriminatory laws and the discriminatory application of \nlaws by public authorities. In the Applicants\u2019 submission, the QPS is one such public authority and the application of \npowers and functions imparted on the QPS by force of law in a manner which constitutes racial discrimination can \namount to a breach of the right to equality before the law and equal protection under the law.\n\n Further, the Applicants submit that a failure by the police to exercise their functions as prescribed by statute and \nas recognised under the common law could amount to a breach of the rights of citizens to equal protection under \nthe law in the sense that it would be a violation of their rights to go about their affairs in peace and under the \nprotection of the police.  Neither written nor oral submissions developed the argument much beyond this rather \nglobal contention.  In relation to the alleged failures of the QPS in the intervening week and then during the events \nsurrounding the protests and fires on 26 November 2004, the applicants\u2019 written submissions contended:... the acts \nrelied on which occurred between 22 to 25 November 2004 resulted in a wholesale failure of the police to meet the \ncultural needs and expectations of the community on Palm Island or to address the feelings of grief and anger in \nthe community. Rather, the manner in which policing was conducted served to inflame tensions between the \ncommunity and the police. The community\u2019s questions were derided as \u201cnot factual\u201d and derogatory comments \nwere made about the \u201cviolent\u201d culture in the community. The police visibly increased their presence in an \naggressive manner, including by beginning to carry firearms, and not in a productive manner involving engagement \nwith members of the community. The few positive measures which were taken, including the removal of SS Hurley \nand the establishment of regular meetings between Insp Richardson, SS Whyte and Erykah Kyle, were not \nproactive, but reactive and belated.\n\n In the Applicants\u2019 submission, this resulted in the administration of policing services, as authorised by statute and \nby the general law, in a manner which caused a wholesale failure to uphold the law, to maintain peace and good \norder, to provide services required of officers under the law or the reasonable expectations of the community, or to \nallow honest citizens to go about their affairs in peace. Accordingly, the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an \nequal footing of the Applicants\u2019 rights to equality before the law was impaired, as were their rights to access \npolicing services intended for the use of the general public.  And then, as to the events of 26 November 2004 and \nonwards, the applicants submit (having contended that much of the impugned conduct only occurred because Palm \nIsland was an isolated Aboriginal community):In the Applicants\u2019 submission, this resulted in the administration of \npolicing services, as authorised by statute and by the general law, in a manner which caused a wholesale failure to \nuphold the law, to maintain peace and good order, to provide services required of officers under the law or the \nreasonable expectations of the community, or to allow honest citizens to go about their affairs in peace. In those \ncircumstances, the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of the Applicants\u2019 rights to equality before \n\n\n\nthe law and to access policing services intended for the use of the general public were severely impaired.  The \noverlap with the applicants\u2019 reliance on the Art 5(f) right is apparent from these submissions. The \u201cequal protection\u201d \naspect of Art 26 is not advanced in these submissions beyond an entitlement to have policing services rendered \non an equal footing with the manner in which those services would be rendered to any other community or section \nof the public in Queensland, rather than (as the applicants contend) a heavy-handed, culturally insensitive and \ndisproportionate manner.  Accordingly, in my opinion, despite the views I have expressed about the content of the \nright in Art 26, including its capacity for independent application, the content of this right has little separate \napplication to this proceeding. The content of Art 26 as relied upon by the applicants does not appear to extend \nbeyond the content of Art 5(f), and they can be dealt with together. The one exception to this is the making and \ncontinuation of the emergency declaration under s 5 of the PSP Act. That is because this conduct is not, in my \nopinion, comprehended by Art 5(f). I deal with this at [1482]-[1485] below.\n\nThe common law rights relied on by the applicants    The applicants contend the police officers charged with \ninvestigating the death of Mulrunji had duties to act with reasonable diligence and integrity in the way they \nconducted the investigation. These duties were pleaded (in the third further amended statement of claim at [115]) \nas either arising from the legislative scheme under which the QPS operates, or at common law. For the existence of \nsuch duties at common law, the applicants relied on O\u2019Malley v Keelty, Australian Federal Police Commissioner \n[2004] FCA 1688 at [6]- [8] (Emmett J) and Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] VicRp 76; [1995] 2 VR 562 at 578-79 \n(Hansen J).  The respondents contended, without elaboration, that such allegations about common law duties \n\u201cshould be ignored\u201d, on the basis that the functions and powers of the QPS have a statutory source, and also \nbecause breaches of those duties were not pleaded. The respondents did not cavil with the general nature of the \nobligations and requirements alleged by the applicants to apply to police officers in the manner in which they \ncarried out their functions and powers, because ultimately both parties accepted the applicability of the regulatory \nscheme established by the PSA Act and the instruments and policies made under it.  In relation to the events of 19 \nto 24 November 2004, the applicants also rely on a breach of what they describe as \u201ctheir rights to go about their \naffairs in peace under the protection of the police services, under the common law\u201d. The respondents\u2019 submissions \ngive the same answer to this contention, again without elaboration: namely, that the powers and functions of the \nQPS have a statutory source.  The way the applicants rely on the common law is another aspect of their case which \nlacks clarity. It is unclear whether the applicants are relying on the common law as a source of rights within the \nterms of s 9 of the RDA, or whether it forms part of their case about what are the distinctions and restrictions for the \npurposes of s 9. As I have noted elsewhere, the manner in which the applicants have structured their argument \nabout distinctions for the purposes of s 9 has been to identify what they contend the QPS officers were required to \ndo in certain circumstances and then identify what they did not do; the non-compliance being, on the applicants\u2019 \nargument, the relevant \u201cdistinction\u201d for the purposes of s 9. It is unclear whether the applicants contend that QPS \nofficers\u2019 non-compliance with the common law (without particulars about that non-compliance) is an \u201cact involving a \ndistinction\u201d within the meaning of s 9(1).  Insofar as the applicants seek to rely on the common law as a source of \nrights to which s 9 applies, that is a novel submission. Section 9, like s 10, is about a collection of rights described \nas \u201chuman rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d. The term \u201chuman rights\u201d is generally seen as referring to rights \nderived from international law, or (possibly) domestic law which implements international human rights obligations \nassumed by states parties. Whether in s 9 of the RDA the term \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d comprehends freedoms \nthat exist at common law is a novel question.  In circumstances where the applicants themselves did not develop \nany submissions about this construction of s 9, nor any submissions about the precise nature of the common law \nrights or freedoms relied on (including their source in judicial authority), I do not propose to decide the question. The \ngeneral way the applicants describe those rights does not seem to me to involve any different evaluation or \nconsideration of the evidence from the way the applicants contend the powers and functions under the Queensland \nlegislative scheme operate to control police conduct. The content of the asserted common law rights is not \nmaterially different, at least not on the generalised submissions made by the applicants.  Nevertheless, I should not \nbe taken as accepting the respondents\u2019 submissions that there are no such common law rights, and no correlating \ncommon law duties imposed on police officers. The issue was given such scant attention by both parties that it is \nnot capable of resolution, other than to say I am satisfied the applicants have not discharged their burden of proof in \nrelation to breaches of any common law duties or obligations by QPS officers, however those allegations are said to \noperate within s 9 of the RDA.\n\n\n\nThe human rights and fundamental freedoms relied on by the applicants and the subgroup members    The \napplicants and the subgroup, consisting of those individuals whose homes were subject to entries and searches by \nSERT officers on 27 and 28 November 2004 and those who were present in or around the houses during the \nentries and searches, advance s 9 claims independent of the principal class in this proceeding, and accordingly rely \non a separate set of rights and freedoms for that purpose.  The applicants and the subgroup rely in significant \nmeasure on the right set out in Art 17 of the ICCPR, which is in the following terms:     No one shall be subjected to \narbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his \nhonour and reputation.   Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.      \nThey also rely on the right in Art 7 of the ICCPR:No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or \nscientific experimentation.  The rights and freedoms contained in Art 17 are critical to the resolution of the \napplicants\u2019 allegations and I deal with them at [705] below.  Generally speaking, Art 7 and commensurate rights \n(such as Art 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), or those in constitutionally entrenched Bills \nof Rights) apply to a certain severity of treatment and conduct which renders the right unlikely to be applicable in \nthe context of the present proceeding. It is not necessary to do more than give a brief summary of the content of the \nArt 7 right. Just as under Art 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment \nor Punishment (CAT), a contravention of Art 7 by reference to \u201ctorture\u201d involves conduct inflicting severe physical \nviolence: see, for example Committee Against Torture, Views: Communication No 207/2002, 33rdsess, UN Doc \nCAT/C/33/D/207/2002 (2004) (\u2018Dimitrijevic v Serbia\u2019), re Art 1 of the CAT; Human Rights Committee, Views: \nCommunication No 1761/2008, 101st sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/101/D/1761/2008 (2011) (\u2018Giri v Nepal\u2019), re Art 7 of \nthe ICCPR. Although in General Comment 20, the HRC made it clear that causing mental suffering may constitute \ntorture, it is likely the kind of mental suffering would need to be extreme: see also Zaoui v The Attorney-General \n(NZ) [2004] NZCA 228; [2005] 1 NZLR 577 at 103-07. Claims relating to poor or severe prison conditions have \ngenerally not been successful on the basis of alleged contravention of Art 7 rights or their equivalents: see, for \nexample Taunoa v Attorney-General (2004) 7 HRNZ 379 in relation to a prisoner subjected to a \u201cspecial behaviour \nmanagement regime\u201d in a New Zealand prison. This decision also describes the adjective \u201ccruel\u201d in Art 7 and similar \nprovisions as requiring the intentional infliction of severe suffering.  In contrast, \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment is treatment \nwhich induces humiliation and debases a person. In Wainwright v United Kingdom (2007) 44 EHRR 40, a mother \nand her disabled son claimed that strip searches they were subjected to upon entering a prison as visitors of an \ninmate constituted degrading treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR. In rejecting that contention, the European \nCourt of Human Rights described the \u201cthreshold\u201d for degrading treatment as follows (at [41]):Ill-treatment must \nattain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Art.3 of the Convention. The assessment of this \nminimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the \ntreatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and health of the victim. In considering \nwhether a treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Art.3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to \nhumiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely \naffected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Art.3. Though it may be noted that the absence of \nsuch a purpose does not conclusively rule out a finding of a violation. Furthermore, the suffering and humiliation \nmust in any event go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of \nlegitimate treatment or punishment, as in, for example, measures depriving a person of their liberty.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Other cases also serve to illustrate the point at which treatment may become degrading. It \nmust involve more than official conduct which is excessive or disproportionate. For example, excessive use of \npepper spray by police was held not to be \u201cdegrading\u201d in Falwasser v Attorney-General [2010] NZHC 410; [2010] \nNZAR 445. Handcuffing a person for a court appearance may not amount to degrading treatment if there is \nadequate justification: Raninen v Finland [1997] ECHR 102; (1998) 26 EHRR 563. In contrast, having prisoners in a \nScottish jail \u201cslop out\u201d human waste was held to be degrading treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR: see Napier v \nScottish Ministers [2004] ScotCS 100; [2005] 1 SC 229. Corporal punishment has been held to be degrading \ntreatment when inflicted by police officers as part of a sentence: see Tyrer v United Kingdom[1978] ECHR 2; \n(1979-80) 2 EHRR 1.  The applicants and the subgroup members further rely on two rights, one in Art 9(1) of the \nICCPR and one in Art 5(b) of the ICERD, which have similar content. However, these rights are given significantly \nmore emphasis in the claims of the applicants themselves. Article 9(1) of the ICCPR provides:Everyone has the \nright to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be \n\n\n\ndeprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.  \nSimilarly, Art 5(b) of the ICERD protects:The right to security of person and protection by the State against violence \nor bodily harm, whether inflicted by government officials or by any individual group or institution.  There is no debate \nthat the first limb of Art 9 requires any deprivation of liberty to adhere to the requirements of the law. In the present \nproceeding, if the arrests of Mr Wotton and certain members of the subgroup were unlawful, then the Art 9 rights of \nthose individuals have been impaired or nullified. In and of itself, that will not establish a contravention of s 9 of the \nRDA, but it is important to note that Art 9 requires, first and foremost, adherence to other requirements of the law.  \nHowever, like other ICCPR rights, Art 9 goes beyond the requirements of the law and confers a freedom from \narbitrary deprivation of liberty. Article 9 was considered by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and \nMulticultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri [2003] FCAFC 70; 126 FCR 54. The Court said at [143]-[146]:In \nconstruing Art 9(1) it should first be noted that the right not to be subjected to arbitrary detention is, textually, in \naddition to the right not to be deprived of liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as \nare established by law. Professor Manfred Nowak, in his authoritative commentary on the ICCPR, The UN \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights: CCPR Commentary ... notes this additional limitation and observes that it is \nnot enough for the deprivation of liberty to be provided for by law; the law itself must not be arbitrary.\n\n The history of the second sentence of Art 9(1) supports the conclusion pointed to by the text and supports, as well, \na broad view of what constitutes arbitrary detention for the purposes of Art 9. Professor Nowak reviews the travaux \npr233;paratoires ... and observes that the prohibition of arbitrariness was adopted as an alternative to an exhaustive \nlisting of all the permissible cases of deprivation of liberty. It was based on an Australian proposal that was seen as \nhighly controversial, and although some delegates were of the view that the word arbitrary (\u201carbitraries\u201d) meant \nnothing more than unlawful, the majority stressed that its meaning went beyond this and contained elements of \ninjustice, unpredictability, unreasonableness and \u201cunproportionality\u201d.\n\n Having considered the history of Art 9 Professor Nowak concludes that \u201cthe prohibition of arbitrariness is to be \ninterpreted broadly\u201d and that \u201c[c]ases of deprivation of liberty provided for by law must not be manifestly \nunproportional, unjust or unpredictable\u201d ... Other commentators have expressed much the same view ... \n\n In applying Art 9 in the performance of its functions under the ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee (the \nCommittee) established under Art 28 has also interpreted the provision broadly and as containing an important \nelement additional to, and beyond, compliance with the law ... The Committee concluded:\u201cThe drafting history of \narticle 9, paragraph 1, confirms that \u201carbitrariness\u201d is not to be equated with \u201cagainst the law\u201d, but must be \ninterpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice and lack of predictability. This means \nthat remand in custody pursuant to lawful arrest must not only be lawful but reasonable in all the circumstances ... \u201c\n\n(Footnotes omitted).    The applicants submit that it may well be the case that there are members of the subgroup \nwho have claims under s 9 which are similar to those made by the applicants, but accept those claims cannot as a \nmatter of fact be determined in this proceeding. The respondents\u2019 submissions accepted this position.  It is also \nwell-established that Art 5(b) protects against racially discriminatory arrests and other interferences with personal \nliberty by government officials, including police officers: see P Thornberry, The International Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (OUP, 2016) p 323. Therefore, if the first limb of s 9(1) is made out \nin relation to the arrests of Mr Wotton and the relevant members of the subgroup, their Art 5(b) rights have also \nbeen impaired or nullified.  In the applicants\u2019 final submissions, there were references to a number of other sources \nfor the rights asserted, such as Arts 31 and 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, Art 17 of the \nUDHR and Art 5(d)(v) of the ICERD. These were not pleaded by the applicants, and aside from being briefly \nmentioned, no submission was made about their content and how that content might differ (for example) from Art 17 \nof the ICCPR. I do not consider them further.\n\nArticle 17 of the ICCPR: the right not to be subjected to unlawful interference with privacy, family or home    The \nrespondents did not dispute the authorities on which the applicants relied concerning the content of the right in Art \n17. They accepted, correctly, that for each of the applicants (and, for that matter, the subgroup members) the \narrests, entries and searches occurred at places which were the \u201chomes\u201d of the applicants and the subgroup \n\n\n\nmembers, and that the family members present fell within the concept of \u201cfamily\u201d as used in Art 17.  The pre-\neminent aspect of the Art 17 right is often described as privacy: see, eg, the commentary by Joseph and Castan at \n[16.01]. Interference with one\u2019s home, and family, are seen as aspects of the privacy right. The HRC has described \nprivacy as \u201cthe sphere of a person\u2019s life in which he or she can freely express his or her identity, be it by entering \ninto relationships with others or alone\u201d: see Human Rights Committee, Views: Communication No 453/1991, 52nd \nsess, UN Doc CCPR/C/52/D/453/1991 (1994) (\u2018Coeriel v The Netherlands\u2019). Forcible entry and search of an \nindividual\u2019s house (in an apparently mistaken raid) has been found by the HRC to be a contravention of the \nindividual\u2019s rights under Art 17: see Human Rights Committee, Views: Communication No 687/1996, 71st sess, UN \nDoc CCPR/C/71/D/687/1996 (2001) (\u2018Rojas Garcia v Colombia\u2019).  Where conduct such as an entry and search of \nan individual\u2019s home where other family members are present is concerned, it is not difficult to conclude that there \nhas been an interference with the privacy of the individual and of her or his family members. That is the case with \nthe entries and searches by SERT officers of the homes of the applicants and other members of the subgroup. The \nnature of the evidence which has been adduced in these proceedings, to which I refer elsewhere in these reasons, \nleaves no doubt that there was, for the purposes of Art 17, an \u201cinterference\u201d with the private and personal lives and \nhomes of the individuals affected. I include in this finding people, such as the witnesses who gave evidence in this \nproceeding, who were no more than innocent bystanders, without necessarily being members of the family whose \nhouse was entered and searched.  In dealing with a similar right under the Charter of Human Rights and \nResponsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) (s 13), Bell J of the Supreme Court of Victoria (sitting as President of the Victorian \nCivil and Administrative Tribunal) in Kracke v Mental Health Review Board [2009] VCAT 646; 29 VAR 1 adopted an \napproach to the subject matter of the right which is consistent with the Committee\u2019s approach in General Comment \n16. His Honour said (at [620]):The fundamental values which the right to privacy expresses are the physical and \npsychological integrity, the individual and social identity and the autonomy and inherent dignity of the person.  The \naspects of Art 17 which generate the most debate are the adjectival aspects: namely, that the interference must be \neither unlawful or arbitrary. That is also the case in this proceeding.  Whether an interference is unlawful is, again, a \nrelatively straightforward assessment because one examines the requirements of (here) Australian law, and \nQueensland law in particular, relating to the entry and search of private property and the arrest of individuals. The \napplicants contend that all the arrests undertaken on 27 and 28 November 2004 were unlawful, although there has \nbeen in the proceeding particular focus on the arrest of Mr Wotton, as the lead applicant. Similarly, they contend the \nentries and searches of the houses were unlawful.  Arbitrariness, it is well-established, is to be given a different \nmeaning from lawfulness in provisions such as Art 17.  The HRC, in its General Comment 16, described its \nunderstanding of arbitrariness in the following way, noting that it can include an interference which is lawful:The \nintroduction of the concept of arbitrariness is intended to guarantee that even interference provided for by law \nshould be in accordance with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and should be, in any event, \nreasonable in particular circumstances.  In Toonen v Australia, the Committee expanded upon the concept of \nreasonableness in the following way:The Committee interprets the requirements of reasonableness to imply that \nany interference with privacy must be proportional to the end sought and be necessary in the circumstances of any \ngiven case.  In R (Munjaz) v Mersey Care NHS Trust [2005] UKHL 58; [2006] 2 AC 148, a United Kingdom case \ndealing with ECHR rights (where there is an equivalent right to Art 17, namely Art 8), Lord Bingham\u2019s description of \nwhat the phrase \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d means also conveys an understanding of what it means to say \nsomething is \u201carbitrary\u201d:it is directed to substance and not form. It is intended to ensure that any interference is not \nrandom and arbitrary but governed by clear pre-existing rules, and that the circumstances and procedures adopted \nare predictable and foreseeable by those to whom they are applied.  In Charter litigation, the Supreme Court of \nVictoria has expressed a variety of opinions about the width of the concept of arbitrariness. In Re Director of \nHousing and Sudi [2010] VCAT 328; 33 VAR 139 (at [63]-[82]), Bell J adopted a meaning which approximates that \nused in international and comparative human rights cases: namely, that it encompasses a lack of proportionality or \njustification and objective unreasonableness. This aspect of his Honour\u2019s decision was not relevant to the grounds \nof appeal, nor to the basis on which his Honour\u2019s decision was overturned: see Director of Housing v Sudi [2011] \nVSCA 266; 33 VR 559 at [4]- [5], [43] (Warren CJ), [61]-[63] (Maxwell P) and [283]-[284] (Weinberg JA). At first \ninstance in WBM v Chief Commissioner of Police [2010] VSC 219; 27 VR 469, Kaye J took a narrower approach, \npreferring to construe the term \u201carbitrary\u201d as meaning conduct not based on any identifiable criterion, but which \nstems from an act of caprice or whim: at [51], [56]. On appeal in WBM, the Court of Appeal did not need to \ndetermine whether Kaye J\u2019s approach was correct. In obiter statements, Warren CJ (with Hansen JA agreeing) \nexpressed a preference for the approach adopted in the United Kingdom in relation to Art 8 of the ECHR, which \n\n\n\nwould include capriciousness and unpredictability, but also unreasonableness, injustice and lack of proportionality \nto the legitimate aim sought: WBM v Chief Commissioner of Police [2012] VSCA 159; 43 VR 446 at [114]. In \nVictorian Police Toll Enforcement v Taha [2013] VSCA 37, Tate JA also preferred a meaning which followed that \ntaken in jurisdictions applying human rights jurisprudence: at [198]-[199].  I prefer a construction of arbitrariness \nwhich includes, at least, lack of proportionality to the ends sought, and lack of justification. Such a construction \ngives independent operation to arbitrariness in contrast to unlawfulness. Exercises of statutory power which are \ncapricious or irrational are unlikely, under Australian law, to be lawful: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v \nSZMDS [2010] HCA 16; 240 CLR 611 at [42](Gummow ACJ and Kiefel J), [119]-[120], [130]-[132] (Crennan and \nBell JJ). I would, with respect, adopt the approach of Tate JA in Taha. In construing and applying s 9 of the RDA \nand its express incorporation of identified human rights, it is preferable for Australian law to give content to those \nrights \u2013 and to concepts such as \u201carbitrariness\u201d \u2013 which is consistent with the content given to them in other \njurisdictions.\n\nRESOLUTION OF THE APPLICANTS\u2019 CLAIMS  \n\nStructure of findings in this part and approach to the evidence    The way in which I propose to set out my findings \nof fact, and my findings about whether or not the impugned conduct, or any part of it, constitutes a contravention of \ns 9 of the RDA, is to take the four categories of conduct identified by the applicants in their summary of their final \nsubmissions. Those categories are:(a) the police conduct in the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death;\n\n (b) the police conduct during the \u2018intervening week\u2019 after Mulrunji\u2019s death and prior to the protests and fires of 26 \nNovember 2004;\n\n (c) the emergency declaration issued under the PSP Act;\n\n (d) the deployment of SERT and the arrests, entries and searches. I have set out my findings about the scope of \nthis claim on the pleadings at [99]-[109] above.  As I have noted earlier, the pleadings in this case divide the police \nconduct into small and specific parts. On some issues there can be no objection to that: for example, the making by \nDI Webber of the emergency declaration. On other issues, it becomes difficult to understand how it is said a single \npiece of conduct contravened s 9 of the RDA. Examples of the latter are the allegations that Inspector Richardson \n\u201cwas not adequately briefed on the contents of the Preliminary Autopsy Report\u201d, that appointing DI Webber and DS \nRobinson to the investigation team was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d; the failure to electronically record conversations with SS \nHurley; and that QPS members \u201ccommandeered the local school bus\u201d. The fragmentation is then complicated by \nusing the specifically identified conduct as a basis to allege non-compliance with various legal duties, so that the \nnon-compliance itself appears to become an \u201cact\u201d.  A good example of this is the pleading in [307] of the third \nfurther amended statement of claim, which states:In each of:\n\n a. the commandeering of the school bus, the damage to property, and the other conduct pleaded under sub-\nheading J.2(e) hereof; and\n\n b. the evacuation pleaded under sub-heading J.2(f) hereof;\n\n in contravention of s 10.14 of the Code of Conduct, the QPS officers responsible for those events failed to:\n\n c. demonstrate high standards of professional integrity and honesty;\n\n d. perform any duties associated with their position diligently and to the best of their ability, in a manner that bears \nthe closest public scrutiny and meets all legislative, Government and Service standards;\n\n e. act with fairness and reasonable compassion;\n\n\n\n f. provide conscientious, effective, efficient and courteous service to all those with whom they have official dealings. \nIn particular, members are to be sensitive to the special circumstances and needs surrounding victims of crime;\n\n g. perform their duties impartially and in the best interests of the community of Queensland, without fear or favour; \nand, or alternatively\n\n h. act in good faith.  At [309(f)] the non-compliance with the Code of Conduct is alleged to be an \u201cact\u201d for the \npurposes of s 9 of the RDA, read with s 3. I deal with the misconception involved in this approach, which was \nmanifest throughout the pleadings, at [725] below.  The point to be made here is that the fragmentation in the \npleadings also led to similar fragmentation in the evidence, and it was only during final submissions, with some \ninsistence from the Court, that the applicants attempted to draw their allegations together in a way which engaged \nwith the task they faced under s 9 of the RDA. In response, the respondents also engaged directly with that task.  \nThis litigation challenges, in identified stages, the performance in an Aboriginal community of a series of policing \nfunctions and powers on behalf of the State of Queensland, first in response to the death of an Aboriginal man in \ncustody, and second in response to community reactions to that death and the subsequent police investigation. \nThe grouping of police conduct in broadly chronological stages and by identifiable subject matter, and the \nmeasuring of that conduct (as grouped) against s 9, is the only rational approach to a claim such as this.  To do \notherwise would be a triumph of form over substance and would allow some of the fragmentations and distractions \nin the pleading to obscure those parts of the pleading, and their development through the evidence and \nsubmissions, which were the gravamen of the case made on behalf of the applicants. For reasons similar to those \ngiven by Allsop J in Baird, I do not consider such an approach should be taken.  To take this approach does not \nallow the applicants to depart from their pleadings in the sense of raising allegations not reasonably understood to \narise from the pleadings. It is rather, as I have said, a question of substance and emphasis.\n\nThe applicants\u2019 premise of unlawfulness and non-compliance    A significant part of the applicants\u2019 pleadings is \noccupied with allegations that the conduct of QPS officers was unlawful. On some occasions the unlawfulness was \nsaid to lie in non-compliance with statute. In others, it was non-compliance with orders in the OPM. In still others, it \nwas non-compliance with policies or procedures in the OPM, or with the QPS Code of Conduct. Sometimes non-\ncompliance was used as an alternative description to unlawfulness.  I do not accept the direct link the applicants \nsought to draw between unlawfulness or non-compliance, and contraventions of s 9 of the RDA. The premise which \nunderlies this approach is flawed.  Where a claim under s 9 of the RDA identifies as the relevant \u201cact\u201d an exercise of \nstatutory power, the lawfulness, or unlawfulness, of that exercise of statutory power will not necessarily answer the \nquestion posed by s 9. Similarly, where there are instructions or procedures given or issued as part of an internal \ndisciplinary and regulatory regime such as that set out in the OPM, non-compliance with instructions or procedures \nwill not necessarily answer the question posed by s 9.  Broadly, the respondents are correct in their submission \nthat, where the OPM sets out a policy or procedure and states that it may be departed from if there are \u201cgood and \nsufficient reasons\u201d (in the case of a policy), or states that \u201cgenerally\u201d an objective should be achieved in a particular \nway (in the case of a procedure), no legal duties or requirements are imposed upon police officers in any given \ncircumstance. The respondents are also correct to submit that there was no onus, legal or evidentiary, on them to \njustify admitted or proven non-compliance with policies or procedures \u2013 for example, by proving there were \u201cgood \nand sufficient reasons\u201d in a particular situation for a particular policy not to be applied. The respondents carried no \nsuch onus. That does not mean, and I understood the respondents to accept as much, that the conduct of police \nofficers is incapable of constituting a \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d: rather the respondents \ncorrectly resist the rigid, legalistic approach to the terms of the OPM taken by the applicants, together with any \nsuggestion of a reversal of the onus of proof.  Contrary to the applicants\u2019 submissions, the status of unlawfulness or \nnon-compliance, of itself, is not a \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d for the purposes of s 9 of the \nRDA. Instead, focus on lawfulness or compliance in my opinion may confuse the issues for determination, and that \nis what has tended to occur in the arguments made in this proceeding.  An exercise of statutory power which is \notherwise lawful may still contravene s 9 if it involves a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on \nrace and has the requisite purpose or effect. Similarly, an act complying with an order under the OPM may still \ncontravene s 9 if it involves a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race and has the requisite \n\n\n\npurpose or effect. The status of lawfulness or compliance, or unlawfulness or non-compliance, says nothing about \nthe discriminatory nature of an act. However, there may be circumstances where an act comprising an exercise of \nstatutory power is so obviously beyond jurisdiction that its exercise in those circumstances is probative of the act \ninvolving a distinction based on race, rather than being based on a statutory purpose.  Further, a statutory power \nexercised in contravention of s 9 of the RDA might (and I emphasise might) be said to have been based on an \nimproper purpose and so made without jurisdiction, or to have been based on a misunderstanding or \nmisconstruction of the power (it being likely most powers would be construed as not authorising racially \ndiscriminatory conduct). Both of those conclusions would arise from the conclusion of a contravention of s 9, not the \nother way around. No contentions of that kind are made in this case.  The approach I have taken does not render \nunlawfulness or non-compliance irrelevant to the questions posed by s 9 of the RDA. I give three examples of \nwhere it may be relevant.  First, unlawfulness or non-compliance may inform a conclusion whether an act involving \na distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference is based on race. Disregard for the law, or disregard for the need to \ncomply with orders or procedures, may provide evidence of the basis for distinction or restriction involved in an act. \nDisregard for the law may make it easier to infer that basis is race. An example might be the arrest of a young \nAfrican man as he stands on a street corner using his phone, on a charge of having stolen the phone. Let us \nassume the police officer is later shown to have had no basis whatsoever for a reasonable suspicion that the young \nman had committed the offence of stealing the phone he held. The arrest \u2013 the \u201cact\u201d for s 9 purposes \u2013 would be \nunlawful. The status of the act as being unlawful does not answer the question posed by the first limb of s 9(1). \nHowever, the reason for the unlawfulness \u2013 a complete absence of a reasonable suspicion of the commission of an \noffence \u2013 may be probative of a conclusion that the arrest (act) involving a restriction (the young man loses his \nliberty while he is taken to the police station to be charged and bailed) was based on race. Thus, the reason for the \nunlawfulness may assist in supplying the inference for a racial basis.  Second, the reasons for the unlawfulness \nmay, in some circumstances, inform the identification of a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference. For \nexample, an employer pays wages to her Indian employee which are below the level of wages set in the applicable \nenterprise agreement. The \u201cact\u201d is the payment of wages. The \u201cact\u201d is unlawful, or non-compliant with the enterprise \nagreement, because the wages paid are below what is stipulated in the agreement. The payment of wages (the act) \ninvolves a distinction (paying less wages than the employee is entitled to) and (we assume in this example) is \nbased on the employee being Indian. In this example, the reason for the unlawfulness (payment of wages less than \nthe entitlement set out in the enterprise agreement) is the distinction involved in the act: it is the differential \ntreatment. It is not the status of the payment of wages (the act) as unlawful which is critical, or even relevant, to \nidentifying a contravention of s 9.  The third example is in a different category and relates to instances in which \nunlawfulness may be an element of nullification or impairment of a human right. Relevantly to this proceeding, Art \n9(1) of the ICCPR provides that \u201cno one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance \nwith such procedure as are established by law\u201d. As I note at [700] above, there is no debate that an unlawful \ndeprivation of liberty, including an unlawful arrest, will nullify or impair the right protected by Art 9(1). Similarly, Art \n17 of the ICCPR provides that \u201cno one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, \nfamily, home or correspondence\u201d. Therefore, assuming the first limb of s 9(1) is made out, an unlawful arrest would \nsatisfy the second limb of s 9(1), as would an unlawful interference with privacy. But the unlawfulness of the arrest \nor the interference is not, of itself, relevant to whether the first limb of s 9(1) is satisfied. For example, police officers \nuse a listening device to monitor conversations in the home of a man suspected of drug trafficking. They do so \nwithout lawful authority. The man\u2019s rights under Art 17 of the ICCPR are nullified or impaired because the \nmonitoring is unlawful, but there is no suggestion the officers\u2019 conduct involved a distinction based on race. If the \nsole reason the officers suspected the man of drug trafficking was that he was from Sub-Saharan Africa, their \nconduct would involve a distinction based on race and the second limb of s 9(1) would be satisfied because of the \nunlawfulness of using the listening device. In both cases, the man\u2019s Art 17 rights are nullified or impaired because in \nboth cases the use of the listening device is unlawful and interferes with his privacy. It is not the unlawfulness of \nusing the listening device that satisfies the first limb of s 9(1) in the second case: it is the fact that the man was \nsingled out for particular treatment based on his race. To focus on the unlawfulness as the \u201cdistinction\u201d is apt to \nobscure the true reason that the first limb of s 9(1) is satisfied.  All of these matters are fact and circumstance \ndependent. Aside from the third example, none flow inevitably from the status of an act as unlawful according to \nstatutory or general law, or as non-complaint with instructions, directions or policies rendered binding on the actor \nby statute or by contract (to take two examples).  The applicants also made a general and repeated contention that \nevery time there was a breach of any \u201claw, police obligation and police procedure\u201d (being the description in the \n\n\n\napplicants\u2019 submissions at [595]) this amounted to a \u201cdistinction\u201d for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA. That was said \nto be the case because the Court was, the applicants submitted, entitled to assume that \u201claws and QPS obligations \nand procedures are ordinarily adhered to\u201d. That is the effect, in particular, of two of the key paragraphs in the \napplicants\u2019 third further amended statement of claim: [246] and [247]. Those paragraphs allege:     In November \n2004, ordinarily in Queensland, the Second Respondent and QPS Officers:       complied with QPS Policy, Orders \nand Procedures and all Acts and laws required to be complied with, in the provision of QPS services to residents of \nQueensland;    conducted investigations into deaths in police custody according to QPS Policy, Orders and \nProcedures;           complied with the PSAA, including ss. 2.3 and 2.4(2) of the PSAA;           acted in partnership \nwith the community at large, and provided QPS services as were required under any Act or law or the reasonable \nexpectations of the community or as reasonably sought of officers by members of the community;    provided to \ncommunities in Queensland which were predominantly made up of members of the racial majority in Queensland:         \nQPS Services and the rendering of help reasonably sought, as are required of officers under any Act or law or the \nreasonable expectations of those communities;     QPS Services which considered the cultural needs of those \ncommunities;     QPS Services which met the cultural needs of those communities;     QPS Services which met the \nspecific cultural and ethnic demographic characteristics of those communities and the needs thereby created.                 \nIn 2004, residents of Queensland were entitled to expect that the QPS would uphold the law.      The applicants\u2019 \ncontentions as expressed in these pleadings are too broad and too absolute. While police officers can be expected \nto do their best to adhere to the requirements of law, policies and procedures, they are, like other human beings, \ncapable of making mistakes, not following requirements as closely as they should, making errors of judgement and \nmaking choices in the performance of their duties that may be less than ideal, or making choices that fit the \noperational circumstances rather than the terms of a policy or procedure. The officers involved in the events on \nPalm Island know only too well the consequences of these issues, as they have been subject to a number of \ninquiries and reports in various jurisdictions.  In order to involve a \u201cdistinction\u201d (or exclusion, restriction or \npreference) for the purposes of s 9, it is critical to the purpose of s 9 that differential treatment can be identified. The \ndifferential treatment will not be found in an aspirational standard set out in orders, policies, codes or procedures. It \nwill not be found by comparing conduct with such an aspirational standard. It will be found in the way a person or \npersons are treated, in comparison to others. Otherwise, as the respondents submit, a standard of perfection would \nbe imposed in order to avoid contravention of s 9.\n\nThe contemporaneous video evidence    Before I embark on explaining the conclusions I have reached in each \ncategory of conduct impugned by the applicants, it is important to set out in some detail certain key aspects of the \ncontemporaneous video evidence from 2004 which have contributed to the findings I have made.  The \ncontemporaneous evidence of the events that took place in mid to late November 2004 consists mostly of video \nrecordings, taken by a variety of individuals and therefore approaching the events from a variety of perspectives. \nSome show the same events, not only from different vantage points but also as taken by people with widely \ndifferent interests (for example, a local resident versus a television reporter). Some of this video footage was shown \nto witnesses during the proceedings, but much of it was not. Sometimes only excerpts were shown. I have watched \nall of the video footage, several times. I have found it helpful in reaching my conclusions because of its \ncontemporaneity and spontaneity, and because it comes from different sources and so cannot be said to have been \ntaken with only one intention, or from one perspective. No evidence was adduced, nor any submission made, to \nsuggest the footage was not authentic, nor that it was unrepresentative of the events depicted, or was inaccurate.  \nThe first set of footage comprises six videos taken by Stephen Arthur Hume between 22 and 27 November 2004, \nmostly recording all or parts of the community meetings held in the square near the police station. Mr Hume \nrecorded these videos in his role as a camera man for Channel 10. The footage appears to be uncut, because \nsometimes interviews stop and restart.  The first video begins with some footage of the central area of Palm Island, \nwhere the general store, the Council offices, the police station and the courthouse were located. It is raining, and \nthere are not many people about. A few people, adults and children, are filmed walking along the roads. There is \nfootage of the bay, the pier, forklifts doing deliveries, cars driving along the road which runs parallel with the bay, \nthe sea with neighbouring islands in the background and rubbish bins with beer cans in them. An interview with \nErykah Kyle, the Mayor at the time, then begins. She speaks about the \u201coutpouring of anger\u201d from the community \nwhich occurred the day before, as a reaction to Mulrunji\u2019s death. She describes how she needed to do a \u201clot of \nencouraging\u201d to have the young men move away from the police. She said \u201cthere is so much anger ... [Mulrunji] \nwas a great hunter, he had a lot of mates who go hunting ... he was a great diver, they don\u2019t use anything expect \n\n\n\ntheir spear guns ... we know him as a healthy young man except for his drinking\u201d. She describes his family as a \nquiet family.  It would appear this interview occurred on Tuesday, 23 November 2004. That is clear because Ms \nKyle speaks about the resolution at the meeting the day before that SS Hurley leave the island, which he did. Other \nevidence establishes this occurred on 22 November 2004. Ms Kyle said the feeling was \u201cvery high\u201d against SS \nHurley, because \u201che was the sergeant in charge of the whole situation\u201d. It appears she may not yet know about SS \nHurley\u2019s personal involvement in the events leading up to Mulrunji's death. She describes other views of members \nin the community, stemming from other interactions, that are adverse to SS Hurley. She says that people have \nheard he had to leave another Aboriginal community and that the other community did not have a good experience \nwith him. There is no evidence about this before the Court, but I refer to it to demonstrate what the then leader of \nthe Palm Island community had by way of information, how quickly speculation can become prominent in a tense \nand difficult situation such as this, and therefore how important it was for the QPS officers on the island to be \ntransparent, which in my opinion, they were not.  I should say at this point that Mayor Kyle appears throughout all \nthe video evidence of her as a careful, measured and concerned leader, having some depth of experience with her \ncommunity. She notes in the interview that she had not seen the level of anger then present \u201cfor years ... for a long \ntime\u201d. She describes Palm Island as a \u201cplacid\u201d community and expresses her shock at the level of anger she was \nwitnessing. I did not take her use of the word \u201cplacid\u201d as signalling any ignorance about some of the issues of \nviolence, especially domestic violence, which other evidence revealed as problems within the Palm Island \ncommunity. Rather, I took her description as one she applied to the general disposition of the community when its \nmembers were out and about in public. This has some consistency with the video evidence showing Palm \nIslanders, as they gathered and moved about in public, having a relaxed demeanour while they went about their \ndaily lives.  Ms Kyle describes the large numbers of young men in the community who were unemployed, with low \nlevels of education, and who spent their time hunting and fishing. She acknowledges there was a considerable \namount of drinking in the community, as the young men had nothing else to do. She described Mulrunji as a \u201clow \nkey fellow\u201d and said he was not known in the community as a nuisance, and appeared to question the reasons for \nhis arrest. She reports the family\u2019s observations that Mulrunji had bruises on his face. She emphasises her concern \nabout the 339 recommendations coming out of the RCIADIC and how, with all these recommendations, nothing was \nin place to prevent this death. Ms Kyle expresses concerns about the state of the watchhouse, which she says had \na \u201cputrid smell\u201d. She relates what she had heard about the circumstances of Mulrunji\u2019s death, including that he died \nalone, which does not accord with the objective evidence from the cell video showing Patrick Bramwell in the cell \nwith him. This illustrates again the consequences of the QPS failing to provide any reliable and transparent \ninformation to the community, up to and including the Mayor.  Mayor Kyle describes there being four public \nmeetings on 22 November 2004 \u2013 she emphasises how devastated all Mulrunji\u2019s friends were and says she does \nnot know how the anger will subside. She emphasises the young people were \u201cnot listening\u201d yesterday, and there \nwas too much anger to speak rationally to them. She describes this as the first death in custody \u201cfor a long long \ntime\u201d, and then describes how she lost her own son three years earlier to a death in custody that occurred in \nanother community. She expresses concern for all the Palm Islanders incarcerated in Townsville at this time and \nwhat they must be going through. When asked what her advice to the community was, she urges everyone to \u201cget \ntogether and focus on this beautiful young man that we lost ... to get past our anger to showing respect for his life \nand his family\u201d.  She notes how unusual it was for the young men to be so outspoken and angry, and adds \u201cit wasn\u2019t \nalcohol either\u201d because the canteen was closed. She presents as obviously and genuinely worried about the level \nof anger. I am satisfied she would have expressed similar views to QPS officers.  The video then moves to filming \nseveral police officers near a police vehicle, apparently speaking to drivers and locals and issuing tickets. Some \nlocal men are then interviewed, speaking about Mulrunji, describing him as \u201charmless\u201d and a \u201cpretty good bloke\u201d. \nThe men are all calm, although they are expressing their unhappiness and frustration with the police. The men \nstate that \u201ceveryone\u201d is holding the police responsible for what happened. There is then some footage of the \ncourthouse and the sign above the courthouse, which appears to have cracked glass: it may be that the \ncameraman assumed the damage was from a rock thrown at the sign, but there is no particular evidence to \ndetermine why that footage was shown.  The second video in this series also commences with footage of the Palm \nIsland courthouse, with some damage done to a wall, again I infer from a rock being thrown at it. The footage then \nfocuses on a couple of rocks, perhaps 5 to 6 cm across, lying in the yard in front of the courthouse. Again, one can \nspeculate about the point the cameraman was seeking to make, but that is all. It is common ground there were \nincidents of rock throwing, mostly at night, directed at the police station: the police logs record an event, for \nexample, at 11 pm on 22 November 2004. As I set out at [755] below, Inspector Richardson had described rock \n\n\n\nthrowing as generally a \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d on the island.  The footage then moves to outside the Palm Island \nstore, where groups of people are sitting down on benches, steps and walks around the store and the square. \nThere are people of mixed ages, many children, and some people are laughing and chatting. The atmosphere is \nobviously relaxed.  The footage then moves to an interview with Inspector Richardson (part of which I have \nextracted at [306] above). He begins the interview by calling the place \u201cMornington\u201d, as in \u201cMornington Island\u201d, but \nthen corrects himself and the video restarts. He describes the watchhouse as \u201cvery basic\u201d but disclaims any \nconnection between the watchhouse and Mulrunji\u2019s death. He says he is \u201cnot exactly sure\u201d about the cause of \ndeath. He describes that \u201call of a sudden, yesterday\u201d (that is, 22 November 2004), questions were asked about \nMulrunji\u2019s death. He describes what was being said as \u201crumours\u201d and says that \u201cthey can ask their questions when \nthey get all the facts\u201d, that is, once the autopsy report had been released.  He says:These community problems \nfrequently arise when there\u2019s been a death in custody. ... they are emotional about the deaths ... There\u2019s attacks \nmade and allegations made. The majority of it is unfounded but it\u2019s developed through rumours which are spreading \nthroughout the community.  He then says that, in these circumstances, it is \u201ccommon practice\u201d to take an officer \ninvolved out of the community. He also states that \u201cThe investigations at this stage have shown no improper police \npractice\u201d, which is clearly not an accurate statement for him to make by 23 November 2004. No explanation was \ngiven in the respondents\u2019 evidence about why Inspector Richardson would make such an inaccurate statement. \nOne obvious explanation is that all of the Aboriginal witness\u2019s allegations had been disregarded.  He describes the \nrock throwing as \u201cconcerning\u201d, but says that he understands it to be a \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d on the island, \ncontinuing:The government department houses are frequently pelted with rocks mainly by a lot of juveniles, that \noccurs at night time and unfortunately appears to be a way of life on Palm Island.  This evidence is significant. \nInspector Richardson himself is recognising that rock throwing at public buildings \u2013 antisocial and aberrant as it may \nbe \u2013 was a \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d on Palm Island. Yet it was presented at the time of these events, and was again \npresented in this proceeding, as something unusual, terribly frightening, and indicating high levels of risk and \nviolence.  The footage then moves to various local people speaking, with a microphone, at a meeting. The date and \ntime of this is unclear. The first speaker is talking about other allegations against SS Hurley and questioning why \nSS Hurley was allowed to be \u201cin charge of us\u201d. The speaker alleged SS Hurley had spoken to 16-year-olds by \nsaying \u201cDon\u2019t talk smart, I\u2019ll pig slap you\u201d. I refer to this not to express a view about its truth but as an example of \nwhat was being said about SS Hurley, and the high level of dissatisfaction with the QPS and SS Hurley in particular. \nI do not accept that these sentiments were unknown to QPS officers during the first few days of their investigation \ninto Mulrunji\u2019s death.  The footage of the crowd again shows a mixture of ages, with many children and babies, and \na number of women obviously very concerned and listening intently. A number of young people are also listening \nintently to what was being said. There is applause when the speaker finishes, but it is a peaceful gathering.  Each \nspeaker emphasises the RCIADIC, the recommendations made and the failures to implement them, and expresses \nfrustration that another Aboriginal person has died in custody. The speakers are male and female, mostly middle-\naged or a little older. They speak with eloquence and passion. I estimate there to be perhaps 100 people sitting \naround and listening.  Each of these speakers is rational, understandably outraged, and speaking about issues of \npolicy, as well as speaking of the community\u2019s grief at having lost one of their own. Speakers say that nobody is \nlistening to Aboriginal people. At the end of the speeches, Mayor Kyle calls for a resolution that the police minister \nshould come to Palm Island. She speaks, through tears, about her own family\u2019s experience of a death in custody. \nShe says:How many more of our people are going to die in custody, where there is much money spent to keep \nAboriginal people locked away. They talk about programs. What programs ... this is the place where we want the \nprograms ... programs we know will work for our people.  She calls for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d and for the police to \n\u201canswer\u201d and \u201crespond\u201d, implying that officers should not rely on any privilege against self-incrimination.  Among the \nspeakers is Roy Bramwell, who relates what he saw in the police station when Mulrunji was brought in. As he \nspeaks, a man and a woman stand behind him with a poster calling to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody. Bramwell \ncalls for Hurley to go to jail, and a man in the crowd calls out to similar effect.  A woman then speaks about how \nPalm Islanders needed to \u201cstand up\u201d for all Aboriginal people and \u201cstand up\u201d about how police are working in their \ncommunity. She speaks about how police \u201cdon\u2019t even know us as a person or as a people ... how we think ... how \nour culture is ... how we respect death ... they don\u2019t know us, they\u2019re just talking about us\u201d. She called for more \nIndigenous police officers and liaison officers. She called for the community to come together.  The reporter then \ngives a speech to camera about tensions being very high in the community, through several takes. Each time he \ndoes a take, the emphasis on \u201ctensions being very high\u201d increases in what he says. As he says this, adults, children \nand dogs can be seen wandering about behind him near the store. His increasingly emotive description does not \n\n\n\naccord with the tenor of the meeting.  The third video in this series begins with an aerial view over the island, and \nthen moves to another community meeting. In his evidence, Mr Wotton confirmed that the events in the video took \nplace on the morning of Thursday, 25 November 2004. Mrs Agnes Wotton is the first speaker at this meeting. She \nspeaks strongly about Mulrunji\u2019s death, asking \u201cwhat are they doing\u201d, and speaks about her concerns there would \nbe a cover-up. She asks if the police were contributing to Mulrunji\u2019s funeral expenses, since he died in their \ncustody. In this video a few people can be heard calling out in the background. Mayor Kyle then speaks about how \nofficers from government departments were being \u201cheld back\u201d from coming to Palm Island \u201cbecause of the \nviolence\u201d, and then began speaking about how Palm Islanders should start doing things for themselves and not \nrelying on government. \u201cThey\u2019re not staying away to show respect to us ... they\u2019re staying away because we are \nviolent\u201d. It is difficult to understand what Mayor Kyle meant by this comment, but on balance it seems to me she \nwas saying the community was being unjustly stereotyped as violent. Again, in this footage, family groups with a \nnumber of children can be seen sitting around, talking, going about their business at the store and in their cars.  An \ninterview then commences with Tracey Twaddle, Mulrunji\u2019s partner, and Elizabeth Doomadgee, Mulrunji\u2019s sister. It \nis still Thursday, 25 November 2004. They are standing outside the store. Both women speak with great sadness \nand considerable disbelief, but clearly and solemnly about their need to know what has happened. They speak \nabout not being able to come to terms with why he died: \u201cHow can it be after just an hour ... he wasn\u2019t sick or \nseriously ill ... we just want to know what happened\u201d. Both describe themselves as being angry, but they are calm \nand solemn when doing so. A young child is standing with them. Ms Twaddle recounts how, when she was told \nMulrunji had a black eye, and swelling around his eye, she stated that he had not fought with anyone that morning. \nElizabeth Doomadgee describes Mulrunji as a hunting man, very fit, and just a \u201chappy drunk\u201d. Both women speak \nagain about how black deaths in custody must stop. Elizabeth Doomadgee says \u201cwe all want to know why ... why is \nthe question\u201d.  I should interpolate at this point that there is in evidence video footage of Mulrunji after he died. It is \nplain from that footage that his right eye and cheek were quite swollen.  As Ms Twaddle and Ms Doomadgee speak, \nAboriginal and non-Aboriginal people are walking around in the background. Children are filmed playing in the \npuddles; people are filmed in the store, and sitting outside. I note these details only to illustrate the apparent \nongoing normality of life on Palm Island despite the subject matter of the women\u2019s interview. Ms Twaddle states \nhow glad she is that people had come down to the square, spoken at the meeting and \u201cstood up\u201d. The extended \nDoomadgee family are filmed \u2013 children, young people and older people. Concern is expressed again about the \nlength of time it is taking to get the autopsy report and for the QPS to tell the family, and the community, what \nhappened.  There is then another interview with Inspector Richardson, who describes the situation as \u201cpretty calm, \nbut with an air of tenseness\u201d, although on the second take he drops the \u201cpretty calm\u201d part. There are then further \ntakes, and each time Inspector Richardson emphasises tension and apprehension more strongly, moving away \nfrom the first take where he described the situation as \u201cpretty calm\u201d. He describes rocks being thrown on the roofs \nof the police station and the barracks, and at a police car. This time he does not repeat what he said in the earlier \ninterview about rock throwing being a common occurrence on Palm Island prior to Mulrunji\u2019s death. He says \u201cmost \nof the damage is being caused by juveniles ... no doubt they have got a bit of aggression in them\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll just \nhave to see what happens ... take it as it comes\u201d. He agrees with the interviewer it might be \u201cnormal\u201d for Palm \nIsland, and observes there \u201calways seems to be some aggression\u201d on the island. He speaks of local men working \nwith the police on night patrols. He is asked what he said to the community and he says \u201cthey should sit back, wait \nfor the report to come out, see what is in the report ... nothing\u2019s going to come out of this overnight ... don\u2019t go \nlistening to rumours ... we need the facts to come out ... listen to people who have the ability to sensibly reason\u201d.  In \nlight of the facts that emerged during the police investigation, Inspector Richardson\u2019s comments demonstrate \nconsiderable partiality. His comments emphasise antisocial behaviour of local people and diminish the seriousness \nof what he knew by then had been alleged about SS Hurley\u2019s conduct. That of course would not have been \napparent to a listener at the time he gave the interview. There is then some footage shown of damage to the police \nbarracks, apparently to confirm what Inspector Richardson had just said.  The fourth video in the series begins with \nan idyllic frame of the jetty on Palm Island and some general footage in the early evening of the courthouse and \npolice station, with officers walking around. The footage then shows officers preparing to go out on night patrols. \nThey all appear to be armed. Officers are shown standing around and talking. The atmosphere seems fairly casual. \nThe video then cuts to a daytime scene, which appears to be the following day. This is the footage of Mayor Kyle\u2019s \ndescription of the autopsy results. A small number of people (perhaps 50) are filmed seated around the square, \nagain with a predominance of women and children visible, but also a number of elderly people. The number of \nchildren present may be explained by Mr Koch\u2019s evidence that the meeting was taking place in the school lunch \n\n\n\nbreak. Bwgcolman school is physically located very close to the mall area. Once more, there are no signs of unrest: \npeople are sitting and talking, gathered in small groups, others going about their daily business. Mayor Kyle \nemerges from the Council offices and tells the people that she is waiting for a member of Mulrunji\u2019s family to arrive. \nVarious people are shown going into and out of the Council offices. The footage then ends.  The fifth and final video \nis the fuller footage of the same meeting, where Mayor Kyle tells the community about the autopsy results. I have \ndealt with these events in the general narrative at [318] above. The point to emphasise is that, while the information \nthat Mayor Kyle conveys is serious, there is nothing aggressive or agitated in the reaction of the people listening. \nPolice helicopters can be heard and seen, but local people are sitting quietly, talking, watching. Many other locals \ncan be seen coming in and out of the store, walking past those sitting around. When Mayor Kyle starts to speak, \nshe asks for a moment of silence for Mulrunji, which is respectfully observed by the whole crowd. The size of the \ncrowd shown on this footage is larger than the fourth video, and is likely to be around 100 to 150 people. The \nmoment\u2019s silence is one of the many points in this video evidence which is incompatible with the picture of the \nprevailing atmosphere on Palm Island portrayed by officers such as Inspector Richardson at the time, and by the \nQPS witnesses in this proceeding.  Ms Kyle informs the meeting that she has spoken to the State Coroner and has \nbeen told she could share whatever was considered appropriate from the autopsy report to meet the needs of the \ncommunity. QPS officers are noticeably absent. I do not understand why QPS officers were not making this \nannouncement, or at least standing by the side of the Mayor. There was no evidence before me that the Mayor was \ngiven any assistance by QPS officers in compiling her remarks. As I have found at [318] above, what Mayor Kyle \nsaid was neither a complete nor contextually accurate summary of the autopsy findings, and it is clear the use of \nthe word \u201caccident\u201d to describe what caused Mulrunji\u2019s severe injuries generated some shock and disbelief amongst \ncommunity members. No QPS officer spoke, for example, to reassure the meeting that given the nature of \nMulrunji\u2019s injuries the cause of those injuries would be vigorously and independently investigated. The \ncircumstances called for such reassurance, at the very least.  After Mayor Kyle finishes, a number of individuals \ntake the microphone and express their views. First is David Bulsey. He says \u201cput him in prison\u201d, referring to SS \nHurley. Some people are calling out \u201cthat\u2019s not an accident\u201d and \u201cwho caused the accident\u201d. Mr Bulsey can be \nheard saying \u201cif I did something like this I\u2019d be put in prison\u201d. Mr Wotton then says that \u201cthings gunna burn\u201d, a \nstatement which seems to have been part of the reason he was identified as the ringleader of those who \nparticipated in the protests and fires. Mr Bulsey claims the police were inciting a riot and that they wanted a riot, \nasking \u201cwhy should he [SS Hurley] get away with fucking murder\u201d. Both Mr Bulsey and Mr Wotton are speaking \nloudly. There is no doubt that they are angry. However, the content of what they are saying is about their sense of \ninjustice: Mr Bulsey says that when he did the wrong thing he went to prison and that is all he wants to see for SS \nHurley. He says:If you people don\u2019t stand up it\u2019s gunna happen again and again and again. If you people don\u2019t \nstand up its gunna happen again, maybe your children.  PLO Bengaroo is accused of being an accessory to \nmurder. Mr Bulsey asks why the police would not come out and give more answers.  Some people in the crowd are \naudibly and visibly angry. One can be heard saying \u201cwe\u2019re not under the Act, we\u2019re all young generation now, you \nmob of cunts\u201d. Others using similar language can be heard. The footage then moves to the back of the police \nwatchhouse where Mulrunji had been taken from the police vehicle. Men and women are yelling out; rocks or other \nitems can be heard landing on the police buildings. There is then footage of Mr Wotton striding angrily into the \npolice yard with a shovel, and being physically restrained and taken back out of the yard by Mr Bulsey.  The \nfootage then moves to the island airport, with various people arriving. DI Webber is shown at the airport. During \nthis footage, an employee of the airline is told, by telephone, that the police station is on fire and people have \nsurrounded the barracks. The employee is asked if he is thinking of getting off the island. He replies, \u201cdunno, \nhaven\u2019t had any problems before ... wouldn\u2019t like to, no ... depends how it turns out\u201d. He then says he might lock up \nthe airport. He does not seem particularly concerned.  The footage then shows a plane landing at the airport, and a \ngroup of people taking off in a plane. This is the plane Inspector Dini described in his evidence that he decided to let \ngo, despite the Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) that was in place. I address the NOTAM in more detail at [1105] below. \nSome aerial footage then appears, showing smoke coming from the central part of Palm Island. The video \nconcludes with some footage from Townsville airport of a number of police officers preparing to leave for the \nisland.  There is another video in evidence which also shows Mayor Kyle describing the autopsy results from \nanother angle, and also shows Mr Wotton entering the yard of the police station with a shovel. It adds nothing of \nrelevance to the description I have given above.  Other video footage in evidence was taken by Mr Hal Walsh, who \nhad previously worked for the Palm Island Council but in November 2004 was employed by Queensland Corrective \nServices. It is footage of some of the events on 26 November 2004. Several female voices can be heard from time \n\n\n\nto time throughout the footage. None of these people were identified in the evidence. The footage commences with \na scene from the mall area, and shows, from a different angle, the speech by Mayor Kyle about the autopsy report, \nand the subsequent speeches by David Bulsey and Lex Wotton.  The footage then cuts straight to scenes of smoke \ncoming from the police station, and the sound of a fire alarm. About 20 people can be seen walking past, heading \nin various directions, some with their shopping bags. A person on a bike can be seen standing under a tree. The \nfootage then shows flames as the police station is engulfed. By this stage there are several dozen people standing \naround watching. The sirens of the fire brigade can be heard, and then a fire truck can be seen arriving. The fire \nofficers who get out of the truck appear to be Aboriginal, and I infer they may be local people. A local woman goes \nto help two of them. There is a heated shouting exchange between this woman and a group of mostly men further \naway from the station. It is not possible to hear what is being said. However, it appears the men are angry that local \npeople are assisting in putting the fire out. Cheers can be heard as the station burns. After no more than a few \nminutes, the crowd quietens and people continue to stand around, or sit. At this stage no more than a few dozen \npeople are present. A group of about six local people are assisting to put the fire out.  SS Hurley\u2019s house is then \nshown surrounded by smoke. The camera turns to face up to Reservoir Ridge, behind the main settlement, where a \ngroup of people can be seen although they are too far away to make out any individuals. Voices on the video \nidentify these people as \u201cthe cops\u201d. I infer this is SS Dini and the other police officers who had not long before \narrived on the island. Reservoir Ridge is located in between the airport and the main settlement. Inspector Dini \ngave evidence about standing up on Reservoir Ridge looking down towards the main settlement and watching the \nfires.  The camera turns back to the fires. Local people, both young and middle aged, can then be seen pulling fire \nhoses along the road towards SS Hurley\u2019s house, which is now completely on fire.  The footage then shifts to the \nfront of the hospital, which in distance terms would be no more than approximately 100 m away from the police \nstation and SS Hurley\u2019s house. I interpolate here that the events I describe at [792] below (from the footage taken \nby Constable Robertson) have occurred by the time this footage records officers standing outside the hospital. A \nfemale voice on the video states that \u201ccops are having to wait at the hospital, running from the barracks, hiding out \ndown here\u201d. Helicopters can be seen circling. There are approximately 100 people visible, including police. Some \nof the officers appear to be talking to some of the locals. Most local people are simply watching, there is some noise \nbut it is mostly people talking and calling out. The footage then shows the line-up of officers outside the hospital, \nand a Rottweiler police dog aggressively barking. The crowd seem to be winding the dog up. Inspector Richardson \nand SS Whyte can be seen speaking to Mr Wotton. The footage then moves to some scenes at the airport of more \npolice officers arriving, and also a helicopter landing near the hospital. A number of patients can be seen being \nevacuated from the hospital to the helicopter. More helicopters can be seen in the air. The remnants of the burnt-\nout police station are also shown, as well as SS Hurley\u2019s house. Again, as with all the footage, there are numerous \nlocal people simply standing around and there are still a large number of children visible. Some of the children are \nplaying in the middle of what is going on around them, others are simply standing around watching.  The next piece \nof footage is also from 26 November 2004. It was taken by Nicky Wills, about whom there is little evidence before \nthe Court but who appears from the footage to have been a member of the local community. The footage begins \nwith similar scenes of helicopters flying around; Ms Wills states \u201chere is the burnt-out police station ... they\u2019ve just \nflown in all these emergency people\u201d; she then identifies \u201cUncle Molly\u201d in the footage. This footage is clearly taken \nlater in the day because the fire is mostly out and the burned out remains of the two buildings are visible. Ms Wills \nstates \u201cthey\u2019ve declared a state of martial law here on the island and they\u2019ve flown in extra coppers, there\u2019s one \nthere, and apparently they\u2019ve all been told to shoot if there\u2019s any more harassment\u201d. The footage then shows a \nmiddle-aged woman and a young girl on the street, and a number of local people (perhaps 50 or so) sitting in the \nmall. Ms Wills then interviews some young girls in the mall, who express views about Mulrunji\u2019s death, including that \n\u201cif he was white it wouldn\u2019t have happened to him\u201d. Mrs Agnes Wotton, who is sitting in the mall with some other \nwomen, is then asked for her views. Mrs Wotton says \u201cwe put our heart and soul into what happened last week ... \nand it came out ... knew something was going to give\u201d and expresses the hope that the world will take notice.  A \ngroup of men, including Mr Wotton, are then interviewed, saying the police could have prevented what happened. \nNegative views about the autopsy result are expressed by several of them. They assert that the kind of injuries \nMulrunji suffered could not have been self-inflicted or accidental. Complaints about the police are also made. The \nfootage then moves to a helicopter which had landed outside the front of the hospital, apparently with more police \nofficers coming in. The buzzing of helicopters appears constant. Again, as Ms Wills moves around, there are still \npeople standing, watching and walking around. Some footage of a Channel 7 news item about the day\u2019s events is \nthen recorded, including interviews with police officers and the then Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie. Darren \n\n\n\nCurtis, the Channel 7 news reporter on the island, reports that it appears everything will now stay calm, that officers \nare patrolling on foot and taking time to stop and talk to local people, and that most police officers are now \nunarmed. He reports tension between local people about whether the buildings should have been burned down.  \nThe footage then shows interviews with more people sitting around in the mall area \u2013 again, the atmosphere is \nrelaxed, although it is clear people are most concerned about the level of police presence. One elderly man \nremarks on how angry the young people were, how things could have been handled better. The footage then \nmoves to the Council chambers, where Mayor Kyle can be seen talking to a group of approximately eight to 10 \npeople, mostly middle-aged to older women, discussing whether anything could have been done to stop the \nbuildings being burned down. There is also discussion about past injustices, including how their people came to be \nput on Palm Island. The group then discusses the presence of the police, the occupation of the school by police, \nand the hospital. The group discusses their view that \u201cblackfellas\u201d are not able to sit in the back trays of vehicles, \nbut people have seen \u201cwhite coppers\u201d doing just that.  The footage then shows PSRT officers, in full riot gear, \nstanding around the Council chambers. Ms Wills says this is a Sunday, so it must be Sunday, 28 November 2004. \nThis is after the arrests, entries and searches and after the removal of those who had been arrested from the \nisland. Ms Wills states that the Premier (Mr Beattie) has been in the Council chambers for over three hours. The \nfootage then shows Mr Beattie emerging with Mayor Kyle and a large group of media. Groups of people are \nstanding around shaking hands. The Premier then speaks, paying his respects to Mulrunji, describing how he sat \ndown with the Council and the elders and how the important thing was to \u201cmove forward\u201d. He states that he wants \nto \u201cget some good\u201d out of what has happened: to re-establish law and order, to improve services on the island, to \nrebuild the police station and courthouse, to finalise an alcohol management plan, and to establish new \ngovernance arrangements to align the Palm Island Council with other local council structures as they operate \naround Queensland. The Premier emphasises that it is a time for mourning, and then the community must move \nforward. He finishes with assuring the crowd that the CMC will thoroughly investigate what had happened in relation \nto Mulrunji\u2019s death and urges people to respect the outcome of that process. The footage concludes with scenes at \nthe Palm Island cemetery and the graves of Ms Wills\u2019 family.  There is another video in evidence taken, apparently, \nby a local person. It also shows the aftermath of the fires, including burnt out buildings. It shows some of the people \nwho are present in the mall areas, sitting around talking. The air is smoky. There is a young boy on a horse. There \nare people with bicycles, and children. There is some footage of children playing in the street with what looks like \nbuilding material. Helicopters can be heard and seen in the air. The footage shows the scene outside the hospital, \nwith a number of police officers standing around a helicopter which has landed. This footage shows a little more \nclearly groups of people standing approximately 50 m away from the hospital, about 100 people, in small to medium \nsized groups. They are talking, or watching. A woman with a baby on her hip walks into the hospital.  In none of the \nvideo evidence to which I have referred have I seen a single person with any spears or sticks. One young boy, \nperhaps around 10 to 12 years old, could be seen outside the hospital with a small rock in his hand, which fitted \ninside the palm of his hand. Otherwise I saw no people with rocks. Some noises could be heard when the fire \nengine first arrived at the fire, which may well have been the fire engine being hit with rocks, but it is difficult to \nknow. Overwhelmingly, the contemporaneous video footage shows groups of local people \u2013 never in the region of \n200 to 300, in my opinion \u2013 sitting or standing around, talking and watching. There are large numbers of children \nand elderly people present. Some people appear simply to be going about their daily business without paying much \nattention to what is happening around them. Others are clearly watching. In my opinion all of this evidence shows a \ncommunity concerned, frustrated, and at times angry, but it shows no indication of continuing risk of further property \ndamage, and certainly no risk of physical violence of the kind which some of the contemporary media reporting and \npolice commentary, and later descriptions of these events, suggested was likely.  The video evidence also \nestablishes that, as the applicants submitted, there was general suspicion amongst a significant number of people \nin the Palm Island community about the circumstances of Mulrunji\u2019s death, SS Hurley\u2019s possible role in it, and what \nother white police officers might be doing to \u2018cover-up\u2019 what had happened. Contrary to the respondents\u2019 \nsubmissions, the evidence on this issue is not limited to Mr Wotton, Mrs Agnes Wotton, Mr Blackman Senior and \nMs Sailor, although each of those witnesses gave specific evidence to this effect, and linked their evidence to their \nknowledge of and reactions to the RCIADIC. The video footage from the community meetings in the week after \nMulrunji\u2019s death is clear evidence of more widespread community suspicion and concern. Many of the individuals \nwho are interviewed express concerns of this kind. The sense of anxiety, anger and mistrust is palpable and, as the \napplicants submit, there is a sense of outrage and frustration about the situation. One only has to watch and listen \nto Mayor Kyle\u2019s speech to those assembled at the community meeting about her own family\u2019s experiences to hear \n\n\n\nthe trembling in her voice, and to hear the audible responses from the crowd, to get some sense of the level of \nconcern.  Finally, and in my opinion in stark contrast to the other video evidence, I turn to the video taken by \nConstable Robertson, a police officer stationed on Palm Island on 26 November 2004. There is also a transcript of \nwhat Constable Robertson and others say during this video recording, and that transcript was in evidence before \nme. Constable Robertson was not called to give evidence. The footage begins with a view of the crowd gathered in \nthe mall, just after Mayor Kyle had told the people gathered there about the autopsy report. David Bulsey\u2019s voice \ncan be heard, giving the speech to which I have earlier referred. Constable Robertson says \u201cthey\u2019ve just been told \nhow Doomadgee died ... riots with the police riots with the police.\u201d The footage then shows a group of local people \nwalking towards the police barracks. I estimate in the footage one can see approximately 50 people. Constable \nRobertson can be heard to say \u201cwe just got the call to kit up ... here we go ... game\u2019s on ... we\u2019re in trouble ... we\u2019re \nin trouble\u201d. He can then be heard to say \u201cwe\u2019re on our way ... wait for me\u201d as he moves with the camera still \nrecording.  Some commotion is then apparent as he and other officers appear to be looking for and putting on their \ngear, including finding their weapons. Constable Robertson can be heard to say, in a highly agitated voice:They \nsaid to get down there straight away. Hang on, we\u2019ve all got to go down at once. Fuck. Fuck you\u2019ve got to take your \nGlock they\u2019re chuckin\u2019 fuckin\u2019 fair dinkum into the Station. They\u2019ve just smashed all the windows. All right hang on \nmate, hang on, oh fuck. Wait up mate, wait up. Fuck.  I interpolate here that a \u201cGlock\u201d refers to a handgun.  The \nsound of smashing windows and rocks pelting the building can be heard. Footage is shown of some of the crowd \noutside. Again about 50 to 75 people are visible, some are shouting and calling out, and are gathered near the \nentrance to the police station.  The time stamp on the video then moves from 1.03 pm to 1.30 pm on 26 November \n2004. The camera moves around quickly and shakily and the footage is difficult to see clearly, but officers can be \nseen moving about from one direction to another. SS Whyte can be seen moving quickly across the frame of the \ncamera. Constable Robertson then says:Fuck. We\u2019re in trouble. Where are we holding them down now? \n\n [another officer] Fucked if I know.226;128;\n\n Watch out, watch out, pull back, pull back, back, back, watch em come over the roof \n\n [another officer] Have you got a holster?226;128;\n\n Yeah I\u2019ve got a big pocket, chuck one in my pocket. \n\n [another officer] Give us those spare ones mate.  Constable Robertson can be heard puffing while he is speaking. \nTen to 12 police officers can be seen moving around the yard. The camera then focuses on the back gates to the \nbarracks, facing onto Mango Avenue. Constable Robertson also shows some footage of the Ruger Mini-14 rifle. \nFrom time to time, noises can be heard, it may be rocks or other items being thrown, it is difficult to tell. Constable \nRobertson gives the following narrative.I\u2019ve got the mini 14. ... We\u2019ve been chucked out of the Station, it\u2019s been over \nrun and we\u2019ve had to move back to the barracks, we\u2019ve reached barracks, we\u2019ve reached the station, I\u2019ve had to \ngrab, we have to grab all the ammunition, all guns so they couldn\u2019t get any and we\u2019ve got nowhere to run, we\u2019ve got \nnowhere to run. I don\u2019t want to go in there, I don\u2019t know where to go. Board up these windows. Watch out. They\u2019re \nat Mango Ave, they\u2019re at Mango Ave. Is everyone here? All right update, we\u2019ve all been chucked out of the Station, \nthey\u2019ve now set it on fire, I have two Glocks and a semi automatic rifle on me. A mini 14 and we are in trouble, we \nare in fair dinkum trouble. They\u2019ve just broken through the Compound, into the barracks, we have only had one \ngarage shed, they have now the police vehicles, the police vehicles, they\u2019ve got the vehicles. They have now \nbroken through the Compound and we\u2019re in trouble, dead set trouble. Now the last barracks we got nowhere to hide \nand we\u2019re out of options. They\u2019ve set fire to the Station, they\u2019ve now set fire to the front barracks and we\u2019re at the \nlast barracks we are now surrounded. They\u2019re upstairs now and we are downstairs in the garage, we are fully \nloaded. I\u2019ve only got 30 rounds, I\u2019ve got two Glocks and we are outnumbered. ... We\u2019re in trouble, we\u2019re in trouble, \nwe\u2019ve got nowhere to go now. They have both, there is only two police vehicles, they have both police vehicles, \nthey are on fire I think. If we go anywhere our only option is to run, is to run and try and they\u2019re trying to get \nthrough.  The footage then moves back to the double metal gates at the rear of the barracks, opening onto Mango \nAvenue. These gates are approximately seven feet high. A small group of local people can be seen on the other \n\n\n\nside of the gates, and they can be seen throwing items, possibly rocks. Constable Robertson then calls out:Heads \nup heads up, heads up.  He then says, apparently for the benefit of the recording rather than to his colleagues:The \nonly option we have now is to run to the hospital which is about 100 metres away and there is a bus there to try and \nget back to the airport which we will not make, we will not make that airport. We will not make, we will not make that \nhospital. The only, the only option we have now is to open fire, is to open fire, that is all we have now, we\u2019re in \ndead set trouble. There is three to four hundred people out there.  The footage shows nowhere near 300 to 400 \npeople. It may show about 10 to 20 people. The sounds one can hear in the background do not indicate a group of \npeople any larger than 10 to 20 people. They mostly appear to be young men or teenagers. Mr Wotton\u2019s estimate in \nevidence was that there were no more than 30 people. I agree that would be an upper limit.  As I noted earlier, \nfootage of people at the mall showed around 50 to 100 people. It is unclear from where Constable Robertson could \npossibly get a figure of 300 to 400 people. Constable Robertson then records the following words:Jesus. Stephie I \nlove ya.  While not wishing to diminish the seriousness of the situation, and accepting that viewing something like \nthis many years after the event on a video does not approach any similarity with being present in that moment, it is \ndifficult to understand why Constable Robertson had the level of fear he represented in the video. One possibility is \nthat there was some over-dramatisation by him while he was filming. He was not called as a witness so none of \nthese matters could be explored with him. It will be apparent from the findings I have made about what can be seen \nin the video that I am not prepared to take Constable Robertson\u2019s recorded words at face value as an accurate \ndepiction of what was occurring.  SS Whyte can then be seen in the footage going out to speak to the young people \non the other side of the gates. Again, the footage shows no more than 10 to 20 people. Constable Robertson can \nbe heard calling out \u201cWatch out Rodg watch out\u201d. SS Whyte speaks to the locals on the other side of the fence, and \nthere is much yelling from them at him. He retreats, apparently because more rocks have been thrown. Constable \nRobertson yells out and appears to become quite unhinged. He states:We\u2019ve got no option we gunna have, we \ngunna have to open fire.  My impression is that Constable Robertson is not, at this point, over-dramatising about \nwhat he believed might need to occur. He is quite serious when he says that he considers police officers may \n\u201chave to\u201d open fire on an unarmed group of what appears to be approximately 20 Aboriginal people.  The video \nthen shows SS Whyte going out again to speak to the group on the other side of the fence. That he does so sits \nsomewhat incongruously with what Constable Robertson has just said. Mr Wotton can be seen at the front of the \ngroup near the gates. While SS Whyte is out speaking to the group, Constable Robertson then continues, in an \nagitated voice:We have got nowhere to go, we\u2019ve informed VKR on the mainland, we\u2019re in trouble. Even if we do \nget extra cops over to the airport we cannot go and pick them up and there is no vehicle to go get them. There is \nabout 14 cops, there is a bus at the hospital but someone is gunna have to run to the hospital. You are not going to \nget it in, you\u2019re not gunna get that fuckin\u2019 bus here.  As SS Whyte is speaking to the group, one local person can be \nheard to say \u201cwe\u2019re not going to hurt any individual\u201d. There appears now to be something more resembling a \nconversation between SS Whyte and several individuals in the group at this point.  The footage then goes back to \nscenes of smoke, and Constable Robertson continues with his monologue. From what he says about being given \none hour, I take this to be a reference to the conversation Mr Wotton had with SS Whyte immediately before, when \nMr Wotton was standing behind the metal gates. Constable Robertson then says, in a tone inflected with some fear \nand frustration:There is Palm Island Police Station well on fire, well alight, that mini 14 I\u2019ve got, I didn\u2019t get any \nbloody ammunition for it, I thought it was in the case that I was carrying. They\u2019ve given us one hour to get off the \nIsland. Spoken to Assistant Commissioner Roy Wall who has directed us that we are not to leave the Island, we \nare not to leave the Island. They\u2019re flying in only 20 more officers they\u2019ll be here in the next 20 hours [sic]. Only 20 \nmore officers to come and help us and they have informed the Army, as well. The Army are on the way as well. So \nwe\u2019re surrounded in our Compound and they\u2019ve given us an hour to get off the Island however, we\u2019re not leaving.  \nThe footage shows the police officers grouped together, preparing to move, it seems, to the hospital. SS Whyte \nthen speaks to the assembled officers. Some of what he says has been referred to elsewhere in these reasons. \nHowever, I consider it important to reproduce all of what he says. The transcript of Constable Robertson\u2019s video \nfootage which is in evidence inexplicably does not contain all of what SS Whyte says. I have listened to the video \nseveral times and I find this is what SS Whyte says at this juncture:I have a couple of officers here just looking out \nthere, a couple of officers to the side there, a couple of officers to there. Now we\u2019ve all got to work together here, we \ndon\u2019t do anything stupid. Mr Richardson is the boss and he\u2019ll give instructions if you need to utilise your firearm. I \nknow he has given instructions before. I\u2019d be very careful with the firearm. It may the case that you will have to \ndischarge a few fuckin\u2019 rounds in the air, to scare the shit out of these cunts. I don\u2019t know about you but that\u2019s \nfuckin\u2019, that\u2019s just ridiculous, there\u2019s not one fuckin\u2019 court in the land or one cunt anywhere in Australia\u2019s gunna \n\n\n\nfuckin\u2019 put up with it when they see this shit. And when I, we were talking and carrying on they were on camera, \nthere was a commercial tv station taking all that footage.  A small explosion can then be heard and the officers \ncomment that it must be a gas bottle going off in the fire.  The footage then cuts to footage of the officers walking \ndown Mango Avenue to the hospital in a group. There do not appear to be any local people around at all. The \nfootage then cuts again to a view from the line-up of police officers outside the hospital, looking out towards the \nwater, and the local people who are standing around. By the time stamp on the video, this is 16 minutes after the \nofficers were walking down Mango Avenue. SS Whyte and Inspector Richardson can be seen talking to Mr Wotton \nand a number of other men. Erykah Kyle can also be seen in this footage standing near Mr Wotton. A few men are \nshouting out. My estimate is that about 50 to 100 local people can be seen in this footage. Again, none of these \npeople, as far as I can see, are holding spears or sticks, or indeed holding anything at all. Most of the officers, in \ncontrast, are armed.  As I have found, Constable Robertson\u2019s video footage, and his commentary, presents a very \ndifferent perspective on the sequence of events which lasted, perhaps, an hour or so. His version is inflammatory, \nheightened, almost hysterical in parts. The references to the likelihood that officers would start shooting people is \ndisturbing, to say the least. All the local people who were visible were unarmed, except for some who had thrown \nrocks. It is not possible from the footage to see anywhere near the numbers of people that Constable Robertson \ndescribed, and that some police witnesses also described in their evidence in this proceeding.  There are several \ninterpretations which could be placed on the different impressions gained from the media and local footage, and the \nfootage shot by Constable Robertson. Of course, the latter is the only one which shows the way the police officers \nwere surrounded and had rocks thrown at them, and that must be taken into account. My finding is that there was \nreal fear amongst the officers, and certainly Constable Robertson displayed that. He also displayed some \nexaggeration and over-dramatisation in what he said and how he presented what was happening, but it is difficult to \nknow if that was conscious, or simply stemmed from his subjective fear. The objective basis for the level of fear he \nshowed was harder to discern. I have found that he was speaking seriously and not over-dramatising when he \nsuggested police offices may have to open fire on local people. That statement is extremely concerning.  The way \nSS Whyte conducted himself in speaking to the group of local people on the other side of the gates indicated the \nsituation was well capable of being brought under control and indeed that is exactly what SS Whyte did, with (it \nwould seem) some co-operation from Mr Wotton and the other local people.  In my opinion, it is likely that some of \nthe fear arose from the fact that this was a group of white police officers, surrounded by a group of angry Aboriginal \npeople. There was, I have no doubt, a racial element to it. So much comes across in Constable Robertson\u2019s video, \nand what he is recorded as saying. It also came across in Inspector Whyte\u2019s oral evidence in this proceeding. \nInspector Whyte\u2019s evidence was, as I have found, often exaggerated. The explanation for the exaggeration is in part \nhis personality and disposition but, in my opinion, in part because he was describing confrontations with groups of \npeople who were not white, not like him and whom he did not really understand. For example, he said:It was a very \nprecarious situation. There were other Aboriginal people in the area, hundreds of people. Very, very fearful of my \nown life, safety and welfare at that point in time but I needed to communicate with him to at least allay my own fears \nthat I was going to get a plumber\u2019s Stillson across the head.\n\n ...\n\n It wasn\u2019t something that was minor. I\u2019ve been involved in riots on the communities in the past. This was something \nelse. I guess, with experience, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the case that you need to make sure that you have another conversation \u2013 \nor, as best you can, with the identified leader, and I had no doubt Mr Wotton was the leader. He was the man \u2013 no \ndoubt whatsoever \u2013 and the precarious situation that we were in is that what if they \u2013 that\u2019s the people that were \nthrowing rocks and stuff \u2013 entered into that barracks. Now, the police need to know about use of firearms, and \nlethal force. How horrible \u2013 how bloody awful would it have been if police had to use lethal force to protect their \nown lives? Primarily to mitigate against that, I saw it upon myself that I needed to talk to Mr Wotton, and \ncommunicate and say, \u201cHey, listen. This can\u2019t go on. You know, fuck off. This \u2013 you know, this cannot go on.\n\n ...\n\n\n\n I got pelted with rocks, and I went out unarmed, hands like this, and there were hundreds of people on the other \nside of Mango Avenue throwing rocks at me, so I went back into cover - - -  No submission was made by either \nparty about whether the reactions of these two police officers were typical or atypical of the reactions of the other \nofficers present. The video footage of the officers lined up outside the hospital shows no officers visibly distressed \nor agitated, but there is simply insufficient evidence to make any findings about how fearful any other officers were.\n\nFirst category: the police conduct in the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death    The way I have structured this part of my \nreasons is to set out my findings on the impugned conduct and my conclusions whether it involved a distinction, \nexclusion, restriction or preference based on race. In the next section of my reasons (starting at [1463] below), I \nthen consider whether any acts involving distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences based on race, which I \nhave found proven, had the purpose or effect required by s 9: that is, whether they had the purpose or effect of \nnullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or \nfundamental freedom. For those acts which I do not accept involved a distinction, exclusion, restriction or \npreference based on race, I do not go on to consider the second limb of s 9(1).  The applicants divide their \nallegations regarding police conduct in the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death into six categories: the interactions \nbetween investigating officers and SS Hurley; DS Robinson\u2019s involvement; failures in oversight by senior officers; \nthe treatment of Aboriginal witnesses, particularly PLO Bengaroo; failures to assist the pathologist conducting the \nautopsy; and failures to meet or consider the cultural needs of the community.  In the course of considering those \nallegations, I set out below a number of extracts from transcripts of interviews between investigating officers and \nwitnesses to the events surrounding Mulrunji\u2019s death. Those transcripts are, for the most part, official QPS records \nof interview and the applicants put them into evidence. No party made any submission that they were inaccurate. \nHowever, audio of many of the interviews was also in evidence and, at certain points, the audio shows that a \nwitness or investigating officer said something different to what is in the transcript. At various points below, I note \ninstances in which a transcript is materially inaccurate and set out my finding on what the audio shows was actually \nsaid.\n\nThe purpose of the investigation  It is as well to begin with the competing contentions about the statutory purpose of \nthe police investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death. While not the subject of detailed submissions by the parties, in my \nopinion a correct understanding of the statutory purpose of the investigation should inform the approach to be taken \nto this group of allegations made by the applicants. The respondents submit that the investigation was \u201cfor the \npurpose of a mandatory inquest\u201d and \u201ca fact finding process to place facts before a coroner\u201d for the purposes of the \ncoronial inquest required by s 27 of the Coroners Act. The applicants made no specific submission about the \npurpose of the investigation, although their allegations about the failure of QPS officers to treat SS Hurley as a \nsuspect suggests they assumed at least one purpose was to determine whether any criminal offences had been \ncommitted.  I accept that the primary purpose of the police investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death was to provide \nevidence for the coronial inquest. It was at that inquest that a coroner would determine how Mulrunji died and what \ncaused his death. Nevertheless, in the context of general policing functions (whether at common law or under the \nPSA Act) the investigation should also have been for the purpose of determining whether any crimes had been \ncommitted.  DSS Kitching\u2019s evidence in his witness statement made in January 2005 described his function as \nbeing \u201cthe primary investigator to investigate the death\u201d. It is correct that significant parts of DSS Kitching\u2019s \nevidence in that witness statement deal with arrangements he made for an autopsy of Mulrunji\u2019s body and for \nliaison with the pathologist, the submission of the Form 1 to the Coroner, and further liaison with the Coroner\u2019s \noffice. However, the part of his evidence dealing with his investigations on Palm Island once he arrived there are \nexpressed in the way one would expect any competent police officer to express the steps he took to investigate a \ndeath, and in particular a death in custody. It would seem obvious that those investigations should also be directed \nto ascertaining whether there was any basis reasonably to suspect that the death might be the result of a criminal \noffence, or whether any other criminal offence had been committed: for example, assault.  Under s 7(3) of the \nCoroners Act, QPS officers had a duty to report deaths in custody to the State Coroner or Deputy State Coroner. In \nthis case, as I have set out at [241] above, DI Webber notified DI Aspinall of Mulrunji\u2019s death at 12.20 pm on 19 \nNovember 2004 and the State Coroner was notified immediately thereafter. Under s 447A of the PPR Act in force at \nthe time of Mulrunji\u2019s death, QPS officers had a duty to assist coroners in the performance of their duties under the \nCoroners Act, including in the investigation of deaths and the conduct of inquests, and a duty to comply with every \nreasonable and lawful request or direction of a coroner. Part 4A of the PPR Act set out the powers available to the \n\n\n\nQPS when assisting a coroner. Section 15(2) of the Coroners Act also confirmed the duty of a police officer to help \na coroner, referring to s 447A of the PPR Act as the source of that duty.  In addition to those duties, the ordinary \nfunctions, duties and responsibilities of the QPS under provisions such as those in Ch 7 of the PPR Act and in s 2.3 \nof the PSA Act (see [76] above) were preserved. At the relevant time, s 5(2) of the Coroners Act provided:5 \nRelationship with other Acts\n\n ...\n\n (2) This Act does not limit or otherwise affect the functions or powers of \u2013(a) a police officer or other person to \ninvestigate a death under another Act; or\n\n (b) a police officer to do something other than an investigation under this Act.Example \u2013\n\n A police officer helping a coroner to investigate a death may at the same time investigate whether the death was a \nhomicide.  In R v Cowan [2015] QCA 87, Margaret McMurdo P at [64] summarises the effect of various provisions \nof the Coroners Act and describes the effect of s 5(2) as being that the Act \u201cdoes not limit or otherwise affect the \nfunctions or powers of a police officer investigating a death\u201d. This approach is supported by s 29 of the Coroners \nAct, which provided that an inquest must not start (or be continued, if it has already commenced) if the coroner \ninvestigating the death is informed that someone has been charged with an offence in which the question of \nwhether the accused caused the death may be in issue. Neither the Explanatory Memorandum nor the second \nreading speech for the Coroners Bill 2002 (Qld) provide any further clarification or insight into the operation or effect \nof s 5.  The legislative scheme of the Coroners Act does not suggest or require any change to this position once the \nCMC assumed responsibility for the investigation on 24 November 2004. Although s 5 of the Crime and Misconduct \nAct 2001 (Qld) (which has been renamed the Crime and Corruption Act 2001 (Qld)) made clear that the CMC was \ngiven additional investigative powers \u201cnot ordinarily available to the police service\u201d, its investigative functions are \ncomprehended by the terms of s 5(2) of the Coroners Act. Any charges laid as a result of CMC investigations would \nalso trigger the terms of the inquest stay provisions in s 29 of the Coroners Act.  It seems to me inevitable from the \nterms of the legislation to which I have referred that a purpose of the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death was to \nascertain whether any criminal offence had been committed in relation to his death. I do not accept the narrower \nproposition put by the respondents that the investigation was limited to a fact-finding role to assist the coroner. Such \nan approach would have involved QPS officers ignoring their statutory duties. I consider that DI Webber, DSS \nKitching and the other investigating officers well understood part of their function in the investigation was to \nascertain whether any criminal offences had been committed. They neglected that function in relation to SS Hurley. \nI set out my findings on the consequences of that neglect at [833]-[890] below.\n\nThe duty of QPS officers to act impartially  I have addressed the general obligation of police officers to exercise \ntheir powers impartially at [77]-[83] above. Although they cavilled with the label \u201cimpartiality duty\u201d in the applicants\u2019 \npleadings, the respondents accepted that QPS officers comprising the investigation team on Palm Island (at any \ngiven time) were subject to the following obligations, being:(a) to expeditiously conduct an impartial investigation;\n\n (b) to perform their duties in such a manner that public confidence and trust in the integrity and impartiality of the \nQPS is preserved; and\n\n (c) to perform their duties impartially and in the best interests of the community of Queensland without fear or \nfavour.  As I understood the parties\u2019 position, these obligations arise from a combination of the provisions in the \nPSA Act and the OPM. By the time of final submissions, the applicants did not press for the officers\u2019 obligations to \nbe any differently described. In other words, what the applicants described in their third further amended statement \nof claim as the \u201cimpartiality duty\u201d was accepted by the applicants as comprehended by these three agreed \nobligations.  The applicants continued to rely on what was described in their pleadings (at [115]) as the \u201cintegrity \nduty\u201d and the \u201creasonable diligence duty\u201d. These were said to be:     to preserve the integrity of the investigation and \n\n\n\nevidence obtained, collected or produced in the course of the investigation (Integrity Duty); and, or alternatively   to \nconduct the investigation with reasonable diligence, and take all steps and make all decisions that would \nreasonably be expected of QPS officers in their position (Reasonable Diligence Duty).      Where these obligations \nwere relied on by the applicants, I refer to them below. It is fair to say they featured to a lesser extent than the \napplicants\u2019 submissions about impartiality, which underpinned their contentions about the first category of QPS \nconduct.  There is no real debate about the importance of impartiality, and especially so in the public function of the \ninvestigation of a death in custody (for all of the purposes to which I have referred above). At [15] of his findings in \nthe third inquest into Mulrunji\u2019s death, Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine said:Mr. Elliot Johnson QC observed in the \nNational Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody [RCADIC]:-\n\nA death in custody is a public matter. Police and prison officers perform their services on behalf of the community. \nThey must be accountable for the proper performance of the duties. Justice requires that both the individual interest \nof the deceased\u2019s family and the general interest of the community be served by the conduct of thorough, \ncompetent and impartial investigations into all deaths in custody.\n\n(Footnote omitted.)    I respectfully agree with those observations.\n\nInvestigating officers and SS Hurley  The material facts about SS Hurley\u2019s role on Palm Island after the discovery \nof Mulrunji\u2019s body are not in dispute. He remained on duty until the end of Saturday, 20 November 2004. He then \nhad a rostered day off on Sunday, 21 November 2004, but remained on the island. He resumed duty on the \nmorning of Monday, 22 November 2004, and it was later this morning he had a tense exchange of words with Mr \nWotton in Police Lane: see [294] above. As I have noted in that paragraph, in my opinion it is unsatisfactory that \nthe respondents led no evidence to explain when or how SS Hurley left Palm Island, nor who made the decision \nthat he should leave. The absence of any rational explanation in the evidence about these matters lends support to \nthe conclusion that, throughout the time from Mulrunji\u2019s death to the departure of SS Hurley from Palm Island, \nscant and insufficient regard was paid to what was appropriate in terms of SS Hurley\u2019s continued presence on the \nisland, his continued interactions with local and investigating police officers, and his continued performance of \npolice duties generally on the island.  SS Hurley was the officer who met DI Webber, DS Robinson, DSS Kitching \nand some scientific police officers at Palm Island airport in the afternoon of 19 November 2004, to transport them \ninto the police station. Sergeant Leafe also met the officers, in another vehicle, and transported some of them. DI \nWebber and DSS Kitching went with SS Hurley. DI Webber\u2019s evidence suggested that alternative transport options \nwere not considered. The matter was simply overlooked. In my opinion, the thrust of DI Webber\u2019s oral evidence was \nthat he was concerned first to get to Palm Island, second to get to the police station, third to start familiarising \nhimself with what had happened, and fourth to get the investigation underway. Correctly, he was concentrating on \nthose objectives, especially the latter two. He was not focussing at all on how he and the other officers got to the \npolice station. It may well be, as the applicants submitted, that officers such as Constable Steadman and \nConstable Tonges, who were present at the police station on Palm Island but not on duty until later in the day, \ncould have been ordered to replace SS Hurley and provide the transport. It is clear on the evidence that option \nsimply did not occur to DI Webber, nor to any other officer. As I find in relation to other allegations made by the \napplicants, DI Webber did not pay any attention to the perceptions of the local community: they were not important \nto him. Nor was he concerned to observe the kind of separation, objectivity in behaviour and impartiality in fact that \nhe would no doubt otherwise have considered appropriate to observe: this was an Aboriginal community and, from \nthe outset, in my opinion DI Webber was disposed to act in a way which was protective and uncritical of his fellow, \nnon-Aboriginal police officers stationed on the island.  Unsurprisingly, the evidence revealed there were some \ndiscussions during the drive back to the police station. Neither DI Webber nor Inspector Kitching had much of a \nrecollection about what was said and, given the events took place 11 years ago, that is understandable. DI \nWebber\u2019s evidence was that the men discussed whether the Tactical Crime Squad officers should take over \npolicing duties on Palm Island, as well as the possibility of \u201cunrest or ill [will]\u201d in the community once the news of \nMulrunji\u2019s death became more widely known. In his evidence, Inspector Kitching said the discussion was \u201cminor\u201d \nand \u201c[n]ot about the death, but about what was going to transpire\u201d. What he meant by this was unclear, and he was \nnot pressed to explain it further.  I am not prepared to find that SS Hurley refrained from discussing Mulrunji\u2019s death, \nor his part in it, with DI Webber and DSS Kitching during the drive from the airport to the police station. However, \nthere is insufficient evidence to make any positive findings about what was discussed. The inability to make any \n\n\n\nfindings about what was discussed does not affect my conclusions about the inappropriateness of SS Hurley \npicking up investigating officers in the way he did.  It is difficult to say whether, by this time, DI Webber or DSS \nKitching knew SS Hurley was one of the last people to interact with Mulrunji before he was placed in the cell. \nInspector Strohfeldt certainly knew what had happened and the extent of SS Hurley\u2019s involvement. This was his \nstatement in February 2006:I was the Duty officer from Monday 15 November 2004 to Saturday 20 November 2004. \nThe role of the Duty Officer is a Commissioned Officer and is responsible for the coordination of all major incidents \noccurring within the Townsville District. At about 1130hrs on Friday 19 November 2004 I received a telephone call \nfrom Senior Sergeant Hurley from Palm Island Police Station. He informed me that Cameron Francis \nDOOMADGEE had died in the watchhouse at Palm Island. He informed me that the Ambulance had attended and \nfound life to be extinct.\n\n Senior Sergeant Hurley informed me that the Cameron Francis DOOMADGEE and Patrick Nugent were arrested in \nthe Palm Island Community, for creating public nuisance and drunk respectively, by Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley \nwho was assisted by PLO Lloyd Bengaroo, at 1026hrs. On arrival at the Watchhouse the deceased was \nuncooperative and violent - he punched S/Sgt. Hurley in the jaw as they were being removed from the police \nvehicle. They were placed in the cells and checked a couple of times before and at about 1120 hrs, the deceased \nwas noticed to be pale and possibly have a weak pulse. QAS advised and responded whereupon he was found to \nbe life extinct. Palm Island police presently making arrangement for notification of the next of kin.  In evidence in \nchief, DI Webber gave this description of what Inspector Strohfeldt then told him in a conversation that occurred \nbetween approximately 11.40 am and 12 noon:In broad terms, he told me that an Aboriginal prisoner had died in \ncustody at the Palm Island Police Station.  In cross-examination, DI Webber said the following in response to \nquestions from senior counsel for the applicants:So turning to Friday, 19 November, we\u2019ve discussed that you were \nfirst advised by District Inspector Strohfeldt that there had been the death in custody on Palm?---Yes.\n\n And were you told the first time that it was an aboriginal person?---I can\u2019t say for certain but I believe so.\n\n And that it was an aboriginal man?---Yes, I think so.\n\n So that you knew that it was an aboriginal death in custody from the outset?---Yes.\n\n And that produced certain requirements in and of itself?---Yes.\n\n That is, that it was an aboriginal death in custody?---Yes.  However, DI Webber was not asked, and did not say, \nwhether Inspector Strohfeldt told him about SS Hurley\u2019s interactions with Mulrunji prior to the death. Inspector \nKitching\u2019s evidence was that he had \u201cno understanding at all of what had occurred\u201d when he arrived on Palm \nIsland. In my opinion, there is insufficient evidence to make a positive finding about whether DI Webber or (then) \nDSS Kitching had any knowledge of SS Hurley\u2019s involvement when they arrived on Palm Island. It may be that \nInspector Strohfeldt told DI Webber that SS Hurley had arrested Mulrunji and struggled with him shortly before his \ndeath, or it may be that he did not. What is clear, however, is that SS Hurley knew, and his conduct as a QPS \nofficer is just as relevant as that of DI Webber and DSS Kitching to the question whether there was an act involving \na distinction based on race for which the first respondent is vicariously liable.  As the respondents note in their \nsubmissions, in their oral evidence both DI Webber and Inspector Kitching accepted that travelling with SS Hurley \nfrom the airport to the police station created a perception of bias and a lack of impartiality. Each said this was not \nsomething which occurred to them at the time. I accept that evidence, although I do so having made the findings I \nset out at [890] below.  In my opinion, having SS Hurley as the driver of the police vehicle carrying the investigation \nteam is a good and representative example of some of the attitudinal problems shown by QPS officers who came to \nPalm Island to investigate Mulrunji\u2019s death. This attitude was evident in the oral evidence each of DI Webber and \nInspector Kitching gave in this proceeding. It was also evident in the statements they gave at earlier times, although \nin those statements it was evident more by what was not said than what was said.  In cross-examination in this \nproceeding, DI Webber said the following:And were you aware before you hopped on the plane that it was a very \n\n\n\nsubstantial aboriginal and Torres Strait islander community?---It depends on your \u2013 it depends on, I supposes, what \nyou call substantial.\n\n Well, over 95 per cent?---In numbers terms?\n\n Yes?---I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I was aware that it was an aboriginal community, yes.\n\n And is that all you knew about Palm Island on 19 November 2004?---I mean I was aware of its general locality and \npolicing activities that occurred there.\n\n Are you aware of its history?---In a raw sense.\n\n How it was created?---Yes.  Similarly, Inspector Kitching said:Now, when you arrived in Palm Island on 19 \nNovember \u2013 just leave those there, we will be returning to them \u2013 did you know much about the history of Palm \nIsland?---No.\n\n Were you aware that it comprised of a community that had very substantially been forcibly removed there?---In \nvery basic terms \u2013 very general terms.\n\n And or were descendants of people who had previously forcibly been removed there?---Yes.\n\n And that all the persons who had been forcibly removed there by the government were Aboriginal?---I wasn\u2019t aware \nof the full circumstances, no.\n\n Or Torres Strait Islanders?---Yes.\n\n So I would suggest to you that when you\u2019re on Palm Island, you never considered that this history, in that short \nform, had engendered a deep distrust of authorities by Palm Islanders?---I never considered that, no.\n\n And especially the police, because the police have, over the history of Palm Island, been the enforcers of the \nvarious regulations?---Correct.\n\n And that was not something that you turned your mind to?---No.  I find that DI Webber and Inspector Kitching had \nlittle awareness of the nature of the community they were entering and little knowledge of its history. They did not \nmuch care about either of those things. The oppressive role played by police officers on Palm Island in the past \u2013 \na clear precursor to high levels of suspicion and mistrust, as the QPS remote policing review indicated \u2013 was not a \nmatter they brought to account in the performance of their duties. They were not interested in how they were \nperceived by the Palm Island community. They were not thinking, at all, about any apprehensions of lack of \nimpartiality which might arise from some of the conduct now impugned by the applicants. I detected no sense that \nany of the investigating officers saw themselves as performing their investigative tasks, even in part, for the Palm \nIsland community itself. That community was simply the location, nothing more.  In contrast, all the officers were \nintently focussed on the wellbeing of the other police officers, and on how what had happened affected those \nofficers. They were, in large part, looking after their own. I return to this matter at several points in these reasons.  \nOf itself, the transportation by SS Hurley of these officers from the airport to the police station on Palm Island, \nwhile unwise, was not an act which in my opinion involved any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference for the \npurposes of s 9 of the RDA. If such transportation breached any provisions of the OPM this non-compliance did not \nrender the transportation an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference for the purposes of s 9. \n\n\n\nThere was no differential treatment arising from the non-compliance.  However, when considered together with the \nother conduct I refer to below, the transportation of investigating officers by SS Hurley was the first act in a pattern. \nIt was a pattern of disregard for any objective need for impartiality, and a lack of interest by QPS officers in creating \nany sense or appearance of impartiality.  The other interactions between SS Hurley and the investigating officers \nupon which the applicants rely are: the dinner at SS Hurley\u2019s house on the evening of 19 November 2004; the \nfailure to treat SS Hurley as a suspect; and SS Hurley continuing to perform duties at the Palm Island Police \nStation and around the island itself.  The respondents do not dispute the material facts about the dinner at SS \nHurley\u2019s house and I have set those out at [260] above. It is clear that by the time of the dinner, all the officers \npresent knew the nature of SS Hurley\u2019s involvement in the events leading up to Mulrunji being placed in the cell. \nThey knew he was the arresting officer, he had wrestled Mulrunji into and out of the police van, he had wrestled \nMulrunji into the police station, he was involved in a struggle with Mulrunji, and he had dragged Mulrunji into the \ncell. By the time the dinner occurred DSS Kitching and DS Robinson had interviewed SS Hurley, PLO Bengaroo \nand Sergeant Leafe, all of whom had given accounts of this conduct. Before going to dinner, DSS Kitching had \nprepared, and DI Webber had reviewed, a draft of the Form 1, which included an account of SS Hurley struggling \nand falling with Mulrunji immediately prior to dragging him into the cell with Sergeant Leafe (see [290] above).  The \nrespondents, and their relevant witnesses, accepted that this event did compromise the appearance of impartiality \nof the investigation. DI Webber and Inspector Kitching accepted, with hindsight, they should not have gone to SS \nHurley\u2019s house for dinner. To give one example, this was DI Webber\u2019s evidence on the issue:in my view, there was \nprobably \u2013 and it\u2019s a perception, but I accept that the perception is there. And I\u2019m sorry that it occurred, but I accept \nthat the reality in relation to consuming a beer and having a meal at [SS Hurley\u2019s] residence on the Friday evening \nwas \u2013 was inappropriate and in that \u2013 in that sense, I acknowledge that. But I don\u2019t believe that it went beyond that.  \nI note the respondents also rely in their written submissions on a passage from the findings of DC Rynders, and \nappear to invite me to give the event the same characterisation given to it by DC Rynders. This is but one example \nof the inappropriate approach taken by both parties, to which I have referred at [118]-[119] above, to rely on findings \nmade by other persons and bodies where those inquiries were undertaken for different statutory and non-statutory \npurposes, and on the basis of different material and evidence. The respondents\u2019 use of DC Rynders\u2019 findings here \nis a pertinent example because DC Rynders refers to evidence given by DSS Kitching to her, which he did not give \nin this proceeding. I decline to make any use of DC Rynders\u2019 report in the way the respondents suggested. The fact \nof her ultimate conclusions may be relevant to relief. The fact of her inquiry is relevant in terms of context and \nbackground. Beyond that, her factual findings cannot be adopted in this proceeding. I take the same approach with \nthe CMC report, and the findings of the coronial inquests.  The respondents submit that the decision to eat a meal \nat SS Hurley\u2019s residence was a decision \u201cmade by tired and hungry officers who made what they now accept was \nan error of judgment\u201d. I accept that may be part of the explanation. However, consistently with similar findings made \nelsewhere in these reasons, in my opinion none of the police officers who were on Palm Island for this \ninvestigation (nor those already stationed there) were in the slightest bit concerned about the perceptions and \ncircumstances of the local community. Those matters were irrelevant to them. Mulrunji\u2019s death had to be \ninvestigated, and the officers would perform that task. But the effect of the death on the community, apprehensions \nof culpability in the police, awareness of the need to appear and be impartial \u2013 these were not matters that, on the \nevidence before me, the officers turned their minds to at all. The dinner at SS Hurley\u2019s house is emblematic of this \nattitude.  The conduct next relied on by the applicants is the failure to treat SS Hurley as a suspect. As I have \nnoted above, the statutory functions of the police during this investigation were not limited to assisting the coroner \nand extended to investigating whether a criminal offence had been committed in relation to the death of Mulrunji, \nincluding whether SS Hurley should be treated as a suspect.  The applicants correctly submit, and the respondents \naccept, that the OPM procedure (at s 16.24.3(ii)) was that the commissioned officer in charge of the investigation \n(at this time, DI Webber) should \u201cnot presume suicide or natural death regardless of whether it may appear likely\u201d. I \ndo not accept the respondents\u2019 submission that the terms of the order in s 8.4.2 of the OPM (that part dealing with \nwhat is required by officers who are first responders on the scene of a death) overrides or displaces what is \nrequired by s 16 of the OPM. The latter is specifically about deaths in custody, and is comprehensive in what it \nrequires of officers in those circumstances. The former concerns every kind of death to which police officers may \nhave to respond and s 8.4.2 is expressly about first responders. None of that applied to DI Webber or his \ninvestigative team. If anyone was a \u201cfirst responder\u201d, it was Sergeant Leafe, Constable Steadman and SS Hurley, \nwho were the first officers to examine Mulrunji and conclude he was dead.  The respondents contend that there \nwere no grounds to treat SS Hurley as a suspect during the period of the investigation until the CMC took over the \n\n\n\ninvestigation on 24 November 2004, especially since the cause of Mulrunji\u2019s death was not known until after the \nautopsy on 23 November 2004. Without the cause of death there was, they submit, no basis for any reasonable \nsuspicion that SS Hurley had been involved in the commission of a criminal offence. They refer to the description of \nreasonable suspicion given by the High Court in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at 115-16 (the \nCourt):Suspicion, as Lord Devlin said in Hussien v. Chong Fook Kam, \u201cin its ordinary meaning is a state of \nconjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: \u2018I suspect but I cannot prove.\u2019\u201d The facts which can reasonably \nground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion \nmust be shown. In Queensland Bacon Pty. Ltd. v. Rees, a question was raised as to whether a payee had reason \nto suspect that the payer, a debtor, \u201cwas unable to pay (its) debts as they became due\u201d as that phrase was used in \ns. 95(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth). Kitto J. said:\u201cA suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle \nwondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, amounting to \u2018a slight \nopinion, but without sufficient evidence\u2019, as Chambers\u2019s Dictionary expresses it. Consequently, a reason to suspect \nthat a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. The notion which \n\u2018reason to suspect\u2019 expresses in sub-s. (4) is, I think, of something which in all the circumstances would create in \nthe mind of a reasonable person in the position of the payee an actual apprehension or fear that the situation of the \npayer is in actual fact that which the sub-section describes \u2013 a mistrust of the payer\u2019s ability to pay his debts as they \nbecome due and of the effect which acceptance of the payment would have as between the payee and the other \ncreditors.\u201dThe objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly \nto the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the \nbalance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more \nslender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a \nproposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the \ncircumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    In their reply submissions, the applicants contend the respondents failed to engage with the \nevidence relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the basis on which the investigating officers should have, from \nthe start of the investigation, had a reasonable suspicion that SS Hurley may have committed a criminal offence. \nThe applicants are correct in that submission: the respondents did fail to engage with the evidence. This was, in my \nopinion, a feature of the respondents\u2019 final submissions, and made their final submissions of less assistance to the \nCourt than they otherwise might have been.  The applicants rely significantly on what they submit was a failure to \ntake the allegations of Roy Bramwell seriously. I deal with this at [959]-[987] below, where I find that the \ninvestigating officers discounted Roy Bramwell\u2019s account of what he saw and they did so because he was a local \nAboriginal person. On any view of Mr Bramwell\u2019s account \u2013 which the investigating officers had by mid-morning on \n20 November 2004 \u2013 there was a basis for, to use the language of Kitto J in Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees \n[1966] HCA 21; 115 CLR 266 at 303, \u201c an actual apprehension\u201d that SS Hurley may have committed a criminal \noffence. As the applicants point out, that suspicion should not, in the circumstances, have been limited to homicide, \nbut should have included assault and, I find, also manslaughter, with which SS Hurley was in fact eventually \ncharged.  However, in my opinion there were other independent and more immediate reasons that, on any objective \nview, SS Hurley should have been treated as a suspect from the outset of this investigation.  The first reason is \nwhat SS Hurley said in his record of interview with DI Webber and DSS Kitching. That interview began at 4.04 pm \non 19 November 2004. After describing why and how he and PLO Bengaroo went to Dee Street, and describing the \narrest of Patrick Bramwell, SS Hurley continued (with \u201cH\u201d standing for SS Hurley and \u201cK\u201d standing for DSS \nKitching):     Whilst we were making that arrest [of Patrick Bramwell] \u2013 whilst we were executing the arrest and \nplacing him in the rear of the police vehicle \u2013 Cameron DOOMADGEE approached us and \u2013 he had words with \nLLOYD and the words were similar to the effect of \u2013 hey BENGAROO you shouldn\u2019t be doing this you\u2019re a black \nfella yourself you shouldn\u2019t be locking up black people \u2013 LLOYD ahh \u2013 told Mr DOOMADGEE to move on \u2013 \notherwise he\u2019d find himself under arrest. We continued with the arrest of ahh \u2013 BRAMWELL. Ahh \u2013 DOOMADGEE \nthen walked down Dee Street toward ahh \u2013 Klump Point Road. The ahh \u2013 Dee Street\u2019s a ahh \u2013 horseshoe umm \u2013 \ntype street. He was on the southern side of Dee Street   Hhmm   He aah \u2013 then mouthed off at us again. Ahh \u2013 \ncalling out abuse. He then continued to walk down stopped again \u2013 turned again and mouthed off for a second \ntime. By that stage I was just entering the police vehicle. I asked LLOYD who the male was that had mouthed off \nbecause I ahh \u2013 didn\u2019t know him and he said it was Cameron DOOMADGEE and ahh \u2013 I advised LLOYD that umm \n\u2013 DOOMADGEE would be going in as well for his behaviour. There was ahh \u2013 people umm \u2013 you know there was \n\n\n\npeople\u2019s houses where he was umm \u2013 so I drove down to him \u2013 I asked him ahh \u2013 ahh \u2013 what his problem with the \npolice was and ahh \u2013 I can\u2019t remember whether he replied or what the situation was but I told him he was under \narrest and that ahh \u2013 he was going to the watchhouse. Now, he struggled a little bit \u2013 he didn\u2019t just step in the back \nof the van. I grabbed him by his arm \u2013 by the top part of his arm near his bicep and ahh \u2013 then umm \u2013 moved in \ntowards the ahh \u2013 car \u2013 Lloyd opened the rear cage door of the police vehicle and then umm \u2013 I put him down on \nhis backside in the ahh \u2013 cage and then umm \u2013 he ahh \u2013 ahh \u2013 resisted you might say to not going in the cage \u2013 so \nthen I lifted his legs up and put them on the seat opposite him and ahh \u2013 closed the cage door.      SS Hurley then \ndescribed the trip back to the police station and recounted what happened when he pulled up in the car park \nbehind the police station in Police Lane.     ... Now from there what happened was I opened the rear door of the \npolice vehicle to get the two people in custody out. As I did this, Cameron DOOMADGEE struck me with a closed \nfist \u2013 that was on the back side of his fist \u2013 he came across my face. I then took hold of him by grabbing him on the \nshirt \u2013 up close to where they ahh the V of the shirt \u2013 a struggle ensued. What I was trying to do at the time was get \na hold of \u2013 get a hold of one of his arms \u2013 but it was a confined area between the \u2013 police vehicle and the side wall \nof that police station \u2013 from there we ahh \u2013 the struggle moved into the station where we were on the ground \u2013 \nbecause the step up   So you tripped over a step is that right   Over the step as we came in \u2013 there\u2019s a step there   \nHow did you manage to fall on the ground   I fell to the left of him and he was to the right of me   What caused you \nto fall   Just coming into the station I was trying to grab him and he was trying to get away   Oh OK      It can be \nseen that SS Hurley\u2019s account is that he fell one way and Mulrunji fell another: that is, SS Hurley does not say that \nhe fell on top of Mulrunji. He confirms this later in the interview, saying he fell beside him. SS Hurley then describes \nputting Mulrunji, and then Patrick Bramwell, into the watchhouse cells. He subsequently describes checking on \nthem in the following way:     ... I did the first check \u2013 I actually did a physical check \u2013 where I opened up the cell \nand walked in \u2013 and the reason I did that was umm \u2013 because there were two prisoners there ahh \u2013 with one \nnormally you can crouch down beside the cell and hear them breathing whatever \u2013 with the two I actually walked in \nthey were laying down there \u2013 both asleep and both were snoring.      This account is inconsistent with the cell \nvideo, which the evidence shows DI Webber and DSS Kitching watched before DSS Kitching interviewed SS \nHurley, although as I have said at [285] above it is unclear whether they watched all of it. Inspector Kitching\u2019s \nevidence about this was:I don\u2019t recall whether I watched it up to the point where inspections were conducted of the \ndeceased or not. But I certainly did watch that video before I interviewed Hurley.  SS Hurley stated in the interview \nthat he saw Mulrunji had a \u201csmall amount of blood\u201d coming from a \u201cvery small injury\u201d above his right eye. He said \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know\u201d when asked how Mulrunji got that injury. The video of Mulrunji after he died is in evidence. It clearly \nshows considerable swelling of his eye and of the right side of his face. Any police officer objectively comparing \nwhat he saw on Mulrunji\u2019s face with SS Hurley\u2019s account would, I find, have had cause to suspect SS Hurley may \nhave been minimising Mulrunji\u2019s injuries.  SS Hurley was then asked again about the struggle with Mulrunji:K OK \nand you said you had a struggle between the police vehicle and the wall of the police station\n\n H Yes\n\n K Ok umm \u2013 who assisted you to get him from the police vehicle to the police station\n\n H Nobody \u2013 I was the only one that was umm \u2013 wrestling with him\n\n K And you said as a result of the struggle you fell into the police station because of a step is that right\n\n H Yeah \u2013 I can only presume we fell over the step because when we were at the station I can remember that we \nwere on the ground\n\n K OK \u2013 and who was assisting you then\n\n H Nobody \u2013 I stood up (ui) Michael LEAFE came and ahh \u2013 assisted me to drag him into the cell  For SS Hurley to \nsay that he \u201cpresumed\u201d he and Mulrunji fell over the step is inconsistent with the answer he gave earlier, including \n\n\n\nin answer to DSS Kitching\u2019s leading and suggestive question.  SS Hurley was asked about Mulrunji\u2019s demeanour \nwhen he first encountered him in Dee Street. SS Hurley described Mulrunji as aggressive and affected by liquor. He \nwas asked what Mulrunji\u2019s demeanour was when SS Hurley and Sergeant Leafe got Mulrunji into the cell. SS \nHurley replied:     He just lay on the ground \u2013 he was umm \u2013 ready to go off to sleep I think but ahh \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t \nget up when we asked him to get up to go into his, to go into the watchhouse that\u2019s why we had to drag him in   OK \n\u2013 umm was he speaking to you at that stage when he pulled you into the cell.   No not that I can recall.      DSS \nKitching then asked SS Hurley if Mulrunji complained of any injuries, to which SS Hurley replied:H No\n\n K That he was aware of any injuries\n\n H I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t able to ask him the questions because of his aggression and because of the fact we \ntook him straight to the cell ...  Therefore, SS Hurley was telling DSS Kitching that Mulrunji was so aggressive as he \nwas being brought into the police station that he could not be asked if he had any injuries or medical conditions. \nInexplicably (on the information before the investigators), within seconds the man is uncommunicative and has to \nbe dragged into his cell, and less than an hour later he is dead.  Later that evening, at approximately 7.50 pm, DSS \nKitching interviewed Sergeant Leafe. In that record of interview, this was Sergeant Leafe\u2019s description of what \noccurred as SS Hurley was bringing Mulrunji into the police station:Now at that stage um I\u2019ve gone through the \nback of the police door to go into the watchhouse area to make sure the cell door was open so DOOMADGEE \ncould be placed straight in there because he was, was, well he appeared to be quite aggressive, he was struggling \nwith Senior Sergeant HURLEY. When I come out from inside the watchouse area um DOOMADGEE was on the \nground in the police corridor just inside the backdoor and longways to hall, longways running with the hallway that \ngoes up to the CIB office\n\n ...\n\n And he would\u2019ve only been just inside the door um we tried to lift up DOOMADGEE um from, from behind in the \nshoulder areas to carry him into the cell but he felt, he felt like a dead weight like he, he wouldn\u2019t try and help us um \nso at that stage we, we both grabbed an arm. I think I was on the left arm um Senior Sergeant HURLEY was on the \nright arm, I recall and um dragged him into the cell.  He then described finding Mulrunji:I opened up the door ah \nwalked in I saw DOOMADGEE was flat on his back, his head was slightly tilted to the right and his, his eyes were \npartially opened um I tried to ah arouse him um to wake him, gave him a shake um a slight pat on, on the other side \nof the face um when I felt his face it felt strangely cold um I can\u2019t remember if I checked the pulse at that stage or \nran into the Senior Sergeant HURLEY\u2019s office and told him um that DOOMADGEE didn\u2019t look well but I, I, I, at one \nstage I\u2019ve gone back in and checked a pulse ah I was unable to locate a pulse um at that time.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Sergeant Leafe placed the time at which Mulrunji was put in the cell as approximately 10.25 \nam and the time at which he (Sergeant Leafe) entered the cell as 11.15 am or 11.20 am. That is, Mulrunji was cold \nafter only 50 to 55 minutes in the cell.  Again, on this account the police investigators had descriptions of an \naggressive individual, struggling with SS Hurley as he was brought into the police station, with Sergeant Leafe not \nwitnessing what happened next between SS Hurley and Mulrunji but eventually seeing Mulrunji on the ground, \nbefore Sergeant Leafe dragged him as a \u201cdead weight\u201d into the cell. On Sergeant Leafe\u2019s account, 50 to 55 minutes \nlater Mulrunji was not only dead, but already cold.  In my opinion, any experienced, objective and impartial police \ninvestigator looking at that material would readily form an \u201cactual apprehension\u201d that the person who \u201cstruggled\u201d \nwith Mulrunji may have committed a criminal offence \u2013 at the very least, an assault. Further, in my opinion, any \nexperienced, objective and impartial police investigator would also have formed an \u201cactual apprehension\u201d that the \ntall, well-built man who had wrestled Mulrunji into the police station may have committed an offence more serious \nthan assault, given Mulrunji went from being aggressive to a dead weight in a matter of seconds, and then to being \ndeceased in less than an hour.  PLO Bengaroo\u2019s account was quite different to SS Hurley\u2019s. This is the first relevant \nportion of the record of interview (with \u201cLB\u201d standing for PLO Bengaroo and \u201cRK\u201d standing for DSS Kitching):LB um \n- so Chris (ui) Chris said he punched me in the face and Chris just lead him by the arm (ui) and walked him in \nthrough the front door \n\n\n\n RK Yeah, what happened then\n\n LB And through into the watchhouse ...\n\n RK And where are you when Chris took him through to the watchhouse\n\n LB I was at the front door (ui)\n\n RK You were just out at the front door \u2013 did anything happen near the front door?  The transcript of the interview \nstates that PLO Bengaroo\u2019s answer to this question was unintelligible, but in the audio he answers \u201cNup\u201d and then \nsays a few words that are unintelligible. After PLO Bengaroo gave that answer, DSS Kitching went on to another \nquestion:RK Right, um, how was Cameron when Chris was walking him through to the watchhouse\n\n LB He was aggressive (ui)\n\n RK What was he actually doing\n\n LB Oh he was probably (ui) flopping down or something, you know\n\n RK Flopping down..\n\n LB Yeah\n\n RK So he wouldn\u2019t ... \n\n LB No, he wouldn\u2019t hardly walk was you know just flopped himself down\n\n RK So he wouldn\u2019t walk to Chris and he just dropped himself down eh and what did Chris have to do now\n\n LB Umm Chris tried (ui) picked him up (ui) and you know just dragged him past um just picked him up and (ui)\n\n RK Okay \u2013 so where did um Sergeant Leafe go\n\n LB Ah, Sergeant Leafe ah ... he was with Chris to the cells \n\n RK With Chris to the cells and what was, what was he doing \n\n LB Helping Chris (ui) put him in the cell\n\n RK Helping Chris put him in the cell\n\n LB Yes\n\n RK OK, do you remember what he was actually doing to help Chris, how, how was he helping him\n\n\n\n LB By the arms\n\n RK By the arms\n\n LB Yes\n\n RK Okay \u2013 so what did they \u2013 was he walking or lying or ...\n\n LB No, he (ui) two legs on the floor \u2013 just grabbed him by the two arms \n\n RK Two legs on the floor and then pulled him by the two arms, is that\n\n LB Yes\n\n RK What happened then ...\n\n LB Hmm we just laid him, put him on the floor with ah, two fellas on the floor - it was Cameron and Patrick Yallop \u2013 \non the floor\n\n [I note that the audio of the interview shows that PLO Bengaroo said \u201cPatrick together\u201d, not \u201cPatrick Yallop\u201d in the \nlast line of the transcript extracted above.]  In my opinion, DSS Kitching asked several leading questions which \ndirected PLO Bengaroo\u2019s answers away from an account that would implicate SS Hurley: the \u201chelping him\u201d \nexchange is one example. DSS Kitching does not explore at all with PLO Bengaroo the account of the fall given by \nSS Hurley. He does not ask PLO Bengaroo about the injuries to Mulrunji\u2019s eye, or about any injuries. He does not \nexplore what PLO Bengaroo meant by \u201cflopping down\u201d. I find that the manner in which DSS Kitching interviewed \nPLO Bengaroo discloses a consciousness on the part of DSS Kitching of the risk that SS Hurley could be implicated \nand a method of interviewing which discounted information adverse to SS Hurley.  PLO Bengaroo\u2019s interview \ndiscloses a significant partiality on the part of DSS Kitching \u2013 a partiality towards accounts which would not \nimplicate SS Hurley. The manner in which DSS Kitching conducted this interview contributes to explaining why SS \nHurley was not treated as a suspect. There was clear partiality by the QPS investigating officers and an active \ndetermination not to accumulate information from witnesses such as PLO Bengaroo which would require him to be \ntreated in that way.  Although it is in a different category from some of the other conduct, in my opinion the failure to \ntreat SS Hurley as a suspect is another indicium of the lack of impartiality, apprehended, but also actual, that \nattended the investigation. The apparently conscious steering of questions, in the interviews to which I have \nreferred, away from blame on SS Hurley is further evidence that there was no open mind brought to this \ninvestigation about the possibility that SS Hurley could in any way be culpable for what had happened to Mulrunji.  If \none compares, for example, what happened, on the evidence of SS Hurley and PLO Bengaroo, in the arrest of \nMulrunji in Dee Street with the manner in which SS Hurley was treated by the investigating team, one can easily \nsee the different standards at work. Mulrunji had accused PLO Bengaroo of siding with white police officers rather \nthan his own people, by assisting in the arrest of Patrick Bramwell. This is how PLO Bengaroo described, in his \nrecord of interview with DSS Kitching, what happened:LB ... there was a struggle, person named Cameron \nDoomadgee walked towards me and said \u2018Ah you\u2019re a black man, like me, I said ah \u2013 what do you lock him [Patrick \nBramwell] up for\n\n RK So he said, Bengaroo you black like me\n\n LB Yeah\n\n RK What are you locking him up for\n\n\n\n LB Yes \u2013 And I told, myself I told ah Cameron to, just walk down the road otherwise he\u2019d get locked up\n\n RK So, you, you told Cameron to keep walking down the road or he'd get locked up\n\n LB Yes,\n\n RK Yeah \u2013 What happened then\n\n LB Um, Chris started the vehicle, ah Chris had (ui) gone a couple of metres down the road, Chris said Cameron \nwas calling out (ui)\n\n RK Uhm, do you know what Cameron was calling out\n\n LB I can\u2019t recall\n\n RK Okay, what happened then\n\n LB Ah, all of a sudden Chris said to me who was that (ui) \u2013 we pulled up and \u2013 next to Cameron and Chris said to \nme \u201cI\u2019m going to have him \u2013 lock him up\u201d \u2013 so both of us jumped out of the police vehicle and I went down to the \nrear end of the police vehicle to the cage part and I opened the door for Chris \u2013 and Chris grabbed Cameron and \nput him in the back of the vehicle  As the extract at [860] above shows, Mulrunji is said by SS Hurley to have \n\u201cmouthed off\u201d and to have been abusive to PLO Bengaroo. For that, he was arrested. The police log refers to the \nnominated offence as \u201cCreate Public Nuisance\u201d.  Whether there was or was not a valid basis for that arrest, my \npoint in referring to it here is to illustrate the double standards at work on the very same day on Palm Island. A \nyoung Aboriginal man who protests about what he saw as the partisanship of a PLO is arrested, roughly and with \nsome aggression, by SS Hurley.  But when, on all accounts, that same young Aboriginal man punches SS Hurley \nand a considerable struggle ensues at the door of the police station which has both men ending up on the ground \nand only Mulrunji being limp and unresponsive afterwards and then dead in less than an hour, no white police \nofficer considers there should be a reasonable suspicion about SS Hurley\u2019s conduct at all. Even allowing for the \nbenefit of hindsight, I can see on the evidence before me no justification or explanation for this, other than the fact \nSS Hurley was a white police officer and the victim was an Aboriginal resident of Palm Island. The assumption that \nSS Hurley was acting lawfully, while arresting Mulrunji for the most minor of matters, with force, was never \nquestioned by any investigating officer.  Finally, in this category of conduct, is the allegation that SS Hurley was \npermitted to continue to perform policing duties until he left the island on 22 November 2004. This allegation is \nconnected to the orders in the OPM to which I have referred at [158]-[165] above. It is developed in a slightly \ndifferent form in the applicants\u2019 \u201cintervening week claim\u201d as a failure to suspend SS Hurley. In this first category, the \nfocus is on the continued performance of duties by SS Hurley, and why this was permitted to occur.  The \nrespondents submit that SS Hurley did not continue to perform any duties in association with the investigation. The \napplicants rely on admissions by both Inspector Kitching and DI Webber in cross-examination that SS Hurley was \npresent and performing duties in the police station while DSS Kitching, DS Robinson, DI Webber and Inspector \nWilliams were conducting interviews and video re-enactments. They contend that, since the police station was \nobviously small (so much can be seen from the video re-enactments), there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that SS Hurley \nhad overheard at least some of the interviews and re-enactments being conducted in the station. They contend that \nhis presence in the station and the likelihood he overheard some of the interviews and re-enactments \n\u201ccompromised the integrity of the evidence gathered in the course of the investigation by permitting SS Hurley to \nhave an opportunity to be aware of what other interviewees had been saying and to adapt his version of events \naccordingly\u201d. Accordingly, the applicants submitted the investigating officers had not conducted the investigation \nwith reasonable diligence nor with integrity, as the applicants alleged was their duty.  Insofar as the applicants rely \non non-compliance with subpara (v) of the orders applicable to the regional duty officer in s 1.17 of the OPM for this \n\n\n\nallegation, the respondents are correct that there is no evidence SS Hurley undertook or continued to perform any \nduties associated with the investigative process, in terms of what he did at the police station. Of course, he had \ntransported investigating officers from the airport, shown them Dee Street, relating what occurred there on his \naccount, and participated in video re-enactments (all while on duty and in uniform, so far as the evidence \nestablishes), and he had hosted investigating officers for dinner at his home. In other words, he was certainly not \nquarantined away from the investigative process, or the investigating officers. That could only really have occurred \nif he had been stood down from duties when the investigation team arrived, or as soon as practicable thereafter \nonce statements from him and re-enactments with him had been obtained. However, I note that subpara 1.17(v) \nalso prohibited a member involved in the incident continuing to undertake \u201cother duties at the scene\u201d, and is not \nnecessarily limited to investigation. The applicants have established on the evidence non-compliance with s 1.17(v) \nby SS Hurley being allowed to continue to perform policing duties at the station, but the question is: what flows \nfrom this?  As the respondents also correctly submit, it is no more than speculative to suggest that SS Hurley may \nhave seen or heard things which caused him to alter his account of what occurred. Even if it were more than \nspeculation, I would have been reluctant to draw such an inference in circumstances where neither party elected to \ncall SS Hurley himself.  Thus, the way the applicants put this allegation is not one I accept.  In my opinion, however, \nthe fact that SS Hurley was permitted to continue to perform policing duties, and to do so in uniform around the \nisland, in the days after Mulrunji\u2019s death is another indicium of the lack of impartiality, actual and apprehended, that \nattached to the QPS investigation. Contrary to the respondents\u2019 submissions, the explanation for it does not lie in \nany error of judgment, or simple human mistake. It lies in disregard for the Palm Island community.  On the \nevidence before me, I am satisfied none of the QPS officers with command or investigative responsibilities cared \nwhat the Aboriginal people of Palm Island thought about their investigation. They did not care whether the \ninvestigation seemed impartial or not; they did not care if it was deeply offensive to that community that the white \npolice officer who arrested Mulrunji and who brought him into the police station and locked him up was still going \nabout his duties in uniform on the island as if nothing had happened. The commanding and investigating officers of \nthe QPS had no regard for any sense of (justifiable) outrage that might have been generated in some or all of the \nmembers of the Palm Island community from the way the investigation team interacted with, and treated, SS \nHurley. I am satisfied the QPS commanding and investigating officers on Palm Island at this time would not have \nhad that attitude if this tragedy occurred in a remote, close-knit, but overwhelmingly non-Aboriginal community: for \nexample, a pastoralist community in rural Queensland. But on Palm Island, QPS commanding and investigative \nofficers operated with a sense of impunity, impervious to the reactions and perceptions of Palm Islanders, and very \nmuch with an \u201cus and them\u201d attitude.\n\nThe role of DS Robinson  The applicants mount a wholesale challenge to the involvement of DS Robinson in the \ninvestigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death. They submit that DS Robinson had an actual or an apparent conflict of interest \nand his involvement in the investigation created a reasonable apprehension of bias. They allege he was not \nimpartial, and his appointment to the investigation team was not appropriate in the circumstances, as he was from \nthe same police establishment as SS Hurley.  There is also an allegation of the same kind, made more faintly, \nagainst DSS Kitching in relation to his own appointment which has no foundation and need not be considered \nfurther. DSS Kitching was appointed by DI Webber and was clearly qualified for the task. I have found, for reasons \nexpressed elsewhere, that DSS Kitching did not conduct his investigations in an impartial manner, but that is a \nseparate issue.  There is no dispute between the parties that DS Robinson was also stationed at Palm Island, \nhaving lived there and worked with SS Hurley on Palm Island for about two years in a context where there were \napproximately seven police officers stationed on the island at any one time. SS Hurley was DS Robinson\u2019s direct \nline supervisor for operational matters. SS Hurley was the most senior officer stationed on Palm Island, and DS \nRobinson was the next most senior. DSS Kitching and DI Webber were aware of those matters. Other officers with \nlocal knowledge (but who were no longer stationed on Palm Island) were brought in by the CMC the following \nweek (Inspector Trevor Adcock and Sergeant Anthony Melrose) and at least one other officer (Greg Baade, whose \nrank was not in evidence) was available. The applicants contend that other officers should have been deployed \ninstead of DS Robinson for any appearance of impartiality in the investigation to be maintained.  As the \nrespondents submit, DS Robinson\u2019s role changed through the course of the first few days after Mulrunji\u2019s death \nand, after Inspector Williams arrived on 20 November 2004, he did not participate in the interviews and video re-\nenactments, nor did he take statements. However, he then again assumed a critical role in the identification and \narrest of suspects after the protests and fires on 26 November 2004.  Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s evidence was that \n\n\n\n\u201ceverybody knows when a new detective coming to Palm, and everybody know who the person is and what their \nrole is in the community\u201d. It was apparent during the evidence that DS Robinson was known by most of the group \nmember witnesses.  There may well be advantages in having community members interviewed by an officer who is \nfamiliar to them. The applicants\u2019 evidence and submissions on how Aboriginal witnesses should be treated would \ntend to support such a proposition.  I did not detect in the applicants\u2019 witnesses any particular difficulties with the \nrole of DS Robinson. I did not, for example, detect that any witness was more concerned about the role he played \nthan the role played by DI Webber, DSS Kitching or Inspector Williams. In my opinion, what came through in the \nevidence of the applicants\u2019 witnesses was a general mistrust of the way the QPS would investigate the death of an \nAboriginal man in custody, and on Palm Island in particular. And what most troubled members of the community \nwas that SS Hurley was not being treated as a suspect, and was free to go about his duties. That is what comes \nacross strongly in the video evidence, and in the witness evidence.  I reject the applicants\u2019 contention that DS \nRobinson\u2019s involvement in the investigation, of itself, indicated a lack of impartiality, or the appearance of a lack of \nimpartiality. Unlike DSS Kitching, there was no particular evidence relied on by the applicants to establish DS \nRobinson was not impartial, or did not appear impartial.  Nevertheless, what the evidence reveals DS Robinson did \nnot do, and was not asked to do, supports my later findings about failures to communicate with the Palm Island \ncommunity: see [1052] below.  So far as is apparent from the evidence, the fact that DS Robinson was a locally \nbased police officer did not mean that he engaged with the local community in any more of an empathetic or \nappropriate way. There is no evidence he was proactive in trying to communicate effectively with the local Council. \nHe does not appear on any of the video evidence at the community meetings, although given he was known to the \ncommunity this would have been an appropriate role for him to perform. There is no evidence he played an active \nrole in how the next of kin should be notified, or in determining the best way to inform the community about the \nresults of the autopsy report. There is no evidence he used his local knowledge and familiarity in the intervening \nweek to reduce tensions and address the legitimate concerns of the local community that, despite the autopsy \nresults, Mulrunji\u2019s death was not being treated as suspicious and no officer (especially SS Hurley) was being held \naccountable for it. In that sense, the only use to which his \u201clocal knowledge\u201d seems to have been put was one that \nwas disadvantageous to members of the community, in that he assisted in identifying and arresting suspects.\n\n\u201cFailures in oversight\u201d by senior officers  This is a collection of allegations (set out at [244(f)] and [244(n)(ii), (v), (vi) \nand (vii)] of the third further amended statement of claim and summarised at [254(q)-(v)] of the applicants\u2019 closing \nsubmissions) which comprise: the appointment of DSS Kitching to the investigation team; the failures by each of DI \nWebber and Inspector Strohfeldt to instruct officers not to talk to each other about Mulrunji\u2019s death and the \nsurrounding events; the fact of officers talking to each other about Mulrunji\u2019s death and the surrounding events; the \nfailure by DSS Kitching to ascertain what had been discussed by witnesses; the failure of DI Webber to ensure \nConstable Steadman was interviewed as soon as practicable; the failure by Inspector Williams to overview, advise \non, and confer with DI Webber and the CMC to resolve issues regarding the integrity of the investigation.  The \nparties are agreed that s 1.17 of the OPM is again relevant to these allegations.  In their final submissions, the \nrespondents accept that that neither DI Webber nor Inspector Strohfeldt advised or directed SS Hurley not to \ndiscuss the circumstances surrounding the death in custody with other QPS officers. They also accept that before \nthe investigation team arrived on Palm Island SS Hurley, Sergeant Leafe and PLO Bengaroo discussed Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath, and that DSS Kitching took no steps to ascertain what had been discussed by those three officers. I am \nsatisfied that all these matters confirm the conclusion I have reached and expressed elsewhere that none of those \nin charge of the investigation, nor those officers participating in and subject to it, had any regard for whether the \ninvestigation appeared impartial. They were not at all concerned about what perceptions the Aboriginal community \non Palm Island had of the investigation.  As I have found elsewhere, the investigation was not impartial, but none of \nthe allegations in this category illustrate that lack of impartiality. That is because, as the respondents submit, the \napplicants\u2019 contention that there was collusion between those giving accounts (with or without the alleged \nassistance of DS Robinson) is not made out on the evidence and is simply speculation. None of the people who are \nthe subject of these allegations were called by the applicants and none of these allegations were put to them. There \nare many examples in the applicants\u2019 submissions where allegations are made against SS Hurley to the effect that \nhe colluded with others, and consciously altered his version of events to exculpate himself. For example, at [266] of \ntheir written submissions, the applicants contend that what they describe as these \u201ccompromises\u201d of the \ninvestigation provided:multiple opportunities to SS Hurley, the person most closely involved with the incident under \ninvestigation, to be aware of the progress of the investigation and to take measures to influence its [that is, the \n\n\n\ninvestigation\u2019s] findings.  The applicants did not come close to making out their allegations of collusion, and these \nallegations should not have been pressed in the absence of calling SS Hurley to give him an opportunity to respond \nto them.  Although the respondents made no express concession, it is apparent from the evidence that Inspector \nWilliams was not, at the time of the investigation or shortly thereafter when the CMC took over, concerned to review \nwhether the investigation had been and continued to be impartial. Rather, the investigation took its course, and \nthese allegations about lack of impartiality emerged in inquiries well after the events themselves. However, I do not \nconsider this circumstance adds anything to the conclusions I have reached about the lack of impartiality in the \ninvestigation.  It is agreed between the parties that Constable Steadman was not interviewed by the investigation \nteam before the CMC took over the investigation on 24 November 2004. He was interviewed in Townsville on 27 \nNovember 2004, principally about the week following Mulrunji\u2019s death and the day of the protests and fires. It was \nnot until 8 December 2004, several weeks after the events, that he was interviewed in detail by the CMC about the \nstruggle between SS Hurley and Mulrunji at the police station. The applicants contend s 2.5.1 of the OPM \ncontained a policy that \u201cprimary investigation techniques should be followed in order to ensure that potential \nwitnesses are identified and that complete information is obtained\u201d, as well as a procedure which required the \nidentification of witnesses and potential witnesses.  The omission to interview Constable Steadman on 19 or 20 \nNovember does seem inexplicable. Constable Steadman is plainly visible in the cell video. All those officers who \nwere present in the police station at the time of Mulrunji\u2019s death must have known Constable Steadman had been \none of the officers who entered the cell. DI Webber and Inspector Kitching both agreed that they had watched the \nvideo whilst on Palm Island on the Friday afternoon and DI Webber indicated that they again watched the video on \nthe Saturday morning, with Inspector Williams. It was also the case that Constable Steadman was present when SS \nHurley brought Mulrunji into the police station and witnessed SS Hurley getting Mulrunji out of the police van. DI \nWebber agreed that Constable Steadman was a witness to the fall recounted by SS Hurley in his interview.  Both DI \nWebber and Inspector Kitching agreed that Constable Steadman was an important witness yet neither offered any \nreal explanation for the omission to interview him. It was put to Inspector Kitching that the failure to interview \nConstable Steadman at the same time everyone else was interviewed deprived the investigators of critical \ninformation, in particular information which might have been seen as inconsistent with SS Hurley\u2019s account. Senior \ncounsel relied on what was recorded by Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine in the second inquest decision on this issue. \nIt is worthwhile extracting the relevant parts of Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine\u2019s decision, beginning at [311]:There is \nonly one contemporaneous written record of the relevant events concerning this incident, that of Constable \nSteadman\u2019s notebook, which first came to light during his cross-examination before the DSC inquest. These notes \nwere made about 4 pm on the day of the death, in his official notebook, in the knowledge that there had been a \ndeath in custody, and in the interests of keeping an accurate and complete record of events for evidentiary \npurposes.\n\n The notes, which are Exhibit D35.2, record: \u201cAttended Palm Island Station to make inquiries regarding movement \nof my furniture. Observed the marked cruiser in the parking bay. Could hear two persons saying something from the \ncage. S/Sgt Hurley opened the rear door and spoke with one of the persons in the rear of the van. I walked to the \nfront right hand side of the van. I heard a scuffle at the rear of the van. I then saw S/Sgt Hurley grapple with an \nAboriginal male. He was dragging him towards the station entrance. He appeared to slip as he walked in the door. \nChris was yelling something at the ATSI male. I could not see the top half of the ATSI male as they were obscured \nby the doorway. I then walked into the station and sat down at the computer.\u201d\n\n As it can be seen, these notes make no mention of any fall, let alone a heavy one. They record only \u201che\u201d (i.e. one \nperson) \u201cslipping\u201d. There is no mention of seeing Hurley\u2019s feet, let alone seeing them on top of Mulrunji\u2019s (as later \nrecalled in evidence in support of the proposition that Hurley fell on top of Mulrunji.\n\n The notes, per se, provide no support for Hurley\u2019s position now, that he must have fallen on top of Mulrunji to have \ninflicted the fatal injuries. They also record that Hurley was \u2018yelling\u2019 at Mulrunji; but that Steadman could not see him \nand that he could not see the top half of Mulrunji\u2019s body at this time.\n\n\n\n Steadman maintained his position about Hurley yelling at Mulrunji after the fall, when interviewed on 8 December \n2004, when giving evidence at the original inquest, when giving evidence at the trial, and finally, when giving \nevidence at the re-opened inquest. Before the DSC inquest:\u201cYou\u2019ve heard Senior Sergeant Hurley say something at \nthat time? \u2013 Yes.\n\nIt was something abusive? \u2013 I \u2013 it was loud, it was yelled.\n\nIt was something abusive? \u2013 Possibly, yes.\n\nIt was abusive or it wasn\u2019t Constable? \u2013 It was loud. I don\u2019t remember what he \u2013 I don\u2019t know what he said.\n\nNo. But you got a sense \u2013 a sense of what he said? \u2013 Yes.\n\nAnd it was at least to an extent abusive, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 Yes.\n\nYes. And it was in a raised voice? \u2013 Yes.\u201dBefore the re-opened inquest:\u201c... and you accept that the yelling bordered \non being abusive, correct? \u2013 Yes.\n\nAnd the volume and manner of the yelling suggested to you that Senior Sergeant Hurley was angry; correct? \u2013\n\nYes.Before the trial:\u201cit sounded angry.\u201dSteadman did not water down this evidence at the inquests or at trial. Being \nangry and yelling in response to being punched, struggled with, and after a fall caused by the resistance to his \nauthority by a prisoner, might be considered an ordinary human response.\n\n However Hurley claimed:\u201c It was a heavy fall? Yes.\n\nIt was a hard fall? Yes.\n\nThat floor is hard? Yes.\n\nAt that point, I suggest you snapped? No.\n\nYou yelled? Yelled what?\n\nYou yelled abuse at him? No.\n\nYou spoke abusively to him? No.\n\nYou yelled loudly? No.\n\nConstable Steadman is not someone who would have a grudge against you is he? No.\u201dHurley\u2019s denial can be seen \nas a calculated and tactical stratagem particularly in light of earlier statements that show he may not really \nremember what occurred in the fall.. It was untrue. It affects his overall credibility. There would seem to be no \nreason to lie about this material issue other than that the truth would implicate him in a physical assault by providing \nfurther evidence that his response to Mulrunji\u2019s provocation was an angry response.\n\n\n\n Steadman appeared to me to be the most consistent and honest of all the witnesses. Steadman\u2019s evidence on this \npoint is consistent with Bramwell\u2019s version; Bramwell probably did not see the initial fall into the police station, but \nbecame conscious of their presence because of the accompanying racket.\n\n This evidence also ties in with the fact that Bengaroo saw the fall into the police station, heard the angry yelling, \nand did not want to be involved in case he got into trouble.  I have set out this extract from Deputy Chief Magistrate \nHine\u2019s findings, not for the purposes of agreeing or disagreeing with it, but because it shows how critical Constable \nSteadman\u2019s account may have been. It shows also that there were contemporaneous notes kept by an eyewitness \nwhich did not come to light, or were overlooked, at the time. It shows how one decision-maker, looking at all the \nevidence, found that SS Hurley\u2019s account should be disbelieved on this point having given, it would seem, \nsignificant weight to the evidence of Constable Steadman and to his contemporaneous notes.  Deputy Chief \nMagistrate Hine\u2019s findings show that this omission by DI Webber and DSS Kitching cannot be brushed off as \ninsignificant human error.  Constable Steadman had just arrived on Palm Island. He was, to that extent, something \nof an unknown quantity to the other police officers. Perhaps it was the case that some or all of the investigating \nofficers knew he had seen something and any account he might give could be inconsistent with their view that SS \nHurley should be protected. Constable Steadman was not called as a witness in this proceeding, so just as with \nother hypotheses to which I have referred, the Court remains without sufficient evidence to proceed beyond \nspeculation.  Whatever the explanation \u2013 innocent or otherwise \u2013 the glaring omission to interview Constable \nSteadman is in my opinion another example of the lack of actual impartiality in the investigation. I cannot reconcile \nan investigation that was in search of the truth of how Mulrunji had died (and whether any criminal offences may \nhave been committed) with an omission to interview an eyewitness to both the precursor events to the man\u2019s death, \nand then to his death being discovered. Particularly not in a small community, with a small number of police officers \nand no other potential eye witnesses.\n\nThe treatment of PLO Bengaroo  There are two categories of allegations relating to the treatment of Aboriginal \nwitnesses. The first category relates only to PLO Bengaroo, and sets up a contrast between the way he was treated \nby the investigating officers and the way other police officers were treated. The second category relates to the way \nthe investigating officers dealt with the other Aboriginal witnesses who were interviewed as part of the investigation.  \nAs I have already set out, PLO Bengaroo was interviewed by DSS Kitching and DS Robinson in the late afternoon \non 19 November 2004. He also participated in a video re-enactment conducted by Inspector Williams and DI \nWebber on 20 November 2004 in the middle of the day: see [257] and [268] above.  In the interview with DSS \nKitching and DS Robinson, PLO Bengaroo had given this account of what had happened just before Mulrunji\u2019s \narrest, part of which is also extracted at [880] above but which I extract here again for the purpose of addressing \nthis category of allegations (\u201cRK\u201d standing for DSS Kitching and \u201cLB\u201d standing for PLO Bengaroo):LB Chris had \nPatrick put in the Police vehicle \u2013 I stood, I stood besides the police vehicle and I helped open the back door for \nChris to put um Patrick in and um ... there was a struggle, person named Cameron Doomadgee walked towards me \nand said \u2018Ah you\u2019re a black man, like me, I said ah \u2013 what do you lock him up for\n\n...\n\n LB ... And I told, myself I told ah Cameron to, just walk down the road otherwise he\u2019d get locked up\n\n RK Yeah \u2013 What happened then\n\n LB Um, Chris started the vehicle, ah Chris had (ui) gone a couple of metres down the road, Chris said Cameron \nwas calling out (ui)\n\n RK Uhmm, do you know what Cameron was calling out\n\n LB I can\u2019t recall\n\n\n\n RK Okay, what happened then\n\n LB Ah, all of a sudden Chris said to me who was that (ui) \u2013 we pulled up and \u2013 next to Cameron and Chris said to \nme \u201cI'm going to have him \u2013 lock him up\u201d \u2013 so both of us jumped out of the police vehicle and I went down to the \nrear end of the police vehicle to the cage part and I opened the door for Chris \u2013 and Chris grabbed Cameron and \nput him in the back of the vehicle\n\n ...\n\n RK And what did Chris do\n\n LB He grabbed um Cameron\n\n RK Yep, he grabbed Cameron, yep\n\n LB (ui) opened the back of the vehicle and Chris put Cameron in the vehicle \u2013 in the rear\n\n RK How did he do that?\n\n LB (ui) force, by force (ui)\n\n RK By force \u2013 how come (ui) why\n\n LB (ui) grabbed his two arms and two legs and helped him in that way into the vehicle\n\n RK Just helped him in?\n\n LB Yeah  The italicised part above is not reproduced in the typed record of interview but is clearly audible in the \ntape recording. The \u201cYeah\u201d from PLO Bengaroo is inconsistent with what he had said when he was able to give \nunprompted answers.  There is no evidence that PLO Bengaroo\u2019s statement that SS Hurley used force to put \nMulrunji into the vehicle was pursued by QPS investigators. There is also no evidence investigators pursued \nwhether there was a proper basis for Mulrunji\u2019s arrest in the first place, given the statement of PLO Bengaroo. \nCertainly DSS Kitching\u2019s inaccurate and leading questions in the interview with PLO Bengaroo would suggest he \nhad no intention of pursuing any such inquiries.  However, it was what PLO Bengaroo said during the video re-\nenactment with Inspector Williams and DI Webber which was the focus of the applicants\u2019 criticism in this \nproceeding. To recap, this is what PLO Bengaroo is recorded as saying during the video re-enactment, in answer to \na question from DI Webber about what he did after he saw SS Hurley and Mulrunji \u201cstruggling\u201d through the doorway \ninto the police station (\u201cMW\u201d standing for Inspector Williams, \u201cW\u201d standing for Inspector Webber and \u201cLB\u201d standing \nfor PLO Bengaroo):MW: Okay. And they went through the doorway and what happened then?\n\n LB: I just stood up here. I stood a bit further here. They struggled through the door and down the hallway.\n\n MW: Went down the hallway? Okay. Did anything happen here?\n\n LB: Mmm. - I can\u2019t recall. No.\n\n\n\n W: They walked into anyone?\n\n LB: No they didn\u2019t. They struggled.\n\n W: He was struggling?\n\n LB: Yeah.\n\n W: Struggling - what happened?\n\n LB: Ah - I think he flopped against the floor and Chris fell on him ... Chris fell on him. I ... I cant\u2019t tell you ... Mmm - \nthey fell down I think ... Chris was trying ... trying to pick him up.\n\n MW: Just take your time. So you\u2019re saying that Cameron fell down?\n\n LB: Yeah\n\n W: They both fell down?\n\n LB: They both fell down (ui) on it.\n\n W: They both fell down.\n\n MW: And you said Chris was trying to pick him up?\n\n LB: Yes.\n\n MW: Okay. How was Chris trying to pick him up?\n\n LB: Mmm\n\n MW: Can you remember how he tried to do that?\n\n LB: Well I just stood here and I just seen him ...\n\n W: From behind like this or (ui)?\n\n MW: What, what did you see from here? What could you see from where you\u2019re standing?\n\n LB: He was behind (ui) behind ah Cameron, - just like that - just trying to pick him up that way.\n\n MW: Was he?\n\n LB: Yes.\n\n MW: Okay. And did you go inside?\n\n\n\n LB: No I didn\u2019t.\n\n MW: What about Sergeant LEAFE? Did you see Sergeant LEAFE\n\n LB: Yes I did.\n\n MW: Yeah, what did he do and where was he when you saw him?\n\n LB: Ah he was in the hallway.\n\n [Then a little later.]\n\n LB: I was just there and um I moved a bit further and then I was just inside the door\n\n W: And so they both ended up on the floor just in here?\n\n LB: Yeah\n\n W Just inside here?\n\n LB: Mmm\n\n W: Did you see ah Cameron hit his head or anything like that?\n\n LB: No I didn\u2019t. Nothing at all.\n\n MW: So what did you do after you saw them go in there?\n\n LB: I just stood and moved a little bit further. I just stood on the matt.\n\n MW: Can you show us where you stood? Yep. You stood up there?\n\n LB: Yeah. And I seen Chris and Michael just took Cameron that way um they sort of dragged him towards ....\n\n W: From behind (ui)\n\n LB: Yeah.\n\n MW: So they dragged him from behind? Okay. And what did you do as they were dragging him down the hallway?\n\n LB: I stood right here\n\n MW: You stood there?\n\n LB: Yeah.\n\n\n\n MW: Were you watching?\n\n LB: No I wasn\u2019t.\n\n MW: What were you doing? What, how come you were standing there?\n\n LB: Um ... I can\u2019t remember. I just stood here because I was thinking um if I see something I might get into trouble \nmyself or something ... the family might harass me or something you know ...\n\n MW: Oh okay\n\n W: While, while Cameron was on the ground did you see Senior Sergeant HURLEY do anything?\n\n LB: Um he scruffed him - like he sort of a bear hugged him ... just has his arm around his shoulder - around this \npart here.\n\n MW: To hold him?\n\n LB: Yeah\n\n MW: Okay. And you still had the other chap in ah, in the back of the van?\n\n LB: We did, yeah.\n\n MW: Okay.\n\n W: You see Senior Sergeant HURLEY punch Cameron (ui)?\n\n LB: No I didn\u2019t No.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    During the inquests and during the Palm Island Review, DI Webber was challenged about \nwhy he did not investigate further what PLO Bengaroo meant by the remarks I have italicised. He was challenged \nagain on this issue in this proceeding. Steadfastly, DI Webber has maintained that he did not understand PLO \nBengaroo\u2019s comment in the way the series of people who have questioned him about it over the years have \nsuggested it should be understood. In cross-examination in this proceeding, DI Webber accepted that he did not \nask any follow up questions of PLO Bengaroo about this comment. He insisted he did not interpret it in the way the \napplicants\u2019 senior counsel suggested it should be interpreted:Well, it\u2019s a pretty remarkable thing for someone to say, \nisn\u2019t? He\u2019s a long-term PLO. And he\u2019s telling you that he stands outside the police station because he doesn\u2019t want \nto see what\u2019s happening?---I didn\u2019t interpret it as that.\n\n Well, that\u2019s his clear words. \u201cBecause I was thinking, if I see something, I might get into trouble myself\u201d?---Well, I \ntook that on the \u2013 in a different sense.\n\n Well, what sense did you take it in?---I took it in the sense that he doesn\u2019t want to be involved, doesn\u2019t want to have \nanything to do with it because then he would potentially be in trouble with the rest of the community.\n\n And it\u2019s a remarkable thing to say?---As in fact he was.\n\n\n\n Leave the benefit of hindsight. He\u2019s telling you a very serious proposition, isn\u2019t he?---Well, as I say, I didn\u2019t take it \nas a serious proposition at that point.\n\n Well, he\u2019s worried \u2013 might be \u2013 see something that might get him into trouble. You didn\u2019t ask him had he seen \nsomething that Hurley had done before that might get him into trouble?---Well, the point was that he didn\u2019t say that \nhe saw anything.  After some further exchanges which are not in my opinion material, DI Webber then said, \napparently in an attempt to explain why he may not have understood what PLO Bengaroo said in the way that \nothers appear to have, that:not every piece of the conversation was easily understood.  The remainder of the cross-\nexamination on this issue concerned putting to DI Webber what had been found in the other inquiries \u2013 an exercise, \nas I have said, that I did not find of any assistance to the Court\u2019s task in this proceeding.  The applicants also rely \nupon, and DI Webber was cross-examined about, the fact that PLO Bengaroo was not taken to the re-enactment in \nDee Street. Instead, only SS Hurley was taken. DI Webber explained this in the following way:But you only took Mr \nHurley?---Yes.\n\n Despite the fact that he was one of the two QPS officers there at the time of the arrest?---Yes.\n\n You didn\u2019t ever take Mr Bengaroo on a similar view, did you?---No.\n\n But there\u2019s no reason, is there, why his version would have been any less important than Mr Hurley\u2019s?---No.\n\n Except that Mr Hurley is white and Bengaroo is Aboriginal?---No. Mr Hurley was the primary person of interest at \nthat point in time, so - - -\n\n But wasn\u2019t it important to know what Mr Bengaroo\u2019s account of what it was, in case it differed from Mr Hurley?---It \nwas \u2013 it was primarily to identify the actual location of where the arrest had occurred.\n\n And you could have taken Bengaroo for that?---Subsequent - - -\n\n He didn\u2019t need to be seen in public in the company of Hurley?---Subsequently, we could have, yes.\n\n But you didn\u2019t?---No.  DI Webber\u2019s evidence was that SS Hurley was never a suspect in the investigation and I do \nnot understand his use of the phrase \u201cperson of interest\u201d in this evidence to change that position. I do not accept DI \nWebber\u2019s evidence that the primary purpose of going to Dee Street was to identify the location. That could have \nbeen done without SS Hurley, or in other ways \u2013 including by a simple description and a mark on the map. In my \nopinion, DI Webber was giving SS Hurley an opportunity to give his account, alone, of what happened in Dee \nStreet. That is because, as I have found at [859] and following above, neither DI Webber nor DSS Kitching \nconducted themselves so as to allow for the possibility that SS Hurley was responsible for Mulrunji\u2019s death, or for \nany other criminal offences in relation to Mulrunji.  In my opinion DI Webber did not believe PLO Bengaroo had any \nreal contribution to make to the investigation. He found the man hard to understand but made no real effort to \nunderstand him. DI Webber found PLO Bengaroo \u201creluctant\u201d, whereas Dr Eades\u2019 impression of PLO Bengaroo\u2019s \nanswers was that he was taking his time and being careful. DI Webber did not appear, in the contemporaneous \nvideo footage nor in his oral evidence, to be interested in such nuances. Instead, PLO Bengaroo\u2019s hesitation in the \nre-enactment video meant his accounts were put to one side. When PLO Bengaroo made statements in his record \nof interview or the re-enactment which could reflect adversely on SS Hurley, those statements were not followed up. \nInstead, there were efforts made to discount PLO Bengaroo\u2019s statements to a level where they could not assist in \nimplicating SS Hurley.  My impression was that DI Webber had little regard for PLO Bengaroo, and was prepared to \ndisregard what he had to say. He took that approach because PLO Bengaroo was an Aboriginal man from Palm \n\n\n\nIsland, and DI Webber did not want to see a senior, white QPS officer such as SS Hurley implicated in the \ncommission of a serious offence on the say-so of an Aboriginal PLO or (as I set out below) Aboriginal witnesses.\n\nThe treatment of other Aboriginal witnesses  These allegations are separate from the allegations about the \ntreatment of PLO Bengaroo, although because of the nature of the allegations there is some overlap. There were \nseparate allegations made about the treatment of Roy Bramwell and I deal with those at [959] below. In relation to \nthe Aboriginal witnesses as a group, the applicants contend: first, that there was a failure to organise for a support \nperson for Aboriginal witnesses during their police interviews (if needed); and second, that the way the interviews \nwere conducted \u201cdid not account for the cultural needs of the witnesses\u201d.  There were, relevantly, seven Aboriginal \nwitnesses interviewed in the first few days after Mulrunji\u2019s death. They were PLO Bengaroo, Roy Bramwell (who \nwas at the police station when Mulrunji was brought in by SS Hurley), Patrick Bramwell (who was in the cell with \nMulrunji), Penny Sibley (who saw Mulrunji being taken out of the police van at the station), Gladys Nugent, Edna \nCoolburra and Gerald Kidner (all of whom were in Dee Street at the time of Mulrunji\u2019s arrest).  Section 6.3.2 of the \nOPM (which is an order) obliged police officers to establish, prior to interviewing a person, whether any special \nneed existed in relation to that interviewee. Criteria were specified, but to make the position completely plain s 6.3.6 \nof the OPM contained a policy that persons who were Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders were to be assumed to \nhave a special need unless the contrary was clearly established by reference to the criteria for identifying whether a \nneed existed. That was because of not only cultural concerns, but also, the OPM stated, sociological ones.  The \nparticular, and well-recognised, features associated with interviewing Aboriginal witnesses were addressed by Dr \nEades in her evidence. Dr Eades commenced with a general description of the problem for Aboriginal people with \ninterviews as a method of gaining information:Many of these problems arise from the culturally-based nature of the \ninterview as a speech event in which a person requiring information asks questions from a person who is expected \nto provide the information. Interviews are mostly one-sided in this way, and the expectation is of a smooth \nQuestion-Answer iterative pattern. Interviews are not a speech event typically found in Aboriginal societies, where \ninformation is often provided in a much less direct and one-sided way. When Aboriginal people want to find out \nsubstantial information, such as details about an event or a situation, or why someone has done something, they \ntypically talk around a topic, engaging in conversation (or yarning) rather than a Question-Answer session.  Dr \nEades identified three main problems which affect the way some Aboriginal people communicate information. The \nfirst is \u2018gratuitous concurrence\u2019 which Dr Eades defined as a:sociolinguistic term which refers to a speaker saying \nyes (or yeah or mm or nodding their head) in answer to a question (or no, nuh or shaking their head to a negative \nquestion), regardless of whether or not they agree with what they are being asked, and sometimes regardless of \nwhether they even understand the question.  The second feature is silence. Dr Eades said:In Aboriginal \ninteractions, silences are often used productively and positively ... But many Aboriginal people respond to some \ndirect questions from non-Aboriginal people, especially those on important personal topics, with a period of silence, \noften lasting more than one second. When the questioner allows for some silence, it is often followed by an answer. \nBut many non-Aboriginal people feel uncomfortable with a silence of more than about one second. Thus it is easy in \ninterviews of Aboriginal people in legal contexts for the interviewer (e.g. police officer or lawyer) to effectively \ninterrupt the first part of the answer, that is the silence that often begins an Aboriginal answer.  The third feature is a \ndifferent way of providing specific information in answer to a question that required a specific answer:Another \ndifference concerns the way that people provide specific information. It is common for interviewers to ask for \nspecific information with such questions as \u201chow many? what time? how far? how long\u201d? These questions often \nexpect an answer with some quantifiable specification, such as \u201cseven, 10.30, half a kilometre, 20 cms, 6 inches\u201d. \nBut many Aboriginal people give specific details in relational rather than quantifiable terms: that is relating the \nquestion to social, geographical or similar situations or events, rather than using numbers. Answers might involve \nfor example listing the names of people present, giving time information in terms of social comings and goings (eg \n\u201che came just after the kids went to school\u201d), and calculating distance in relation to known places. It is not that \nAboriginal people are not able to give specific detail, but that their ways of being specific may not involve numbers. \nAsking Aboriginal people questions that expect a quantifiable specification (such as questioning clock time: \u201cwhat \ntime was it?\u201d) can be an invitation for less accurate information than inviting people to provide other details about \nthe event.  Dr Eades also gave evidence about the usefulness of a support person for Aboriginal people who were \nbeing interviewed. In summary, her evidence was to the effect that while having a support person might give an \nAboriginal witness some comfort and put them more at ease, it was not likely to improve any of the three features \nshe had identified as problematic in interviewing Aboriginal witnesses.  For the purposes of her report, Dr Eades \n\n\n\nexamined the interviews conducted by DSS Kitching of the seven Aboriginal witnesses. As the respondents \nsubmitted, her evidence having examined the interviews did not particularly assist the applicants\u2019 contentions on \nthese allegations, and the applicants made no submissions to the contrary. Suffice to say Dr Eades found few of the \nthree features she had described present in the interviews. Where she did have some criticisms, it was of matters \nsuch as the pace of DSS Kitching\u2019s questions and his use of clock time. Neither Dr Eades, nor the applicants in \nother evidence or submissions, suggested that the presence of those features had any material impact on the \nnature and quality of the information provided by any or all of the seven Aboriginal witnesses.  The applicants did \nmake a separate submission about DSS Kitching\u2019s interview with Patrick Bramwell, which (there was no dispute) \nwas substantially uninformative, and plainly wrong in places (such as Mr Bramwell telling DSS Kitching he was \nalone in the back of the police car and in the cell, when it is clear Mulrunji was in both locations with him). The \napplicants attempted to lay the blame for those features of the interview with the interviewing technique of DSS \nKitching, assessed in accordance with Dr Eades\u2019 evidence. However, Dr Eades\u2019 own assessment of Patrick \nBramwell\u2019s interview did not support this contention.  In my opinion, there may have been a number of reasons for \nPatrick Bramwell\u2019s interview being so uninformative. I do not propose to speculate about them. The point is that the \napplicants have not discharged their burden of proving DSS Kitching\u2019s questioning technique was responsible.  It is \nimportant not to generalise or stereotype about what an Aboriginal person may or may not need by way of \nassistance or support. To do so is to engage in the very kind of attitude of which the applicants complain in this \nproceeding. The witnesses who appeared in this proceeding were mostly articulate, careful, informative witnesses \nwho dealt with the questioning they faced as well as non-Aboriginal lay witnesses might have done in a similarly \nstressful situation. Some were subjected to leading questions and, ironically, it was possible to see some gratuitous \nconcurrence occurring in those situations. I am sure there are many Aboriginal people living on Palm Island who \nare perfectly capable of communicating well through a question and answer process; or, at least, as well as many \nnon-Aboriginal people can communicate. The cautions and factors to which Dr Eades refers are matters which \nshould inform the judgement and approach of those charged with conducting interviews, or seeking information, but \nthey are by no means to be treated as rigid rules, to be applied in all circumstances. What is important is awareness \nin the questioner, and those responsible for organising questioning, of what might be required by particular \nindividuals.  The respondents accept that none of these witnesses were asked if they would like a support person \npresent during their interviews, and none were offered a support person. They submit, correctly, that a support \nperson is not required by ss 6.3.2 and 6.3.6 of the OPM. These sections of the OPM do not refer to arranging for a \nsupport person to be present for interviews of individuals who are not charged with an offence.  The only evidence \nfrom the respondents about any particular efforts made to accommodate the special needs of Aboriginal witnesses \nwas given by DI Webber. That evidence was that he tried to involve Legal Aid. He said:We attempted to consider \nthose things earlier \u2013 earlier in the piece by involving ... the Legal Aid service, etcetera, and contacting them and \ncommunicating with them. Unfortunately for one reason or another, they ... weren\u2019t able to ... be engaged or to \nparticipate.  Taking into account evidence given later in cross-examination, it is apparent by \u201cthe Legal Aid Service\u201d \nDI Webber meant ATSILS. Ms Sailor was the person resident on the island who worked for ATSILS, as well as Mr \nMarpoondin. DI Webber was aware of this because these were the two people he sought to assist him in going to \nsee Mulrunji\u2019s family to notify them of his death. Ms Sailor\u2019s evidence was very clear that she was not contacted. \nShe said she was in the ATSILS office all afternoon, after Mr Marpoondin went with DI Webber to tell Mulrunji\u2019s \nfamily the news of his death, and she stayed in the ATSILS office until Mr Marpoondin came back. It is clear she \nwas still on Palm Island the next day. It is clear no police officer asked for her assistance, or that of Mr \nMarpoondin, in interviewing the seven Aboriginal witnesses. This is despite her describing having previously had a \ngood working relationship with DS Robinson, and sitting in, as matter of course, on interviews when people were \ntaken into custody.  Although both DI Webber and DSS Kitching stated that they contacted Ms Sailor and Mr \nMarpoondin, in their capacity as ATSILS representatives, at the outset of the investigation and that Ms Sailor \u201cdid \nnot feel comfortable\u201d assisting them, I do not consider their evidence on this question to be as reliable as Ms \nSailor\u2019s evidence. Her evidence, which I accept, is that she found out about Mulrunji\u2019s death from her cousin, who \nwas a paramedic. After that, she and Mr Marpoondin went to the police station to see what had happened. \nMulrunji\u2019s body was still in the cell at this time. Ms Sailor then described what she and Mr Marpoondin were told:So \nyou then spoke to an officer from Townsville?---Yes.\n\n\n\n And do you recall that conversation?---Vaguely. I \u2013 we were notified that there was a death and that the forensic \nteam would be sent to Palm Island. They were awaiting the forensic team to come across. They \u2013 then we \u2013 the \nfamily at that stage hadn\u2019t been notified, and we were asked to accompany the police to the family, but I spoke with \nUncle Owen, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with doing that business, and I just couldn\u2019t face giving news such as that, \nparticularly because I\u2019ve lost a brother in custody as well, so I didn\u2019t want to have to relay that message. So Uncle \nOwen went himself to the family.  I note also that Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine made arrangements for support \npersons for all Aboriginal witnesses giving evidence before him on Palm Island: see [88] of the inquest findings \ndated 14 May 2010.  I find DI Webber made no real attempt to secure the assistance of ATSILS or anyone else to \nsupport the Aboriginal witnesses interviewed between 19 and 21 November 2004. That omission, of itself, does not \ntake these contentions of the applicants very far. Inspector Kitching gave evidence that he considered all the \nwitnesses could be interviewed by themselves, that he had no difficulty in understanding them and he considered \nthey were understanding him. On my own review of the transcripts of interview, the witnesses do not appear to \nhave had much difficulty understanding what they were being asked, or answering it. As I find below, for example, \nMs Penny Sibley volunteered at several places during her interview that she saw SS Hurley hit Mulrunji and \u201crough \nhim up\u201d. At least from the written transcript, there is no indication Ms Sibley felt inhibited in giving this account, \nwhich she gave at least twice during the interview. There were also other difficulties with the interviews in terms of \nwitnesses not being followed up on what they meant by various statements, but I do not consider any Aboriginal \nwitness appeared as if they would not, or could not, give a full and truthful account of what they saw or heard.  It is \ndifficult to assess from the evidence before me whether providing a support person would have made any \ndifference to the information provided by the seven people interviewed. As I have outlined, Dr Eades did not find \nanything of real substance to criticise about the interviews. That is not necessarily the end of the matter, but the fact \nis that not a single one of these seven witnesses gave evidence before me. None stated, for example, that they felt \nunable to give a full account of what they saw. None said they were intimidated by the circumstances. There was \nsimply no such evidence. As I have noted, Patrick Bramwell\u2019s account was uninformative and plainly wrong in \nplaces. While there may be other reasons for this, for present purposes the critical point is that DSS Kitching \nseemed to simply push through the interview, no matter what answers were given.  While I accept that in some \ncircumstances it will be necessary for police officers to consider what means might be available to make witnesses \nwith special needs (including some Aboriginal people) comfortable enough to give their best account of what they \nare being asked about, and that such means might include a support person, I am not satisfied on the evidence \nbefore me that any of the seven witnesses the applicants identify were in need of such support. I am not satisfied it \nshould have been apparent to either DI Webber or DSS Kitching that any of them needed a support person, or any \nother special considerations. In the absence of any evidence from the witnesses themselves, I am also not satisfied \nthat their evidence was in any material way inhibited by the manner and circumstances in which DSS Kitching \nquestioned them (in contrast to his questioning of PLO Bengaroo).  There was, accordingly, no act involving a \ndistinction, exclusion or preference for the purposes of s 9.  However, the content of Ms Sibley\u2019s interviews is \nanother feature which makes plain the lack of impartiality in this investigation. Twice during her interview Ms Sibley \ngave a clear account of SS Hurley assaulting Mulrunji. On the first occasion this is how she described what she saw \n(with \u201cK\u201d standing for DSS Kitching and \u201cFS\u201d standing for Ms Sibley):K Alright. Can you tell us what you saw then \nafter you saw the police car turn up\n\n FS Ah we just stood there waiting for Lloyd. Lloyd said \u2018I\u2019m busy at the moment wait for me\u2019\n\n K Ahm\n\n FS Um,\n\n K What happened then\n\n FS They just got out and opened the back of that police van there. Cameron was going off swearing and being \nabusive there for awhile.\n\n\n\n K Yeah\n\n FS And BRAMWELL was asleep on the floor.\n\n K Yeah\n\n FS So they grabbed hold of Cameron and pulled him out Cameron made a swing at Chris and punched him in the \nface and them they got him outside. Chris - Chris hit him back and they roughed him up into the side door. And I \ndidn\u2019t see anything else after that. The door closed behind us.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    DSS Kitching did not follow up on this account immediately, or really at all. Instead, a few \nminutes later, he went back to Ms Sibley\u2019s account of Mulrunji punching SS Hurley. He asked:K Okay. And how ah - \nwho opened the cage of the police car\n\n FS Chris\n\n K Chris opened the cage. And you said then Cameron hit Chris\n\n FS Yes\n\n K How did he hit him\n\n FS He just punched him like that\n\n K He just punched him.\n\n FS (UI) .... punched Chris yes. []\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Thereafter, it was only when DSS Kitching asked another (properly) open ended question that \nMs Sibley returned again to her account of SS Hurley punching Mulrunji:K Alright and what happened when \nCameron got out of the police car.\n\n FS He was there going off drank singing out Hey-ee\n\n K And what happened then.\n\n FS That\u2019s when Chris hit him\n\n K How did he hit him\n\n FS He jabbed him you know to the good side of the head (slapping noise) a clip \u2013 just once that\u2019s all\n\n K Just once that\u2019s all ... (overtalk)\n\n FS ... and then they grabbed, grabbed him by the his two arms and they dragged him to the door.\n\n K And what was Cameron doing then\n\n\n\n FS He was still singing out  Ms Sibley\u2019s account here of how Mulrunji was brought into the police station was quite \ndifferent to that of SS Hurley. She said quite clearly, on several occasions, that he was dragged through by the \narms. She then said a few minutes later: \u201cAnd his two legs were dragging, you know\u201d. The other accounts (including \nthose of SS Hurley, Constable Steadman, and Sergeant Leafe) give descriptions suggesting Mulrunji was upright \nand walking, although struggling, when he was taken out of the police vehicle and to the doorway leading into the \npolice station.  A little later when Ms Sibley was asked what happened as Mulrunji was dragged away, this was the \nexchange:     Okay. When, when the police and Cameron got to the door, did anything happen then.   There was ... \na bit of a roughing up there, but I couldn\u2019t see properly, you know what they were doing. And I then could hear \nCameron saying \u2013 \u201coh eff off\u201d you know, \u201cleave me, eff off\u201d.   Was Cameron standing up then or..   No, no they had \nhim by the two arms and then the door closed and I couldn\u2019t see anything else.   Were both the policemen, were \nthey still standing up.   Yeah, they were still there, standing up   And when they were dragging Cameron they were \nstanding behind him or in front of him or beside him   On the side of him   One each side of him   Yeah      The final \naccount she gave was as follows:K And you say then during that struggle ...\n\n FS Yeah\n\n K ... he hit Chris\n\n FS Yeah\n\n K And then once Chris got him out of the van, you said ....\n\n FS Chris hit him\n\n K You\u2019re indicated to the hip area.\n\n FS He sought [sic] of hit him there\n\n K Hip ... hip ... hip ahh \u2013 the side here somewhere ...\n\n FS Yeah\n\n K And were they still struggling to get (UI)\n\n FS Yeah and he was still singing out - Cameron at the time\n\n K So when they were walking down to ahh the door, were they still struggling as they walked down ...\n\n FS Yeah\n\n K And (overtalk)\n\n FS Then they got inside, they just closed the door behind..\n\n K Did you see who closed the door  No. I don\u2019t know who it was. ...[I note that the transcript that was in evidence \nshowed DSS Kitching asking the questions in this passage, but in the audio of the interview, which was also in \nevidence, it is clear that Inspector Williams was asking the questions with DSS Kitching present.]  This seemed, at \nleast on one view, to be an account of a second time when SS Hurley hit or punched Mulrunji, in a different part of \n\n\n\nhis body.  In this exchange it is notable, in my opinion, that again a question was put to Ms Sibley which did not \nreflect what she had told the officers who were interviewing her, and which was more consistent with the account \ngiven by the other police officers. Ms Sibley had clearly said, several times, that the officers dragged Mulrunji \nthrough the door by his arms. Yet here DSS Kitching puts back to Ms Sibley a question premised on Mulrunji \nwalking through the door, struggling.  In this interview, and in his subsequent failure to pursue or even highlight Ms \nSibley\u2019s account, in my opinion DSS Kitching was intent on pursuing a narrative which was consistent with what his \nfellow police officers had told him. Consciously or unconsciously \u2013 it does not matter for the purposes of s 9 \u2013 \nwhatever he was told by Aboriginal eyewitnesses was neither as important nor as compelling to him.  Ms Sibley\u2019s \naccount of what she saw SS Hurley doing was either downplayed or disregarded. That was, in my opinion, in \nsubstantial part because she was an Aboriginal person giving an account of potentially incriminating behaviour by a \nwhite police officer.  This evidence contributes to and supports my findings about the lack of impartiality in the \ninvestigation. However, the applicants have not proven any of their separately formulated allegations concerning \nthe treatment of Aboriginal witnesses.\n\nThe way Mr Roy Bramwell was dealt with  The applicants singled out the treatment of Mr Bramwell. I agree his \ntreatment was quite different from that of other Aboriginal witnesses. It is the most obvious example of differential \ntreatment of an eyewitness because he was an Aboriginal person, and not perceived by the investigating officers as \nlikely to have an account of events that was reliable, or truthful. Again, it supports and contributes to my finding \nconcerning the lack of impartiality in the investigation.  Mr Bramwell was first interviewed at 8.15 am on 20 \nNovember 2004 by DSS Kitching and DS Robinson, having been collected from his house that morning and taken \nto the police station for the purposes of that interview. Apparently he had not been held overnight despite having \nbeen arrested the previous morning. He participated in a video re-enactment with DI Webber and Inspector \nWilliams later that morning. Both his interview with DSS Kitching and the video re-enactment were in evidence in \nthis proceeding.  Mr Bramwell had been arrested on the morning of 19 November 2004 on charges relating to an \nassault of Gladys Nugent. That led to Mr Bramwell being in the watchhouse, sitting in what was known as the \nyellow chair, directly facing the door through which SS Hurley would subsequently bring Mulrunji. During his \ninterview Mr Bramwell told DSS Kitching he had seen Mulrunji in the police van outside, as he (Mr Bramwell) had \nwalked into the police station. He recounted how he had seen Mulrunji punch SS Hurley after he had been \nremoved from the police van. On Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, SS Hurley then dragged Mulrunji inside.  During his first \ninterview Mr Bramwell gave the following account of what he had then seen:Chris started punchin\u2019 him just in the \nhall there, Chris started punchin\u2019 him. \u201cYou want more Mr Doomadgee?\u201d He went like that. \u201cYou want more Mr \nDoomadgee hey that\u2019s enough for ya?\u201d Just kept on going like that. Chris. Ah I just sat down and (ui) I seen Mr \nDoomadgee\u2019s legs sticking out. \n\n ... And Chris started punchin\u2019 him. I seen Chris goin\u2019 at \u2013 I seen Chris goin\u2019 at him like that, you know. \n\n [In my view, the audio shows Mr Bramwell said \u201cChris was goin\u2019 like that\u201d, not \u201cI seen Chris goin\u2019 at him\u201d.]  When \nMr Bramwell spoke about Mulrunji\u2019s legs \u201csticking out\u201d, the parties agreed this was a reference to the fact that \nMulrunji was lying on the floor of the watchhouse, but Mr Bramwell\u2019s view was obscured by a filing cabinet, so that \nhe could not see the whole of Mulrunji\u2019s body on the floor.  DSS Kitching asked Mr Bramwell how he could have \nseen SS Hurley punching Mulrunji from where he was sitting, and this was what Mr Bramwell said:Well he tall, he \ntall you know. I just seen the elbow comin\u2019 down like that you know. Must have punched him pretty hard didn\u2019t he. \nWell he a sober man, and he was a drunken man. \n\n [In my view, the audio shows Mr Bramwell said he saw \u201cthe elbow goin\u2019 up and down like that\u201d, not \u201cI just seen the \nelbow comin\u2019 down like that\u201d.]  On Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, there was no fall of both SS Hurley and Mulrunji. Mr \nBramwell said only Mulrunji fell over, and when asked why, he said \u201che was drunk\u201d.  Subsequently, when DS \nRobinson took a written statement from Mr Bramwell, Mr Bramwell\u2019s account was recorded in the following \nway:From where I was sitting I could see Cameron\u2019s feet and I could hear Chris saying \u201cyou want more Mr \nDOOMADGEE, you want more\u201d. I could not see what Chris was doing, I could see his elbow going up and down \ninto the air.  As the applicants submit, DS Robinson, who had been present during the interview DSS Kitching \nconducted, had heard Mr Bramwell say at least twice that SS Hurley had punched Mulrunji. Yet when he typed up \n\n\n\nMr Bramwell\u2019s written statement, DS Robinson did not include anything about SS Hurley punching Mulrunji.  After \nMr Bramwell\u2019s account, and as the applicants submit, the investigating officers did not put his account back to SS \nHurley, Sergeant Leafe or PLO Bengaroo. Instead, they continued to interview other witnesses, turning their \nattention to people who had been present at Dee Street.  Later that morning, after Inspector Williams arrived, he \nsuggested a video re-enactment should be conducted. DSS Kitching was also present during Mr Bramwell\u2019s re-\nenactment. The applicants criticise the conduct of the re-enactment, submitting that Mr Bramwell is questioned \nmore closely (whether he had been drinking, whether he was okay, whether his memory was good) than the non-\nAboriginal (police) witnesses. They also submit he was asked to go through events numerous times, whereas the \nnon-Aboriginal police witnesses were not. All this combines, the applicants submit, to create the impression that \nthe investigating officers were either dismissive of Mr Bramwell\u2019s allegations, or were actively trying to discredit \nthem, at an early stage of the investigation before they had been put to SS Hurley.  I have watched the video re-\nenactment several times. Mr Bramwell\u2019s emphasis is on what he saw SS Hurley doing to Mulrunji \u2013 that is, \npunching him. He commences his narrative almost immediately with this. He is also clear that SS Hurley dragged \nMulrunji through the door, that Mulrunji was drunk but was saying he wanted to stand up, telling SS Hurley to let \nhim go and let him stand up. On Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, the two did not fall through the door and both end up on \nthe floor. On his account, there was no fall: rather, Mulrunji was dragged through the door and ended up on the \nfloor. Mr Bramwell was asked to show the officers where SS Hurley and Mulrunji were when the punching occurred. \nHe did so. He went into the corridor behind the filing cabinet. From the camera angle as it panned back towards \nwhere Mr Bramwell was sitting, although part of Mr Bramwell\u2019s body is obscured by the filing cabinet, the top of his \nbody, and the elbow coming up and down mimicking what Mr Bramwell said was how SS Hurley punched Mulrunji, \ncould be easily seen. The filing cabinet appears to come up to about the chest level of Mr Bramwell, who is not a \ntall man. Further when DI Webber played the role of SS Hurley and Mr Bramwell lay on the ground playing the role \nof Mulrunji, it is clear to an observer that DI Webber could be seen, from the chair Mr Bramwell was sitting in, \nperforming the punching actions Mr Bramwell recounted. Mr Bramwell also explained why he did not say anything \nat the time: he said, if he had said something, \u201cChris\u201d would have locked him up. Towards the end of the interview, \nMr Bramwell described SS Hurley punching Mulrunji in the face three times and Mulrunji trying to cover up his face. \nOn the video re-enactment, it is objectively difficult to see how Mr Bramwell might have been able to observe that.  \nIn other words, there are aspects of Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, viewed objectively, which are less plausible than other \naspects. Having watched the video re-enactment with SS Hurley, however, the same observation might be made of \nhis account. His account in the video, for example, does not recount him falling very much at all, and certainly not \nfalling onto Mulrunji \u2013 indeed later in the re-enactment SS Hurley describes ending up on his knees.  In my opinion \nthere was no material difference between the quality or reliability of Mr Bramwell\u2019s interview and video re-enactment \nand those of the QPS officers, especially SS Hurley. Each had omissions and contradictions.  Yet Mr Bramwell\u2019s \naccount was quickly discounted. His account was not put to SS Hurley during the re-enactment. Nor was it put to \nSergeant Leafe and PLO Bengaroo during their re-enactments. Nor, as I have dealt with above, was it included in \nthe Form 1.  When pressed in cross-examination about why he never considered SS Hurley a suspect during the \nfirst few days of the investigation (until he was relieved from his investigative duties), Inspector Kitching maintained \nthat:I had an open mind. I had no preconceived ideas at all about what caused the death. It was a completely open \ninvestigation to identify the facts of the matter.  For reasons I have already set out, I do not accept this was the \ncase.  I emphasise that the recounting of these events is not designed to establish one way or the other what SS \nHurley did or did not do to Mulrunji on 19 November 2004. Rather, the focus is on what an objective, thorough and \nimpartial investigation should have identified.  The applicants repeatedly referred (in their written submissions and \nin the lengthy factual annexure to those submissions) to findings adverse to SS Hurley made by both Acting State \nCoroner Clements, the CMC, and Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine. This is an example of the applicants\u2019 \nsubmissions:Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine concluded: \u201cAnother instance of collusion is the mimicking of Bramwell\u2019s \nactions by Hurley in the video re-enactment of 20 November 2004, which conveniently explained earlier actions \ndepicted by Bramwell in his re-enactment, and which were mentioned to Sergeant Robinson in Bramwell\u2019s interview \nand statement earlier that day. The suspicion is compounded by Hurley\u2019s failure to mention his repeated attempts to \nraise Mulrunji from the floor by grabbing his shirt when he was interviewed for the first time on 19 November \n2004.[\u201d]  Anyone observing the video of Mr Bramwell\u2019s account of how SS Hurley was punching Mulrunji, and then \nwatching SS Hurley re-create how he pulled Mulrunji up by the shirt, could see the similarity.  It is not this Court\u2019s \nfunction to decide whether to make the kind of finding Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine made, and I have not \napproached the parties\u2019 submissions on this basis. Rather, like Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine\u2019s findings about \n\n\n\nConstable Steadman, what reference to later findings in later inquiries shows is the potential probative value of Mr \nBramwell\u2019s account. It was that potential probative value that I find QPS investigating officers ignored in November \n2004. To make that finding is not to reach any conclusions about where the investigation should appropriately have \nended up: rather, it is to emphasise how it should have been conducted, if it was to be conducted impartially and \nobjectively, with equal attention and respect being paid to the evidence of Palm Islanders as to that of non-\nAboriginal police officers.  The relevance of examining how Mr Bramwell was treated is to determine, at the time \nthis re-enactment occurred, what one might reasonably have expected the investigating officers to do with this kind \nof account. Whether or not SS Hurley\u2019s re-enactment had been modified to address Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, the \npoint to be made here is that any investigating officer at this early stage of the investigation would, it seems to me, \nhave been taking all accounts seriously. An investigating officer might have watched what SS Hurley did and \nconsidered whether he was adjusting his account on purpose, whether there was in fact a similarity that meant Mr \nBramwell might be mistaken, or whether there was enough consistency that Mr Bramwell might be correct. All those \nwere reasonable possibilities on what was known to the investigating officers at this time. At the time (rather than in \nhindsight), there was no obvious reason to discount or dismiss what Mr Bramwell had said. Yet this is what in \nsubstance occurred.  Inspector Kitching denied that he decided Mr Bramwell\u2019s account was not credible. He said he \ndid not recall any discussion with DI Webber in which they agreed to ignore Mr Bramwell\u2019s account. He stated that \n\u201call the information from all the witnesses was \u2013 was taken credibly and it was to be produced at any time\u201d. He \ndenied dismissing Mr Bramwell\u2019s account because he was an Aboriginal man. He accepted it was part of his task \nas an investigator to analyse information, not simply collect it. He appeared to say that he was too short of time to \nreview properly the information he had collected. If this was proffered as an explanation for the disregard of Mr \nBramwell\u2019s statement, and the failure to put its substance to SS Hurley, or to include it in the Form 1, I do not \naccept it. The more likely explanation, and the one I favour, is that DSS Kitching had made up his mind to accept \nthe account of events given by SS Hurley, and not to emphasise, or further investigate, any information that might \ncontradict what SS Hurley had said, especially information coming from local Aboriginal people.  DI Webber\u2019s \nevidence was that he thought Mr Bramwell might have been \u201cgilding the lily or telling lies, furthering the \u2013 increasing \nhis status in the community by telling lies\u201d. He also confirmed that another possible explanation for what he \nconsidered were Mr Bramwell\u2019s \u201clies\u201d was that he had been drinking on the Friday night and listening to community \ngossip.  I note that DI Webber appeared to have no compunction about using the term \u201clies\u201d about what Mr \nBramwell had said: a view DI Webber has no doubt reached in hindsight after considering all the inquiries and \nfindings. However, DI Webber did not characterise the evidence of any non-Aboriginal witness in this way, despite \nhaving the same advantage of hindsight and the same access to adverse findings about the evidence of certain \npolice officers, including SS Hurley.  DI Webber gave no acceptable or persuasive explanation to justify the way Mr \nBramwell\u2019s account was disregarded, was not put back to SS Hurley, and was not included in the information \nprovided to the coroner. He offered justifications which involved a pejorative judgment, now made in hindsight, but \nwhich in fact reflected the preconceived views DI Webber held of Mr Bramwell on 20 November 2004. In my \nopinion, at that time, DI Webber, like DSS Kitching, was simply not prepared to take seriously the account of a local \nAboriginal man, in part because of his stereotyping about the motivations and weaknesses likely to affect what an \nAboriginal man such as Mr Bramwell would be prepared to say. It may well have been that, in due course, later in \nthe investigation, or in any prosecution process, those weaknesses or improper motivations might have been \nestablished as affecting the reliability of what was said by a range of witnesses, including Mr Bramwell. At the early \nstage of this investigation on 19, 20 and 21 November 2004, that could not possibly have been a reason to discount \nand disregard Mr Bramwell\u2019s account. In my opinion, the reason was the source of the information: a local \nAboriginal man, known to drink. To accept Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, implicating SS Hurley, inevitably led to a \nrejection or questioning of SS Hurley\u2019s account. Neither DSS Kitching nor DI Webber were in my opinion prepared \nto allow the account of an Aboriginal man affected by alcohol to impugn the account of a white police officer.  I \naccept that in the circumstances of this investigation it might have been appropriate to ask an eyewitness whether \nshe or he had been drinking, whether during the events witnessed or before any interview. That is especially so \nwhere, on the evidence, alcohol consumption was a considerable social problem on Palm Island and it was not \nuncommon for people who ended up at Palm Island Police Station to have been affected by alcohol. However, a \nperson affected by alcohol may still be able to give a truthful and reliable account of something she or he saw, \nheard or experienced. In the situation under consideration, questions of that sort as a first line of inquiry do seem to \nset up a different approach towards, and reveal different underlying assumptions about, local Palm Islanders from \nthat taken with other witnesses.  I also note that the investigating officers did not ask Mr Bramwell more objective \n\n\n\nquestions that might have gone to the credibility of his account. For example, when SS Hurley returned to the \npolice station with Mulrunji he had been assisting Mr Bramwell\u2019s partner, Gladys Nugent, after Mr Bramwell had \nbeen arrested for assaulting her and SS Hurley had also arrested Mr Bramwell\u2019s nephew, Patrick Bramwell, and \nhad him in the paddy wagon with Mulrunji. Whether these circumstances coloured Roy Bramwell\u2019s account was not \nexplored with him by the investigating officers. One explanation for that is that DSS Kitching and DI Webber were \nnever going to take what Mr Bramwell said seriously.  In circumstances where a local Palm Island Aboriginal man \nis giving an account that inculpates a white police officer, including saying at the end of the interview that he did not \nspeak up because he was certain that white police officer would arrest him if he did, and in the absence of any \nsatisfactory explanations in the evidence, I am satisfied that Mr Bramwell\u2019s account, and Mr Bramwell himself, was \nnot taken seriously because he was an Aboriginal man from the Palm Island community. The Aboriginal race of the \npeople involved cannot be separated from their status as Aboriginal people from Palm Island. Palm Island is an \nAboriginal community \u2013 that is its nature. The community is defined by race, and defined by the racially \ndiscriminatory and negative treatment that Aboriginal people in that community have suffered since its inception. On \n19 and 20 November 2004, there was no respect from the investigating officers for the members of this community, \nthere was no understanding of them, and there was no sense that what they had to say might be more truthful than \nwhat a white police officer had to say. There was, quite simply, no objective, racially neutral starting point.\n\nConduct surrounding the autopsy  There are four allegations made about the way QPS officers provided information \nto the pathologist conducting the autopsy on Mulrunji. Most of these allegations concern the conduct of DSS \nKitching. They are: a failure to submit the Form 1 for the autopsy as soon as possible; the statement in the Form 1 \nthat \u201cthe deceased laid on the floor of the cell and went to sleep immediately\u201d; the failure to include the allegations \nthat SS Hurley assaulted Mulrunji in the Form 1 or in a supplementary Form 1; and the failure to advise the \npathologist, Dr Lampe, of the assault allegations during the autopsy.  I have set out the agreed circumstances \nconcerning the \u2018Form 1\u2019 for the autopsy being sent to the Coroner at [282] above. The applicants criticise the delay \nin sending the Form 1, contending it was a breach of the requirement in s 8.4.8 of the OPM for that form to be \nsubmitted \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to enable an autopsy to be \u201ccarried out on the next working day\u201d.  It is unclear on \nthe evidence when it was decided that the autopsy would be performed on Tuesday, 23 November 2004, nor is it \nclear when DSS Kitching knew it would be performed on the Tuesday. This was his evidence about why, although \nthe Form 1 was complete and checked by DI Webber on the Friday night, he did not send it until Monday \nmorning:The next working day, which was the Monday, when \u2013 before the autopsy, I had to get the \u2013 the purpose of \nthe form 1 is to inform the \u2013 the coroner and to substantiate a reason for an autopsy. So I certainly submitted it on \nthe \u2013 the next working day, which was the Monday.  Inspector Kitching seems to have misunderstood the \u201cnext \nworking day\u201d reference in s 8.4.8: it relates to the conduct of the autopsy on the \u201cnext working day\u201d after the \nsubmission of the Form 1, not the submission of the Form 1 on the \u201cnext working day\u201d.  Inspector Kitching also gave \nevidence that, at 7.25 pm on Friday, 19 November 2004, he contacted the local Townsville Magistrate to inform him \nof the death and then also contacted the government undertaker and made arrangements for Mulrunji\u2019s body to be \ncollected and taken to Townsville. Mulrunji\u2019s body was moved on the Saturday morning, according to Inspector \nKitching. This seems to be confirmed by the contents of DS Robinson\u2019s witness statement from February 2005, \nwhich was in evidence before me. That being the case, it seems wholly inexplicable that DSS Kitching would forget, \nomit or neglect to submit the Form 1, as such a critical step in an investigation into a death in custody. The \ninvestigation team worked over the weekend, and no distinctions appear to have been made between \u201cworking \ndays\u201d and \u201cnon-working days\u201d. It was not suggested that the State Coroner\u2019s office in Townsville operated in a \nfashion which meant it would only receive documentation about a death in custody, which the Coroners Act \nmandated be provided, between Monday and Friday.  It may have been conceivable that DSS Kitching decided to \nwait until more interviews were conducted over the weekend, so he could give the pathologist a fuller picture. \nHowever, he did not give that as a reason in his evidence. Indeed, his evidence was that he intended to include \ninformation collected over the weekend in a Supplementary Form 1, not in the original Form 1. No Supplementary \nForm 1 was prepared or submitted. As it turned out, some of the accounts which emerged over the weekend were \ninconsistent with SS Hurley\u2019s account, and involved allegations of injuries inflicted on Mulrunji by SS Hurley. It was \nthat feature, combined with the contents of the Form 1 as completed on the Friday evening, which the applicants \ncontend demonstrates that DSS Kitching decided to present to the coroner a picture of what had happened that \nwas exculpatory for SS Hurley, and which disregarded what Aboriginal witnesses had said.  Similarly, Inspector \nKitching\u2019s evidence about why, in the Form 1, he described what happened to Mulrunji as that \u201cthe deceased laid \n\n\n\non the floor of the cell and went to sleep immediately\u201d, was unsatisfactory. As the applicants have submitted, this \ndescription in the Form 1 conveys a wholly inaccurate impression of what occurred. Mulrunji did not \u201clay\u201d on the \nfloor: he had been dragged into the cell by two police officers and was limp (or a \u201cdead weight\u201d in Sergeant Leafe\u2019s \nwords) when this occurred. There is no possible way for DSS Kitching to have been certain that what happened \nwas that Mulrunji went to sleep, as opposed to losing consciousness. The only person who described it that way \nwas SS Hurley. The description is at odds with the cell video, which Inspector Kitching agreed he had viewed. In \ncross-examination of Inspector Kitching, senior counsel for the applicants described Mulrunji as \u201cwrithing in pain\u201d. \nWhile, to an observer of the video, that description also makes several assumptions, it is true that the cell video \nshows Mulrunji moving in ways that are not consistent with a person who is sleeping. Many of those movements are \nnot, as DI Webber described it, \u201ctossing and turning\u201d during sleep. The cell video also clearly records audible noises \nbeing made by Mulrunji, which were not mentioned in the Form 1.  However, the point is (as Inspector Kitching \neventually conceded in cross-examination) that it was not the task of any of the investigating officers to make \nassumptions or draw conclusions of this kind, especially about an issue so critical to the investigation.  Inspector \nKitching was prepared to accept he should not have described Mulrunji the way he did:And he did not lie on the \nfloor and he was not asleep?---He was lying on the floor.\n\n He didn\u2019t lie himself on the floor?---No.\n\n No. He was limp - - -?---He was taken to the cell. Yes.\n\n - - - unresponsive, and taken there by two police officers?---Correct.\n\n But you don\u2019t set any of that out?---Not in the form 1. No.\n\n It would have been helpful for the coroner \u2013 the autopsy conductor to know that, wouldn\u2019t it?---I would accept that. \nYes.\n\n But you didn\u2019t tell him?---No.  Nor did Inspector Kitching include on the Form 1 an adequate description of how \nMulrunji\u2019s face appeared shortly after he was found deceased, and still lying in the cell. As I have noted, the state of \nMulrunji\u2019s face is clearly evident in the video taken by Constable Tibbey while his body was still in the cell. In that \nvideo, Mulrunji\u2019s face is bruised and quite swollen. In evidence in chief, Inspector Kitching confirmed that he had \nviewed Mulrunji\u2019s body while it was in the cell, albeit briefly, and said he was aware of the injury to Mulrunji\u2019s face. \nHe described that injury as \u201ca small cut or mark just underneath one of his eyebrows\u201d. Based on the video that is in \nevidence, I find that description is inaccurate and minimises the nature of the injury.  Having failed to convey \nrelevant information to the coroner, DSS Kitching nevertheless provided information to the coroner that included a \nnumber of stereotypical and negative comments about Mulrunji, based it appears either on assumptions or \ncomments from DS Robinson, for which there was no foundation in the evidence. These included that he might \nhave been drinking bleach and sniffing petrol. To make allegations of that kind, and to omit the assault allegations, \nwas capable of steering the initial pathologist inquiries in one direction (self-inflicted or pre-existing harm), and away \nfrom another (the conduct of SS Hurley). That is not the conduct of an objective and impartial investigator.  In my \nopinion, DSS Kitching was not focussed on giving the coroner an accurate and fulsome description of the state \nMulrunji was in when he was placed in the cell. He was not, I find, inclined to offer a description that was in any way \ninculpatory of the police officers responsible for putting Mulrunji into that cell and leaving him there, especially SS \nHurley. He chose to provide information, stereotypical of Aboriginal people (a drunk sleeping his inebriation off, an \nAboriginal person consuming bleach and sniffing petrol) that suggested Mulrunji was responsible for his own death. \nI am unable to place a benign construction on DSS Kitching\u2019s conduct. It was another example of the lack of actual \nimpartiality in the investigation.  I reach the same conclusion about the omission of the accounts of Mr Bramwell \nand Ms Sibley from the Form 1. Inspector Kitching again, in cross-examination, conceded they should have been \nincluded. He had no real explanation for why they were not. He accepted he was able to (and indeed, proffered that \nhe intended to) complete a Supplementary Form 1 containing additional information gleaned from interviews over \n\n\n\nthe weekend. That Supplementary Form 1 could also have been used to correct misinformation. It is clear Inspector \nKitching was able to submit this supplementary form whether or not he had submitted the original Form 1, but as it \nturned out he had not submitted the original form, so there was really no practical or logistical difficulty at all in \nhaving the additional information included. Inspector Kitching\u2019s evidence on this issue should be set out:And you \naccept that there\u2019s no mention of Mr Bramwell\u2019s allegation of assault?---I didn\u2019t know that when I completed the \nform 1. No.\n\n But you well and truly knew it before you lodged it, didn\u2019t you?---Yes. I did. Yes.\n\n And there\u2019s no mention of Ms Sibley\u2019s assault allegation - - -?---No. That\u2019s right.\n\n - - - even though you well and truly knew that before you lodged it?---That\u2019s correct.\n\n ...\n\n Now, you were able to include an allegation that the deceased has assaulted Senior Sergeant Hurley, weren\u2019t \nyou?---Yes.\n\n But you were not able to include an allegation by two different people of two different assaults by Mr Hurley?---I \ndidn\u2019t have that information when I completed this form 1, and I didn\u2019t - - -\n\n No, but you had it by the time that you submitted it, didn\u2019t you?---That\u2019s correct. Yes.\n\n So by Saturday morning, you had the Bramwell allegation?---Yes.\n\n By Sunday you had the Sibley allegation?---Yes.\n\n And the form was submitted around 10.30 or so on the Monday?---Yes.\n\n You could have easily amended it to include those matters. Would you agree?---I could have. Yes.\n\n And you didn\u2019t?---No.\n\n And during the course of the Monday, before the Tuesday autopsy, you did not cause to be submitted a \nsupplementary form 1 - - -?---No.\n\n - - - which included that important information, that is, of the two allegations?---Correct.\n\n And at the time you were on Palm Island, the faxes were working?---I\u2019ve got no idea\n\n The computers were working?---The computers were working. Yes.\n\n Well, there is no logical \u2013 there\u2019s no organisational reason why you couldn\u2019t have lodged it while you were on \nPalm?---No.\n\n And then you instructed Constable Paul Harvey at 10.40 on Monday when you were in Townsville to submit it. Do \nyou agree?---That\u2019s correct. Yes.\n\n\n\n And I would suggest to you that you didn\u2019t include Mr Bramwell\u2019s allegation because you had rejected them \ncompletely out of hand as soon as you heard them and you never took them seriously?---No. That\u2019s incorrect.\n\n And you also didn\u2019t accept Ms Sibley\u2019s allegations?---No. That is incorrect.\n\n Because \u2013 the demonstration that you never took them seriously is that you didn\u2019t put them on the form 1 and you \ndidn\u2019t include the other option of a supplementary form 1 prior to the autopsy?---No. That\u2019s incorrect.\n\n That\u2019s not incorrect. You didn\u2019t do it?---No. That\u2019s correct. I didn\u2019t do it, but the form 1 was submitted with the \ninformation I had at that time when I briefed the coroner. I accept that further information could have been put into \nthat form. However, I \u2013 I hadn\u2019t put it in there \u2013 not on purpose, certainly not on purpose. It was simply a matter of \ntime, everything else going on at the same time, and when the form 1 needed to go to the coroner to get a post-\nmortem authority \u2013 and I certainly hadn\u2019t had time at that stage to update the form, and that\u2019s why it was faxed \nthrough at the time.\n\n But it was critical information to confer \u2013 convey to the person conducting the autopsy, wasn\u2019t it?---I accept that. \nYes.\n\n And it never happened?---It didn\u2019t happen. No.\n\n No?---It had always been my intention to complete a supplementary form 1. However, I didn\u2019t have an opportunity \nto do that. Yes, it should have been done. I accept that.\n\n See, I suggest to you that because it was an Aboriginal death in custody and the two allegations were made by \nAboriginal people, you just dismissed them and failed to act on them. Would you agree?---No. I do not agree.\n\n And that the allegation of the Aboriginal person assaulting the white person \u2013 that was included, wasn\u2019t it, in the \nform 1?---That was the information I had at the time. Yes.\n\n Well, the information you had at the time from at least some people was there was a scuffle?---Correct.\n\n You didn\u2019t include that, ie, a joint enterprise. You only included an allegation of assault by the deceased?---That\u2019s \ncorrect. Yes.\n\n And I would suggest to you that you deliberately failed to meet the requirements imposed on you by the OPM \nbecause of the Aboriginality of the three people involved?---I certainly included in the form 1 about the struggle, \nwhich outlines:The deceased became aggressive and punched Hurley in the side of the face. Hurley then physically \nrestrained the deceased and struggle \u2013 struggled with him to the rear door of the police station, where they both fell \nto the ground \u2013which was the information I had at the time.\n\n It was the information you had at the time you completed the form, and you lodged it two and a half days later. So it \nwas not the information you had when you lodged the form, was it?---That\u2019s correct. Yes.  The only explanation in \nthis evidence is that \u201cwith everything else going on at the time\u201d, he could not prepare a more complete Form 1. He \naccepted he should have prepared a Supplementary Form 1, and said he intended to do so. He offered no \nadequate explanation for failing to complete a Supplementary Form 1, stating only that:I didn\u2019t have an opportunity \nto do that.  Although Inspector Kitching did not expand on this statement, it appears to be a reference to the fact \nthat the CMC took over the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death on the evening of Wednesday, 24 November 2004. \n\n\n\nMr Bramwell was interviewed on 20 November 2004 and Ms Sibley was interviewed on 21 November 2004. He \ntherefore had ample opportunity to complete a Supplementary Form 1 which included the allegations made in their \nstatements.  The respondents\u2019 submissions seek to diminish the significance of DSS Kitching\u2019s conduct by pointing \nto the conclusion reached by Dr Lampe on the preliminary autopsy report that he could find no evidence that the \nuse of direct force (such as punching or stomping) caused Mulrunji\u2019s injuries. Dr Lampe did note this did not \nexclude that either or both of those two possibilities may have occurred at some time prior to Mulrunji\u2019s death. The \nrespondents also submit that the pathologist who conducted the second autopsy (Dr David Ranson) on 30 \nNovember 2004 (by which time the CMC was in charge of the investigation) had access to all the police interviews \nand had watched the cell video. They point out there is still no reference to the accounts of Mr Bramwell and Ms \nSibley. The respondents then also rely upon the findings of Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine, first, concerning the \ninconsistent accounts given by all witnesses who were present at the police station when Mulrunji was removed \nfrom the police van, and second, concerning the medical opinion before him, which was to the following effect:(a) \nnone of the medical witnesses nor any of the parties disputed Dr Ranson\u2019s rejection of the possibility that the \npunches described by Mr Bramwell (and, I infer, Ms Sibley) could have caused the fatal injuries; \n\n (b) Dr Ranson agreed with Dr Lampe that there was no evidence to suggest that the use of direct force (such as \npunching or stomping) caused the injuries; and\n\n (c) the medical experts agreed that the fractured ribs, liver lacerations and partial vein rupture likely occurred as a \nresult of a single injury, and the medical evidence suggests only a single blow rather than a number of blows.  \nIndeed, at [47], Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine made the disconnect between Mr Bramwell\u2019s allegations and the \ncause of Mulrunji\u2019s death very clear:It is not possible to make a finding that the punching by Senior Sergeant Hurley \ncaused the fatal injuries because, as the Court of Appeal said at paragraph [39] \u201c...even if Mr Bramwell\u2019s evidence \ninculpatory of Mr Hurley were to be accepted, the conclusion that the punches of which Mr Bramwell gave evidence \ncaused the rupture of the portal vein and the near-severing of the deceased\u2019s liver, was a conclusion which was not \nreasonably open to the Coroner.\u201d  I do not accept that any of these factors diminish the seriousness of DSS \nKitching\u2019s omissions. Whether or not blows struck by SS Hurley (if that occurred) caused Mulrunji\u2019s fatal injuries, \nthose actions could nevertheless be assaults and should have been the subject of a separate investigation. More \nimportantly, the respondents\u2019 submissions are made with the benefit of hindsight, which is the very perspective that \nin other aspects of this case the respondents urged the Court not to take. What, eventually, was the cause of \nMulrunji\u2019s death was the subject of a careful and exhaustive examination by Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine, \nincluding a great deal of medical evidence, but also with careful consideration given to the account of all \neyewitnesses, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. All of that evidence was subject to detailed scrutiny, including cross-\nexamination. Further examining the cause of Mulrunji\u2019s death is not the purpose of this proceeding. Rather, these \ncurrent allegations are about how the police officers went about their statutory (and non-statutory) duties in those \nfirst few days after Mulrunji\u2019s death, and whether the way they went about those duties contravened s 9 of the RDA.  \nFor that purpose, Deputy Chief Magistrate Hine\u2019s eventual conclusions are not determinative. Nor are the ultimate \nconclusions of Dr Lampe and Dr Ranson. The Court is concerned here with how the relevant QPS officers \nperformed their policing tasks during the period 19 to 22 November 2004, whether their conduct involved a \ndistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, and whether their conduct had the purpose or effect \nof nullifying or impairing human rights, as provided for by s 9. In looking at effect, it is critical in a context such as \nthis not to do so with hindsight. As the applicants submit, it is not in any event possible to rule out a different \napproach to the autopsy if complete and accurate information had been provided by DSS Kitching in a timely way. \nThat is something which can never now be known.  In my opinion, like the other features which I have identified, the \nconduct of DSS Kitching in providing information to the coroner shows, once again, a lack of impartiality in the \ninvestigation, a disregard for information provided by Aboriginal people, and a stereotypical presentation of \ninformation about an Aboriginal man who had died. The \u201ceffect\u201d to which s 9 directs attention is an effect on the \nhuman rights of the class members (which I address below), not an effect on the outcome of the coronial process.\n\nAllegations of failures to consider cultural needs  The last category of conduct during the initial part of the \ninvestigation concerns what the applicants contend was a failure to \u201cmeet the cultural needs and expectations of the \ncommunity\u201d. Included in this category are allegations about the failure of the QPS to utilise its own Cultural Advisory \n\n\n\nUnit (CAU), a failure to employ the assistance of a Cross Cultural Liaison Officer in the first week or so after \nMulrunji\u2019s death, deficiencies in the notification of next of kin and a more general allegation of \u201cfailure to take \naccount of cultural needs\u201d.  This latter allegation was scarcely developed in final submissions. Its main component \nappears to be a contention that QPS investigating officers took no reasonable steps to keep the Palm Island \ncommunity informed of the progress of the investigation, including a failure to contact community leaders and to \nconsider \u201ccultural issues\u201d. The problem for the applicants in this allegation is that they never made clear what these \n\u201ccultural issues\u201d were. I have addressed elsewhere my conclusions that the investigating officers seemed to have \nlittle appreciation of the particular and unique characteristics of the Palm Island community (including their historical \nreasons for mistrust of police), did not take any meaningful steps to engage with the local community after \nMulrunji\u2019s death, and indeed did not seem to know how to do so. All those conclusions have been reached in the \ncontext of the disregard I have found officers had for Palm Islanders, and are relevant again to some of the \napplicants\u2019 allegations about the intervening week between Mulrunji\u2019s death and the protests and fires of 26 \nNovember 2004.  Those findings notwithstanding, I do not consider the applicants have made out independent \nclaims of a contravention of s 9 by a failure to deal with cultural issues, or to engage with the community. In my \nopinion those matters are properly characterised as attitudes and behaviour of QPS officers contributing to the \nfailure to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death and the failure to communicate and \ndefuse tensions in the community in the week before the protests and fires. I turn to the other allegations in this \ncategory.  SS Dini, who gave evidence in the proceeding, did not arrive on Palm Island until around midday on 26 \nNovember 2004. Prior to this he was on leave: the respondents seemed to submit this explained the absence of a \nCCLO until that time.  In his oral evidence, Inspector Dini did not see himself as having any particular role to \nperform during the events following Mulrunji\u2019s death:Now, in the context of Palm Island, your role was not only to \nassist QPS to liaise with the community, was it; it was more extensive than that; you had to identify the needs of the \nPalm Island community?---Well, what would happen is \u2013 because I\u2019m not based on Palm Island, the police on \nPalm Island would identify if there were any issues or anything that they needed assistance with, and they would \ncontact me, and we would provide advice and support.\n\n So you didn\u2019t see your role as a proactive one to ascertain what the needs in the community were?---Well, I was \ndoing that for Townsville.\n\n But not for Palm?---Not for Palm.\n\n So you relied on the local police to feed to you what they identified as maybe specific needs?---Yes. Well, Senior \nSergeant Hurley is a very experienced officer with regards to working in Indigenous communities and probably \nknew as much as I did about Indigenous matters. So yes. If he called and asked for help, I was there to help.\n\n But if he didn\u2019t identify a particular need, then you wouldn\u2019t know what was happening?---No.  It was not suggested \nto Inspector Dini that another CCLO could have gone out to Palm Island on and from 19 November 2004. It \nappears he was the only occupant of that office in the region. He was not recalled from leave, but no witness was \nchallenged about why that was not done.  It seems to me that the lack of any proactive involvement of SS Dini \nearlier in the week is consistent with the findings I have made elsewhere about a disregard for the local community, \nand the potential effects of these events on them. As it turned out, that disregard had tragic consequences in the \nfollowing week, consequences which in my opinion could well have been preventable. Inspector Dini appeared to \nme to be a capable and experienced officer, with considerable dedication to his role as CCLO. Indeed he described \nin his evidence the proactive and substantive steps he had taken since the events of November 2004 to improve \nQPS awareness about the best ways to interact with Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities, and the \ndevelopment of closer and more respectful relationships between police and elders and community leaders in \nAboriginal communities. He described:(a) meeting with elders, the community justice group, the Mayor and the \nPalm Island Council to discuss protocols on the island, the make-up of the island and the cultural sensitivities;\n\n (b) developing a cultural appreciation project;\n\n\n\n (c) developing a community specific package (CATPRO) for QPS officers working on Palm Island;\n\n (d) establishing community police consultative groups; and\n\n (e) developing three culturally specific self-paced learning modules for QPS officers, relating to Aboriginal people \nand Torres Strait Islanders.  It may well have been the case that SS Dini could have made an active and positive \ncontribution to easing tensions on Palm Island after 19 November 2004 and during the intervening week when \ncommunity meetings were occurring. It seems to me that he, or another CCLO, could have constructively and \nempathetically worked with elders, the local Council, and those members of the community who had a great sense \nof injustice about what had happened, and he \u2013 leading a different attitude and approach by the QPS \u2013 could have \nalleviated the tensions which built up during that week. The evidence suggests there was little or no positive \nworking relationship during this time between other police officers and the island Council, or other elders. There is \nvery little evidence before the Court about what PLO Bengaroo was doing during this time (the running log for the \nPalm Island Police Station records that he was on duty between 8 am and 4 pm on 22 November 2004, but there \nis no evidence about what he may have done during that period), but it seems he may well have been lying low and \nthat he was not asked to do otherwise.  Rather than the failure to make arrangements for SS Dini, or another \nCCLO, to be present and providing assistance on Palm Island shortly after Mulrunji\u2019s death being itself a \ncontravention of s 9, in my opinion the better approach is that this failure is yet another feature of the QPS officers\u2019 \ndisregard for the local community, their (rightful) search for explanations, their need for a sense of justice and \nprobity about Mulrunji\u2019s death, and their (rightful) concern that the lives of Aboriginal people were seen as worth \nless than the lives of white people. In that disregard was a distinction, exclusion or preference from the way an \nisolated and close-knit non-Aboriginal community would have been treated if a white person from that community \nhad died in local police custody. I am satisfied adequate and sympathetic community liaison would have occurred \nin those circumstances.  The CAU was part of the Commissioner\u2019s office in Brisbane, whereas the CCLOs were \nmore regionally based. Sergeant Dini, for example, was based in Townsville. The evidence shows the only \ninvolvement of the CAU during November 2004 was as an initial conduit for rather inaccurate and incomplete \ninformation about Mulrunji\u2019s death. The emails in evidence from 19 November 2004 assert that Mulrunji was found \nto be \u201cill\u201d; they note he was arrested for being a public nuisance and was intoxicated; they note that he punched SS \nHurley, but do not note any other violence; they say nothing about the fall; they note Mulrunji\u2019s next of kin were not \n(at 12.30 pm) identified or advised of the death (although, as I note at [242]-[245] above, it appears Ms Twaddle \nmay have been to the police station asking about Mulrunji). A file note made by the relevant CAU officer also \nrecorded that a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d was \u201cbeing implemented for policing Palm Island in event of an increase in \npublic disorder\u201d. The emails note that a \u201csignificant event message\u201d would be sent, and would be copied to the \nCAU. What that message said, and what its purpose was, were not the subject of any evidence.  Like the \u201ccultural \nissues\u201d allegation, this allegation made by the applicants was never given any real content. No evidence was led \nabout the role and functions of the CAU. No evidence was led about what they might have been expected to \nprovide by way of assistance. That is not to suggest there was no role for them, but the evidence does not reveal \nwhat it could have been. The applicants have not discharged their burden in relation to any of the allegations in this \ncategory.\n\nDelay in notification of the next of kin  I have set out at [182] above the provision of the OPM (s 16.24.3(vi)) which \ndeals with the notification of the next of kin where there has been a death in custody, but for ease of reference I will \nset it out again:Where responsibility for the investigation of a death in custody or in police company reverts to a \ncommissioned officer pursuant to s. 1.17 ... that commissioned officer should, as part of the investigation:\n\n ...\n\n\n\n (vi) immediately arrange for the next of kin or person previously nominated by the deceased to be notified. Cultural \ninterests of the person being notified should be respected by using the cross cultural liaison officer, if practicable. \nWhere the deceased is an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander and there is a delay or inability to notify the next of \nkin, efforts to notify the next of kin should be recorded;  This is an example of an allegation where the applicants \napproached the \u201cduties\u201d they contended fell on the QPS officers with considerable strictness, seeing any deviation \nfrom the OPM as evidence of a contravention of s 9. As I have set out at [253] above, DI Webber performed the \nnotification task, with Mr Marpoondin and Sergeant Leafe. Ms Andrea Sailor gave evidence she had been asked to \ngo, but felt she could not as she had had a brother die in custody and found it too upsetting and confronting. DI \nWebber and Mr Marpoondin saw Ms Twaddle, Mulrunji\u2019s partner, first at about 3.40 pm in the afternoon, then went \nto see Mulrunji\u2019s mother after that.  The applicants\u2019 basic contention was that the delay in notifying the next of kin \nwas a breach of the duty to \u201cimmediately arrange\u201d notification, and that the requirement of the OPM for DI Webber \n(as the commissioned officer responsible for the investigation) to \u201carrange\u201d notification did not mean he had to \nperform the notification task himself.  Mrs Agnes Wotton confirmed that, earlier in the afternoon, Ms Twaddle had \ngone down to the police station to see what had happened to Mulrunji. Read in conjunction with DI Webber\u2019s \nevidence and SS Hurley\u2019s record of interview, it appears that Ms Twaddle was met by SS Hurley himself at the \nstation and, upon her asking about Mulrunji, she was told she should go home. As I have noted at [242]-[245] \nabove, there are gaps in the evidence about when Ms Twaddle went to the police station, and what SS Hurley told \nher. There are findings in the CMC Report that Ms Twaddle went to the station twice, at 11.30 am and 1 pm. There \nwas no evidence to that effect in this proceeding. SS Hurley mentioned in his record of interview that Ms Twaddle \ncame to the station and that he did not tell her anything. The most that can be said is that Ms Twaddle did go to the \npolice station looking for her partner at some stage on that day, probably after he was dead; she encountered SS \nHurley, who chose to say nothing about his death; and she had no choice but to simply go home and wait.  DI \nWebber\u2019s evidence was that he firmly believed it was his responsibility to notify the next of kin, so that is why he \nexplained it was not done until mid-afternoon. He maintained in his evidence that mid-afternoon was \u201cas soon as \npracticable\u201d for him to do the notification, given his other responsibilities after arriving on Palm Island. I see nothing \nunreasonable, disrespectful, or insensitive, in his approach to this issue. As the OPM suggested, DI Webber took \nMr Marpoondin, an ATSILS officer and a local Palm Island man, as someone who could provide cultural support. \nHe had wanted also to take Ms Sailor.  The time in which next of kin should be notified of the death of a family \nmember may be, reasonably, affected by any number of circumstances. No comparative evidence was led to inform \nassessment of the applicants\u2019 submissions that notifying the next of kin about three and a half hours after a death in \ncustody was outside the reasonable parameters of what could be expected in similar circumstances. There was no \nevidence at all about what had occurred in similar situations prior to this death in custody. Although DI Webber \nconceded in cross-examination that things could have been done differently, and he could have used another local \nofficer to notify the family sooner, I accept his evidence that he gave careful consideration to the most appropriate \nway for the notification to occur and, reasonably, determined that he should do it personally.  I have no evidence \nfrom Ms Twaddle herself on this allegation, nor from any other member of Mulrunji\u2019s family. Thus, there is no \nevidence before me whether his own family felt they had been neglected, disrespected or sidelined. There is no \nevidence they considered they were not notified as soon as reasonably practicable.  There was hardly any evidence \nabout what seemed to me to be the more concerning aspect of the factual circumstances giving rise to this \nallegation: namely, SS Hurley\u2019s reaction when Ms Twaddle turned up at the police station during the late morning \nor early afternoon, having apparently heard something may have happened. The bare facts as they emerge on the \nevidence suggest she was very poorly treated by SS Hurley, and possibly deliberately misled. However there is \nsimply not enough evidence to make any findings in relation to s 9 about this incident and it is not, in any event, put \nforward by the applicants as part of their case on s 9. This conduct could not, in any event, have nullified or \nimpaired the human rights of the group members (as opposed to Ms Twaddle personally).  The applicants make \nsome submissions about whether DI Webber \u201cmisread\u201d the policy in s 16.24.3(vi), but in my opinion this submission \nis beside the point. This is not an administrative law case or a disciplinary inquiry, and these kinds of arguments \nfrom the applicants (which were numerous) were distractions from the central issues arising under s 9.\n\nConclusions on the investigation claims  By reference to the applicants\u2019 final submissions at [254]-[276], and the \napplicants\u2019 summary submissions at [5]-[7], read with the third further amended statement of claim at [244]-[250], I \nam satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the following conduct constituted acts involving distinctions based \non race for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA. As I have noted, I consider that a fair reading of the applicants\u2019 \n\n\n\npleadings and submissions reveals that the applicants put their allegations in a cumulative as well as an individual \nway.  First, the inappropriate and partial treatment of SS Hurley by the investigating officers DI Webber, DSS \nKitching and Inspector Williams constituted by the failure to treat SS Hurley as a suspect and allowing him to \ncontinue to perform policing duties on Palm Island. SS Hurley\u2019s conduct in his interactions with the investigating \nofficers and continued performance of policing duties should be viewed as part of those acts. The acts involved \ndistinctions \u2013 namely a disregard of usual policing standards of independence and impartiality, and a departure \nfrom the usual levels of objectivity brought by police officers to an investigation. These distinctions were based on \nrace. That is because those officers in charge of this investigation did not care what the local Aboriginal community \napprehended or thought about their investigation; they had a sense of impunity because they were operating in a \nwholly Aboriginal community and their partiality was because a white police officer was being accused of causing \nthe death in custody of an Aboriginal man. The evidence about allowing SS Hurley to collect them from the airport, \nand the dinner at his residence, are supportive of the conclusions I have reached. So too is the evidence about the \nfailure to interview Constable Steadman.  Second, the treatment by DI Webber and DSS Kitching of Aboriginal \nwitnesses, in particular PLO Bengaroo, Roy Bramwell and Penny Sibley. These acts involved a distinction \u2013 namely \nthe treatment, at an early stage of the investigation, of these people as less reliable and material witnesses. This \ndistinction was based on race, because the officers involved were disposed to disregard or downplay witness \naccounts given by local Palm Island people, especially where those accounts were adverse to a white police \nofficer. The evidence is unclear about the role played by Inspector Williams in the decision-making about what \nweight to give to the information provided by Aboriginal witnesses, although he participated in the video re-\nenactments. Accordingly, I make no finding about Inspector Williams\u2019 conduct.  Third, the conduct of DSS Kitching \nin submitting the autopsy report to the Coroner with the descriptions he gave of Mulrunji prior to his death, and his \nfailure to include the allegations of assault made by Roy Bramwell and Penny Sibley. These acts involved \ndistinctions \u2013 namely a disregard of usual policing standards of independence and impartiality, and a departure \nfrom the usual levels of objectivity brought by police officers to an investigation. These distinctions were based on \nrace, because stereotypical assumptions were made about what might have might have caused an Aboriginal man \nto die (substances he could have ingested). It was also because DSS Kitching did not care what the local Aboriginal \ncommunity apprehended or thought about the investigation; he had a sense of impunity because he was operating \nin a wholly Aboriginal community and his partiality in the information he provided was because a white police officer \nwas being accused of causing the death in custody of an Aboriginal man.  The investigation as conducted by the \nQPS until the time the CMC took over was not, in fact, impartial. This was not just a matter of appearance. Despite \nthe approach required of them by the PSA Act, the OPM and the general law, the officers were not interested, \nduring this early part of the investigation, in preserving public confidence on Palm Island, nor in preserving trust in \nthe integrity and impartiality of the QPS investigation. The officers did not turn their minds to the best interests of the \nPalm Island community, and that was not because they saw any conflict between the best interests of that \ncommunity and the best interests of the broader \u201ccommunity of Queensland\u201d. They were not interested in what \npeople on Palm Island thought about what they were doing. They did not see their role as supporting or assisting \nthe community to come to terms with what had happened, or to be fully informed about what had happened. They \nwere not interested in addressing the fear and mistrust of the police identified by the Queensland government\u2019s \n1994 review of policing in Aboriginal communities. They were interested in a style of investigation which treated \npersons in the Palm Island community as little more than sources of information \u2013 yet, sources that were regarded \nas less reliable than other police officers or what could be independently observed. All this occurred because the \nofficers were operating in an Aboriginal community, and one where domination of Aboriginal people by white \nauthorities was the historical norm. In this community, white police officers were not, and did not see themselves, \nas accountable to the Aboriginal members of that community, nor as required to work in partnership with that \ncommunity. Policing was conducted very differently in that community than in non-Aboriginal communities. As for \nconducting themselves without \u201cfear or favour\u201d, to use the respondents\u2019 expression, there was clear favour given to \nthe views and interests of white police officers on the island, with no real respect or consideration paid to the \njustifiable concern and bewilderment amongst Palm Islanders about how Mulrunji could have died so soon after \nbeing taken into custody.  I turn now to the second group of conduct relied on by the applicants.\n\nSecond category: the police conduct during the \u2018intervening week\u2019 after Mulrunji\u2019s death and prior to the protests \nand fires of 26 November 2004    Five categories of conduct are impugned by the applicants under this heading. \nThey are: the failure to suspend SS Hurley from duty; failures to take culturally appropriate policing measures; \n\n\n\nfailures to liaise with the community and address its concerns; deployment of police without adequate cross-\ncultural skills; and failures regarding the autopsy report.\n\nFailure to suspend SS Hurley  A/AC Wall had determined to remove SS Hurley from his post at some time during \nMonday 22 November 2004. There is no direct evidence about how this happened \u2013 this is one of the many \nexamples of evidence that one might naturally expect to be led by the respondents, but was not. In their final \nsubmissions, the respondents conceded that it was \u201creasonable to infer SS Hurley was stood down from his \nposition as a result\u201d of the confrontation between SS Hurley and certain residents of Palm Island described at \n[1044]-[1046] below. Why evidence to confirm that could not have been led is difficult to understand.  The failure to \nsuspend and remove SS Hurley is in substance a challenge to the same conduct of the investigating officers that I \nhave already found involved distinctions based on race. It flows directly from the failure to treat SS Hurley as a \nsuspect. The lack of impartiality in the investigation, and the lack of care about the concerns of the local Palm \nIsland community, led the investigating officers to ignore the obvious impropriety and conflict of interest in having \nSS Hurley remain in uniform and on duty on the island. The QPS running log records SS Hurley as having a \u201crest \nday\u201d on 22 November 2004, but it also records him as giving a briefing to officers arriving on the island between 3 \npm and 4 pm. Again, that DI Webber and DSS Kitching had considered it appropriate for SS Hurley to remain on \nduty, and therefore to perform functions such as providing those officers with such a briefing, demonstrates the \nextent of their partiality and how determined they were to ignore the perception and the reality of what had occurred \non Palm Island over the preceding 72 hours.  Community members had raised concerns with the police about SS \nHurley\u2019s role in the events that led to Mulrunji\u2019s death from the day Mulrunji died. Mr Zacchias Sam gave evidence \nthat, on 19 November 2004, the Council went to the police station and met SS Hurley and some other officers. This \nwas his evidence about the meeting:And what was talked about at that meeting?---Well, Chris just \u2013 just said that \nhe \u2013 he \u2013 he \u2013 he \u2013 he didn\u2019t kill him or he didn\u2019t mean to hurt him or anything like that, really, and that was more or \nless all he was saying, all he kept saying. We just sort of left it at that.\n\n And so were you satisfied with that reply?---Well, not \u2013 not \u2013 not really. We really wanted to find out what really \nhappened. No one \u2013 you know, because the community wanted to know, and the family of Mulrunji wanted to know \ntoo. So we didn\u2019t really have an answer for anyone.  Whether or not DI Webber and DSS Kitching knew about that \nmeeting, it should have been immediately apparent that people in the community would want to know how Mulrunji \ndied and whether SS Hurley was responsible. It should have been apparent that the community wanted to know if \nany police officer had committed any criminal offences in relation to Mulrunji\u2019s death. In those circumstances, it was \nclearly inappropriate for SS Hurley to remain on duty.  Nevertheless, no decision was taken by DI Webber and DSS \nKitching to remove SS Hurley from the island and the evidence is that he was visibly and actively on duty on 22 \nNovember 2004. Ms Cecilia Wotton gave evidence that on the morning of 22 November 2004, in response to a call \nshe had made to police concerning a domestic violence incident occurring across the road from her, she saw SS \nHurley, DS Robinson, PLO Bengaroo and two other police officers respond to the call. I accept Ms Wotton\u2019s \nevidence as to her observations. It takes only a little imagination to understand how this must have looked to local \npeople on Palm Island: it was as if nothing had happened on the previous Friday.  Both DI Webber and Inspector \nKitching gave evidence that it did not cross their minds that SS Hurley should not be on duty although DI Webber \nconceded that \u201cperhaps\u201d it would have been sensitive to community needs for SS Hurley to have been removed \nfrom the island, but he did not turn his mind to the issue. Particularly given Mr Bramwell\u2019s allegations, and even \nonce they had heard SS Hurley\u2019s own account, I find this evidence extraordinary. It is inexplicable, other than by a \ndisregard for what the local community thought and a discounting of the sense of grief, outrage and injustice being \nfelt in that community. Having SS Hurley remain on the island and on duty was for the QPS to set its face squarely \nagainst an understandable and entirely predictable reaction of a community like Palm Island, which had been so \nbadly oppressed in the past by authorities (including police), because of the race of people comprising the \ncommunity.  The failure to remove SS Hurley led to a community meeting on the morning of Monday, 22 November \n2004, where a resolution was passed calling for his removal. Mr Wotton placed the meeting at approximately 11 am \nand I accept that evidence. That was the meeting at which Mr Bramwell spoke, recounting what he said he had \nseen in the police station. There is ample evidence of the antagonism towards SS Hurley that existed by this stage. \nTo jump ahead somewhat, by the time SS Whyte arrived that afternoon (to replace SS Hurley as Officer in Charge) \nhe clearly understood the community had demanded that SS Hurley be removed from the island. In evidence, \n\n\n\nInspector Whyte also conceded that at the community meeting which he attended on the Monday afternoon, it was \n\u201carticulated that the community wanted Hurley removed and charged\u201d. He also agreed that he came to learn while \nhe was on Palm Island that there was a perception within the community that SS Hurley would not be held to \naccount for what had happened to Mulrunji.  On Tuesday, 23 November 2004, Mayor Erykah Kyle gave an \ninterview to Mr Flynn from Channel 10, the recording of which was in evidence. As I noted earlier, Ms Kyle was not \nwell enough to given evidence in this proceeding, although her daughter Andrea Sailor did give evidence. The \nrespondents did not dispute the authenticity of the video recording, nor challenge its admission. In that interview, \nMs Kyle describes the anger at the community meeting on the Monday morning about SS Hurley, and describes the \nresolution passed which called on the QPS to have him leave the island by the end of the day.  The video \nrecordings of that meeting, and of some of the other community meetings during that week, do show a level of \nanger in some people, but it is controlled. The speakers at the meetings are articulate, and genuinely expressing \nhigh degrees of frustration and outrage not only at Mulrunji\u2019s death, but at the fact of yet another young Aboriginal \nman dying in custody, and (from their perspective) yet further disregard, lack of concern, and \u201ccover-up\u201d from the \npolice, the authorities and the government of the day.  Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence was that during the morning public \nmeeting he had seen a police vehicle containing SS Hurley, DS Robinson, PLO Bengaroo, and two other police \nofficers drive into the police station with a local resident named Tony Palmer locked in the cage at the back of the \nvehicle. That any QPS officer \u2013 including SS Hurley himself \u2013 could possibly have considered it appropriate that SS \nHurley should be actively involved in arresting another Aboriginal man and bringing him in custody into the police \nstation after what had happened on Friday, and during the active conduct of an investigation into those events, is \nextraordinary. It is explained, in my opinion, by the level of impunity SS Hurley felt, and the investigating QPS \nofficers shared.  Approximately 150 to 200 people then surrounded the police station and began shouting abuse at \nthe police in response to cries from Mr Palmer that he was \u201cgoing to be the next one\u201d. The \u201cnext one\u201d was plainly a \nreference to Mr Palmer suffering the same fate as Mulrunji if placed in the police lock-up. There was then a \nconfrontation between members of this crowd (including Mr Wotton) and SS Hurley. Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence was:we \nobserved -- the police paddy-wagon at the time was one of the old paddy-wagons where you could see inside, and \nit had \u2013 they had a local person in the back, and we could recognise his voice, and we actually saw him, and he \nactually sang out his name. He said, \u201cGet me out of here. Otherwise I\u2019m going to be the next one,\u201d and that really \nriled a lot of people up. People were starting to sing out abuse towards the police and stuff, and so they pulled up. I \nwalked in, halfway in through the garage, and Chris Hurley jumped out of the vehicle, and others, and I said, \u201cChris, \ncould you come out here and explain what happened on Friday, because the community wants to know what \nhappened.\u201d So he walked out, and people are upset and then Tony Palmer was going off in the back of the police \ncar, kicking in the doors and everything, singing out, \u201cLet me out of here. Let me out of here. Otherwise I\u2019m going to \nbe the next one. You\u2019re going to find me dead.\u201d So we, sort of, went \u2013 as you go out of the police station, we \nwalked to the left. The crowd \u2013 Chris was right beside me, and other officers were ..... Robinson and all others were \npretty close. We were all amongst each other. I think the crowd \u2013 probably 150 to 200. Could be less; could be \nmore. Anyway, I said, \u201cChris, can you now please explain?\u201d and he said, \u201cWhat? Two years of service not good \nenough for you people?\u201d and that really fired them off again, abuse and stuff, and in one of those things I heard my \nbrother-in-law, David Bulsey, say, \u201cLloyd, you know what happened. You seen what happened. Tell the truth.\u201d So I \nlooked at the people and I said, \u201cNow, here\u2019s your answer. You heard what he said,\u201d and I\u2019m actually this close to \nhim. \u201cYou heard what he said. You either do something to this man, or walk away, because I\u2019m walking away.\u201d So \nat the same time, I think through \u2013 just before that, I observed Darren Robinson walk back into the police station, \nand my thoughts were, \u201cHere they go. He\u2019s going to call reinforcements.\u201d So I walked away. Everyone started to \nwalk away. Tony was still going on.  I see no reason not to accept Mr Wotton\u2019s account of these events. No \nevidence was called to contradict it from SS Hurley or DS Robinson, or any other police officers present on Palm \nIsland that morning. In cross-examination, his account was not seriously challenged. Although there were aspects \nof Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence I found less reliable, his account of what happened during these key meetings and \nconfrontations was, I found, based on a real recollection, although I accept he was very likely paraphrasing what \nwas said.  It is notable that despite this being an encounter between a large group of local people who were \nfrustrated and angry about Mulrunji\u2019s death and were talking of a cover-up, on the evidence no QPS officer sought \nto engage with this crowd. No QPS officer took this as a face-to-face opportunity to express sorrow, or regret, that a \nyoung member of the community had died. No QPS officer took this as an opportunity to reassure the community \nthat if Mulrunji did not die from natural causes, that would be discovered and action taken against those \nresponsible. No QPS officer spoke about the law being enforced to the benefit of the Palm Island community: \n\n\n\ninstead the use of the law on the island at this time, and the show of force which was building, was against the \ncommunity and against its interests.  Further, the situation should not have come to a group of local people having \nto confront QPS officers with the impropriety of SS Hurley remaining the Officer in Charge on Palm Island. Those \nofficers responsible for the investigation should have been well aware of how inappropriate it was. DS Robinson, \nfamiliar as he was with Palm Island, should have readily recognised that SS Hurley should have left as soon as he \nhad been interviewed on the Friday. As for SS Hurley himself, his reaction as recalled in evidence by Mr Wotton is \nrevealing, and consistent with the attitude taken by the QPS: no Aboriginal person was going to impugn him.  The \nfailure to suspend SS Hurley and remove him from the island very shortly after the events on Friday (and, at least, \nafter his interviews had been concluded) was in my opinion an act (that is, an omission) involving a distinction \nbased on race. SS Hurley was the person responsible for the physical manhandling of a healthy, active man, taken \ninto custody with no afflictions or injuries, who died less than an hour later. The obvious, prudent, rational and \nimpartial course would have been to remove that person from any official duties and to ensure he left what was, on \nany view, a close-knit community expressing high levels of discontent and outrage at what had happened.  That \ncourse did not occur because, as I have found, QPS officers \u2013 especially those tasked with the investigation, but \nalso SS Hurley himself as the officer still in charge on Palm Island \u2013 had no regard whatsoever for the reaction of \nthe community, for how this event affected them, or for their perceptions of how the rule of law would operate in \nthose circumstances. That finding applies especially to DI Webber, DS Robinson and DSS Kitching. Clearly, it \napplies with greater force to SS Hurley himself, who was still the Officer in Charge of Palm Island. His sense of \nprofessional responsibility to the community rather than to himself, and his adherence to the values set out in s 2.3 \nof the PSA and the QPS Code of Conduct, entirely failed him.  None of these officers cared what Palm Islanders \nthought, how outraged they were, or about their sense of injustice, although through the community meetings and \ncommunity gatherings those feelings were on public display. They apparently paid no regard to the perceptions of \nMulrunji\u2019s extended family. I am satisfied those QPS officers would have cared if these events had occurred \nelsewhere, in a non-Aboriginal community \u2013 if for no other reason than that QPS officers would have well and truly \nunderstood that in a less invisible and powerless community they would have been held to account more quickly for \nwhat was occurring. Yet, on Palm Island \u2013 seen as a disaffected, remote and troublesome place \u2013 there was a \nsense of impunity at work. No complaints by groups of Aboriginal people \u2013 stereotyped as disaffected, \ndisconnected, transient, uneducated, drunken, violent, unworthy and unimportant \u2013 would be allowed to have any \neffect on how the white QPS officers would conduct themselves. Those white QPS officers saw themselves as \ncharged to impose law and order on Palm Islanders, from the outside. This was not an attitude of community \nprotection, or community service. It was the imposition, by force, of norms of behaviour that white police officers \nconsidered should be observed. I find SS Hurley was, until the afternoon of 22 November 2004, at the centre of that \nattitude. It shows the extent of his own sense of impunity and lack of judgement that he did not seek to leave the \nisland voluntarily.\n\nFailures to communicate with the community and defuse tensions  There are three sets of allegations which I \nconsider can be grouped under this heading: failures to take culturally appropriate policing measures; failures to \nliaise with the community and address its concerns; and deployment of police without adequate cross-cultural \nskills. The applicants\u2019 submissions attempt to separate them out, somewhat artificially in my opinion.  The \nrespondents have agreed as a fact in this case that QPS officers situated on Palm Island knew there was a feeling \nof anger held by some residents over Mulrunji\u2019s death in custody, and a perception by some residents that SS \nHurley was not being held to account for his death. The respondents also appear to accept that, because about \n150-200 people were present at the meeting on 22 November 2004, \u201cmost if not all of those present were aware \nthat that perception was being voiced\u201d.  They accept that DS Robinson, Inspector Richardson and SS Whyte \nattended the afternoon meeting on 22 November 2004 and some Palm Island community members expressed their \ndissatisfaction to those three officers about Mulrunji\u2019s death. The police running log records the following:WOTTON \nvocal and protesting criminal actions of police relating to death of Cameron DOOMADGEE. WOTTON demanding \nwith support of persons present that S/Sgt. HURLEY be arrested and in custody. WOTTON is demanding and with \nthe support of the persons present that S/Sgt. HURLEY be taken off the island immediately.  They also accept that \nSS Bennett \u201cobserved\u201d a meeting mid-morning on 23 November 2004. He provided situation reports to SS Whyte. \nThere is video footage in evidence of this meeting. Various community members take a microphone and express \ndissatisfaction and frustration about why Mulrunji was arrested and about what happened after that, saying also that \nthey feel the Police Commissioner and Police Minister have not engaged with the community and have neglected \n\n\n\nPalm Island. Those people also express frustration at the lack of real communication and information from the QPS \nabout the investigation and autopsy, and their opposition to Palm Island people being perceived as violent.  The \nrespondents led little evidence about the response and reaction of QPS officers to the public sentiments being \nexpressed. Inspector Whyte was asked about meetings with Mayor Kyle and other Council members. He stated \nthere were three meetings \u2013 one on 24 November 2004 and two on 25 November 2004, one in the morning and \nanother in the afternoon. Inspector Whyte gave no evidence about what transpired at those meetings. The police \nlog in evidence gives a brief description of each of the three meetings, all of which Inspector Richardson and SS \nWhyte attended. An entry at 3 pm on 24 November 2004 reads:Meeting with Chairperson Erica Kyle re issues \npresently effecting [sic] the stability on the Island. Arranged to meet daily am and discuss issues which occur \novernight. Council officer advised no electronic security available at Canteen tonight as Chubb were reluctant to \nattend to fix the system due to problems on the island.  An entry at 10.30 am on 25 November 2004 reads:Meeting\n\n Held with Erica Kyle and Denise Geia at the Palm Island Council Chambers. Current situation discussed. Advice \nlater received from Geia that a number of male persons have volunteered to assist with prevention of rock throwing \nactivities tonight.  An entry at 3.30 pm on 25 November 2004 reads:MEETING\n\n Requested to attend Council Chambers in relation to an issue with police. Further meeting had with Erica Kyle and \nDenise Geia where they stated that an issue has arisen this morning over the actions of a police officer. They \nintroduced use to a [redacted] and [redacted] 16yrs and [redacted] 16 Yrs. It was explained to police that they \ndidn\u2019t like the way that a uniformed officer spoke to juveniles this morning at their residence. The complainant \nstated that she would be happy for RICHARDSON and WHYTE to look further into the matter, moreover she would \nbe happy with an apology from the officer involved.\n\n The Police Officer was spoken to in relation to this matter and he provided a different version of events. Attempts \nmade by S/Sgt Whyte to arrange another meeting. Further contact made with Denise Geia to ascertain whether the \ncomplainant was happy to meet personally with the police officer and hear his version of events in the company of \nsenior police and Erica Kyle. Geia to contact S/Sgt Whyte within the hour.  The police log records a further attempt \nby SS Whyte to contact Ms Geia in relation to this complaint approximately two hours after the meeting, but it does \nnot record any resolution of the complaint.  The principal focus of these discussions, such as they were, was on \ncontrolling lawless behaviour. The entries in the police log for this period show, even in relation to the behaviour of \nindividual Palm Islanders, an intensity of policing that I doubt applied in non-Aboriginal communities. The arrest of \nMulrunji provides another example.  From the evidence before me, while control of unlawful behaviour was an \nimportant function for QPS officers on Palm Island, as in any other community, the particular circumstances on \nPalm Island at this time required a more sophisticated and multi-faceted response. The OPM contemplated such a \nresponse. It did not occur.  That frustration, anger, a sense of injustice and being kept in the dark were pervasive \nsentiments on the island during this week was confirmed by several of the applicants\u2019 witnesses, including Mrs \nAgnes Wotton, William Blackman Senior, William Blackman Junior, John Clumpoint, Collette Wotton, Zacchias Sam \nand Mr Wotton. As the applicants submitted, a theme throughout this evidence was that people wanted \u201canswers\u201d, \nin respect of how and why Mulrunji had died and whether the police would be held to account.  Further, from some \nof these witnesses, the link with the treatment of Aboriginal people generally, and in particular the history of Palm \nIsland, was most apparent. These are not extraneous matters, or footnotes. They are the lived experiences of the \ncommunity which was in November 2004 trying to come to terms with a death in custody of one of their family and \nfriends, a person many had known since childhood. Although it is lengthy, I propose to set out the evidence of \nWilliam Blackman Senior, which not only captures the feeling about Mulrunji\u2019s death, but also places it in the \ncontext of the life experiences of the people who were affected by it.And can you tell the judge what people were \nsaying at the meetings?---Well, they were asking \u2013 they were asking the question now. You know, we needed \nanswers. Who was \u2013 who was going to answer to us and the family and the community and the friends and the \nfamily of how he died and why he died and, you know, who\u2019s responsible and what\u2019s going to \u2013 what\u2019s going to be \nthe outcome? Nothing. Everything fell on deaf ears.\n\n\n\n And were there any questions being asked about Senior Sergeant Hurley?---Yes.\n\n What sort of questions?---We wanted him to answer of how \u2013 how Cameron died. And even the PLO that was with \nhim at the time.\n\n Was that Mr Bengaroo?---Yes, Bengaroo.\n\n And did Mr Bengaroo come to any of the meetings?---I don\u2019t recall seeing him.\n\n He didn\u2019t speak at any of the meetings?---No\n\n And did you see any of the investigation team on the island?---I didn\u2019t know who was investigating, yes. I don\u2019t \nknow if they were plain clothes, had uniforms on, or what, because I \u2013 I\u2019m not really a person to look at their face \nand, you know, to say \u201cThis \u2013 this is\u201d, just, \u201cI remember him, but no. I\u2019m not good at that, because if they come over \nto investigate, I\u2019m taking notice of it, because I know there\u2019s going to be a cover up. So I\u2019m \u2013 actually I\u2019m \u2013 yes, \ndon\u2019t look at names, you know, not good at names or faces. I just know it\u2019s going to be a cover up. You know, \ndoesn\u2019t matter who they\u2019re bringing to investigate it.\n\n And why did you think there was going to be a cover up?---Because look at our history, the black people of this \ncountry. Look at our history of \u2013 you know, of European invasion, or what my grandparents \u2013 you know, not only my \nfamily, but a lot of other Aboriginal people went through.\n\n And were your grandparents on Palm Island?---Were they? Sorry.\n\n Were your grandparents on Palm Island?---Yes, my grandfather, not originally from here. He got brought from \nanother country, and they all got sent here for \u2013 yes, taken off their country.\n\n And do you know when that was, when your grandfather came here?---Yes.\n\n When was that?---1918, after the Bwgcolman mission settlement destroyed by a cyclone.\n\n And your grandmother, was she here?---I think she was here, yes. She would\u2019ve came later on when they had \ndormitories and everything set up here, and everything.\n\n And both your parents were from here?---No.\n\n So one of them was. Did your grandparents stay on the island?---Yes. Well, they were under the Act. They were \u2013 \nthey were under the white man\u2019s Act to stay here, yes, so from their country they got sent here, to stay here.\n\n They weren\u2019t allowed to leave then?---No, they wasn\u2019t allowed to leave.\n\n And what about your parents?---My mum, well, she \u2013 she was \u2013 I think she was born \u2013 she was born here, 1943, \njust after the war.\n\n And was your father born here too?---No, he was born at Winton.\n\n\n\n I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t catch that?---Winton. He was born at Winton up here, west.\n\n But you used to come here as a child?---Yes. Not with my \u2013 my dad, my original dad, but my mum and her partner, \nmy stepdad, we used to come over, because my mum was born here and she could\u2019ve grew up living here with her \nfather, her grandfather.\n\n And on the Friday after Cameron died, the following Friday, were you at the meeting in the mall when Mayor Kyle \nspoke?---Yes.\n\n And you heard what she said?---Yes.\n\n And how did that make you feel \u2013 sorry. Go back a step. Do you remember what she said?---Well, I remember her \nreading the autopsy report, and how he \u2013 the damage of \u2013 yes, of \u2013 of how he died.\n\n Right. And how did you feel about that?---Shattered, you know. My mind was gone. We were \u2013 all of our minds \nwere gone, because we wanted answers, you know. You can\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t even get those injuries falling from a \u2013 \nyou know, from that high, so how could that happen just from a fall on a step?\n\n But there were no - - -?---We wanted answers. Yes, we wanted answers. Everyone was, you know \u2013 the \ncommunity was angry about it.  No QPS witness demonstrated any semblance of understanding about these \nissues. Nor did any understanding of these matters emerge from the contemporaneous video evidence, or the \ndocumentary evidence. There was no sense that any QPS officer was concerned to try to understand the people he \nor she was responsible for serving on Palm Island, and why the particular injustices and subjugation in the history \nof people on Palm Island would incline that community to mistrust of police, and to a heightened sense of injustice, \noppression and discrimination, despite those characteristics being clearly expressed in the QPS review of policing \nAboriginal communities which I have extracted at [138] above. Perhaps some QPS officers on Palm Island during \nthese events, or involved in these events from Townsville, did possess that kind of understanding. I am not \ndiscounting that possibility. Since he was on the organising committee of the QPS review in 1994, one might \nspeculate Inspector Strohfeldt had such an understanding. However, there was no evidence of any such \nunderstanding before the Court. That, it seems to me, may be one of the consequences of the forensic choices \nmade by the respondents in which police officers they chose to call.  One only needs to spend time watching the \ncontemporaneous video recordings of the community meetings, beginning on 22 November 2004 and going \nthrough to 26 November 2004, to see that \u201canger\u201d is far from the only emotion and reaction on display. There is \ngrief, there is sadness and disbelief, there is frustration, there is outrage, there is a palpable sense of injustice. The \nsense of disbelief should be emphasised \u2013 it is apparent in the video recording that people at the meeting on 26 \nNovember 2004 (when Mayor Kyle announced the autopsy result) are calling out with observations (in my opinion \nrational and substantive ones) that call into question how Mulrunji could have died so quickly after being taken into \ncustody following an \u201caccident\u201d (Mayor Kyle\u2019s term) from a \u201cfall\u201d (also her term).  A likely explanation for QPS \nofficers being less aware, or unaware, of the depth and intensity of the grief, frustration and sense of injustice in the \ncommunity lies in one of the facts I have found to lead to a contravention of s 9: QPS officers did not engage with \nthe community very much at all.  QPS officers were not key participants in the community meetings and, where they \ndid participate, their attitudes were condescending and rigid. As I have found, the evidence about their interactions \nwith the Council shows a singular focus on prevention of lawlessness by extra security measures. QPS officers \nwere not intent on working with the Palm Island community through this tragedy: they saw the community as their \nopponents, or as the perpetrators of lawlessness who needed to be subjugated. I find the attitude of QPS officers \nsuch as DI Webber, Inspector Richardson, and SS Whyte was that community protests were unjustified, and were \nrepresentative of a tendency to lawlessness that needed to be controlled. The public statements of Inspector \nRichardson clearly express the view that the community should passively and quietly wait. That attitude was both \nunrealistic and patronising. When the protests continued and escalated, the QPS quickly resorted to a battle \nmentality. All of this, in my opinion, occurred very much by reference to the fact that Palm Island was an Aboriginal \n\n\n\ncommunity.  The attitudes of Inspector Richardson and SS Whyte during this week, as revealed by both the oral \nevidence before me and the documentary and video evidence from the time, are consistent with the findings I have \nmade.  As to Inspector Richardson, the principal evidence available about his attitude during this week, and to his \nresponsibilities on Palm Island generally, is what he said during two media interviews to which I have referred at \n[306], [752] and [769] and above. He was not called as a witness by the respondents, so there was no opportunity \nfor the Court to understand, from him, why he might have made the remarks he did. All the Court has is what he \nsaid, and evidence about its context. The applicants submit that in those interviews:he derided the community\u2019s \nconcerns regarding Mulrunji\u2019s death as \u201crumours\u201d and \u201cnot factual\u201d, he made repeated calls for the community to \u201csit \nback and wait\u201d for more information and he remarked that the community \u201ccan ask their questions, when they get all \nthe facts\u201d. The Applicants submit that these remarks indicate a patronising and insensitive approach to the deeply \nfelt grief and anger within the community and denigrates the community because it is Aboriginal.  I have watched \nthe interviews several times. There is some force in the applicants\u2019 submission. Remarks like that from the police \nofficer in charge of policing on Palm Island could only have inflamed tensions. They conveyed to the local people \nthat QPS officers were disinterested in what this death had done to their community, and in why they might have a \nsense of injustice. They were going about their policing tasks without any real regard to the circumstances in which \nthey were working.  I have set out my impressions about Inspector Whyte earlier in these reasons. They are not \nfavourable. In my opinion Inspector Whyte was simply not capable of adopting the kind of culturally sensitive \napproach required during this week. He appeared to have no respect for Aboriginal people he encountered. As I \nhave noted in my impressions of him earlier in these reasons, he tended to engage in stereotyping about Aboriginal \npeople. My impression from his oral evidence is that he was disinterested in the decision-making and authority \nstructures of the elders and the Council. The evidence that exists about his interactions with the Council indicates \nhe was principally concerned to impose extra security measures and further restrictions on community members. \nHe was not proactive at the single community meeting he did attend. He did not speak at that meeting and he did \nnot respond to what had been said. He did not engage in any of the conduct I set out below, which, as the officer in \ncharge of the police station, he could have done. Alternatively, if he considered (as some of his answers in cross-\nexamination seemed to suggest) that it was not his place to speak about the investigation, he could have taken \nsteps to have another QPS officer, or someone from the CMC, provide more information. He did none of these \nthings. Instead, he appears to have ensconced himself, with a confrontational battle mentality emerging, in the \npolice station.  There are agreed facts concerning an increase of antisocial conduct during the week, including \nproperty damage (mostly through the throwing of rocks) and threats (or rather, the passing on of information about \nthreats) to damage the police station and barracks, including by a fire bomb. The rock throwing appeared from the \nevidence to occur mostly at night. So far as I can ascertain from the evidence, aside from the rock throwing which \nwas witnessed, and the damage done as a result (such as a hole in a prefabricated wall of a building which was \nevident in one of the video recordings), the remainder of the threats (excluding what people such as Mr Wotton said \nat public meetings) came by way of information provided to officers such as DS Robinson. Some of this information \nmade its way into the running logs, for example (at 2.30 pm on 23 November 2004):THREATS\n\n Meet with confidential informant who advised that there are small numbers of people who are going to fire bomb \nthe police station or police barracks. The informant stated that it will depend on what happens at the public \nmeeting that is planned for 3pm. The informant stated that if it does not happen tonight it will in the next few days. \nThe informant stated that the persons responsible are Dwayne BLANKET and Jason POYNTER. The identity of the \ninformant is known to D/Sergeant ROBINSON and known to be reliable.  Aside from such entries in the running \nlogs (of which there are four in the logs spanning 2.10 pm on 22 November 2004 to 7.15 am on 26 November \n2004), the content of the threats and the reliability of the information provided was not explored in the evidence.  \nAccounts of property damage and rock throwing tended, in my opinion, to be overemphasised by some of the \npolice witnesses, especially Inspector Whyte. His evidence tended to suggest the atmosphere on the island was a \nviolent and explosive one, with very significant risks to life and limb. There were, however, as the applicants pointed \nout in cross-examination, no physical attacks on police officers (although once the situation escalated on 26 \nNovember 2004, it seems to be agreed that at least one officer was hit by a rock). The threats were against the \nproperty of the institution (the police) which the community held responsible for Mulrunji\u2019s death. That is not to \ncondone any violence or property damage which did occur, but in my opinion there is a different, and more \naccurate, perspective on it to the one presented by the respondents. Especially telling is the footage from the \n\n\n\ncommunity meetings and gatherings during this week \u2013 there are children everywhere, there are many older \npeople, there are no weapons or implements. People are sitting or standing around listening and talking, others are \ngoing about their business in the shops in the background or simply passing by. Mothers are nursing babies, \nchildren are playing, young men and women are sitting in groups laughing and talking. A minute\u2019s silence is called \nfor and observed in the meeting on 26 November 2004, before Mayor Kyle announced the autopsy results. From \nwhat she says in her introduction, this was not the first time she had called for that at one of these meetings. Many \nin the large crowd have heads bowed and are silent. There is, as I have said, a clear sense of grief, frustration and \nanger in what individuals say in the video footage. Yet what is going on behind them while they express their views \nis the daily life of a community.  These circumstances were, in my opinion, capable of giving rise to a very different \ncourse of events to the one which followed, had police officers engaged in a way which would have encouraged \nthat different course. Centrally, that would (and should) have involved treating SS Hurley differently, and then \nlistening to and engaging with the community about the investigation process, the autopsy and what changes might \nbe made to ensure a death like Mulrunji\u2019s did not happen again. There was no impediment to the QPS \nimplementing changes immediately, or at least consulting with the community about changes. There was no need \nto wait for coronial recommendations. They had the RCIADIC recommendations, the Queensland government \nresponse, and the review of policing in Aboriginal communities. They had ample information and advice on which \nto begin discussion with the community about change and improvement.  Indeed, as the respondents concede, the \nprincipal reaction of the QPS to what they saw as rising tensions was to increase the numbers of police officers on \nPalm Island threefold. The numbers went from seven to approximately 20 before the protests and fires on Friday, \n26 November 2004. I return to the additional influx of police officers which occurred at that point below. The other \nreactions, undisputed on the evidence, were that the fire brigade was placed on standby (on 23 November 2004 in \nthe early evening), a fire evacuation plan was drawn up and extra fire brigade staff were sent from the mainland. Of \ncourse, as it turned out precautions about fire were prescient of what happened on 26 November 2004. In and of \nitself such precautions cannot be criticised, particularly given the information about the threat of fire-bombing to \nwhich I have referred at [1072]-[1073] above.  Nevertheless, the applicants are correct to identify the absence of \nany proactive measures to address community anger, frustration (at lack of information) and the overall sense of \ninjustice. They are correct to identify the absence of steps by the QPS to prevent the escalation of those attitudes to \nthe point which tragically occurred on 26 November 2004.  On the afternoon of 23 November 2004, police officers \nwere instructed to take their weapons to their sleeping quarters with them. That morning, Mr Wotton noticed police \nwearing guns whilst pulling people over for traffic offences. He said (and Inspector Whyte and Inspector Dini \nagreed) this was unusual as police officers did not ordinarily carry firearms on Palm Island. Again, the message \nthis sent to the community was that the police were intent on imposing their version of law and order, which did not \ninvolve applying the law to those responsible for Mulrunji\u2019s death. In the context of Palm Island at this time, that \nwas an understandable perspective for the community to hold; the QPS as an institution had recognised such \nperspectives in the past, but chose not to acknowledge or address them in November 2004.  There was obvious \napprehension amongst police officers. Sergeant Leafe, in his record of interview on 19 November 2004, described \nhow shortly after Mulrunji\u2019s body was discovered he tried to call his wife (who was also on the island, and pregnant) \n\u201cto tell her what had happened and to advise her not to leave the police compound for um just for fear of um any \nsort of retribution if word had got out\u201d. At one level, that is an understandable human reaction. It also shows the way \na newly arrived officer viewed the Palm Island community. It reveals a consciousness of the seriousness of what \nhad occurred. Finally, it is in stark contrast to the approach taken to telling Mulrunji\u2019s family what had happened.  In \ntheir written submissions, the respondents spend some time criticising the lack of particularity surrounding this \naspect of the applicants\u2019 case. The respondents submit there were no pleadings about what should have been \ndone, and that the applicants refused to give particulars of what should have been done. That is correct. For \nexample, one of the answers to a request for particulars stated:The Applicants do not ask the Court to make \nfindings on precisely which special measures ought to have been put in place or undertaken, nor could they. The \nallegation is that no special measures were put in place or taken, and that special measures ought to have been put \nin place or undertaken.  It is straightforward to set out the kinds of measures, and actions, which might have been \ntaken by the QPS during this week. The existing evidence provides an ample basis to set them out. In the first \nplace, some clear measures relied on by the applicants were the proactive use of CCLOs, which did not occur. \nThere was also \u2013 briefly \u2013 another PLO sent to the island, but there is no evidence his skills and cultural familiarity \nwere put to any use.  The QPS running sheet in evidence records that in this intervening week, PLO Buttigieg \narrived from Townsville on the Monday afternoon and departed the island on the Wednesday morning. Inspector \n\n\n\nWhyte seemed to consider it important to note PLO Buttigieg was a \u201cformer Cowboys player\u201d without identifying \nhow that might better qualify him for his police role. Inspector Whyte said he came \u201cunder the banner of cross \ncultural\u201d (an expression I am far from confident he really understood) but did not give any evidence about what PLO \nButtigieg actually did. This exchange occurred in cross-examination:And what tasks did you \u2013 specific tasks did you \ngive Mr \u2013 the PLO to perform- - -?---I can\u2019t - - -\n\n - - to liaise with the community?---I can\u2019t recall.\n\n And I suggest to you, you didn\u2019t give him any. Would you agree?---No, I don\u2019t.\n\n And there\u2019s nothing recorded in the log about any special tasks given to him to liaise with the community?---I can\u2019t \nrecall.\n\n Well, just take it from me. We\u2019ve read the log a number of times?---Yes, ma\u2019am.\n\n There\u2019s nothing \u2013 the only time he gets mentioned is when he arrives on the island and he\u2019s only mentioned with \nanother group of other people who have arrived on the island?---Yes.\n\n In the log there\u2019s no special tasks assigned to him as the PLO to go and meet with the council, meet with the \nmayor meet with the community justice group, nothing like that?---But there were - - -\n\n And I suggest that\u2019s because it didn\u2019t happen?---There were oral briefings facilitated at the station, so during the \ncourse of the oral briefings then tasks are given to officers or PLOs, so it\u2019s possible that the PLOs were tasked to \nundertake certain duties during the course of that oral briefing.\n\n You\u2019re just making it up now as you go along, aren\u2019t you?---No, I\u2019m not.\n\n You didn\u2019t take the PLO with you when you [went] to meet the council and Erykah Kyle on the Thursday, did you?--\n-No.  In my opinion, there was some force in senior counsel\u2019s suggestion to Inspector Whyte that he was \nreconstructing some of this evidence as he went along. I consider that was the case. It is significant, for example, \nthat no PLO was taken to the Council meetings: this seems like an obvious step to have taken, to try to bridge some \ngaps in understanding and information and to assist in easing tensions. If it was the case that officers formed the \nview, after consideration, that a particular PLO could not undertake such tasks, that would be one thing: but there is \nno such evidence before me. Nor was a PLO sent to speak at any of the community meetings: if PLO Buttigieg\u2019s \nprofile as a former Cowboys player was so significant, it would seem to have been a short step to using that profile \nat the public meetings so that information about the investigation could be given to the community, perceived delays \nin release of the autopsy results addressed, and the positon of SS Hurley clarified. If there was some particular \nimpediment to such steps being taken, it was not identified by the respondents in their evidence.  This was \nInspector Whyte\u2019s evidence about SS Dini (the CCLO who did arrive on the Friday):And sergeant \u2013 Senior Sergeant \nDini, you know him?---Yes, I do.\n\n And you\u2019re aware that, at this stage, he was a CCLO \u2013 sorry \u2013 a cross-cultural liaison officer?---I can\u2019t recall.\n\n And do you recall that he arrived on the Friday afternoon?---He was on the island, yes. I can\u2019t recall when he \narrived, ma\u2019am.\n\n And he was involved in things like providing administrative duties and the provision of food. Do you recall that?---\nNo, I don\u2019t.\n\n\n\n And he didn\u2019t perform any cross-cultural liaison duties while he was on the island?---I don\u2019t recall.\n\n And he would have been under your command when he was on the island?---Yes.\n\n And you didn\u2019t direct him to do so; would you agree?---No, I don\u2019t.\n\n Well, where in the log do I find the directions you gave him to liaise with the community?---It may have happened \nduring the course of the oral briefings when they arrived on the island.  This, in my opinion, was also a \nreconstruction by Inspector Whyte. I find he had no memory of what SS Dini did once he arrived. To be fair, that \nmay well be explained because SS Dini arrived about the time the protests and fires started on Friday, 26 \nNovember 2004, and SS Whyte would have had his attention elsewhere. Obviously SS Dini, from the evidence in \nthe logs, was also put to other tasks, and that may also be understandable given what was happening on the \nisland. However, the applicants\u2019 focus is on the period leading up to the protests and fires and they are correct to \nidentify no activity at all by the QPS to utilise CCLOs to defuse the situation on the island.  Thus, the use of PLOs \nand CCLOs was an obvious measure that was not employed. Other obvious measures were also available.  No \nofficer, for example, offered apologies or explanations for circumstances such as the fact that there was still no \nautopsy report as of mid-week. No officer explained the autopsy process at the community meetings. No officer \nrevealed to the general community the timing of sending off the details of the autopsy material, nor the proposed \ntiming of the autopsy. No officer outlined the steps in the investigation. No officer explained why SS Hurley was still \non duty and still on the island. No officer, so far as the evidence showed, even publicly offered the sympathy of the \nQPS to Mulrunji\u2019s family and all those who knew him. No officer took any steps to emphasise how tragic it was that \nthere had been yet another death of an Aboriginal person in custody. No officer accepted that another Aboriginal \ndeath in custody was the opposite of the intention of the recommendations of the RCIADIC, and the implementation \nof those recommendations in the OPM. No officer sat with the Council, or the community elders, and went through \nthe RCIADIC recommendations, or the Queensland report on policing in Aboriginal communities, and began a \nconversation about what could be done differently to avoid more deaths. None of these matters trespassed across \nthe investigative functions being performed: they were matters of simple decency and transparency. They were \nconsistent with, and inherent in, the function of the QPS and the standards of conduct expected of QPS officers \narising from the legislation and other instruments to which I have earlier referred.  None of these steps needed to be \nspelled out in a document such as an OPM. QPS officers can be expected to understand that their roles and \nresponsibilities in crisis situations. Circumstances of death and injury require sensitivity, proactivity, care and \nconsideration. Policing is often undertaken in situations of great human tragedy and emotion: the need to bear \nthose matters in mind is obvious. It is especially obvious in the context of the particular and unique circumstances of \nthe Palm Island community.  I should note here that in their reply submissions the applicants sought to explain why \nthey had not particularised the measures they contended the QPS ought to have taken by reference to authorities \nconcerning limits on the power of courts to direct executive action (for example, Bare v Independent Broad-Based \nAnti-Corruption Commission [2015] VSCA 197; 326 ALR 198 at [367] (Tate JA)). In my opinion, those submissions \nare not of any relevance. No orders of that kind are sought by the applicants from this Court against the executive.  \nI find that during the intervening week between Mulrunji\u2019s death and the protests and fires on 26 November 2004, \nQPS officers failed to engage in any substantive or appropriate way with the Palm Island community, including by \nnot participating in community meetings; not explaining to the community why SS Hurley had not been arrested and \ncontinued on duty, nor why there were no autopsy results; engaging in a minimal and passive way with the Council \nand thereby not assisting the elders and leaders of the community to reduce tensions; and failing to utilise the \nspecific cultural communication and liaison strategies contemplated by the OPM (ie the CCLOs and the PLOs). The \nresult was that tensions and frustration in the community rose, a sense of injustice and disrespect increased, and \nviolence against police property continued and increased.  In my opinion the conduct of the QPS involved a \ndistinction in the way the QPS performed its functions under s 2.3(g) of the PSA Act, which requires:the provision of \nthe services, and the rendering of help reasonably sought, in an emergency or otherwise, as are \u2013\n\n\n\n (i) required of officers under any Act or law or the reasonable expectations of the community; or\n\n (ii) reasonably sought of officers by members of the community.  This was a community seeking the help of the \nQPS as the institution charged to uphold the law \u2013 to investigate and determine whether any offences had been \ncommitted in relation to the arrest and death of Mulrunji, to prepare information for an autopsy and a coronial \ninvestigation, to explain how people would be held to account under law, and to keep peace and good order on the \nisland during a tense and difficult time. The community had, and had expressed, its expectations, which in my \nopinion were reasonable ones, about the removal of SS Hurley and him being treated as a suspect, and about the \nneed for timely explanations of why Mulrunji was arrested, why he died, who would be held accountable, and what \nmust change to prevent or reduce the numbers of Aboriginal people dying in police custody.  QPS officers did not \nrespond to those expectations in the way they would in a non-Aboriginal community. They were not respectful, they \nwere dismissive. They were not consultative, they dictated. They did not recognise grief and frustration, they over-\npoliced. They behaved in this way because this was an Aboriginal community where the police had a sense of \nimpunity and separateness, and an intention to exert control. The distinction was based on race.\n\nQPS handling of the autopsy report  Finally, in this group of allegations, the applicants also expand on their criticism \nof the way QPS officers handled the results of the autopsy. They contend that there was a failure to adequately \nbrief Inspector Richardson on the contents of the preliminary autopsy report; a failure to conduct what the \napplicants describe as \u201cstrategic planning\u201d to respond to the autopsy report once it was known the kind of injuries \nMulrunji had sustained; and lastly a failure of the QPS officers on Palm Island to make \u201cspecial or other \narrangements\u201d prior to the autopsy report being released to the community.  I have made findings above concerning \nthe approach of DSS Kitching to the provision of information for the autopsy report. I have also made findings \nconcerning the inadequacy of QPS officers\u2019 engagement and communication with the Palm Island community, \nincluding over the autopsy report. There are no other or separate acts involving distinctions based on race which \narise from these allegations. Additionally, whether or not Inspector Richardson was briefed properly is not a matter \nthat could impair or nullify the rights of the Palm Island group members, nor the subgroup.\n\nConclusions on the intervening week claims  By reference to the applicants\u2019 final submissions at [312]-[375], and \nthe applicants\u2019 summary submissions at [9]-[11], read with the third further amended statement of claim at [256]-\n[274], I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the following conduct constituted acts involving distinctions \nbased on race for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA.  First, the decision not to suspend SS Hurley from duty. I am \nsatisfied this decision rested with Inspector Strohfeldt as SS Hurley\u2019s immediate supervisor, and/or with A/AC Wall. \nGiven the acceptance of vicarious liability by the first respondent, precise identification of the QPS officer with \nwhom the decision rested is not critical.  This act involved a distinction: namely a disregard of usual policing \nstandards of independence and impartiality, and a departure from the usual levels of objectivity brought by police \nofficers to an investigation. The distinction was based on race. That is because the supervising or commanding \nofficers paid no real regard to what the local Aboriginal community apprehended or thought about the QPS \ninvestigation. There was no respect or concern for the justifiable shock and outrage at what had happened to \nMulrunji. There was no respect or concern for the justifiable outrage that SS Hurley had not been arrested, \nsuspended or even removed from the island. The evidence suggests those in command positions were impervious \nto these issues and in my opinion that is because they were dealing with a powerless, remote Aboriginal \ncommunity, and in particular one where the authorities (including police) were quite accustomed to being \u2018in \ncharge\u2019 of Aboriginal people and controlling how they lived.  Second, the failures to communicate with the Palm \nIsland community and defuse tensions. These acts were ongoing throughout the week and manifested in the \nconduct I have set out in [1052] to [1093] above. They involved distinctions \u2013 namely, adherence to lesser \nstandards about the preservation of peace and good order, and a focus on increasing security and police numbers \nwithout regard to other methods. Further, the acts involved a distinction in the way QPS officers performed their \nfunctions under s 2.3(g) of the PSA Act: see [1091] above. The acts also involved a preference: preference was \ngiven to protection of the interests and safety of the non-Aboriginal police officers on the island, at the expense of \nengagement with the local community. Instead of defusing tensions and addressing the justifiable concerns \nexpressed at the meetings about what was being done about SS Hurley, and why the autopsy report was taking so \nlong, QPS officers (led by SS Whyte and Inspector Richardson) geared up for confrontation, and subjugation.  \n\n\n\nThese distinctions and the preference just identified were based on race. That is because the nature of engagement \nby the police in this community was historically, and also in 2004, skewed towards a controlling and domineering \nstyle, and was characterised by over-policing rather than partnership. There was no real respect or consideration \ngiven to the role of elders and the local Council; lip service was paid to their roles. There was no inclination to \nunderstand family and community structures, nor how Mulrunji\u2019s death affected people across the Palm Island \ncommunity. There was no appetite to talk about changes to policing on the island, nor about prevention of future \ndeaths. All that would have been taken for granted in a non-Aboriginal community. In an Aboriginal community, \nofficers needed special knowledge, special interest and particular kinds of communication skills. They did not have \nthose things and they were not interested in attempting to engage with the community in any event. The late and \nlacklustre attempts at using CCLOs and PLOs are a good example of the attitudes that prevailed.\n\nThird category: the emergency declaration issued under the PSP Act    In this category of conduct, the applicants \nchallenge both the making and the revocation of the emergency declaration. The revocation is challenged on the \nbasis that the declaration, if lawfully and properly made, should have been revoked much sooner. The applicants \nalso challenge conduct arising from the emergency declaration: namely, the restriction of transport to and from the \nisland, and the \u201cpresence and behaviour of police\u201d.\n\nThe making of the emergency declaration by DI Webber  The basic course of events is set out at [328]-[330] above. \nIt is necessary to begin with the evidence about the oral declaration. DI Webber was at Mundingburra police \nstation, where A/AC Wall\u2019s office was close to his. DI Webber said that A/AC Wall told him that:a riot was occurring \nat \u2013 on Palm Island, that the police station had been set on fire and that demands had been made for all the \npolice officers to \u2013 to leave the island within the hour. He \u2013 he asked me to do certain things and as a result of \nwhich I arranged various officers to \u2013 to attend at Townsville Airport.  This was how DI Webber described the \ndecision to make the emergency declaration:I was. I was \u2013 I was listening to the police radio and I was also making \ntelephone calls to the police communication centre and also to \u2013 to regional office to ascertain exactly what was \u2013 \nwhat was occurring. It was during those \u2013 during \u2013 or hearing those conversations and \u2013 and the details concerning \nofficers\u2019 accommodation then being under attack etcetera that I made a determination to \u2013 to \u2013 to announce a call \nfor an emergency situation to be declared.  He had also been told the police station and SS Hurley\u2019s house were \nalight. As I explain in more detail below, in my opinion, what the officers on Palm Island were articulating as their \nfears and apprehensions were substantially affected by their sense of being under siege from a group of Aboriginal \npeople, and there was some material stereotyping at work in the officers\u2019 reactions, as well as considerable \ndisproportion of reaction stemming from that. Those matters are not ones DI Webber could have perceived, and I \naccept his evidence that what he was listening to made the situation sound grave indeed.  DI Webber had made \nemergency declarations before, in relation to siege and hostage situations, and was broadly but not intimately \nfamiliar with the PSP Act. He telephoned police communications and asked them to make a broadcast about the \ndeclaration, and also to contact the Department of Transport to put in place a \u201cNotice to Airmen\u201d (NOTAM) \nbecause, he said, of the \u201csafety issues\u201d on Palm Island. A NOTAM could be issued pursuant to r 4.12 of the Air \nServices Regulations 1995 (Cth). The NOTAM was not in evidence, so its terms cannot be ascertained. It was \nagreed between the parties that commercial flights to and from the island were suspended between 1.45 pm on 26 \nNovember 2004 and 1.30 pm on 27 November 2004. Thus, one of the practical effects of the NOTAM (and the \nemergency declaration) was that some Palm Islanders were stranded in Townsville (or elsewhere) and unable to \nreturn to their families, and Palm Islanders who wished, or needed, to leave the island were unable to do so by \ncommercial flights as they usually might.  On flying into Palm Island, DI Webber could see there were buildings \nalight and could see a crowd around them. SS Dini and Inspector Kachel also arrived around the same time, by \nplane and helicopter. A helicopter was sent to see if the road to the central area of Palm Island was blocked (as \nhad been suggested to DI Webber \u2013 it is unclear on the evidence by whom, but it seems to have been information \npassed to him by police officers at the barracks). DI Webber then described how the group of officers came to \nleave the airport:Well, initially, we did actually remain at the airport whilst reinforcements arrived, I suppose, and we \nthen at that point in time were \u2013 whilst we were at the airport, we received communications to indicate that a code 1 \nwas being issued that the officers at the police station were \u2013 were in imminent fear of losing their lives, so at that \npoint in time I made the determination that a group of us would immediately travel to the \u2013 to the police barracks \nthere to effect a rescue if necessary.\n\n\n\n ...\n\n So we immediately proceeded from the airport to the Palm Island township basically in a convoy of vehicles. By \nthe time we got to the township, a number \u2013 the officers had made their way from the police barracks to the vicinity \nof the hospital, and we drove to the hospital and met them there.  Once at the hospital, this is how DI Webber \ndescribed what happened:We arrived at the rear entrance to the hospital. There were a number of officers there, \nincluding Inspector Richardson who was in charge of the police contingent at that point on Palm. The officers all \nappeared quite, I suppose, drawn, tense and I suppose upset. We received a very quick briefing from Inspector \nRichardson as to what had occurred. There were a number of officers at the front of the hospital where a larger \ngroup of locals were gathered out the front and we went out and joined those officers to effectively, I suppose, \ndemonstrate a show of numbers.\n\n ...\n\n There were a number of local Aboriginals milling around, I suppose, to the front. There were Inspector Richardson \nand I think Senior Sergeant Whyte moved forward and had a conversation with a male person who I now know to \nbe Lex Wotton and I think Erykah Kyle, the chairperson of the council there was also speaking. Inspector \nRichardson had a conversation with them. I didn\u2019t participate in that conversation; I basically stayed four or five \nyards away in a direct line with the other officers.\n\n And could you hear any of the conversation between Inspector Richardson, Senior Sergeant Whyte and other \npeople?---Periodically I heard bits and pieces or whatever. At one point in time \u2013 and I\u2019m pretty sure it was the \nmayor that said something about \u2013 because they were demanding that the police leave the island. We were told \nthat we were not under any circumstances to leave the island and I believe the mayor said something about, you \nknow, he will look after the women and children or something \u2013 words to that effect. And at that point in time, there \nwere a large number of people milling around, some with sticks and clubs, some with rocks in their hands or \nwhatever out the front. And then basically, I suppose, over the next 15, 20 minutes people started to dissipate and \nmove away.\n\n All right. And the other people standing around, were they silent or were they saying things?---There was \u2013 there \nwere a few yelling out chants of abuse, etcetera, but there were no other acts of violence that I saw.\n\n All right. Well, you mention the crowd sort of dispersing. I assume the line of police out the front of the hospital \nalso dispersed at some point?---Yes. Eventually it dispersed and a number of went back into the hospital and \nworked out a plan of action.  The reference to a code 1 and officers being in fear of their lives is a theme which runs \nthrough a good deal of the evidence about this period. It is present in the sentencing remarks of Judge Shanahan in \nrelation to Mr Wotton, on which the respondents rely heavily in their submissions about the emergency declaration \nand the seriousness of the situation. It is a theme present in the audio which can be heard in the recording made by \nConstable Robertson of the protests and confrontations. It was present in the evidence of some of the officers who \ngave evidence before me, notably Inspector Whyte. I return to this at various points in these reasons, but note \nagain that, in my opinion, while the fears may have been genuinely held, there was less objective justification for \nthem than seems to have been previously assumed, and was assumed in the respondents\u2019 submissions. At least, \nnot when one removes stereotypical assumptions and baseless fears made about crowds comprising Aboriginal \npeople. Again, it must be borne in mind that I can only base my findings on the evidence before me. I had no \nevidence from the large number of officers who were present on Palm Island during these events, other than \nInspector Whyte, about whom I have not made favourable findings. DI Webber, it must be recalled, arrived after \nthese so-described \u201clife threatening\u201d events. What I do have is the contemporaneous footage, and I have evidence \nfrom several witnesses for the applicants.  I have set out at [740]-[815] above my findings about what can be seen \nfrom the contemporaneous video footage of the events from 22 November 2004 through to approximately 27 \n\n\n\nNovember 2004, including the footage from outside the hospital. I do not accept DI Webber\u2019s evidence about \npeople having sticks, clubs and rocks. I do not accept his later evidence about people having spears. It is too \ninconsistent with what is visible in video footage. Some people were certainly angry, and Inspector Dini gave \nevidence that people were calling QPS officers \u201cpolice cunts and murdering dogs\u201d. No statement of that kind is \naudible in the video evidence, but I accept it is entirely possible statements like that were made. Nevertheless, the \nonly people capable of doing really serious physical harm at that point on Palm Island were the police officers: they \nwere armed with a variety of firearms and batons, and one officer had a baseball bat. The police had already \nspoken amongst themselves in the barracks about shooting people. The sentencing remarks in relation to Mr \nWotton record victim impact statements from officers stating they had talked about Mr Wotton being the first person \nthey would shoot. There was no such evidence before me and I make no such finding. However, in his record of \ninterview from 26 November 2004, which was in evidence before me and which Inspector Whyte did not disclaim, \n(then) SS Whyte stated that Mr Wotton \u201chad pushed us to the limit where we were of the view that some of those \npeople were gonna get hurt because we would have to utilise and discharge our weapons\u201d. The QPS officers also \nhad police dogs aggressively barking at the local crowd. My conclusion is that, contrary to the evidence of QPS \nofficers, if any people had cause to be fearful for their lives at the point QPS officers lined up outside the hospital, it \nwas members of the local community who were standing in front of armed police officers and police dogs. \nHowever, no such apprehensions are apparent: in part, perhaps, because at the time none of the local people were \naware of how close QPS officers were to using their weapons.  Once the crowd at the hospital had dispersed and \nthe police stopped standing in a line in front of the hospital (on DI Webber\u2019s evidence, this seemed to be only about \nhalf an hour after he arrived, at the most), DI Webber then described how he, Inspector Kachel and SS Whyte \ndecided that the local school would be an appropriate place to establish a command centre, which is what occurred. \nDI Webber was not asked but it would appear to be the case that the source of power relied on to occupy and use \nthe school and its property was assumed to be the emergency declaration. There being nowhere else for officers to \nbe based (including to eat and sleep), classrooms were used for that purpose, as well as for planning and \noperational functions. Officers were despatched to patrol around the island. Plans were made to move all officers \nwho had been present during the protests and fires off the island, except Inspector Richardson and DS Robinson. \nFresh officers would be flown in. DI Webber said:There was a large number of officers \u2013 because of the incident \nthat had occurred \u2013 in my declaration, there were a large number of officers flown basically from all over south-east \nQueensland and up the coast to Townsville. There were also members of the public safety response team, general \nduties officers, detectives, tactical comms ..... officers, etcetera, flown in from ...various areas.  Overall, as I note at \n[332] above, between approximately 59 and 82 QPS officers (excluding SERT and PSRT) came onto Palm Island \nin response to the incident.  DI Webber then described how the responsibility and decision-making for the conduct \nof an investigation into what offences may have been committed that day rested with officers in Townsville:Now, \nnormally I would have had a probably more direct involvement in that process but, because I was actually on Palm \nIsland itself, that was more difficult, but the determination was made that a major incident room, as we call it in the \npolice, would be established at Mundingburra and that major incident team would be responsible for the oversight \nand tasking of the operations involved. So they \u2013 the NYR [sic; \u201cMIR\u201d], which was led by two detective senior \nsergeants, was responsible for, I suppose, bringing the witnesses together, obtaining their statements, identifying \npersons of interest and suspects for offences, and then deploying staff and managing the deployment of those staff \nto effect those arrests, whereas, on the island itself, we were actually, I suppose, more directly engaged in the \ndirect deployment of those staff, deploying those staff to effect those arrests, and then arranging for their movement \nback to Townsville.  He said that he had only:a minimal role in the circumstances as far as I had no involvement in \ndetermining what evidence existed against any particular party or didn\u2019t exist in relation to any particular party.  In \nterms of DI Webber\u2019s role (and those of the other officers on Palm Island as he had described it) in the deployment \nof officers to effect the arrests of suspects, DI Webber then described what was done on the island in this \nrespect:During the early hours of Saturday morning, in consultation with Inspector [Kachel] and Inspector \nUnderwood who had arrived from the specialist services branch, a determination was made and it was worked out \nexactly what action would be taken to actually effect those arrests, which included \u2013 I think Inspector \u2013 the decision \nthat Inspector Underwood would be involved directly in attendance at scenes, Detective Sergeant Robinson was to \nbe involved in actually identifying particular persons and locations of interest, and that the dog squad and specialist \nemergency response team would actually attend to actually assist in the effecting of any arrests, if required, and \nfrom memory, I believe there was also a negotiated deport for each arrest as well.  I understood DI Webber\u2019s \nphrase \u201cnegotiated deport\u201d to mean the police arrangements to take those arrested in custody off the island and \n\n\n\nacross to Townsville.  On the basis of DI Webber\u2019s evidence, I find that the decisions about how SERT and PSRT \nofficers would be used on the island were made by Inspector Kachel and Inspector Underwood, together with DI \nWebber.  The applicants challenged the formation of the requisite state of satisfaction by DI Webber for the making \nof the emergency declaration under the PSP Act, together with a number of other aspects of the making of the \ndeclaration. I have set out the relevant provisions of the PSP Act at [186] above, but I extract the key provisions \nhere again for ease of reference.  In November 2004, the long title to the PSP Act stated:An Act to provide \nprotection for members of the public in chemical, biological, radiological or other emergencies that create or may \ncreate danger of death, injury or distress to any person, loss of or damage to any property or pollution of the \nenvironment and for related purposes  Section 5 provided:Declaration of emergency situation\n\n (1) Subject to section 6, if at any time a commissioned officer (the \u201cincident coordinator\u201d) is satisfied on reasonable \ngrounds that an emergency situation has arisen or is likely to arise the commissioned officer may declare that an \nemergency situation exists in respect of an area specified by the commissioned officer. \n\n (2) The incident coordinator, as soon as practicable after he or she declares that an emergency situation exists, \nshall issue a certificate to this effect signed by the incident coordinator which certificate shall set out the nature of \nthe emergency situation, the time and date it was declared to exist and the area in respect of which it exists.  \nSection 4 of the PSP Act refers to a Dictionary contained in a Schedule to the PSP Act, which includes a definition \nof \u201cemergency situation\u201d:\u201cemergency situation\u201d means \u2013\n\n (a) any explosion or fire; or \n\n (b) any oil or chemical spill; or \n\n (c) any escape of gas, radioactive material or flammable or combustible liquids; or \n\n (d) any accident involving an aircraft, or a train, vessel or vehicle; or \n\n (e) any incident involving a bomb or other explosive device or a firearm or other weapon; or \n\n (f) any other accident; \n\n that causes or may cause a danger of death, injury or distress to any person, a loss of or damage to any property \nor pollution of the environment, includes a situation arising from any report in respect of any of the matters referred \nto in paragraphs (a) to (f) which if proved to be correct would cause or may cause a danger of death, injury or \ndistress to any person, a loss of or damage to any property or pollution of the environment.  The use of the word \n\u201cmeans\u201d at the beginning of this definition indicates that it is intended to be exhaustive: see YZ Finance Co Pty Ltd v \nCummings [1964] HCA 12; 109 CLR 395 at 398 (McTiernan J, Taylor J agreeing at 404, Windeyer J agreeing at \n406), 402-04 (Kitto J); Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] VicRp 42; [1977] VR \n342 at 353 (McInerney J); Douglas v Tickner [1994] FCA 1066; 49 FCR 509 at 519 (Carr J); Transport Accident \nCommission v Hogan [2013] VSCA 335 at [47] (the Court); cf Owen v Menzies [2012] QCA 170; [2013] 2 Qd R 327 \nat [106] (Muir JA).  The powers conferred on the incident coordinator (and those officers subject to her or his \ndirection) are then set out in s 8:Powers of incident coordinator\n\n (1) Where during the period of and in the area specified in respect of an emergency situation the incident \ncoordinator is satisfied on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to effectively deal with that emergency situation \nhe or she (and any other police officer acting on his or her instructions) may\u2013(a) direct the owner or the person for \nthe time being in charge or in control of any resource to surrender it and place it under the incident coordinator\u2019s or \npolice officer\u2019s control (\u201cresource surrender direction\u201d);\n\n\n\n (b) take control of any resource, whether it is in the charge or control of any person or not;\n\n (c) in respect of any resource under the incident coordinator\u2019s or police officer\u2019s control, direct any person who is \ncapable of operating that resource to operate it as directed by him or her (\u201cresource operator direction\u201d);\n\n (d) direct the evacuation and exclusion of any person or persons from any premises and for this purpose may \nremove or cause to be removed (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any person who does not \ncomply with a direction to evacuate or any person who enters, attempts to enter or is found in or on any premises in \nrespect of which a direction for the exclusion of persons has been given;\n\n (e) close or cause to be closed to traffic and pedestrians, any road, street, motorway, private road, private way, \nservice lane, footway, right of way, access way or other way or close any place to which members of the public \nhave access whether on payment of a fee or otherwise;\n\n (f) enter or cause to be entered (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any premises;\n\n (g) search or cause to be searched (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any premises and anything \nfound therein or thereon;\n\n (h) remove or cause to be removed from any premises (using such force as is necessary for that purpose) any \nanimal or anything;\n\n (i) direct any person to assist him or her in the manner specified by him or her (\u201chelp direction\u201d).(2) The incident \ncoordinator or police officer must not give a resource operator direction or a help direction to a person if giving the \ndirection would expose the person to imminent danger.\n\n (3) A person given a resource surrender direction, a resource operator direction or a help direction must comply \nwith the direction, unless the person has a reasonable excuse.\n\n Maximum penalty for subsection (3) \u2013 40 penalty units or 1 year\u2019s imprisonment.  It can be seen that these include \ncoercive powers of entry, search and seizure. There is no express power of arrest without warrant conferred by s 8.  \nThe applicants have put the lawfulness of the emergency declaration in issue in several ways. I have set out at \n[725]-[739] above why I consider a focus on lawfulness can distract from the task under s 9. However, since the \napplicants have placed such emphasis on the lawfulness of the emergency declaration, I consider it is appropriate \nto decide the question. I accept lawfulness may be relevant to the second limb of s 9(1).  In my opinion, the state of \nsatisfaction formed by DI Webber about the precondition in s 5(1) to the making of the declaration was lawfully \nformed. There was, by 1.45 pm on 26 November 2004, obviously a fire consuming public buildings on Palm Island, \n\u201cfire\u201d being one of the definitions of \u201cemergency situation\u201d. Section 5 required a commissioned officer to be satisfied \nthat an emergency situation (here, a fire), \u201chas arisen\u201d (that is, prior to the making of the declaration) or \u201cis likely to \narise\u201d (that is, after the making of the declaration). The applicants do not contest, nor could they, that by the time DI \nWebber made the emergency declaration the police station and barracks, and SS Hurley\u2019s house, were well alight. \nIn other words, a fire had arisen. On the evidence, the fact that these buildings were on fire had been reported to \nhim.  DI Webber\u2019s reliance, in the certificate he issued on 28 November 2004, on there having been \u201cany other \naccident\u201d within para (f) of the definition of emergency situation in s 4 of the PSP Act need not be justified. Even in \nthe context of statutory powers conditioned on the formation of an opinion by the repository of the power (as s 5 of \nthe PSP Act is), if there is a lawful basis available for the exercise of the power, then any mistake by the repository \nin identifying an incorrect source of power does not affect the validity of the exercise of the power: see Brown v \n\n\n\nWest [1990] HCA 7; 169 CLR 195 at 203 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ); Eastman v \nDirector of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [124](Heydon J); Australian Education Union \nv Department of Education and Children\u2019s Services [2012] HCA 3;248 CLR 1 at [34] (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and \nBell JJ); Attorney-General (SA) v Corporation of the City of Adelaide [2013] HCA 3; 249 CLR 1 at [175] (Crennan \nand Kiefel JJ).  If I had needed to consider whether DI Webber could lawfully form the requisite state of satisfaction \nbased on the existence of \u201cany other accident\u201d in the definition of emergency situation, I would have found he could \nnot lawfully have done so. Since fires and explosions are expressly covered in para (a), I do not consider as a \nmatter of construction that those events would also be covered by a general catch-all such as para (f), especially \ngiven the language \u201cany other\u201d accident. That language suggests the legislature is characterising most of the \nevents in paras (a)-(e) as accidents, and then seeking to incorporate, in para (f), other kinds of accidents. The \nrespondents are correct that there is no reference to intentional conduct, or lack of it, in the definition of \u201cemergency \nsituation\u201d. The definition assumes, rightly, that where an accident or disaster occurs, the cause (or responsibility for \nit) may be unknown or contentious. The definition focusses on the nature of the event, and what needs to be done \nto alleviate the situation itself.  I do not consider the exhaustive definition is intended, by the presence of para (f), to \ninclude the activities of a group of people throwing rocks, yelling abuse, engaging in protest and causing property \ndamage. That is not, in any sense, an \u201caccident\u201d, although those activities may have some or all of the \nconsequences set out in the remainder of the definition of \u201cemergency situation\u201d. As the use of the word \u201cincident\u201d \nin para (e) demonstrates, if the legislature had intended broader coverage for para (f), a word other than \u201caccident\u201d \nwould have been selected. In many circumstances what might colloquially be called a \u201criot\u201d may well be an \u201cincident \ninvolving ... a weapon\u201d for the purposes of para (e). The respondents did not rely on para (e), nor did DI Webber in \nhis certificate. It may have been an available source of power. Whether or not that was the case is immaterial, given \nthat para (a) provided a clear source of authority for the making of the emergency declaration.  Finally, s 5 contains \na residual discretion, and DI Webber retained a choice whether to make a declaration even if the preconditions in s \n5(1) were met. The applicants did not mount any challenge to the exercise of the residual discretion: the focus of \ntheir legal argument was on the precondition contained in s 5. For my own part, I see no legal error in the exercise \nof the residual discretion by DI Webber.\n\nThe revocation of the emergency declaration  Section 5(3) of the PSP Act provides:The declaration that an \nemergency situation exists shall continue until revoked by the incident coordinator.  The respondents accepted, \ncorrectly, that for an emergency declaration to remain lawfully in place, the commissioned officer needed to \ncontinue to have a state of satisfaction about the matters in s 5(1) of the PSP Act. That this should be the case is \nreinforced by the use of the present tense (\u201cexists\u201d) in s 5(3). However, as I have already noted, this proceeding is \nonly concerned with whether there was a contravention of s 9 of the RDA in the emergency declaration remaining in \nforce for the period of time it did.  DI Webber was asked about his consideration of when the emergency declaration \nshould be revoked:Was that a matter, the possible revocation of that declaration, that you turned your mind to on \nthe Saturday?---I had. But at that point in time, there were still a few factors under consideration, one being the fact \nthat there was a missing police firearm which had not been located. A number of persons had still to be taken into \ncustody. And there was also, I suppose \u2013 there was still an air of tenseness, I suppose, around the \u2013 around the \ncommunity, and there was still a \u2013 still, I suppose, a fear that there could be further incidents on \u2013 during that \nevening and night.\n\n All right. And by comparison, how did you view the situation \u2013 or how did it appear to you on the morning of the \n28th, the Sunday?---Well, by the Sunday morning, most, if not all, of the persons of interest had been \u2013 been \narrested and taken into custody. Whilst the police firearm had not been located, to my knowledge, the \u2013 we were \ncomfortable with the situation. There were no further acts of violence or whatever overnight. So we felt that it was \nappropriate to \u2013 time to revoke the emergency situation.  It can be seen from this evidence that the fact of a missing \nfirearm seemed to have become less important in the assessment of risk. Nor is there any real evidence, other than \nthe assertion by DI Webber, of any further protests or riotous behaviour. There is nothing of that nature recorded in \nthe running logs between the later evening of 26 November 2004 and the morning of 28 November 2004 when the \nemergency declaration was revoked.  In my opinion it is clear from the evidence that one purpose in maintaining the \nemergency declaration was to facilitate the arrests of those suspected of involvement in the events of 26 \nNovember 2004. The respondents accept that the entry, search and seizure power in s 8 of the PSP Act was one of \n\n\n\nthe sources of authority on which the QPS officers relied, and in my opinion was the source, DI Webber had in mind \nfor the conduct of the entries and searches by SERT officers, assisted by DS Robinson. I accept the implication in \nDI Webber\u2019s evidence that once those suspected of responsibility or involvement in the events of 26 November \n2004 were in custody, then in his opinion it was more likely there would be no further attacks on police property, or \non police, and the declaration could be lifted.  Other evidence given by DI Webber about the continuing situation on \nPalm Island confirms my opinion. There was the following exchange in cross-examination:And I suggest to you that \nthe reasons for the emergency situation before and during the fire ended when the crowd of protestors dispersed \nfrom outside the hospital. Would you agree?---No. I don\u2019t. I believe there was an ongoing and continuing threat and \na risk of harm to the community.\n\n And that there was no emergency situation from Friday afternoon onwards?---I disagree.\n\n Well, there were no incidents on Friday night, were there?---Not that I recall, no.\n\n And none on Saturday?---There were a number of arrests made on the Saturday morning.\n\n But they were arrests arising from Friday, weren\u2019t they?---Yes, but - - -\n\n And they had nothing to do with any civil unrest on Saturday, did they?---But they were still police actions that \ncould have resulted in injuries \u2013 injuries to people and to officers.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    I consider this evidence significant. I consider it accurately reflects DI Webber\u2019s understanding \nat the time. What it indicates is that although he said he was concerned about threats to the community, he did not \nidentify any. That is because there were not any. What did exist, in his mind, were threats to police officers and to \npolice property. There had never been any indication of threats to the non-Aboriginal members of the Palm Island \ncommunity. There had never been any indication of threats to Aboriginal members of the Palm Island community. \nThe aggression, anger, verbal threats, and acts of property damage were all directed at, first, police property, and \nsecond, police themselves. That is because the whole reason and genesis for the protests and fires was Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath, the failure to charge and suspend SS Hurley, and the lack of police transparency about the investigation and \nautopsy results. At the most, what DI Webber\u2019s apprehension about \u201cthe community\u201d might have amounted to was \ndamage to community buildings. Again, however, the only buildings targeted and damaged were those associated \nwith the QPS.  And, it should not be forgotten, the building which was primarily targeted was the building in which \nMulrunji had died.  There is insufficient evidence that any kind of riotous situation continued after the early evening \non Friday, 26 November 2004. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that, at any time after that, any further \nriotous situation was likely to arise. The police presence was overwhelming and what angry crowds there were \naround the barracks and the hospital had dispersed very quickly after the fires and the subsequent confrontation at \nthe hospital. The evidence suggests this occurred in less than an hour. There were many locals around, but they \nwere simply gathering in small groups, talking about what had happened, watching, and otherwise going about their \ndaily lives. There were children everywhere and older people as well \u2013 there was nothing approaching any sense of \nviolence, or threats to property. The police logs show nothing but all being quiet.  There was no \u201cemergency \nsituation\u201d within the meaning of s 5 of the PSP Act (read with s 4) existing up until the declaration was revoked. The \nprincipal emergency situation within the PSP Act that had existed (the fire and any \u201caccidents\u201d which might arise \nfrom, or coextensively with, it) had ceased, at the latest, on Friday evening. It is possible, reading the PSP Act \ngenerously in the context of what had happened on Palm Island, that a person in DI Webber\u2019s position could be \nreasonably satisfied that another fire might be \u201clikely to arise\u201d overnight, given the level of anger in the community \nand the proximity in time of the fire at lunchtime on Friday.  After this point (Saturday morning), in my opinion DI \nWebber maintained the declaration to facilitate the apprehension of suspects and to protect the police and police \nproperty while those apprehensions occurred. The declaration remained in force also to emphasise the total \nauthority of the QPS over the island. His view was that the arrests and the entry onto private property could be \njustified under s 8 of the PSP Act while an emergency declaration was in place. That view was legally erroneous, \nbut more importantly that view reveals the real purpose of maintaining the emergency declaration. He wanted the \n\n\n\nisland kept in some form of lockdown, until suspects were arrested and removed from the island. That may have \nbeen a legitimate approach to his policing task, on one view, but it did not meet the requirements of the PSP Act. \nFor those reasons, the continuation of the emergency declaration until after all suspects were arrested and in \ncustody was outside the purposes for which the power to maintain an emergency declaration was conferred.\n\nWas the making and continuation of the emergency declaration an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction \nor preference based on race?  An emergency declaration gives a wide range of coercive powers, affecting private \ncitizens and their property. It was the declaration which was taken to authorise DI Webber to close the airspace \naround Palm Island, to seize (through SS Dini) a vehicle and the Catholic school bus, to use the school as a police \ncommand centre (although the applicants do not complain about this), to suspend ferry services to and from Palm \nIsland, and (at least in one case) prevented an individual Palm Island resident from returning to the island. It \nappears, at least from the evidence of DI Webber (see my findings on the arrests, entries and searches below), that \nthe emergency declaration was also the occasion, or perhaps the source, of the request for SERT teams to attend \nthe island and apprehend suspects. It is no coincidence, in my opinion, that the emergency declaration was \nrevoked after the SERT teams had completed their arrest tasks. Facilitating the arrests of suspects by SERT \nteams was, it seems to me, inextricably linked to the making of the emergency declaration and the existence of the \npowers in s 8 of the PSA Act. Therefore, I deal with the applicants\u2019 allegations about a \u201cvisible and militaristic \npresence\u201d below, in the section where I deal with the conduct of the SERT teams.  Closing airspace, suspending \nferry services, commandeering the school, a school bus and vehicles were all consequences constituting \nrestrictions, as that word should be understood in s 9. In my opinion, the making and continuation of the emergency \ndeclaration therefore involved restrictions within the terms of s 9. The calling out of the SERT teams to effect the \nsearches for and apprehension of suspects might be characterised as a distinction and a restriction involved in the \nmaking of the emergency declaration, but I consider the better approach is to treat it as a separate alleged \ncontravention of s 9, as the applicants\u2019 submitted.  I refer to the \u201cmaking and continuation\u201d of the emergency \ndeclaration because the preferable characterisation for the purposes of s 9 is to see DI Webber\u2019s conduct as one \n\u201cact\u201d. The evidence is that once he made the declaration DI Webber intended it would continue to facilitate and \nsupport the SERT operation. Only once that operation was complete did he turn his mind to revocation.  Did the act \nof making and continuing the emergency declaration involve restrictions or distinctions based on race? In my \nopinion, only some of the restrictions and distinctions arising from, or involved in, the emergency declaration, were \nbased on race. Those were: the closing of the island to air traffic, and the suspension of ferry services except for \nthe evacuation of \u2018civilian non-ATSIs\u2019.  Why there was a need to shut down air and ferry services was not explained \nin the evidence. If there was concern about suspects fleeing, officers could have been stationed at both the airport \nand the ferry. All people who left the island would have been conspicuous and identifiable. The areas at the airport \nand the wharf where the ferry docks are both small and confined, and highly visible. These restrictions were \ndisproportionate, but in my opinion the QPS was not concerned about proportionate reactions because there was \nno real regard for the Palm Island community, nor for the effects of police conduct on them. The police did not \ncare. It was an Aboriginal community, a remote one at that, and the police were responding to what they saw as an \nuprising against them. There was, as I have found earlier, a strong sense of impunity in QPS conduct and \nresponses.  Indeed, in my opinion, as I explain below in relation to the arrests, entries and searches, the lack of \nproportion was deliberate. There was a deliberately heavy-handed and extreme reaction. It was an assertion of \nauthority, a subjugation. The QPS officers conducted themselves in an authoritarian manner, which is the way Palm \nIsland had historically been run, lest this community of Aboriginal people think they could take matters into their \nown hands without severe consequences.  The arrangements for the departure from the island of non-Aboriginal \npeople, mostly teaching staff, is a clear example of how these restrictions were based on race, and how the \nadministration of the restrictions was based on race.  I should note here that patients at the hospital (Indigenous \nand perhaps non-Indigenous, it is unclear on the evidence) were evacuated by the QPS from the hospital at \napproximately the same time as the confrontation in front of the hospital and shortly after the protests and fires. I \nconsider this evacuation to be in a different category because, at the time, the hospital was the location perceived \nto be at the centre of the confrontation. Apart from the medical evacuation, the evacuation of non-Aboriginal people \nfrom Palm Island occurred in two ways: through a flight SS Dini allowed to leave from the airport despite the \nNOTAM being in place, and through an organised ferry departure on the evening of 26 November 2004. I consider \neach separately.  Much of the evidence about these events is contained in the running logs maintained (at this time) \nby DSS Kitching in Townsville. The entries in the running logs constantly used the terms \u201cATSI\u201d and \u201cnon ATSI\u201d, \n\n\n\nwhere \u201cATSI\u201d meant (as the parties and relevant witnesses accepted) \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders\u201d or \nIndigenous people and \u201cnon ATSI\u201d referred to non-Indigenous people. The word \u201ccivilian\u201d was sometimes used in \nthe phrase \u201cCivilian non ATSI\u201d and, despite Inspector Kitching\u2019s prevarication in evidence, clearly referred to white \npeople who were not police (or perhaps army) officers. Thus, in the QPS universe of discourse there were white \npolice and army officers, and white civilians. And then there were Aboriginal people. Where entries in the running \nlog proved to be controversial, I found Inspector Kitching\u2019s explanations to be self-serving and unreliable. This was \na busy time and no doubt (then) DSS Kitching was pressed in his duties. As with some of Inspector Whyte\u2019s \nevidence and language, it is often the case that when people are pressed and busy, there is not time to tailor or \nmodify what they say or do, and it can be the case that people\u2019s true perspectives and understandings come \nthrough more clearly. However, Inspector Kitching was reluctant to accept responsibility for the entries, where it was \nobvious he was responsible. In my opinion, (then) DSS Kitching used the terms and language he did in the running \nlog because he was quite comfortable describing people in those ways, and describing them by reference to their \nrace. That was his perspective on how things were on Palm Island: there were the \u2018ATSIs\u2019 and there were the \u2018non \nATSIs\u2019. The reason for using those terms was so that people could be assigned to one group or the other, identified \nby race, and treated accordingly.  There were many other ways to describe people who lived on Palm Island. The \nimmediate example is simply to say \u201clocals\u201d. So when describing that some people left on the ferry on Friday night, \na non-racially based approach would have been to say a group of locals, or local teachers and families, left the \nisland. When the logs describe the arrest of an Aboriginal person, or the questioning of an Aboriginal person, the \nnon-racially based way to record that would simply be to say that a local man or woman was arrested or \nquestioned. But that is not what occurred. This evidence is significant because it is emblematic of the attitude which \npervaded many aspects of life on Palm Island: there were the white people, and there were the Aboriginal people. \nThis was a racially divided place and the division was maintained, at least up until 2004, by those white (or non-\nAboriginal) people who over the years had charge of the lives of Aboriginal people on the island. During the events \nwhich are the subject of this proceeding, the QPS, perhaps without any conscious thought (cf Qantas Airways v \nGama [2008] FCAFC 69; 167 FCR 537 at [76] (French and Jacobson JJ)), continued that divide.  Turning first to the \ndeparture of people by plane. It was an agreed fact that between 1.45 pm on 26 November 2004 and 1.30 pm on \n27 November 2004, all commercial flights to and from Palm Island were suspended, and this was because of the \nNOTAM issued by DI Webber as a consequence of the emergency declaration. It is clear on the evidence that once \nhe had landed at Palm Island airport (or, at the latest, once he had information back from the helicopter he sent on \na reconnaissance) DI Webber knew there was no threat to the airport, or for that matter to the roads around Palm \nIsland. The QPS continued to use the airport flying officers in and out, on both helicopters and planes. DI Webber \nalso accepted in cross-examination that a number of media representatives landed on the island on the Friday \nnight whilst the NOTAM was in effect (although, as I note at [1164] below, it appears the media representatives \narrived by boat). DI Webber sought to disclaim responsibility for the effect of the NOTAM:I simply asked for a notice \nto airmen to be issued in relation to the situation on Palm Island to alert air \u2013 alert \u2013 alert pilots, air crew, etcetera, \nof the situation, of the risks and dangers of landing at the airports, etcetera. I didn\u2019t take any control over vetting \nwhat aircraft should or shouldn\u2019t be landed.  This evidence does not disclose the real effect of the NOTAM, which in \nmy opinion DI Webber well understood. The effect of it was that those with the means (and the power) to use their \nown aircraft \u2013 the police, the army, government authorities \u2013 could still fly in and out. However, ordinary Palm \nIsland residents, who were dependent on commercial flights, would be at the mercy of the decision of commercial \noperators. Not surprisingly, and despite the evidence suggesting there were in fact no \u201crisks and dangers\u201d in landing \nat Palm Island airport and that DI Webber knew this shortly after he arrived on Palm Island, the decision taken by \ncommercial operators was to suspend ordinary commercial flights. Although the NOTAM was lifted at approximately \n1.30 pm on Saturday, 27 November 2004, commercial flights did not resume (allowing in practical terms for some \norganisational time, as the applicants submit) until approximately 12.30 pm on 28 November 2004.  Further, DI \nWebber\u2019s evidence is inconsistent with some of the contemporaneous records from the police running logs. At 2.15 \npm on 26 November 2004 there is an entry which reads:10 Mile exclusion zone around airport around Palm Airport \nnow secured  At 6.07 pm on 26 November 2004 there is an entry which reads:[Redacted] from Brisbane Control \nTower - Brisbane Airport advised Official flight exclusion zone 5 mile radius to 4000 feet in effect until 10am \ntomorrow 27/11/04 or until advised other wise by command centre.  At 9.30 am on 27 November 2004 there is an \nentry which reads:[Redacted] of Brisbane Traffic Control [redacted] re: exclusion zone which expires at 10.00am. \nAdvised emergent situation is still in force. Exclusion zone time frames are extended until at least 1600hrs. MIR will \nadvise Brisbane Traffic Control prior to 1600hrs if exclusion zone is required after that time.  And at 1.33 pm on 27 \n\n\n\nNovember 2004 there is an entry which reads:Exclusion zone has been lifted by Acting AC. Phone call made to \n[redacted] Brisbane Air Traffic Control. Comco advised.  The executive briefing notes that were being prepared also \nreferred to an \u201cair craft exclusion zone\u201d designed \u201cto exclude any non police related aircraft\u201d.  Therefore, if the \nsituation on Palm Island was as dire as the QPS projected it was, if people were in fear of their lives and the \nsituation was so dangerous that an emergency declaration needed to be made, it appears that QPS officers were \nunconcerned whether the Aboriginal residents on Palm Island might also want to leave. Or, as I discuss below, \nwhether Aboriginal people stuck in Townsville might wish to rush back to be with their families. There are two \nexplanations for why no regard was paid to these issues. First, because the QPS officers were not concerned about \nany risks or dangers to Aboriginal people on Palm Island, nor to any inconvenience and anxiety caused by \nseparating Aboriginal people in Townsville from their families. Second, these measures were all part of a heavy-\nhanded response, and in order to justify that heavy-handed response, the risks and dangers said to be present on \nthe island had to be elevated and emphasised. It had to look like there was a siege or a battle underway. That was \nhow calling in SERT could be justified. In my opinion, it is likely that both explanations were at work.  Although, \naside from the hospital patients, the QPS did not allow any Aboriginal people to travel to or from Palm Island, the \nQPS did arrange for SS Hurley\u2019s dog to be removed from the island. At 12.15 am on 28/11/04, the QPS log \nrecords:Call from Comco that S/Sgt HURLEY\u2019s dog has just arrived on the police launch from Palm Island in a \ndistressed condition. Comco advised by S/Sgt LAST to contact HURLEY re approval for vetinary [sic] treatment for \ndog.  No oral evidence was led about SS Hurley\u2019s dog. The point is not to criticise the compassionate approach \ntaken by QPS officers to the dog. It is to contrast it with the approach to the Aboriginal people who lived on Palm \nIsland.  Neither DI Webber nor any other witness called on behalf of the respondents offered any explanation for \nthe inconsistent approach to who could leave and who could arrive on Palm Island. None was given in \nsubmissions. Rather, what was emphasised was the short period of time during which the NOTAM was in effect. As \nI have noted above, the evidence shows that the practical effect was for a day or so longer. The period of time \ndoes not affect the inconsistencies in the way people were treated and does not affect my findings that the acts \ninvolved distinctions based on race.  The respondents are correct to submit that the evidence discloses only one \ncertain example of an Aboriginal resident of Palm Island who was affected by the suspension of commercial flights. \nAt 8.55 am on 27 November 2004 there is an entry in the police running log which reads as follows (with names \nredacted):Contacted by Det. M WYTE from State. Op comm.. advising that a [redacted] who resides on Palm \nIsland is currently waiting at Inland Pacific airway, at the airport wanting to know who to get back to PI. Tried \ncontacting [redacted] nil answer. WHYTE can be contacted on [redacted] concerned about family members. \nContacted WHYTE referred information in case [redacted] contacted again.  However since there are several \ncommercial flights each day, it is a reasonable inference that there were other people, both on Palm Island and in \nTownsville, who would otherwise have been travelling between the two places. I am prepared to infer that was the \ncase.  This may be contrasted with access to the island provided by QPS officers to the media. The police running \nlog records that additional media personnel began arriving on the island at 1.45 am on 27 November 2004, prior to \nthe commencement of the arrests, entries and searches. It appears, from an executive briefing note that was in \nevidence (exhibit A133), that those individuals arrived by boat and that the QPS officers at the command post on \nthe island were aware of their arrival. Indeed, it is likely, and I am prepared to infer, there was some conscious \narrangement in place, despite the emergency declaration. At 8.41 am and 8.51 am on 28 November 2004, after the \nNOTAM had been lifted but before commercial flights or ferries had recommenced, two media helicopters also \narrived on the island. Thus, QPS officers were prepared to facilitate media personnel coming to the island while \nlocal residents who were on the mainland were unable to do so. Similarly, Palm Island residents could not leave.  \nThe second aspect is the departure by air of some non-Aboriginal people who were living on Palm Island. At 2.40 \npm on 26 November 2004 there is an entry in the police running log which records:20 Civilian Non Atsi at airport  \nDSS Kitching was responsible for these log entries. He was asked in cross-examination whether this was an entry \nabout getting these people off the island and said he could not recall. About 20 minutes later, at 1500 hours, this \nwas recorded as a report from Inspector Kachel:20 + dog handler on the island have landed. Concerns that \ncivilians will be at risk if left by the police at airport alone. Instructions for police on Palm to go to the hospital via \nMango Avenue only due possible. Instructions from HOWELL - leave 5 at the airport to look after civilians.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    I accept the applicants\u2019 submissions that this entry refers to the 20 \u201cNon Atsi\u201d civilians to which \nthe earlier entry relates. That is, there was group of non-Aboriginal people gathered at the airport who wanted to \nleave the island. Five police officers were apparently left to \u201clook after\u201d these non-Aboriginal people. The only \n\n\n\ninformation about any violence on the island at this time was the rock throwing, abuse and threats being directed at \npolice officers in the town area, and the fires that had been lit at the police buildings. However, the police conduct \nin leaving five police officers (armed, it would appear from other evidence, as all officers arriving on the island \nwere armed to some extent) to \u201clook after\u201d non-Aboriginal residents indicated the extent of the racial divide which \npermeated all police conduct on the island. The assumption was made that all non-Aboriginal people could be \nattacked and that the attackers would be Aboriginal. The assumption was that no Aboriginal people could be \nattacked, and there was no need to assign police officers (in a 1 to 4 ratio) to look after any Aboriginal people.  \nInspector Dini, who was present at the airport, gave evidence that the persons waiting there were eventually \nallowed to leave because:if we kept them on the island then we would be responsible for them and we didn\u2019t want \nthem \u2013 to put them in a dangerous situation so when the pilot asked if he could leave the airport and take the \npassengers with him it seemed to me a logical idea at the time. I wasn\u2019t aware that there was an exclusion zone in \nplace or that I couldn\u2019t let them go so I made a decision to let them go and I did.  When this evidence is read with \nInspector Dini\u2019s earlier evidence about the commandeering of the QBuild vehicles, it is a reasonable inference that \nmany of the people waiting at the airport to leave were contract workers who had completed their working week and \nwere due to head back to Townsville for the weekend. They were not local residents fleeing from danger. This may \nmake SS Dini\u2019s decision to allow the plane to take off and take these people off the island more explicable. \nHowever, why it was seen there was a need to have five police officers remain to \u201clook after\u201d this group of people \ncan only be explained as stemming from the stereotypical apprehension of what the local Aboriginal residents \nintended to do, and were capable of doing, to a group of non-Aboriginal workers unconnected with the reasons that \nlocal people were directing their anger towards the police.  I turn now to the use of the ferry to allow non-Aboriginal \npeople to leave the island. Much of the evidence about what happened is drawn from the police running log. At \n1.10 pm on 26 November 2004, the following entry is recorded:Call from a [redacted] at SunFerries. He normally \nhas a run to Palm Island and arrives at Palm. Not taking any passengers. Has himself plus 3 can take 150  There is \nthen a series of entries, starting at 4.15 pm, which indicate first that the Catholic Education Office staff on the island \nhad been told a ferry was arriving at 5.20 pm. Then at 4.17 pm Inspector Richardson called to advise that he was \n\u201corganising civilians for the 5.30 ferry\u201d. At 4.51 pm, Education Queensland and Catholic Education staff were told \nthey should board the ferry at 6.20 pm. At 5.20 pm there is the following entry:Request from - Captain of ferry \n\u201cHarding Explore\u201d requesting direction on collection of passengers. RICHARDSON contacted and requesting that \nferry wait in the channel until 6pm at this stage before entering harbour. Contact made with [redacted] on vessel. \nWill be advised when safe. RICHARDSON will advise when safe to enter jetty.  At 5.32 pm, there was a request \nfrom the State Emergency Service (SES) in Townsville for numbers of people returning to Townsville on the ferry.  \nAt 6.11 pm, the following entry appears:Advice from (Sun Ferries) 30 people on board Ferry from school staff and \nreturning to Townsville. Includes children. Some have chosen to stay on the Island. Includes both EQ and private \nschool members. Will be docking at Sun Ferries at 2020hrs Townsville. reports that blowing a gale and will be very \nrough for passengers. QAS will dispatch units upon arrival in Townsville.  At 8.08 pm, this entry described the \narrival of the ferry in Townsville:Advice from \u201cHarding Explorer\u201d ferry preparing to dock in Townsville. Some sea sick \npersons on board. Advised QAS, Counsellor from Lifeline and SES would be on hand. SES will transport persons to \naccommodation or organise for those who do not have any accommodation.  The evidence shows an orchestrated \noperation to allow predominantly non-Aboriginal people who wished to leave the island to do so. The ferry had, in \nmy opinion, been specifically commandeered for this purpose. The only contact prior to the ferry\u2019s departure about \nwho would be getting on it was with Education Queensland and Catholic Education staff. Again, if the fear was of \ngeneralised violence and lawlessness it is inexplicable why police were not out contacting all members of the local \ncommunity to see who wanted to leave (especially since the focus of these records seems to be on women and \nchildren, of which there were many on Palm Island). If the fear was of lawlessness and violence from Aboriginal \npeople targeting non-Aboriginal people who just happened to be resident on the island (such as teachers) there \nwas no objective basis for such a fear and in my opinion it arose from the racially based stereotyping of Aboriginal \npeople and how they were inclined to behave.  It is true that in answer to a question from me, Inspector Dini gave \nevidence that if Indigenous people had arrived at the ferry and indicated they wanted to get on and leave the \nisland, he would not have stopped them, and he would have \u201cblown up\u201d if anybody tried to stop them. I accept his \nevidence that he personally may have had this reaction, but the more pertinent question is why no local Palm \nIslanders did turn up to try to leave on the ferry. The ferry and the ferry dock are very close to the school and public \nbuildings in the \u2018town\u2019 part of Palm Island. In my opinion there are several answers. First, for the reason I have \ngiven, it was clear that QPS officers were in charge of that ferry service at that time \u2013 they dictated when the ferry \n\n\n\nwould arrive, when it could dock, when it could leave, and QPS officers had arranged for identified non-Aboriginal \npeople to be the primary passengers. The reason for the ferry being allowed to dock at all was, in my opinion, to \nallow non-Aboriginal people on the island to leave, if they wished to. I consider it highly unlikely any local Aboriginal \npeople would have felt at all comfortable or safe approaching the ferry in those circumstances and asking to leave \non it.  Just as importantly, however, in my opinion the evidence does not support the existence of any widespread \nor substantial fears amongst the local community for their safety and wellbeing because of what had happened on \nFriday, 26 November 2004. Fear existed amongst the non-Aboriginal police officers and it was the police officers \nwho were gearing up for confrontation and whipping up apprehensions of all sorts of potential conflicts and \nviolence, most of which turned out (quickly) to be false.  For example at 4.59 pm the following is recorded in the \nrunning log:Brief that Islanders are presently breaking into Palm Island Service station and concern is that \nIslanders may light service station leaving no fuel on the Island.  Then, at 5.38 pm, this entry:Service Station was \nnot broken into and is now secured by police and under guard.  From the contemporaneous video evidence and \nthe evidence about the arrests, entries and searches, most people on Palm Island (families, children, the elderly) \nwere going about their daily lives. The militaristic battle impressions of the situation on the island came almost \nwholly from the police officers, and were without a doubt occasioned by the extraordinary increase in police \npresence on the island.  Finally, a police log entry at 8.08 pm records the Lifeline counselling facilities which had \nbeen put in place for the people who left on the ferry when they arrived in Townsville. This is in stark contrast to the \nabsence of any such efforts for the Palm Island community after the death of Mulrunji a week earlier. No Lifeline \ncounsellors were sent to Palm Island.  I refer to one more topic of evidence to underline why I have found that the \nrestrictions imposed as a consequence of the emergency declaration were based on race. There was a meeting of \nthe Palm Island Council on the Saturday night, attended by SS Dini and Inspector Kachel.  The applicants\u2019 \nsubmissions focus on the attitudes shown by Inspector Kachel to the community concerns raised at that meeting, \nincluding by Ms Kyle, the mayor. It can now be seen from other evidence in this proceeding that one reason QPS \nofficers such as Inspector Kachel were not taking very seriously the complaints made by Mayor Kyle is that she was \nconsidered one of the two major suspects in the events of 26 November 2004, along with Mr Wotton. An entry in \nthe police running log at 6.16 pm on 26 November 2004 makes this clear:Person of interest 2\n\n Erica Kyle. Chairwoman of council. KYLE was with victims family as post mortem results were explained to them \nby the doctor. During the riot she was positioned with the crowd with a loud hailer to incite the crowd. Her claims \nwere that the deceased had several ribs broken, had a liver punctured and bled to death in half an hour. Suspicions \nare that she was involved in some capacity behind the scenes inciting the affray. At one point KYLE invited the \nInspector to come from the hospital to the Council Chambers to discuss the circumstances of the situation.  It is \nremarkable that an official police record would describe what Mayor Kyle said about Mulrunji\u2019s death as \u201cclaims\u201d. \nShe was, DSS Kitching well knew, announcing the results of the autopsy report. It was not a \u201cclaim\u201d. The falsity at \nwork in this entry indicates the lengths to which QPS officers were going to portray decent, responsible local people \nas criminals, and to diminish the tragedy of Mulrunji\u2019s death.  Inspector Dini gave evidence about the Council \nmeeting, which was held at the school turned police command post on Saturday, 27 November 2004. I accept \nInspector Dini\u2019s evidence about what occurred at the meeting. Members of the Palm Island Council and other \ncommunity members were present. Inspector Dini described being aware of significant anger towards the police. \nCouncil members said the police should leave the island. Inspector Dini described Inspector Kachel\u2019s concern as \nmostly about recovering the \u2018missing\u2019 rifle. The contemporaneous police log is consistent with Inspector Dini\u2019s \nevidence. It also records that Mayor Kyle expressed concerns about \u201cthe scale of police presence\u201d, why the police \nhad \u201coccupied the school as a command post\u201d and \u201chow long the police would remain on the island\u201d. Inspector \nDini accepted the police were concerned only about \u201csecurity\u201d and not about the effect that the police operation \nwas having on the community. Mr Blackman Senior, a witness who attended the meeting, gave this evidence:What \nhappened? Can you tell the judge what happened, what you recall happened?---Well, they called a meeting, like, in \nthe council chambers with \u2013 with a PLO again, Police Liaison Officer Danny. Danny, I think his name was, at the \ntime, and went into the meeting and all they were talking about was a rifle missing from the barracks up there. \nThat\u2019s all they were \u2013 that\u2019s all they were talking about. You know, I thought they were going to give us answers to, \nyou know, a bit more about what happened to Cameron.\n\n\n\n But they were just talking about the rifle?---That\u2019s what they was talking about, just the rifle. That\u2019s all they was \nworried about, was a rifle.  This evidence is consistent with the findings I have made on other allegations made by \nthe applicants about the attitude of QPS officers. It was most apparent during this weekend, when taking into \naccount all the evidence relevant to this period, the death of Mulrunji had been entirely forgotten and replaced with \nan obsessive concern by QPS officers to re-establish police authority in a forceful way on the island, and to \navenge the burning of the police station and the frightening of police officers. Not because it was wilful property \ndamage, but because it was the police station that was burned, and because it was their own officers who were \nfrightened and abused. I see no concern for the community of Palm Island in the conduct of police over this \nweekend. As I have said, there was in any event no evidence of any threats to the safety of all the ordinary people \nliving on Palm Island.  One aspect of the declaration which was expressly challenged was that it extended to the \nwhole of Palm Island, when on the applicants\u2019 submissions the only emergency situation, if there was one, was \nconcentrated around the police station and the police barracks. Given the evidence to which I refer above, in my \nopinion there was some basis, at least at the time the declaration was made, for DI Webber reasonably to be \nsatisfied it was appropriate to make a declaration covering the whole island. The characteristic of Palm Island, as \nan island, lent itself to an approach to containment which extended across the island, especially given the airport \n(one of the two main means of getting on and off the island) was some distance from the township area where the \npolice station was located. It seems to me the real issue about the coverage of the declaration is the same as that \nconcerning the duration of the declaration: once DI Webber was on Palm Island, and the fires were extinguished \nand the confrontation between police and some locals in front of the hospital had dispersed, what was the \ncontinuing purpose for the declaration over the entire island? Asking that question assists in answering the first \nlimb of s 9(1) of the RDA.  Making and continuing the emergency declaration could have led to conduct authorised \nunder the PSP Act which was protective of the safety of all members of the Palm Island community, and which was \naimed at addressing the risks and damage from the fires. Restrictions (such as travel or movement restrictions) \nmight have been imposed, equally, on all persons on Palm Island. That is not what occurred and therein lies the \ncontravention of s 9. Rather, a series of distinctions and restrictions flowed, giving rise to differential treatment \nwhich was based on race.  Similarly, for there to be a contravention of s 9, it is not necessary that all consequences \nflowing from an act such as the making of the emergency declaration involve restrictions and distinctions based on \nrace. There may be some restrictions and distinctions which were not at all racially based. In the present case, any \nrestrictions imposed by QPS officers so as to deal with the fires and damage to buildings (such as cordoning off \nareas and the like) could be an example, although there is no evidence about any such activities. In my opinion, the \ncommandeering of vehicles, the school bus and the school were not distinctions and restrictions involved in the \nemergency declaration that were based on race. They were the kinds of conduct flowing from an emergency \nsituation that may have occurred in any remote and inaccessible community. If most of the consequences fell \nequally on all persons without distinction as to race, but certain of the consequences resulted in differential \ntreatment for some persons based on race, that may be factor affecting relief. However, it would not preclude a \nconclusion of a contravention of s 9.\n\nThe Court of Appeal decision in Poynter  In responding to allegations about the emergency declaration and the \nexistence of an \u201cemergency situation\u201d, the respondents placed reliance on observations by the Queensland Court of \nAppeal in R v Poynter, Norman & Parker; ex parte A-G (Qld) [2006] QCA 517, especially at [3]-[6] and [34]-[38] (de \nJersey CJ, Chesterman J agreeing). This case concerned appeals by the Attorney-General of Queensland against \nthe sentences initially imposed on Jason Poynter, Alissa Norman and Russell Parker Senior as described at [371] \nabove. The Court\u2019s observations are partially descriptive, partially opinion. They involve characterisations by \nmembers of the Court of Appeal about what happened during the protests and fires. I am not aware what evidence \nthe Court of Appeal had on which their Honours based their observations. It may or may not be the same evidence \nthat was before this Court. It most certainly was in a different context. This Court has no information concerning \nwhat facts were placed in issue in the Court of Appeal (or at trial) between the parties and what were not. The \napplicants are correct to identify s 91 of the Evidence Act as having application to the submissions of the \nrespondents based on the Court of Appeal decision. The findings of fact in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment are not \nadmissible in this proceeding to prove the truth of those facts.  As the applicants also submit, many of the adverse \nfindings by the Court of Appeal were not put to Mr Wotton in cross-examination in this proceeding. Apart from the \nprovisions of the Evidence Act, I do not consider this Court is bound or should be influenced by the opinions \nexpressed by the Court of Appeal about the nature of the threats to police, nor the characterisation of other events \n\n\n\nrelated by the Court of Appeal. Their Honours\u2019 function was quite different to the Court\u2019s function in the present \nproceeding.\n\nThe delay in issuing the emergency declaration certificate  There was some extensive cross-examination of DI \nWebber about why he filled in this certificate well after the event (his evidence was he filled it out on 28 November \n2004 and the approval parts were not signed off by his commanding officers until well into December 2004). The \ndelay was also one of the grounds of attack on the making of the declaration. The certificate was, as s 6 indicates, \nto be completed \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the declaration. Thus, s 6 contemplates the sequence of events \nwhich in fact occurred on this occasion: namely that an oral declaration would be made by a commissioned officer, \nand the basis for that declaration would subsequently be made clear in the relevant certificate. That process is a \nrational one for emergency situations where swift action is likely to be required.  DI Webber\u2019s evidence was that he \nfilled out the form on 28 November 2004, on the Sunday morning, while he was still on Palm Island but after the \ncommunications and command centre at the school was up and running, at approximately the same time he \nrevoked the emergency declaration. Although it may not be best practice, DI Webber can hardly be criticised in the \ncircumstances of having his priorities elsewhere than in completing the s 6 certificate. As he pointed out in his \nevidence, he was on his way to Palm Island when he made the declaration, and when he arrived there, the police \nstation had burnt down: there were no computers, no forms to fill in, and the police officers were still in a \nconfrontational situation with a group of local people out the front of the hospital. After the situation at the hospital \ndefused, the focus was on setting up a command centre and pursuing those responsible for the fires, a not \nunreasonable course of action. It is true that an emergency declaration triggers authorisation to use a range of \ncoercive powers and therefore the certificate is of some significance as evidence that the preconditions contained in \ns 6 existed. I do not consider that DI Webber\u2019s delay in completing the certificate, of itself, had any effect on its \nlawfulness or, more importantly involved any contravention of s 9 of the RDA.\n\nOther aspects of the applicants\u2019 contentions regarding the emergency declaration  Some of the conduct I have \ndiscussed above is relied on independently by the applicants as a contravention of s 9. This conduct is, in my \nopinion, properly characterised as a restriction or distinction involved in the making and continuation of the \nemergency declaration. This conclusion applies to the following conduct: the commandeering of the school bus, the \nuse of the school (although the applicants do not complain about that), the suspension of air and ferry services, and \nthe departure of certain people on the ferry and by air. They should not be seen, in this context and for the \npurposes of s 9, as separate \u201cacts\u201d involving distinctions or restrictions. They were the restrictions or distinctions \ninvolved in the act of making and continuing the emergency declaration.  The applicants also contend that the \ncertificate issued by DI Webber contained \u201cinadequate particulars\u201d because it did not set out the nature of the \nemergency situation on Palm Island and instead simply included a reference to para (f) of the definition of \n\u201cemergency situation\u201d in the Schedule to the PSP Act. This is not a contention which can properly be seen as an act \ninvolving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference for the purposes of s 9. Nor, if that point were reached, \ncould it be said to have impaired any rights of the Palm Island group members.\n\nConclusions on the emergency declaration claims  By reference to the applicants\u2019 final submissions at [376]-[433], \nand the applicants\u2019 summary submissions at [13]-[15], read with the third further amended statement of claim at \n[269]-[278], [289]-[292] and [297]-[299], I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the following conduct \nconstituted acts involving restrictions or distinctions based on race for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA.  The act of DI \nWebber in making and continuing the emergency declaration involved restrictions and distinctions. The restrictions \nwere the closing of the island to commercial aircraft and the limit on access to the ferry. The distinctions were the \narrangements made for \u201cnon-ATSI\u201d people to leave the island and the arrangements made for the protection of \n\u201cnon-ATSI\u201d people on the island.  The way in which non-Aboriginal people (primarily teaching staff, it would seem) \nwere given particular opportunities to leave the island by ferry, with those opportunities apparently being planned \nand executed especially for them, is also capable of being characterised as a preference for the purpose of s 9.  \nThe restrictions, distinctions, and preference were based on race. The effective closure of the island and the \nimposition of a disproportionately large police presence on the island, including armed SERT officers, occurred \nbecause the unrest had taken place in an Aboriginal community, and in the Palm Island Aboriginal community in \nparticular. An overwhelming show of force against that community was the instinctive reaction of the QPS officers \nresponsible.  The burden of the restrictions fell disproportionately on local Aboriginal people \u2013 such as the closing of \n\n\n\nthe island\u2019s air and ferry transport services. The criterion of difference, directly or indirectly, was whether a person \nwas \u201cATSI\u201d or \u201cnon-ATSI\u201d. Further, the evidence shows some services were offered conspicuously to the non-\nAboriginal people who had been allowed to leave the island \u2013 such as the Lifeline counselling services. The way \nMayor Kyle and the other local Aboriginal people were treated at the local Council meeting when they complained \nabout the police and SERT presence, and the way their complaints (including about the lack of progress on the \ninvestigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death) were ignored, is evidence of the disregard shown by QPS officers for the \nconcerns and anxiety of the Palm Island community about the police presence. In their view, this was an \nAboriginal community which was to be controlled, including by restricting access to the island, and the persons to \nbe protected (by force if necessary) were the police officers and the non-Aboriginal residents of the island.\n\nFourth category: the use of SERT    There was considerable debate in final submissions about what exactly it was \nthat the applicants challenged about the deployment and use of SERT over the three days of 26 to 28 November \n2004. The respondents correctly submitted that there were no allegations in the third further amended statement of \nclaim or in the applicants\u2019 written submissions that the initial decision to deploy SERT (or PSRT) to Palm Island \nwas an act contravening s 9 of the RDA. The applicants\u2019 written submissions on this topic were somewhat difficult \nto follow, raising a plethora of arguments which were not necessarily connected to each other in a readily \nunderstandable way. In final oral submissions, senior counsel for the applicants clarified that what was under \nchallenge was the entries and searches of the applicants\u2019 houses, and the houses of the subgroup members, and \nthe manner in which those were conducted. She accepted there was no challenge to the decision to deploy SERT \nand PSRT to Palm Island. It was submitted that the use of SERT to conduct the arrests, entries and searches was \nunnecessary, unwarranted, and occurred (at all, and in the manner it did) only because Palm Island was an \nisolated Aboriginal community.  The applicants apparently accepted that even though completed after the event, the \n\u201cmission\u201d part of DI Webber\u2019s request for the SERT team (see [335] above) was an accurate description of what the \nSERT teams were deployed to do. Based on this document, the applicants submitted there were a number of \ngeneral \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d tasks the SERT teams could have performed on Palm Island. Sending SERT officers to \neffect the apprehension of suspects was, the applicants submitted, an overreaction and over-policing and only \noccurred because Palm Island was an Aboriginal community. In other words, the act of racial discrimination is said \nto be the way the operation was executed once the SERT officers arrived on the island: sending teams of officers \nin riot gear, the way suspects were apprehended, the way houses were entered and searched, the way firearms \nwere used (although not discharged).  This is the principal area of the applicants\u2019 claim where the contentions made \non behalf of the subgroup, and on behalf of the applicants personally, diverge somewhat from the contentions \napplicable to all Palm Island group members and require separate consideration.  The claims in this category made \non behalf of the applicants and all Palm Island group members (aside from those I have considered in these \nreasons already) appear to be:(a) the establishment by the QPS on Palm Island of a visible and militaristic \npresence; and \n\n (b) the behaviour by QPS members in a disrespectful and intimidatory manner.  The claims which are made on \nbehalf of the applicants and the subgroup (being all persons whose houses were entered and searched by SERT \nofficers and those who were present at or around the houses) are:(a) the formation of an action plan which required \nthat DS Robinson identify the persons to be arrested;\n\n (b) the preparation of a list of persons to be arrested by DSS Miles in Townsville on the night of 26 November \n2004; and\n\n (c) the failure to obtain a warrant for the arrest of any person arrested in the presence of SERT and PSRT officers \nin connection with the events on Palm Island of 26 November 2004.  In closing submissions, the applicants also \ncontended that the arrests, entries and searches were carried out in an arbitrary way. I address those contentions \nafer addressing the first three claims made on behalf of the applicants and the subgroup.  The claims which are \ncurrently made on behalf of the applicants only are:(a) the entry and search by SERT officers of the dwelling of the \nfirst and third applicants on 27 November 2004;\n\n\n\n (b) the entry and search by SERT officers of the dwelling of the second applicant on 27 November 2004;\n\n (c) the use of unnecessary force and unnecessary disturbance of occupants in the entry and search of the home of \nthe first and third applicants;\n\n (d) the use of unnecessary force and unnecessary disturbance of occupants in the entry and search of the home of \nthe second applicant; \n\n (e) the ransacking of the home of the first and third applicants; \n\n (f) the damage to property in the home of the second applicant; \n\n (g) the arrest of the third applicant; \n\n (h) the use in the arrest of the first applicant of more force than was necessary; \n\n (i) the use in the arrest of the third applicant of more force than was necessary; \n\n (j) the subjection of the first applicant to violence including the use of a taser; \n\n (k) the holding of the first applicant at gunpoint whilst he was unarmed; \n\n (l) the holding of the third applicant at gunpoint whilst she was unarmed; \n\n (m) the forcing of the first applicant to lie face down with guns pointed at him; \n\n (n) the forcing of the third applicant to lie face down with guns pointed at her; \n\n (o) the pointing of guns at the children of the first and third applicants; and\n\n (p) the forcing of the children of the first and third applicants to lie face down with guns pointed at them.  Into this \nlast category (claims made on behalf of the applicants only) falls much of the evidence from the applicants\u2019 \nwitnesses about what happened during the entries and searches. The applicants submit, and the respondents \naccept, that the Court is at this stage confined to considering relief in this category only in relation to what happened \nto the first, second and third applicants at their homes. Although the applicants accept there is some considerable \noverlap in the evidence, they submit that the claims of the subgroup members can only be determined after the \nCourt\u2019s determination of the first, second and third applicants\u2019 claims in this respect. The respondents\u2019 written \nsubmissions (at [489]) appear to accept this position. The parties therefore agree that the Court\u2019s findings of fact \nand law concerning s 9 in relation to the applicants will, insofar as those findings are common to the claims of the \nsubgroup members, be applicable to them.  Returning to the list at [1207] above, as with other aspects of the \napplicants\u2019 case, it is not apparent why the applicants have chosen to divide what they identify as an \u201cact\u201d for the \npurposes of s 9 into so many individual pieces of conduct. This is an artificial way to approach the application of s 9. \nAppropriately, it was not an approach maintained by the applicants in the summary of their final submissions. By \nthat stage, the applicants grouped their contentions about the arrests, entries and searches into three categories: \nthe SERT action plan and methodology; the arrests by SERT officers; and the entries and searches by SERT \nofficers. These categories however were difficult to match up with the way the claims were put in this part of the \nproceeding in relation to all the group members, the subgroup, and the applicants alone, and for that reason I do \nnot propose to use them.  The way I propose to structure this part of my reasons is to begin with some preliminary \n\n\n\nfindings about the way in which the SERT teams came to be deployed to Palm Island. These findings are relevant \nto the claims made on behalf of all the group members, but they also establish the foundation for my findings about \nthe claims of the subgroup and of the applicants. I will next consider the claims put on behalf of the group members, \nsuch as the disproportionate and militaristic policing response. I will then consider the three aspects of the use of \nSERT said to contravene s 9 in relation to the applicants and the subgroup members. Finally, I will consider the \naspects of the use of the SERT teams said to contravene s 9 only in relation to the first, second and third \napplicants, although elements of these claims involve questions common to the subgroup members.\n\nHow the SERT teams came to be deployed  In s 2.26.1 of the OPM, SERT\u2019s role and function was described in the \nfollowing way:The primary role of the SERT is to:\n\n (i) respond to terrorist incidents within the arrangements agreed to under the State Antiterrorist Plan;\n\n (ii) provide specialist police capability to resolve high risk situations and incidents which were potentially violent \nand exceed normal capabilities of the QPS;\n\n (iii) provide assistance to all police with low risk tasks which require specialist equipment, skills or tactics; and\n\n (iv) provide a rescue function in incidents which require specialised recovery techniques.  DI Webber saw a clear \nconnection between the emergency declaration he had made and the ability to deploy PSRT and SERT \nofficers:Well, when I declared the emergency situation to exist, I suppose that initiated an activation plan for them \u2013 \nfor them to actually attend to assist other officers. At the actual determination of what involvement \u2013 I suppose \u2013 \nthey have, it has to be \u2013 I suppose \u2013 agreed to by one of the deputy commissioners.  The request for SERT officers \nwas not made in writing on or about 26 November 2004, and the call out procedure set out in s 2.26.3 of the OPM \nwas not followed by DI Webber. DI Webber\u2019s evidence was unclear about when he completed the written document \nwhich the OPM directed be completed as the formal request for SERT. There are two versions of the SERT request \nin evidence: the first has 2 cover letters, and the authorisation sections are incomplete. The second has the \nauthorisation sections completed.  The first version (exhibit A79) includes a memo from DI Webber to A/C \nMcDonnell which attaches the SERT request. This is dated 9 December 2004, almost two weeks after the events. \nIn that memo, DI Webber informs A/C McDonnell that the request for SERT form has been completed and \nrecommends it be forwarded to the A/C Operations Support Command \u201cas requested\u201d.  Despite his uncertainty in \noral evidence, DI Webber did clearly concede that he did not fill out this form until \u201csome days later\u201d after returning \nto Townsville. In my opinion it is likely he completed it on or about the date he sent it to A/C McDonnell: namely, 9 \nDecember 2004.  As to why the document needed to be produced after the event, DI Webber\u2019s evidence was:This \nwas not produced for anything other than the information and the records of the police service.  He denied the \ndelay in completing it signified this documentation requirement was unimportant, but he contended there were other \npriorities at the time.  I have set out the text of the completed form at [335] above. The content of the form is divided \ninto a number of parts. The first is an outline of the incident or situation. In this part DI Webber gives a detailed \ndescription of the incident, in terms the applicants strongly contested. There were several statements to the effect \nthat offenders could be armed, and would pose a serious threat to safety and good order on the island, and serious \nthreat to life.  Then there is a heading for identifying the offenders or suspects, and other possible \u201coccupants\u201d, \nincluding any criminal histories. No identifying information about suspects or occupants is included there, although \nthose identities were all known to DI Webber at the time he filled this out. There are then sections for particulars of \nvehicles (which DI Webber marked \u201cN/a\u201d, although the QPS had seized and used vehicles) and particulars of \nweapons offenders may have had access to. In the general section outlining the situation, DI Webber wrote \nthat:Persons on the island are capable of using lethal force including rocks, molotov cocktails and have access to \nother weapons including knives, machetes, spears and possibly stolen police firearms.  In the weapons section, he \nwrote:It is suspected a QPS Mini-14 rifle may have been looted from the Police Barracks prior to it being burnt \ndown. Offenders have shown a propensity to use rocks, molotov cocktails and iron bars as weapons. Offenders \nhave ready access to other weapons including knives, machetes, and spears.  While it was \u201csuspected\u201d on the \nevening of 26 November 2004 that a QPS rifle was missing, the rifle was found in the police barracks on 8 \n\n\n\nDecember 2004, the day before DI Webber appears to have filled out the form. It is the rifle Constable Robertson \nhad taken with him, so he could use it as needs be, as shown in his video taken on 26 November 2004. I return to \nthe missing rifle at [1446] below.  The document identified the request to SERT as being to perform the function \noutlined in s 2.26.1(ii) of the OPM, namely to \u201cProvide a specialist police capability to resolve a high risk situation \nwhich is potentially violent and exceed normal police capabilities; (i.e. defeat fortification, detain armed high risk \noffenders)\u201d. Under the heading \u201cMission\u201d, DI Webber stated:SERT to travel to Palm Island and undertake the \nfollowing tasks:  To provide security to police members on Palm Island and regain control of public order on the \nIsland.  To assist investigators to locate and detain wanted persons and associates by tactical methods.  To assist \nin provision of ongoing policing of Palm Island and to provide security and protection of QPS employees and \nproperty on Palm Island.  Inexplicably, DI Webber signed and dated the form with the date of 26 November 2004 at \n1400 hours, which he admitted he knew to be incorrect. He agreed in cross-examination that this presented a false \npicture to the reader. DI Webber insisted under cross-examination that the content of this document was \n\u201ccompleted in relation to what was acting upon my knowledge and my request at the time\u201d, and was not an attempt \nafter the event to make the situation seem more dire than it was. This exchange occurred, in relation to those parts \nof what he had written that turned out not to be true, and which he knew not to be true before he typed up the \ndocument:So why would you include something that\u2019s patently false?---Because that\u2019s what was acting upon my \nmind at the time of \u2013 of the original request.  I accept that in some respects DI Webber may have put the date he \ndid on this document, and included matters he later knew to be incorrect, as a way of indicating that what he wrote \nwas what was operating on his mind at the time he made the emergency declaration. Nevertheless this does not \nexplain the whole content of the document and indeed is inconsistent with it. DI Webber wrote factual assertions in \nthis document that he did not know on 26 November 2004. Statements from the transcript of what David Bulsey \nsaid at the community meeting, which DI Webber inserted word for word into this document, are a good example. \nAnother is the missing rifle, which according to the police logs was first recorded as missing by DSS Kitching at \n8.54 pm on 26 November 2004, so it is untrue that DI Webber knew it was missing when he made the emergency \ndeclaration and asked for SERT around the middle of that day. In my opinion DI Webber drafted this document in a \nway that elevated the impression of risk on 26 to 28 November 2004, and located the risk in generalised violence of \nthe Palm Island community, as well as violence towards police officers. He presented an account that sought to \njustify, as much as possible, the calling in of SERT officers to Palm Island.  The applicants sought to use the \nreconstruction of those events as evidence that DI Webber was prejudiced towards Aboriginal people. I have \nalready made findings that DI Webber, like other QPS officers, tended to stereotype Palm Islanders; was dismissive \nof, and disinterested in, their frustration and sense of injustice over Mulrunji\u2019s death; and did not take their accounts \nof events seriously. However, in filling out this form in my opinion DI Webber had other purposes. He was \nconcerned to justify what was a tremendous deployment of personnel and equipment, all flown to the island at \nenormous cost, no doubt, and the conduct of a heavily armed and militaristic style of operation which ended up \narresting people who were unarmed, sometimes not even fully dressed, and mostly at home with their families. In \nmy opinion it is likely DI Webber knew there may be accusations of an overreaction by police, and accusations that \na heavy-handed and disproportionate policing reaction had been authorised in an Aboriginal community where the \nthreats were not of the scale suggested.  What he wrote in this form was not an act of racial discrimination for the \npurpose of s 9 of the RDA, it was an attempt to justify the level of police response. Nevertheless, its content was \nconsistent with the stereotyping of Palm Islanders in which I have found QPS officers engaged, and in that sense \nfortifies some of the conclusions I have reached.  The state of the evidence concerning which QPS officer in fact \ndecided to deploy SERT is unsatisfactory. Although the applicants have the burden of proof in relation to their \nclaims, this fact was clearly within the knowledge of the respondents and they chose not to lead any specific \nevidence about it.  Mr Campbell\u2019s evidence was that when he arrived on Palm Island on 26 November 2004, \nInspector Kachel was in charge of the \u201coverall policing response\u201d on the island. DI Webber, in cross-examination, \ndescribed himself, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel as the three officers \u201cin charge\u201d and working on the \n\u201caction plan\u201d for SERT. His evidence was that Inspector Richardson left the island late on the Friday night and was \nnot involved in the preparation of the action plan, which took place in the early hours of the Saturday morning. \nNotwithstanding that he held such a position, Inspector Kachel was one of the QPS officers conspicuously missing \nfrom the respondents\u2019 witness list.  Inspector McKay gave evidence about the role of SERT, and confirmed that it \nwas not a unit which deployed on its own initiative. He described its role in the following terms:It\u2019s very much \ndependent on the task. What we \u2013 what we try to do is to fit the resource to \u2013 to the task. At the end of the day, \nwe\u2019re asked to solve problems, and \u2013 and in there it speaks about situations which exceed the capability of other \n\n\n\npolice. So it\u2019s about us trying to fit the resource to the task to achieve the outcome that has been requested by the \nrequesting officer.  Inspector McKay accepted that it was his responsibility to organise how the apprehension of the \nidentified suspects would take place, once SERT teams had been deployed to the island.  Inspector McKay met \nwith Inspector Kachel when he arrived on the island to get an \u201coverview\u201d of the situation and SERT\u2019s role. Inspector \nUnderwood, who was attached to PSRT, had overall command of the \u201capprehension teams\u201d with Inspector McKay \nbeing in charge of the SERT officers. Inspector McKay\u2019s evidence was that it was either Inspector Kachel or DI \nWebber who told him, later in the afternoon of 26 November 2004 and once the SERT officers were on the island, \nthat SERT officers would be used to apprehend suspects. DI Webber confirmed that sequence of events in his \nevidence: that is, that Inspector McKay was not told until later in the afternoon of 26 November, once the SERT \nofficers were on the island, that the SERT officers would be used to apprehend suspects and search houses.  At \nor about the same time as the assistance of SERT was requested, the QPS also called on the army, or as it was \nsometimes described in the running logs, the \u201cmilitary\u201d. In fact, the first entry in the running log for the \u201cState of \nEmergency\u201d on Palm Island records that at 1.20 pm on 26 November 2004 Superintendent Howell contacted an \nunidentified \u201cWarrant Officer\u201d requesting \u201curgent assistance from Military re: unrest/violence on Palm Island\u201d. An \nexecutive briefing note records that the Member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay, lent his support to the request. Given \nthe timeline of events, this request was made almost immediately after police on the mainland were advised of the \nprotests and fires that began on the island at approximately 1 pm. It was also made before an emergency situation \nwas formally declared by DI Webber at 1.45 pm.  Just over an hour later, at 2.50 pm, the following entry \nappears:Situation report \u2013 A/Chief Super HOWELL\n\n Palm Island subject of emergency situation. Police are under siege due to outcome of PM being released to the \nfamily today.226;128;\n\n 2 large ATSI\u2019s broken in and set fire to station. Police barricaded in barracks.

The use of the word \u201ccivilian\u201d in the third last entry above seems to refer to non-Aboriginal \ncivilians, because it was, of course, Aboriginal \u201ccivilians\u201d who were reported as being the perpetrators of the \nviolence. I refer to what I have said at [1149]-[1167] above about the use of the word \u201ccivilian\u201d and its juxtaposition \nwith \u201cATSI\u201d in the QPS running log.  This wording was also used in executive briefing notes approved by A/AC \nWall:Civilians on Palm Island are either self evacuating or seeking assistance to evacuate the island. The civilians \ninclude Teachers and Q. Build Staff. Arrangements in this regard are in place with ferry and aircraft transport being \narranged.  This can only be a reference to non-Aboriginal people on Palm Island. The briefing note continues:In \naddition to setting fire to the police station and police residence, a police vehicle was taken by the mob rendering \npolice communications insecure.  These briefing notes again reveal that the concern was to protect only non-\nAboriginal people on the island. The \u201ccivilians\u201d were non-Aboriginal teachers and QBuild staff seeking to evacuate \nthe island; those involved in the protests and fires were \u201cthe mob\u201d. No express reference is made in the briefing \nnote to the vast majority of Aboriginal people on Palm Island who did not participate in the protests and fires, \nalthough they were clearly not considered \u201ccivilians\u201d.  The police numbers were extraordinarily heavy, recalling that \nPalm Island had a total population of less than 2,000 people, many of whom were children. The evidence about the \ngroups of people who were suspected of actively engaging in property damage and threats of violence numbered \nonly in the tens. Only 10 people were arrested in relation to the protests and fires in the arrests, entries and \nsearches that followed (Mr Blackman is excluded from that number, as is Mr Nona) and only 16 people were \nultimately convicted of offences in relation to those events, although another 11 people were charged with offences \nand were either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn. At 4.04 pm on 26 November 2004, the following entry \nappears in the running log:MCKAY seeking advice on whether to send more number. Advised that 53 have gone \nand 29 waiting to board aircraft. Advised to load all 82.  As I have noted at [341] above, 14 SERT officers and seven \nPSRT officers flew to the island that day, and between approximately 59 and 82 other QPS officers were on the \nisland over the course of the period covered by the emergency declaration. An executive briefing note drafted on \nthe afternoon of 26 November 2004 and approved by A/AC Wall confirms that the number of additional police to be \nflown to the island was \u201cestimated to be 79\u201d, indicating that the numbers were likely to have been at the high end of \nthat range. In any case, the evidence shows that between approximately 88 and 111 police officers were on the \nisland on 27 November 2004 (including SERT and PSRT officers), or approximately one police officer for every 20 \nresidents of Palm Island \u2013 including the elderly, the infirm and children.  Inspector Kitching conceded that ultimately \nthe army declined to provide any assistance. There was no evidence as to why.  To contextualise again the arrival \nof the SERT teams with the approach and reaction of the QPS to the protests and fires, this was the description \ngiven by DI Webber in examination in chief about what he and the other commanding officers decided to do after \nthe confrontation at the hospital ended peacefully:All right. Well, you mention the crowd sort of dispersing. I assume \nthe line of police out the front of the hospital also dispersed at some point?---Yes. Eventually it dispersed and a \nnumber of [officers] went back into the hospital and worked out a plan of action. \n\n All right. Now, what did working out that plan of action involve? Firstly, who was involved in working out the plan of \naction and then tell me what the plan of action was?---Well, by this point in time, there was Inspector [Kachel], \nmyself and Inspector Richardson. We were the three senior inspectors in attendance on the island at that point in \ntime. We had some discussion with ourselves about what we should do about securing of various infrastructure, I \nsuppose, and areas of concern and how we might go about that. We discussed the necessity to establish effectively \na police force command post to take charge of our operations seeing as the other police station had been burnt \nand was no longer available to us. So we had to work through then where we could locate ourselves and the \nsignificant number of officers that were, by that stage, coming to the island. \n\n\n\n All right. Well, was a location for the forward command post settled upon?---Yes. It was. It was \u2013 at that stage, it \nwas determined to be \u2013 that the school would be a suitable location.  It is true this was still only shortly after the \npolice station and SS Hurley\u2019s house had been destroyed by fire, after what was described in the running log as \nthe \u201csiege\u201d at the police barracks and after the tense confrontation at the hospital. The applicants criticised this \nevidence, and the approach it disclosed, as militaristic and as the QPS taking up the function of the army (which \nhad declined to attend) in undertaking tasks such as \u201csecuring infrastructure\u201d. Although in my opinion the entire \nreaction of the QPS should be seen as heavy-handed and disproportionate, no criticism can reasonably be levelled \nat the senior QPS officers at this stage (Webber, Richardson and Kachel) for considering it important to secure fuel \nsupplies, the airport, the ferry terminal, communications infrastructure and the like. This was, after all, a remote \nisland and once destroyed or damaged, those sorts of necessities and infrastructure would be difficult to replace in \na timely way. In the 24 hours or so after the protests and fires, it was not in my opinion unreasonable for the QPS \nto consider there remained a risk of further property damage. To reach that conclusion is not to suggest there was a \nneed for any specialised police such as SERT officers, but rather to recognise that there was a reasonable basis, \nat least until the morning of 27 November 2004, for QPS to take steps to protect infrastructure on the island from \nfurther property damage.  After they had arrived on the island, SS McKay and the SERT officers took one of the \nclassrooms at the school as \u2018their\u2019 room. In the early evening of 26 November 2004, SS McKay was told that \nSERT\u2019s role, in addition to supporting the QPS generally, would be to \u201calso be involved in the apprehension of the \nnominated offenders the following morning\u201d. His evidence was:Detective Sergeant Robinson was aware of who the \noffenders were and I\u2019m not sure how that \u2013 when that \u2013 it was exactly articulated to us in relation to the exact \u2013 the \nexact people. But from there I \u2013 I knew what the task was from there \u2013 that we were to move out and apprehend the \n\u2013 the people the following morning. I had some situational awareness as to where the people would be or the types \nof residents that they would be and I went about formulating a plan involving all of the resources that we had \navailable to us to be able to go to those residents.  Inspector McKay then described how he went about planning \nthe entries and searches:One of the key aspects \u2013 and the planning that goes into this is extremely detailed. We \nuse a process called the appreciation process which is a Queensland Police Service decision-making model. Now, \none of those \u2013 one of the \u2013 there\u2019s four phases to that: (1) we establish the aim; secondly, we identify all of the \nfactors that are relevant at that point in time; thirdly, we will identify the courses of action open to the person of \ninterest that we want to apprehend; then we will identify the courses of action open to police to close the gap to be \nable to apprehend that person; and then we establish a plan. The reason I say that is because the information \nabout the environment that you\u2019re operating in is one of the key factors that impacts on our decision-making \nparticularly in this situation where you\u2019re operating in an Aboriginal community where there are nuances and \npeculiarities that people who may not be in those communities understand and are aware of. So, I went to great \nlengths to make sure that Detective Sergeant Robinson, who had the best situational awareness of anyone that we \nhad available to us on the island, gave us a full brief with regards to what had occurred in the lead up to the riot \nand then, more importantly, how people behaved on the island and what we could expect when we went to \npeoples\u2019 addresses so that the officers were under no illusion as to what they might find.  The reliance on \ninformation provided by DS Robinson was a plank of the applicants\u2019 case. The applicants contended DS Robinson \nwas responsible for providing information to SERT which was stereotypical and unfairly or baselessly adverse to \nAboriginal people on Palm Island.  In total, 21 officers went on the entries and searches, in four vehicles. In his oral \nevidence, Inspector Mackay described the basic methodology to be adopted, involving two SERT teams performing \ndifferent functions at each address:But in \u2013 but, in essence, that was the concept that as we moved to the address \none team would contain the address. The other team \u2013 led by Detective Sergeant Robinson \u2013 would go to the front \ndoor of the address. They would then go inside. Detective Sergeant Robinson would identify the people that he had \nidentified as offenders. They would be taken into \u2013 into custody. The PSRT guys would then remove that person \nfrom the house, put them in a van, take that person to the school and we would then move on to the next address \nwhere the teams would then alternate. The team that was on the outside of the first address would then go in with \nDetective Sergeant Robinson to the next address.  At this point, it is important that I clarify the basis for the findings \nI make in the several sections which follow, concerning the conduct of the SERT teams. Inspector McKay, \nSuperintendent Kruger and Sergeant Folpp struck me as reliable witnesses, doing their best to recall accurately \nevents of now more than 10 years ago. They were all highly trained officers, who were acutely conscious of the \nneed to perform the tasks for which they had been trained with a level of seriousness, dedication and precision \n\n\n\nwhich reflected their training in situations that were classified as \u2018high risk\u2019. It was not their task to second guess the \ncharacterisation of the situation as high risk. It was not their task to question the appropriateness of SERT\u2019s \ndeployment to Palm Island, nor the use to which the teams were to be put once there. Their task was to carry out \nthe instructions they had been given. Unsurprisingly, they did so in the manner in which they had been trained.  \nThere were many points in the applicants\u2019 cross-examination of these witnesses where it appeared to be suggested \nto them that, as individual officers, they could have behaved differently \u2013 more kindly, less aggressively, and the \nlike. The cross-examination often seemed to suggest these officers had broad levels of discretion about how they \nperformed their tasks. An example was the tasering of Mr Wotton and the persistent cross-examination about \nwhether Mr Wotton was intending to flee and whether A/S Kruger and SS McKay were justified in perceiving (as \nthey did) a \u201cthreat cue\u201d. This line of cross-examination, and then argument, missed the point. Similarly, the criticism \nof the conduct of SERT officers when they entered properties and houses \u2013 how they yelled at children, ordered \nthem to get down, pointed rifles at them, turned places upside down and sometimes broke down doors. Criticisms \nof how the SERT officers behaved once engaged in the task they had been instructed to perform was, in my \nopinion, misplaced.  It would be unrealistic to expect such specifically and highly trained officers to behave \notherwise than how they had been trained to behave. They dressed as they would usually dress for SERT \noperations. They were armed as they would usually be armed, and they used their weapons (in terms of when they \nraised them, how they pointed them and so on) as they had been trained to do when conducting searches and \napprehensions. They yelled out instructions as they usually would. As Inspector McKay agreed in his evidence, one \nof the objectives of the manner of dress, the numbers, the weapons and the general behaviour of SERT officers is \nto instil compliant behaviour in those who are the subjects of police action \u2013 in part, through fear.  Thus, in relation \nto the tasering of Mr Wotton, it does not matter whether Mr Wotton intended to flee, or even whether a lay person in \nthe position of A/S Kruger or SS McKay would have seen the threat cue they saw. What matters is that they were \neach trained to detect and react to those threat cues, which they did. I accept their evidence that this is what they \ndid, and that tasering was one of the range of reactions they had been trained to have.  The problem, in terms of s 9 \nof the RDA, was having the SERT officers there at all to perform these arrests, entries and searches, rather than \nany criticism of the way individual SERT officers behaved. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied the officers \nbehaved as they had been trained to behave. Therefore, the findings which follow do not reflect adverse \nconclusions against those individual officers for doing what they had been trained to do.  I turn now to deal with the \nclaims made on behalf of all group members, as they relate to the use of SERT.\n\nThe two claims made on behalf of the applicants and all Palm Island group members  The applicants alleged that \nduring the period on and after 26 November 2004, the QPS established a visible and militaristic presence on Palm \nIsland and QPS officers behaved in a disrespectful and intimidatory manner.  There was not a great deal of content \ngiven to these allegations in the submissions. The \u2018disrespectful\u2019 aspect was not developed in detail. It was \nsubmitted that QPS conduct (apparently, generally) was in breach of s 10.14 of the QPS Code of Conduct, which \nprovided:In the performance of official duties members are to:\n\n (i) demonstrate high standards of professional integrity and honesty;\n\n (ii) apply themselves to the efficient and effective achievement of the functions of the Queensland Police Service;\n\n (iii) perform any duties associated with their position diligently and to the best of their ability, in a manner that bears \nthe closest public scrutiny and meets all legislative, Government and Service standards;\n\n (iv) set and maintain standards of leadership that are consistent with corporate goals and policies, and be seen at \nall times to act in support of those corporate goal and policies;\n\n (v) promote and encourage members of the Service under their supervision to exercise high standards of personal \nand professional conduct;\n\n (vi) act with fairness and reasonable compassion;\n\n\n\n (vii) provide conscientious, effective, efficient and courteous service to all those with whom they have official \ndealings. In particular, members are to be sensitive to the special circumstances and needs surrounding victims of \ncrime;\n\n (viii) while members will put family responsibilities first, duty to the people of Queensland will always be given \npriority over the other private interests of members;\n\n (ix) perform their duties impartially and in the best interests of the community of Queensland, without fear or favour;\n\n (x) act in good faith; and\n\n (xi) actively contribute to the achievement of the Service\u2019s corporate goals.  Without any specific identification of \nthe evidence said to prove such a breach of the Code of Conduct, the applicants have not discharged their burden \nof proof that there was an act involving a distinction based on race for the purposes of s 9. What was said to be the \n\u2018disrespectful\u2019 conduct (as distinct from the \u2018militaristic\u2019 conduct, discussed below) was simply not identified. Further, \nin my view, even if the applicants had proved the alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct, such breaches would \nnot be sufficient to prove, and indeed would be barely material to whether, there had been a contravention of s 9.  \nThe pleading on the second aspect of claims made on behalf of the general class can be found at [290(c)] of the \nthird further amended statement of claim, which states:During the period that the emergency situation was in effect, \nand the days immediately after it was revoked, the QPS members:\n\n ...\n\n c. established a visible presence throughout the island and patrolled the island in a manner which resembled a \nmilitary occupation force; ...Particulars\n\n SERT officers armed with assault rifles and dressed in black uniforms, including body armour, patrolled up and \ndown the streets in unison and with no apparent purpose other than making their presence felt.  By [307] of the third \nfurther amended statement of claim, this is also alleged to be a breach of the Code of Conduct. Again, I do not \nconsider such allegations sufficient to ground a finding that there has been a contravention of s 9 by reason of the \nimpugned conduct. By [309(f)] and [313], the \u2018militaristic presence\u2019 conduct (if I might describe it in that way) is said \nto be an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or \nethnic origin for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA.  One is left to try to piece together what else the applicants have in \nmind on this issue. There are references in the relevant part of their submissions to officers pointing guns at \nchildren and forcing children at gunpoint to lie face down, which go to the claims of the applicants and the subgroup \nmembers rather than to the claims of the general class. The evidence did not establish how the general Palm \nIsland population was affected by this conduct. There are also references to the commandeering of the St \nMichael\u2019s school bus (and indeed Collette Wotton gave evidence about this), but although these contentions are \nlocated in the submissions under a heading referring to these allegations, no submissions are developed about \nthese matters.  The respondents submit:The QPS did establish a visible presence throughout the island. Police \nnumbers were increased following the riot. That was an appropriate reaction to an unprecedented riot in which \npolice officers were given an hour to leave the island or be killed. The functions of the QPS included the \npreservation of peace and good order and the protection of communities from unlawful disruption of peace and \ngood order: see s.2.3(a) and (b) of the PSA Act. The particulars of this allegation are that SERT officers armed with \nassault rifles and dressed in black uniforms patrolled up and down streets in unison and with no apparent purpose \nother than making their presence felt. It is an agreed fact that over the course of the emergency situation and in the \ndays after it was revoked the QPS established a visible presence throughout the island by patrolling the island. \nThat was not done by patrolling the streets in unison.\n\n\n\n(Footnotes removed.)    I accept that the establishment by the QPS (as opposed to the SERT officers) of a visible \npolice presence on the island was a reasonable reaction, especially in the first 24 hours or so after the protests \nand fires, when on any view the risk of further unrest and property damage to public buildings could not be \ndiscounted. That finding is not an endorsement or acceptance that the number of police officers on the island was \nappropriate, nor that it was appropriate to use SERT or PSRT officers. Rather, it is a finding that some level of \nvisible police presence was an appropriate response. As I have noted at [1242] above, securing the island\u2019s \ninfrastructure was also a justifiable and appropriate course of action for QPS to take. I do not consider that in \nestablishing a \u201cvisible presence\u201d with general QPS officers on Palm Island in the immediate aftermath of the \nprotests and fires, the respondents engaged in an act involving a distinction, restriction, exclusion or preference \nbased on race for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA. Whether or not there was a need for SERT and PSRT officers to \nsupply that \u2018visible presence\u2019, in additional to general QPS officers, is not a matter I need to decide because the \ndeployment of SERT was not contended to be a contravention of s 9 of the RDA, and for the reasons I set out \nbelow, there is no evidence of how SERT was used to establish such a visible presence. However, these reasons \nshould not be taken as accepting the justifications put forward by the respondents for the deployment of SERT, \nwhether by reference to s 2.26.1 of the OPM or otherwise.  There is no real evidence about which QPS officers \n(general police officers, PSRT or SERT) secured infrastructure, engaged in patrols or engaged in any other \npolicing activities that could be described as a \u201cvisible presence\u201d. There are some photos in evidence of PSRT and \nSERT officers but the only evidence about those photos concerns who is in the photos and what kind of gear the \nofficers were wearing. There is little or no evidence about what the PSRT officers did on the island, if indeed they \nperformed any functions separately from the SERT and other QPS officers.  The applicants submitted the QPS \napproached its task after the events of 26 November 2004 as \u201ca quasi-military operation\u201d. The applicants say this is \napparent because the QPS in fact requested military assistance and then performed \u201cquasi-military duties\u201d \nthemselves.  Mr Koch, whose evidence I found persuasive, compared what he saw with his experiences soon after \nan actual military occupation on the Solomon Islands. As a journalist sent to the island during these events, Mr \nKoch was there as an observer and reporter. He had no stake one way or the other in matters concerning Palm \nIsland, although it is no doubt correct to say he had his own opinions, which came through in the way he described \nwhat he observed. However, based on the evidence before me, I do not find that Mr Koch\u2019s descriptions were \nunreliable, or unbalanced. Indeed, save in one respect, they appear accurate to me:What was of concern about the \npolice presence: the fact that they were there, the fact that they were there in such numbers? What was the \nconcern?---No. Well, the way \u2013 the way that \u2013 the manner in which they were there, dressed and carrying firearms \naround the island. I mean, it was peaceful. There\u2019s no grog there. Nobody was \u2013 except for the women at the store, \nnobody was yelling out. There were no threats that I could see. There were no\u2013I\u2013I just thought it was a\u2013an over the \ntop response to a situation \u2013 I mean, for goodness\u2019 sake, again it\u2019s reported in the paper and never corrected. They \nasked the Air Force to send Black Hawk helicopters over here.  The one respect in which these observations are \nclearly inaccurate is Mr Koch\u2019s reference to \u201cno grog\u201d. On the evidence it is clear there was alcohol on the island, \nand it was being consumed by some people in sufficient quantities for some of the applicants\u2019 witnesses to describe \nseveral people they referred to as drunk. I mention this because in my opinion it must be recognised, as QPS \nofficers did recognise, that access to and consumption of alcohol by some local residents of Palm Island could \nexacerbate the risk of further property damage and lawlessness. The problem, in terms of s 9, is how that risk \nseems to have been extrapolated by QPS officers to the community as a whole, and used to justify a \ndisproportionate policing response.  Mr Koch\u2019s observations about the situation after the protests and fires set out \nat [1263] above accord with my own. They also accord with the witness evidence. Consistently with findings I make \nbelow about entries and searches by SERT officers of the houses of the applicants and subgroup members, in my \nopinion the methodology employed by the QPS in using SERT officers was a show of force, a retaliation, and an \nexercise in the subjugation of local residents. It would not have occurred in comparable circumstances in non-\nAboriginal communities in Queensland, particularly in a community with a small population.  In relation to the \nalleged contraventions of s 9 by this conduct, the applicants in their pleading again collapse the facts said to \nconstitute the \u201cact\u201d with the facts said to constitute the \u201cdistinction\u201d. This can be seen from the pleadings in [309] \nand [313]. However, read with their submissions, especially at [556]-[558] and [586]-[603], it is tolerably clear that \nthe allegation is that the militaristic way in which the QPS went about its policing operations during these few days \n(with a focus on the way the SERT officers were used) was an act involving a distinction based on race, said to \nimpair the human rights of all members of the class.  Aside from evidence concerning the arrests, searches and \nentries into houses, the applicants have not established the manner in which the QPS officers (whether general \n\n\n\npolice, PSRT or SERT) went about their tasks on the island. They have not adduced sufficient evidence to \npersuade me that the general policing operations on the island at this time had a \u2018militaristic\u2019 character to them. I \nset out below my reasons for finding that the use of the SERT teams to search for suspects and arrest them, and \nthe way in which the searches and entries into houses were conducted, was disproportionate and unnecessary, and \nconstituted acts involving distinctions and restrictions based on race. That is a finding in relation to the applicants \nand the members of the subgroup, which includes all persons present at the houses while the arrests, searches and \nentries were conducted.  The current allegation is one made in relation to all the group members. The only relevant \nevidence is that of Mr Koch. It is insufficient to establish the allegation, although I do not doubt the genuineness of \nMr Koch\u2019s opinion and his opinion is consistent with my findings about the arrests, searches and entries. \nNevertheless, more would be required to make out an act of establishing a \u2018militaristic presence\u2019 across the \ninhabited parts of the island. Further, and in contrast to my findings about the applicants and the subgroup \nmembers, it would have been difficult for the applicants to establish that the effect or purpose of any such \n\u2018militaristic presence\u2019 was to impair or nullify the human rights of the general class members. The applicants did not, \nfor example, rely on the freedom of movement rights of all group members, although that is not to say that, if they \nhad, such a right would have been found to be impaired.\n\nThe first three claims made on behalf of the applicants and the subgroub members  At [588] of the applicants\u2019 \nsubmissions, they state:For the reasons set out above, having regard to all of the evidence adduced at trial, the \nApplicants submit that the following acts comprising the Further Failures and occurring on or after 26 November \n2004 have been proven:  the formation of an Action Plan which required that DS Robinson identify the persons to \nbe arrested;  the preparation of a list of persons to be arrested by DSS Miles in Townsville on the night of 26 \nNovember 2004;  the failure to obtain a warrant for the arrest of any person arrested in the presence of SERT and \nPSRT officers in connection with the events on Palm Island of 26 November 2004.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    This submission contained footnotes to the following paragraphs of the applicants\u2019 third \nfurther amended statement of claim: [284], [285], [286], [300], [309(d)]. In fact, none of these three matters are \nidentified in the pleadings as acts of unlawful discrimination contrary to s 9: rather, it is the arrests which are, in \n[309(d)], so identified. That is consistent with my understanding of the way the case was conducted.  If I had been \nrequired to determine the issues I would have found none of these three matters constituted acts involving \ndistinctions or restrictions based on race.  It is correct that DS Robinson was involved in the formation of the so-\ncalled \u201caction plan\u201d, along with SS McKay, Inspector Kachel and DS Campbell. While it may constitute an \u201cact\u201d, it \nwas not one involving any differential treatment which could be characterised as a distinction, restriction, exclusion \nor preference. If by this, it is intended to refer to some of the information passed by DS Robinson to SS McKay as \npart of the briefing about what SERT officers could expect (which I address in more detail at [1445] below), then this \nis evidence I have taken into account in determining whether the distinctions involved in the use of the SERT \nofficers to effect the arrests, searches and entries were based on race.  The claims about the preparation of a list of \npersons to be arrested by DSS Miles in Townsville and the failure to obtain warrants of arrest for those suspects \nwho were arrested over 27, 28 and 29 November 2004 do not appear to be developed anywhere in the applicants\u2019 \nwritten submissions. Accordingly it is difficult to understand what is being alleged about the conduct of DSS Miles \nand about the failure to obtain warrants, separately from the allegations which I deal with below about the \nunlawfulness of the arrests of some of the subgroup members.  It is common ground no warrants of arrest were \nobtained. The respondents\u2019 case is that they were not required and these were circumstances where the suspects \ncould be arrested without warrant. These issues are engaged in the separate allegations made below about the \narrests themselves. Insofar as these are alleged to be separate contraventions of s 9 of the RDA they have not \nbeen made out.\n\nAn \u2018arbitrariness\u2019 claim on behalf of the applicants and the subgroup members?  The applicants contend that the \narrests, entries and searches were carried out in an arbitrary way, where every occupant was treated as a \n\u201cdangerous criminal\u201d, a description taken from McMeekin J\u2019s reasons for judgment in Bulsey [2015] QCA 187 at \n[127], where his Honour was describing the way, in his opinion, David Bulsey was treated during these entries and \nsearches. The examples of arbitrariness given in the applicants\u2019 submissions are: that Mr Clumpoint\u2019s home was \nentered after he was arrested outside, that Mr Blackman\u2019s home was entered after he was seen fleeing out the \nback; and that Ms Barry\u2019s home was entered \u201cessentially on a whim\u201d in order to search for Jason Poynter, although \n\n\n\n(the applicants submit) the SERT officers and the QPS had no basis to believe that he was there. Other criticisms \nare made of the SERT teams\u2019 efforts to find Mr Poynter, who handed himself in later on 27 November 2004. Berna \nPoynter\u2019s home was entered in search of Mr Poynter because a person on the street told the police officers that he \nmight be there and, despite what the applicants suggested was slight information, the same level of force was used \nin the entry of Berna Poynter\u2019s home as was used at the other homes. In total the SERT teams entered six houses \nlooking for Mr Poynter on the morning of 27 November 2004, but did not find him.  The applicants then contend that \nthe allegedly arbitrary character of that conduct was based on race.  There are no pleadings which support, even \nindirectly, allegations of arbitrary conduct by SERT officers in effecting the arrests and the searches of houses. In \nother words, there is no separate allegation of arbitrary conduct constituting an \u201cact\u201d for the purposes of s 9. The \nonly references in the pleadings to arbitrariness are in the pleadings dealing with the nature of the interference of \nidentified human rights (see [319] and [320]). The application of arbitrariness in the context of Art 17 and the second \nlimb of s 9(1) is a separate issue altogether. I deal with this at [711] above. The apparently additional allegations in \nrelation to the first limb of s 9(1) put by the applicants in closing submissions should not be accepted.  Further, even \nif allegations can be discovered in the pleadings which are said to support these submissions, I do not accept the \nsubmissions that the matters to which the applicants refer establish that the SERT teams were acting in an \n\u201carbitrary\u201d way, whatever the applicants\u2019 submissions intend that to mean. There was nothing capricious or irrational \nabout the method adopted by the SERT officers. To the contrary, it was methodical and calculated to address the \ntask the teams had been assigned. As I find elsewhere in relation to the arrests, entries and searches, in my \nopinion it was both reasonable and to be expected that at each house the SERT officers attended, they would \nsearch it for other suspects. That was the purpose of the operation \u2013 to search for, locate and apprehend \nsuspects. I see nothing irrational in the suspicion which clearly sat behind the entries into each house that some of \nthe suspects may have been present with other suspects, especially since the activities said to constitute offences \nwere alleged to have been committed, as I understand the evidence, by suspects when in the company of other \nsuspects: that is, while all suspects were members of the crowds present at the community meeting and \nafterwards on 26 November 2004.  The applicants\u2019 allegations of contravention of s 9 based on the arbitrariness of \nthe conduct of SERT officers must be rejected.  To be clear, these findings stand quite separately from the findings \nI make later in these reasons that the use of SERT to conduct the arrests, entries and searches impaired the rights \nof the applicants and the subgroup members under Art 17 of the ICCPR because (in addition to being unlawful) the \nuse of SERT constituted an arbitrary interference with the privacy, safety and homes of those individuals. Those \nfindings are based on the use of SERT officers at all, with their concomitant appearance and methods. In this \ncontext, arbitrariness is concerned with lack of proportionality and justification. The distinction is critical to \nunderstanding my reasoning.  The applicants\u2019 criticisms which I have set out in this section of my reasons go to the \nappearance of and methods used by the SERT officers. As I have found, the underlying theme of the applicants\u2019 \ncontentions is that SERT officers could or should have behaved in a more nuanced, less aggressive and less \nviolent way. That is to misconceive the nature and function of SERT. Of course, SERT officers (especially those in \ncommand and control) have some discretion as to how they and their fellow officers behave. However, SERT \nofficers are strictly and highly trained to behave in certain ways, to operate in accordance with strict procedures \ndesigned to accommodate the high-risk situations in which they are deployed. That is why there is nothing \n\u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d about what they in fact do. That is why, in my opinion, no substantive criticism can be \nmade of the individual SERT officers in this case. They performed their functions as they were trained to do. \nIndeed, that was, I have found, the intended consequence of the decision by DI Webber and other QPS officers in \ncommand and control to use SERT to undertake the arrests, entries and searches.  Those QPS officers, such as DI \nWebber, were well familiar with SERT operations. They well knew how SERT officers looked in \u201criot gear\u201d, that they \nwere armed with assault rifles, operated in large teams, smashed down doors if need be, pointed rifles at people \nand yelled orders at them. It was a conscious decision to treat the suspects and occupants of the houses in this \nway, and my findings below are made on the basis that SERT officers acted as they were trained to do, and as \nthose QPS officers in command (such as DI Webber) knew they would. That is why it is quite distinct from the \napplicants\u2019 allegations dealt with in this section of my reasons.\n\nConclusions on the claims other than claims about the arrests, entries and searches by SERT  None of the \nallegations in these two groups of claims have been made out. Even with a holistic approach to the pleadings and \nsubmissions, some of the claims made in the submissions are well outside the case as advanced by the applicants.\n\n\n\nThe arrests, entries and searches by SERT: claims of unlawfulness and excessive use of force  The matters in this \ngroup of claims are common to the applicants and the subgroup.  I have already set out in the narrative section of \nthese reasons an account of the houses the SERT officers went to, insofar as the evidence is not controversial or \ncontested. Where appropriate I will set out my findings of fact on the more contentious aspects of what happened at \neach house to which the SERT teams went, to the extent that the pleadings, the division of claims (between all \ngroup members, subgroup members and the applicants), and the parties\u2019 submissions require me to do so. Neither \nof the parties\u2019 final submissions descended into any details about what findings the Court should make concerning \nthe events at each house, even the houses of the first, second and third applicants. The respondents\u2019 submissions \nbarely descended into factual issues at all. The applicants\u2019 submissions descended into factual issues only to \nillustrate an argument.  The \u201cevents\u201d on which the applicants\u2019 allegations are based are set out in Part J of the third \nfurther amended statement of claim. It is in this section that one finds a series of allegations of material facts which \ngo to more than the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the arrests, entries and searches. Paragraphs [279]-[283] of the \nthird further amended statement of claim should be set out:     On or about 26 November 2004, senior police \nofficers on Palm Island, including DI Webber, formulated the following action plan (Action Plan):    a. DS Robinson \nto identify addresses of interest;\n\n b. Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) and Public Safety Response Team (PSRT) officers to acquire \naddresses of interest;\n\n c. DS Robinson to enter residence and identify persons of interest;\n\n d. DS Robinson accompanied by SERT and PSRT officers who would apprehend the person or persons of interest \nwith minimum force necessary, secure that person and that person would then be taken from the residence;\n\n e. If doors were locked and secured, SERT would use force to gain entry;\n\n f. Other occupants within the dwellings would not be disturbed, if possible;\n\n g. Team would then move on.  Chief Superintendent Wall approved the Action Plan on or about 26 November \n2004.  SERT and PSRT were heavily armed police units with specialist training for dealing with particularly \ndangerous suspects and situations.  On or about 26 November 2004, around 60 SERT and PSRT personnel were \nflown on to Palm Island by helicopter.(c) The Raids  In the early morning of 27 November 2004 and throughout that \nday and the next day, SERT and PSRT officers, heavily armed and with their faces covered by balaclavas, entered \nand searched dwellings of Aboriginal Palm Island residents, purportedly pursuant to s 8 of the Public Safety \nPreservation Act 1986(Qld) (the \u201cRaids\u201d).  While the structure and headings of the applicants\u2019 third further amended \nstatement of claim appear to challenge the arrests (K4, [300]-[302]) and the entries and searches of homes (K5, \n[303]-[306]) only on the basis of their unlawfulness, there are also allegations of the use of more than the minimum \nforce necessary, which appear to be separate allegations from unlawfulness. For example, [300] alleges:In the \ncircumstances pleaded in paragraphs 283 to 288 above, the arrests conducted in the course of the Raids were not \nconducted in accordance with the Action Plan, as they were not conducted with the minimum force necessary, and \nneither were they conducted lawfully.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    And [303] alleges:In the circumstances pleaded in paragraphs 283 to 288 above the entry into \ndwellings by QPS members during the Raids was not conducted in accordance with the Action Plan, as the \noccupants were unnecessarily disturbed, and neither was it conducted lawfully.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Nevertheless, when one reaches the s 9 pleadings, unlawful arrests of the applicants and \nunlawful entries and searches of the applicants\u2019 houses are described as the \u201cFurther Failures\u201d of the QPS during \n22 to 28 November 2004. It is those \u201cFurther Failures\u201d which are then alleged to be the \u201cacts\u201d for the purposes of s \n9.  Taking into account what I have said at [1275]-[1277] above, and reading the pleadings fairly and in conjunction \nwith the applicants\u2019 submissions, it is tolerably clear that the applicants\u2019 challenge is to the arrests, entries and \nsearches as the \u201cacts\u201d for the purposes of s 9, and those acts are said to involve distinctions based on race being \n\n\n\nfirst, the unlawfulness of the arrests, entries and searches, and second, the use of SERT officers to effect the \narrests, entries and searches and how the SERT officers went about their tasks.  For the reasons I have already \nexpressed, I do not accept the applicants\u2019 contention that if an arrest was unlawful, it necessarily involved a \ndistinction based on race. Nevertheless, as I have explained, particular facts or circumstances of unlawfulness may \ninform aspects of s 9. Unlawfulness is also part of the content of some of the human rights and freedoms relied on. \nFor those reasons, it is appropriate to determine whether the arrests, entries and searches were or were not \nunlawful.\n\nWas the arrest of Mr Wotton unlawful?  The first issue to deal with is who was arrested. The applicants claim Ms \nCecilia Wotton was arrested, as well as Mr Wotton. The respondents accept Ms Cecilia Wotton\u2019s liberty was \nrestricted for a short period of time, but submit this was not an arrest. I agree. The evidence discloses that Ms \nCecilia Wotton was indeed unable to move around her house and was forced to lie on the floor. I accept this action \nwas taken by the SERT officers so that they could search the house for other suspects. Ms Cecilia Wotton was not \na suspect in the offences for which people were being apprehended. If there was no lawful authority for such a \nrestriction, there may have been a false imprisonment, but there was no arrest. An arrest requires, first, \ncommunication of an intention to make an arrest, and second, a sufficient act of arrest or submission: see Woodley \nv Boyd[2001] NSWCA 35 at [38] (Heydon JA, Davies AJA and Foster AJA agreeing); Wilson v New South Wales \n[2010] NSWCA 333; 278 ALR 74 at [59] (Hodgson JA); Bulsey [2015] QCA 187 at [12]- [14] (Fraser JA). On the \nevidence, there was no arrest: no officer communicated to Ms Cecilia Wotton an intention to arrest her, and Ms \nWotton was not taken into custody. Although it can be said there was an act of \u201csubmission\u201d in the sense that she \ncomplied with the orders to lie on the floor, that was so the house could be searched, it was not so she could be \narrested. She did not submit to an arrest, where the intention to do so had been communicated to her.  Accordingly, \nI will consider only Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest, and whether it was lawful. The parties were agreed that the fact that Mr \nWotton was subsequently convicted of certain offences in relation to the events on 26 November 2004 did not affect \nthe question whether his arrest was lawful. The respondents submitted it may affect the damages he should be \nawarded, were the Court to find a contravention of s 9 through his unlawful arrest.  The applicants submit his arrest \nwas unlawful because the requirements in s 198 of the PPR Act were not met, that being the only authority in a \nQPS officer to arrest without a warrant.  The same issue was accepted by the parties to arise in relation to each of \nthe other individuals arrested.  In November 2004, s 198 of the PPR Act relevantly provided:(1) It is lawful for a \npolice officer, without warrant, to arrest an adult the police officer reasonably suspects has committed or is \ncommitting an offence if it is reasonably necessary for 1 or more of the following reasons \u2013(a) to prevent the \ncontinuation or repetition of an offence or the commission of another offence; \n\n (b) to make inquiries to establish the person\u2019s identity; \n\n (c) to ensure the person\u2019s appearance before a court; \n\n (d) to obtain or preserve evidence relating to the offence; \n\n (e) to prevent the harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence relating to \nthe offence; \n\n (f) to prevent the fabrication of evidence; \n\n (g) to preserve the safety or welfare of any person, including the person arrested; \n\n (h) to prevent a person fleeing from a police officer or the location of an offence; \n\n (i) because the offence is an offence against section 444 or 445; \n\n\n\n (j) because the offence is an offence against the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 1989, section 80; \n\n (k) because of the nature and seriousness of the offence; \n\n (l) because the offence is \u2013(i) an offence against the Corrective Services Act 2000, section 103(3); or \n\n (ii) an offence to which the Corrective Services Act 2000, section 104 applies.(2) Also, it is lawful for a police \nofficer, without warrant, to arrest a person the police officer reasonably suspects has committed or is committing \nan indictable offence, for questioning the person about the offence, or investigating the offence, under chapter 7.  \nAs s 198(2) indicates, the investigation of offences was governed by Ch 7 of the PPR Act (ss 227-268). Chapter 7 \nauthorised the detention of an arrested person for questioning, subject to certain conditions and restrictions which \nare not presently relevant. The applicants\u2019 submissions did not address whether the exceptions in Ch 7 precluded s \n198(2), from applying but the respondents\u2019 submissions appeared to rely upon it.  The respondents did not rely, \ncorrectly, on s 8 of the PSP Act. Although s 8 authorises the use of a number of coercive powers in emergency \nsituations declared under that Act, the power of arrest is not one of them. DI Webber was mistaken in his \nunderstanding about the scope of s 8. Mr Campbell gave evidence that he had instructions \u201cfrom above\u201d (later \nindicating this was either DI Webber or the MIR) that warrants were not required because of the existence of the \nemergency situation under the PSP Act. He later confirmed in his evidence that he therefore did not believe \nwarrants were necessary. Inspector McKay gave evidence to the same effect.  In his evidence, DI Webber himself \nconfirmed that one of the purposes of the emergency declaration was to facilitate the arrests of suspects. In \nexamination in chief, he said:Was that a matter, the possible revocation of that declaration, that you turned your \nmind to on the Saturday?---I had. But at that point in time, there were still a few factors under consideration, one \nbeing the fact that there was a missing police firearm which had not been located. A number of persons had still to \nbe taken into custody.  He then said that he decided to revoke the emergency declaration on the Sunday morning \nbecause by that time \u201cmost, if not all, of the persons of interest had been \u2013 been arrested and taken into custody\u201d. \nHe also stated:it\u2019s my understanding that the Public Safety Preservation Act actually enables us to actually take \npossession of items such as those [vehicles] and use them during that incident.  I find that DI Webber did consider \nthat the emergency declaration provided a basis for houses to be entered and searched, and suspects arrested, \nwithout warrants. As I have already found, he kept the emergency declaration in force in order to facilitate the SERT \noperations aimed at achieving those objectives.  I note here that the respondents submit, and Inspector McKay \ngave unequivocal evidence that, it was DS Robinson who arrested each suspect as they were apprehended. No \nsubmission was made that the suspects were merely \u201capprehended\u201d by the SERT officers and then \u201carrested\u201d at \nthe school sometime later. In evidence, Superintendent Kruger made some reference to a distinction between an \n\u201capprehension\u201d and an \u201carrest\u201d, but he conceded he could not clearly recall the \u201cdistinctions and terminologies\u201d \nused by the QPS. Were it necessary to decide the issue, I would be inclined to agree with the submission of senior \ncounsel for the applicants that there is in law no distinction. The authorities to which I have referred at [1292] make \nno such distinction. However, given no party submitted that the arrests took place anywhere other than at the scene \nof an entry and search of a house where a person was placed in custody, it is unnecessary to consider the issue \nfurther. Mr Blackman Senior\u2019s arrest, which took place at the school, may be in a different category.  The following \nexchange occurred in the cross-examination of Mr Campbell:And you would agree that not all of the targets at the \nSERT raids would have been arrested?---That\u2019s correct.\n\n Some would \u2013 you have previously said some would have been brought in for interviews?---That\u2019s correct.\n\n So you sent out balaclavaed, helmeted, fully uniformed with large guns to just bring people in for interviews?---I \nthink you\u2019ve got to keep it in the context of what had occurred in the previous 24 hours. We had had - - -\n\n No. I just ask you to answer the question. You sent fully uniformed SERT officers\n\n - - -?---Yes.\n\n\n\n - - - to bring people in for interviews?---That\u2019s correct.  This evidence may have been sufficient to engage s 198(2) \nof the PPR Act. The conduct remains, under s 198(2), but the purpose of the arrest is different. However, as I set \nout below, there are other difficulties in the application of s 198(2).  During the course of the trial and prior to final \nsubmissions, the Queensland Court of Appeal handed down its decision in Bulsey. The applicants relied on \narguments which were successful in that case, although the extent of the reliance might be said to have increased \nas submissions progressed. There is no difficulty in that having occurred, because the respondents also sought to \nuse the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Bulseyto their advantage in relation to the allegations concerning Mr Wotton\u2019s \narrest. Since both parties sought to deploy the approach taken by the Court of Appeal, it is appropriate to consider \nBulsey in some detail. The appeal turned on legal arguments concerning the formation of the reasonable suspicion \nrequired by either ss 198(1) or 198(2) of the PPR Act.  Mr Bulsey had brought a common law claim about the \ncircumstances of his arrest and the entry into his home on 27 November 2004. His then partner was also a plaintiff. \nHe was unsuccessful at trial but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on appeal, and awarded him \n$165,000 and his then partner $70,000 in damages.  In relation to the possible lawful bases for Mr Bulsey\u2019s arrest, \nthe trial judge (unreported, Sup Ct, Qld, North J, 20 February 2015) said (at [79]-[80]):It may be accepted \ninferentially from the evidence of Inspector Webber that he and other police officers assumed that the inspector\u2019s \ndeclaration under the Public SafetyPreservation Act 1986 authorised the forcible entry into the house at Puttaburra \nLane and the arrest of Mr Bulsey without warrant. There is reason to doubt that the declaration authorised those \nactions and the defendant did not rely upon the declaration or the Act at trial.\n\n At trial the defendant relied upon powers under s 198 of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 \nauthorising the arrest without warrant and also s 376(1) ofthat Act as authorising the force used to arrest and \napprehend Mr Bulsey in thecircumstance that applied.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    The trial judge found that DSS Miles was the person who held the reasonable suspicion for \nthe purposes of s 198(2), and that there was a justifiable basis for that suspicion. He also found the level of force \nused by the SERT officers to be justified for the purposes of s 376 of the PPR Act.  In the Court of Appeal, three \njudgments were delivered: Atkinson J agreeing with the reasons of both Fraser JA and McMeekin J, although her \nHonour observed (having referred to authorities concerning the importance of personal liberty) at [119]:The \nappellants in this case were not treated as one might expect in a civilised society governed by the rule of law and it \nis appropriate that they should be adequately compensated for the grievous wrong done to them.  McMeekin J \nagreed with Fraser JA but added his Honour\u2019s own observations about why the damages ordered were appropriate. \nThose observations also emphasised the importance of personal liberty in a society under the rule of law, and the \nloss of dignity involved in false imprisonment. His Honour concluded at [127]:This was not a case of human \nfallibility. A deliberate decision was made to make a dawn raid on a citizen\u2019s home by armed, masked men and to \ntreat those found within as one would dangerous criminals with no regard whatever for their dignity or rights. The \nimprisonment continued for days. The hurt was great.  The principal arguments on appeal which are directly \nrelevant to this proceeding go to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that s 198(2) of the PPR Act authorised the arrest of the \nfirst appellant. In Bulsey, the appellants contended that conclusion was wrong because DSS Miles, who was found \nby the trial judge to hold the suspicion required, did not arrest the first appellant and the police officer who did \narrest the first appellant was found not to hold the required suspicion.  Fraser JA noted that, at trial, the State\u2019s \narguments had been that DSS Miles held the suspicion but delegated the power of arrest to officers on the island, \nwho need not have held the suspicion required by s 198(2). On appeal, the State\u2019s arguments changed, and its \ncase became that DS Robinson held the relevant suspicion. Unlike in the present case, in Bulsey, the State \nexplained by evidence the absence of DS Robinson from the trial, and also relied on his statements given to \ninvestigators shortly after the events to prove he held the requisite suspicion. Ultimately, the Court of Appeal held \nno such inference could be drawn from DS Robinson\u2019s statements.  Fraser JA said (at [15]-[16] and [20]-\n[21]):Section 198 is in this respect indistinguishable from the statutory provisions in respect of which the House of \nLords in O\u2019Hara v Chief Constable of Royal Ulster Constabularyconfirmed that although an arresting officer may in \nappropriate cases form the necessary reasonable suspicion upon the basis of information supplied by another \npolice officer, the suspicion must be held by the arresting officer; it is not sufficient that it is held by a superior \n\n\n\nofficer who ordered the arrest. Again, in Hyder v The Commonwealth of Australia the New South Wales Court of \nAppeal adopted the literal construction of the relevantly indistinguishable language of s 3W(1)(a) of the Crimes \nAct1914 (Cth) in holding that the person who must hold the belief required by that provision is the arresting officer. \n(That section provided that \u201c[a] constable may, without warrant, arrest the person for an offence if the constable \nbelieves on reasonable grounds that: (a) the person has committed or is committing the offence...\u201d) McColl JA \nendorsed the statement by Lord Steyn (Lords Goff, Mustill and Hoffmann agreeing) in O\u2019Hara v Chief Constable of \nRoyal Ulster Constabulary that this requirement is intended to ensure \u201c[t]hat the arresting officer is held \naccountable\u201d and is \u201cthe compromise between the values of individual liberty and public order\u201d. In Dumbell v \nRoberts & Ors Scott LJ said:\u201cThe power possessed by constables to arrest without warrant, whether at common \nlaw for suspicion of a felony, or under statutes for suspicion of various misdemeanours, provided always they have \nreasonable grounds for their suspicion, is a valuable protection to the community; but the power may easily be \nabused and become a danger to the community instead of a protection. The protection of the public is safeguarded \nby the requirement, alike of the common law and, so far as I know, of all statutes, that the constable shall before \narresting satisfy himself that there do in fact exist reasonable grounds for suspicion of guilt.\u201dThat construction and \nexplanation of the requirement that a police officer who makes an arrest must suspect on reasonable grounds that \nthe person arrested has committed a relevant offence are equally applicable in relation to s 198(2). Any differences \nbetween the office of constable under the common law and the powers and functions of a Queensland police \nofficer under the PPRA have no bearing upon that conclusion. So much is also consistent with the context in which \ns 198 appears. The respondent\u2019s construction would render s 198(2) incongruous with the provisions for arrest \nunder warrant in Pt 2 of Ch 6 of PPRA. Section 202 makes it lawful for a police officer acting under an arrest \nwarrant issued under any Act or law to arrest the person named in the warrant. Under the respondent\u2019s \nconstruction, an order by a superior officer has substantially the same effect as an arrest warrant even though it \nlacks any of the statutory protections of personal liberty in Pt 2 of Ch 6: a sworn application stating the grounds on \nwhich the warrant is sought (s 203), a decision by a justice that there are reasonable grounds for the specified \nsuspicion and that (other than for an indictable offence) proceedings by way of complaint and summons or notice to \nappear would be ineffective (s 204), and a written warrant identifying the alleged offence and other matters (s 205).\n\n ...\n\n If a police officer who makes an arrest does not hold that suspicion, s 198(2) does not render the arrest lawful. If, \ncontrary to my own opinion, there is any ambiguity in s 198(2) in that respect, that construction nonetheless should \nbe adopted because of the principle that a statute which affects personal liberty should be construed strictly in \nfavour of the citizen.\n\n \u201cIt is of critical importance to the existence and protection of personal liberty under the law that the restraints which \nthe law imposes on police powers of arrest and detention be scrupulously observed.\u201d Upon the trial judge\u2019s findings \nof fact, the restraints imposed upon the power of arrest in s 198(2) of the PPRA were not observed in the important \nrespect that the police officer who arrested the first appellant did not reasonably suspect that the first appellant \nhad committed an indictable offence. If Detective Miles held such a suspicion (as the trial judge found, but the \nappellants disputed) that is irrelevant because Detective Miles did not arrest the first appellant. The arrest of the first \nappellant was therefore unlawful.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    Fraser JA went on to find (at [22]) that if s 198(2) did not authorise the arrest, then the use of \nforce could not be authorised by s 376(1):It follows that s 376(1) of the PPRA did not justify the use of force by the \npolice officers who arrested or assisted in the arrest of the first appellant. The respondent did not challenge the \nappellants\u2019 contention that the provision in s 376(1) making it lawful to use reasonably necessary force in exercising \nor assisting in the exercise of a power under the PPRA was capable of application in this case only if the arrest of \nthe first appellant was made lawful by s 198(2).  It should be noted that Bulsey was an action in tort: assault, battery \nand false imprisonment. A claim of malicious prosecution was not pursued. The State ultimately conceded, and the \nCourt of Appeal accepted as correct, the proposition that the acts of the police in detaining and imprisoning the first \nappellant amounted to torts actionable by the first appellant unless the respondent proved that those acts were \n\n\n\nauthorised or excused by law: see Bulsey at [4] (Fraser JA).  In the present proceeding, it is not the case that the \nonus of proof under s 9 of the RDA shifts to the respondents at any stage. The applicants must prove all allegations \nsaid to establish a contravention of s 9 of the RDA. If one of those allegations is that the arrest of Mr Wotton was \nunlawful and, when placed together with other allegations, contravened s 9, then the applicants must prove the \narrest was unlawful.  The applicants\u2019 submissions often read as though they assumed the respondents bore the \nkind of burden of proof the State bore in Bulsey. That is not the case.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal has set out \nclearly, and in directly related circumstances, what the law is concerning the scope and operation of s 198(2) of the \nPPR Act, as well as the scope and operation of s 376(1). Whether at trial or appellate level in this Court, the Court \nof Appeal\u2019s decision is not binding as a matter of precedent. Nevertheless, there are important considerations of \ncertainty and predictability in the development and application of the law in a federation that mean that intermediate \nappellate courts and trial judges should not depart from decisions in intermediate appellate courts in another \nAustralian jurisdiction on the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation or uniform national legislation, or on non-\nstatutory law, unless they are convinced that the decision is plainly wrong: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee \nPty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 at [135] (the Court). In the present case, the legal question involves the \nconstruction and operation of a Queensland statute. The Queensland Court of Appeal is the highest court of that \nstate and its interpretation of Queensland statutes is subject only to appeal by leave to the High Court. In those \ncircumstances, the principles set out in Farah apply with equal, if not greater, force. Just as Farah requires a single \njudge of a state Supreme Court to follow an interpretation of Commonwealth legislation by the Full Court of the \nFederal Court unless convinced the interpretation is plainly wrong, a single judge of the Federal Court should apply \nthe same approach to an interpretation of state legislation by the appellate court of the relevant state, unless that \nsingle judge has a fundamental disagreement with the approach taken by the appellate court. As it happens, and \nwith respect, I share the views of the members of the Queensland Court of Appeal that it is the arresting officer who \nmust hold the reasonable suspicion.  There are additional reasons the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction of s 198(2) \nand s 376(1), and its application of these provisions to the circumstances of Mr Bulsey\u2019s arrest, should be followed \nby a single judge in this proceeding. First, Mr Bulsey is a class member, and a subgroup member. The State is \nbound, as between at least Mr Bulsey and it, by the findings of the Court of Appeal. Second, the factual substratum \nconsidered by the Court of Appeal is the same factual substratum applicable in this case. That is, the question here \n(on the pleadings) is also whether DSS Miles formed and held the relevant suspicion for the purposes of s 198(2), \nalthough he did not arrest Mr Wotton. The role of DS Robinson, and whether he held the requisite suspicion, is also \nan issue here.  Neither of the parties\u2019 submissions really grappled with these issues at all.  The respondents sought \nto avoid the finding in Bulsey by submitting that DS Robinson should be found to have arrested Mr Wotton. As the \napplicants noted, this was a departure from the respondents\u2019 pleadings in their defence in this proceeding (at [201]) \nwhich identified DSS Miles and DS Campbell as the two QPS officers responsible for identifying who should be \narrested. Further, in pleading to the allegation about the tasering of Mr Wotton, the respondents admit Mr Wotton \nwas tasered because he was resisting arrest, and then refer only to the evidence of Inspector McKay, \nSuperintendent Kruger and Sergeant Folpp. There is no reference to DS Robinson. Notwithstanding their pleadings, \nthe respondents\u2019 final written submissions stated as the factual basis for their contention that DS Robinson was the \narresting officer:Robinson was present during the riot and had knowledge of Mr Wotton\u2019s involvement in the riot.  In \noral submissions, senior counsel for the respondents pointed to the evidence about DS Robinson\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in \nthe investigation\u201d and \u201cpresence at the riot\u201d to support an inference that DS Robinson was the arresting officer. He \nalso submitted:[Section] 198(2) provides it\u2019s lawful to arrest without a warrant if certain circumstances are satisfied \nabout the reasonable suspicion and, your Honour, we submit that on the basis that Robinson was the arresting \nofficer, it can be inferred that he held such a suspicion.\n\n ...\n\n And he [Campbell] said it was recommended by Robinson and himself that Mr Wotton, who was viewed as the \nprincipal offender, be apprehended first. That evidence appears at page 1331, line 25. His evidence that Mr Wotton \nremained at the top of the list is at page 1342, line 35. Now, there is no direct evidence from Robinson, obviously, \nbut we say that that evidence of Robinson\u2019s involvement in the investigation, being interviewed by Campbell, the \nother evidence about Robinson\u2019s presence at the riot is sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Robinson \nhad the necessary reasonable suspicion under 198(2) ... In that respect also, your Honour, the action plan that was \n\n\n\nformulated contemplated, we submit, that Robinson would be the arresting officer.  Unlike in the Bulsey trial and \nappeal, the respondents in this proceeding did not adduce any evidence about the current circumstances of DS \nRobinson, and did not seek to explain by way of evidence why he was not called. The respondents did not rely on \nhis statements given after the events for the purpose of persuading the Court to draw the inference that he held the \nrequisite suspicion: that is, the respondents did not undertake the task the State sought to undertake in the Court of \nAppeal in Bulsey, which was ultimately unsuccessful in any event. There is a wholly insufficient evidentiary basis in \nthis proceeding to draw an inference that DS Robinson arrested Mr Wotton.  Even if such a task had been \nundertaken, like the Court of Appeal, I doubt I would have been persuaded. The suspects were identified in \nTownsville by DSS Miles. A list was provided to officers on Palm Island, of whom DS Robinson was one. DS \nRobinson\u2019s role was as a local officer with local knowledge. His task was to assist SS McKay and the other SERT \nofficers to find the right houses to attend and search, to identify the persons on the list and other persons who might \nbe present, and to accompany the SERT officers to the door of each house.  This was Superintendent Kruger\u2019s \naccount:You understand that some people stayed near the vehicle \u2013 Mr McKay, for example?---Yes.\n\n He didn\u2019t come with you?---No, he didn\u2019t.\n\n That\u2019s not his job?---No.\n\n His job is to monitor the overall activity - - -?---Yes, yes. - - - and the implementation of the action plan?---Yes.\n\n So you then entered through a side gate and approached Mr Wotton?---I believe so, yes.\n\n And were you \u2013 as the leader, do you go first?---Yes, I would have gone first in that instance.\n\n And Mr Robinson would have been behind you?---I can\u2019t recall but he would have been close.\n\n And I suggest to you that as you approached there was a distance of about five metres from where Mr Wotton \nstood to where you were when you started speaking to him?---Possible.\n\n And you could see that he had his hands slightly raised and to his side, by the time you got to the five metre spot?-\n--No. I \u2013 I \u2013 I can\u2019t recall that.\n\n You said eight to 10 officers went around the house. So they did the \u2013 I think you called it the cordon?---Cordon, \nyes.\n\n I think Mr McKay called it the containment line?---Yes.\n\n So they were in position as you walked towards Mr Wotton, or do you wait for them to be in position before you \nwalked towards him?---I feel it all happened simultaneously. \n\n And there were some officers still standing the near the vehicles?---Mmm.\n\n And in fact I suggest to you that on the inside of the fence there were two PSRT officers with their shields held up. \nDo you remember that?---If they were behind me then I didn\u2019t see them, but I would assume that that\u2019s a sound \ntactic, so yes they would be.\n\n And Mr Robinson had positioned himself behind you and perhaps some other SERT officers?---Yes.\n\n\n\n And you said to Mr Robinson, \u201cIs this the suspect\u201d?---Possibly.\n\n And he replied yes?---Yes.\n\n And you then said to Mr Wotton, \u201cAre you Lex Wotton\u201d and he said yes?---Possibly.\n\n So he was engaging with you?---Yes.\n\n He responded to you?---Yes.\n\n And then you told him to get down on his knees?---To raise his hands and get down on his knees. \n\n [There then follows Superintendent Kruger\u2019s account of Mr Wotton being tasered.]  In my opinion, the description of \nDS Robinson identifying Mr Wotton to A/S Kruger makes it clear that DS Robinson was not adopting the role of the \narresting officer, and behaved consistently with A/S Kruger being the arresting officer.  Superintendent Kruger\u2019s \nevidence in chief is even clearer:Yes?---Now, this is where things were a little bit different as well in relation to how \nwe did business. It was his role to \u2013 to call on the residences and call them out of the residences, because he \nobviously knew them.\n\n Had that been discussed?---Yes, that had been discussed. And also to identify them. As you could well imagine, \nwe saw a lot of pictures. There was a lot of information that \u2013 that we were to try and absorb that evening and just \nto have somebody you could say, \u201cThat\u2019s definitely the person\u201d certainly alleviated some of those risks around \nidentifying the right person.\n\n And so was Detective Sergeant Robinson in the yard at the time you\u2019re describing?---Yes, yes, he would have \nbeen in the yard. He was basically on our shoulder as we moved forward, so - - -\n\n Okay. So please proceed. What do you recall happened next?---So he has \u2013 he has identified him as \u2013 as Mr \nWotton.\n\n Identified him - - -?---To me.  Added to this is his earlier evidence in chief, describing what he understood his task \nto be: namely to be the arresting officer. Although Superintendent Kruger used the word \u201capprehend\u201d, there is no \nmaterial difference \u2013 the conduct and function are the same. So much is clear from the authorities concerning what \nconstitutes an arrest. The evidence reveals that the relevant role played by DS Robinson was to identify the person \nat each property who was listed as a suspect.  The following evidence confirms, in my opinion, that A/S Kruger had \npatently insufficient information to form any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise, that Mr Wotton had committed an \noffence. Indeed, his evidence suggests he did not even attempt do so: rather, he carried out the instructions he was \ngiven, which was to arrest a number of identified people, once DS Robinson confirmed, at each house, they were \nthe identified people.And did you receive some briefings at the command centre?---Yes, there were a few briefings; \nI can\u2019t remember how many, over the course of the early evening and right up until the early morning of the next \nday.\n\n Just in general terms, what did those \u2013 what were those briefings about? What were you briefed about?---Sure. So \nat the front end of it it would have been intelligence briefings and information briefings to tell us what had happened. \nTo bring us basically up to speed with the current situation and the lead-up to it. Some information about particular \nsuspects. So on the front end of that they were really just names. As the evening developed and more information \ncame in there were photographs, etcetera, briefings around criminal histories, backgrounds. There were also some \n\u2013 and that\u2019s fairly standard fare.\n\n\n\n So at some stage you became aware that SERT was to be involved in apprehending \u2013in the apprehension of \nsuspects. Is that correct?---Yes, I did.\n\n And when did you become aware of that? Do you recall?---Well, there was definitely a briefing for all at about 4 \no\u2019clock in the morning where that was apparent to everybody, but before that, in the lead-up to and the small \namount of input I had into the planning process, then it was obvious to me that that was going to be the intent.  \nInspector McKay had no recollection of what DS Robinson said, or what A/S Kruger said, except for the commands \nto Mr Wotton to get down on the ground. However, he conceded it was \u201cmore than likely\u201d an exchange occurred to \nidentify the person to be arrested.  Just as in Bulsey, there was no evidence in this proceeding that DSS Miles \ncommunicated anything to DS Robinson to the effect that DSS Miles held the suspicion required by s 198(2), and \ncertainly not any evidence that DSS Miles said anything to DS Robinson about the material he relied on or the \ngrounds for his suspicion. There was also no evidence DSS Miles had communicated with A/S Kruger.  I find that, if \nanyone held the reasonable suspicion required by s 198(2) of the PPR Act, it was DSS Miles, although that \nconclusion can be reached only by inference from the evidence about the task he performed of drawing up lists of \nsuspects to be apprehended, rather than from any direct evidence. However, the evidence does not establish \nwhether DSS Miles held that suspicion in any event.  I find that DS Robinson did not arrest Mr Wotton: he was \nsimply attending the premises as an officer with local knowledge of Palm Island and many of its residents, who \ncould assist in identifying the suspects on the list that the SERT teams had been given, as well as assisting in \nidentifying any other local people found at any of the nominated addresses. Even if he was found to be the arresting \nofficer, I am not satisfied DS Robinson held a reasonable suspicion. There is no evidence before me about the \nmaterial on which any suspicion he held was formed, or the grounds for that suspicion. As such, it is impossible to \nreach a view whether any suspicion he held (if he held one) was reasonably formed.  A/S Kruger was the officer \nwho arrested Mr Wotton. He could have held a reasonable suspicion, but on his own evidence he did not purport to \nhave formed one. He simply carried out the task he had been given, which was to arrest Mr Wotton. Since A/S \nKruger, as the arresting officer, did not hold the reasonable suspicion required by s 198(2) of the PPR Act, the \narrest of Mr Wotton was unlawful.  The next allegation is that Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was unlawful because it involved \nexcessive force. The use of force in an arrest pursuant to s 198 is controlled by s 376, which relevantly \nprovided:Power to use force against individuals \n\n (1) It is lawful for a police officer exercising or attempting to exercise a power under this or any other Act against \nan individual, and anyone helping the police officer, to use reasonably necessary force to exercise the \npower.Example \u2013 \n\n A police officer may use reasonable force to prevent a person evading arrest.(2) Also, it is lawful for a police \nofficer to use reasonably necessary force to prevent a person from escaping from lawful custody. \n\n (3) The force a police officer may use under this section does not include force likely to cause grievous bodily \nharm to a person or the person\u2019s death.  Section 14.3 of the OPM also instructed QPS officers that it was lawful to \n\u201cuse such force as may be reasonably necessary to overcome any force used in resisting the execution of any \nlawful process or arrest. However, it is unlawful to use more force than is justified by law to effect a lawful purpose\u201d.  \nGiven my findings about the unlawfulness of Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest, it will be apparent that s 376 cannot be relied upon \nto authorise the force used in the arrest of Mr Wotton. It is also apparent that the premise of s 14.3 of the OPM for \nthe use of reasonable force (lawful arrest) is not present. Accordingly, there was no lawful basis for the use of force \nin the arrest of Mr Wotton. This includes the tasering of Mr Wotton, which the respondents did not dispute fell within \nthe concept of the use of \u201creasonable force\u201d. The respondents did not suggest there was any lawful justification of \nthe use of force (including the use of a taser) outside s 376. Similarly, what was done to Ms Cecilia Wotton and the \nWotton children could not be justified under s 376 as a use of reasonable force to effect the arrest of Mr Wotton.  If, \ncontrary to my findings, I had determined that Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was lawful, I would in any event have found that \n\n\n\nthe use of a taser meant his arrest was effected with more force than was reasonably necessary in the \ncircumstances. That is, I would have upheld the applicants\u2019 alternative pleading in [300] of the third further amended \nstatement of claim. This would have led me to conclude, as I have in any event, that the arrest of Mr Wotton was an \nact involving a distinction based on race: the distinction was the disproportionate and unnecessary force applied to \neffect his arrest arising from the use of SERT officers to apprehend him.\n\nWas excessive force used in the arrest of Mr Wotton?  The first step in reaching this conclusion is to repeat my \nfinding that there was no reasonable and objective basis for the use of SERT teams to effect Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest, \nnor those of any of the other individuals arrested in the days after the protests and fires. It was disproportionate, \nand it was intended to subjugate and frighten those who were present at the houses entered and searched, and to \nsubjugate and frighten the entire Aboriginal community on Palm Island. In the same way, the \u2018show of force\u2019 later in \nthe day at Butler Bay, observed by Ms Sailor, of SERT teams striding around in unison in search of Mr Blackman \nSenior, was also intended to instil fear into the Aboriginal community. It was intended to be a show of force, which \nindeed it was. However, there was no objective justification for it.  The use of the taser on Mr Wotton was a direct \nconsequence of the use of the SERT officers to effect the arrest of the suspects. To the extent the applicants \nsuggested otherwise, I do not accept that submission. Whether or not Mr Wotton intended to flee, or even thought \nabout it, or how far he might have got, are all matters beside the point. I accept the evidence of both Inspector \nMcKay and Superintendent Kruger that SERT officers are trained to look for \u2018threat cues\u2019 and react accordingly. As \ntheir evidence made clear, one kind of \u2018threat cue\u2019 is body language, or body movements, that indicate a person \nmight be about to flee and try to escape apprehension. Their evidence, which I have accepted, was that they saw \nthese cues in Mr Wotton\u2019s behaviour. The arrest of Mr Wotton was the first arrest in the planned sequence, and the \nsituation was obviously tense, made all the more so because of the disproportionate and militaristic approach \nadopted by the QPS. The individual SERT officers are not to be criticised for doing what they were trained to do, \nand reacting in the way they were trained to react. That is what I find A/S Kruger did in tasering Mr Wotton. It was \nexcessive and unnecessary not because of any lack of justification in A/S Kruger\u2019s conduct, or his tactical approach \n(or that of SS McKay). It was excessive and unnecessary because there was no objective basis for an armed arrest \nof the kind the SERT officers are trained to perform.  Whether or not there was any reasonable justification for \nSERT officers being on Palm Island at all is not, as the respondents have noted, a material question of fact in this \nproceeding because the decision to deploy SERT officers was not pleaded as a contravention of s 9. Just as I have \naccepted there was a lawful basis for the initial making of an emergency declaration by DI Webber, there may well \nhave been a lawful basis \u2013 in the immediate wake of the protests and fires and given the situation for police at the \nbarracks and at the hospital and the level of tension and unrest on the island \u2013 to deploy the SERT officers to the \nisland. I harbour some doubt whether that would have happened in a non-Aboriginal community, but I need not \nexpress a concluded view.\n\nSubgroup members: lawfulness of the arrests  There is less evidence about the circumstances of the arrests of all \nthe other individuals who are members of the subgroup. Given I have found DS Robinson did not arrest Mr Wotton, \nI am satisfied on the evidence there is no basis to make a different finding in relation to his role in the arrests of the \nother subgroup members. All the evidence suggested DS Robinson played the same role at each house. \nAccordingly, I find that at each house where a member of the subgroup was arrested, it was a SERT officer who \narrested the person, not DS Robinson.  None of the SERT officers held a reasonable suspicion that the persons \nthey were arresting had committed offences for which they were being apprehended. As with Mr Wotton\u2019s case, the \nSERT officers had been given a list of suspects to apprehend, with DS Robinson identifying them. In each case, as \nwith Mr Wotton, the suspicion was likely to have been held by DSS Miles who compiled the list of suspects in \nTownsville. Whether it was a reasonable suspicion or not is not a finding that can be made on the evidence in this \nproceeding. It does not matter, because the suspicion must be held by the person who effected the arrest, and that \ndid not occur.  Subject to two matters, each of the arrests of the individuals set out at [351] was unlawful.  The two \nmatters are the arrests of William Blackman Senior and Solomon Nona. Mr Blackman Senior turned himself in, \naccompanied by his mother, at the school. Thus, there is no evidence relating to who held the requisite reasonable \nsuspicion. I am unable to make a finding that Mr Blackman Senior\u2019s arrest was unlawful. On the approach I have \ntaken to s 9, that conclusion does not preclude a finding that his arrest, and the entry and search of his home, \ncontravened s 9(1) of the RDA.  As to Solomon Nona, the evidence reveals there was an outstanding warrant in \nrespect of him. The evidence is unclear whether the SERT officer who arrested him relied on, or could rely on, this \n\n\n\noutstanding warrant. I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities, given the complete inattention given by \nthe parties to this matter, that Mr Nona\u2019s arrest was unlawful for the reasons articulated in Bulsey, or for any other \nreason.\n\nSubgroup members: use of force in the arrests  As to the use of force at the other houses, the evidence I have set \nout at [348]-[362] above establishes that the same level of force, and armed presence, as occurred at Mr Wotton\u2019s \nhouse occurred at each other house. It was equally disproportionate and unnecessary at each of the houses, and in \neach of the other arrests.  My findings about the unnecessary and disproportionate use of force are relevant to my \nfindings concerning contraventions of s 9(1) of the RDA in relation to the arrests of Mr Wotton and the other \nindividuals who were arrested, in particular the \u2018based on race\u2019 aspect and the second limb of s 9(1).  I turn to \nconsider the allegations that the entries and searches of the first, second and third applicants\u2019 houses were \nunlawful. Once I have set out my conclusion on this second tranche of unlawfulness allegations, I will consider the \nconsequences of the findings I have made for the applicants\u2019 allegations of contravention of s 9 of the RDA.\n\nWere the entries and searches of the applicants\u2019 houses unlawful?  The applicants here make four sets of \nallegations in their written submissions.  First, that the entry and search by SERT officers of the home of the first \nand third applicants at approximately 5 am on 27 November 2004 was unlawful, and was not conducted in \naccordance with the action plan prepared by Inspector Underwood, Inspector Kachel and DI Webber because it \ninvolved \u2018unnecessary disturbance\u2019 to the occupants of the house.  Second, that the entry and search by SERT \nofficers of the home of the second applicant at approximately 6.15 pm on 27 November 2004 was unlawful, and \nwas not conducted in accordance with the action plan because it involved \u2018unnecessary disturbance\u2019 to the \noccupants of the house.  Third and fourth, the use of unnecessary force and the unnecessary disturbance of \noccupants in the entry and search of the houses of the first, second and third applicants.  However, there is no \nfreestanding allegation in the pleadings of the use of excessive force in relation to the entries and searches of the \napplicants\u2019 houses. The applicants\u2019 submissions refer to [303] and [309(e)] of the third further amended statement \nof claim, but these pleadings do not make such an allegation other than as part of an allegation about the content of \nthe action plan: see [279] of the third further amended statement of claim. In other words, it must be inferred that \nInspector Underwood, Inspector Kachel and DI Webber inserted these qualifications in the action plan (about \nminimum force and no unnecessary disturbance) for a specific reason. It must be inferred they well understood \n(without identifying any legal source) that whichever police officers were sent to effect the arrests of the suspects \nin their homes would be required to use the minimum force necessary and to create the least possible disturbance \nto innocent people who might be at the addresses where suspects were to be arrested. None of this is addressed \nby the applicants or respondents in their submissions, but it seems to me that is how the argument must run.  I deal \nwith the question whether the pleadings impugn the lawfulness of the entries and searches of the houses of the \nsubgroup members, as well as the applicants, at [1365] below.  As to the first two issues about entry and search, \nthe applicants identify two possible sources of authority for this conduct: s 8 of the PSP Act ([304] of the third further \namended statement of claim) and s 19 of the PPR Act ([305] of the third further amended statement of claim). The \nrespondents do not submit there was any other source. The applicants submit neither source authorised what was \ndone. I agree with that submission.  In my opinion, s 8 of the PSP Act did not authorise the entries and searches \nconducted by the SERT officers on 27 and 28 November 2004; more particularly, it did not authorise the entries and \nsearches of the applicants\u2019 homes on 27 November 2004. Section 8 is purposive. The powers it confers are \nconferred only for the purpose of doing what is \u201cnecessary to effectively deal with\u201d the emergency situation which \nhas been declared, and remains in force, under the Act. Thus, even if there is an emergency situation within the \nmeaning of s 4 of the PSP Act, the powers in s 8 will not be exercisable unless their exercise is \u201cnecessary to \neffectively deal with\u201d the emergency.  Here, as I have found, the \u201cemergency\u201d for the purposes of s 5 of the PSP Act \nwas the fires (and accompanying explosions) and the likelihood of further fires (and accompanying explosions). \nThat is what I have found capable of satisfying the precondition to the making of the emergency declaration, and I \nhave found that the residual discretion in s 5 was lawfully exercised by DI Webber in making the declaration in the \ncircumstances he did. I have found that although, after the fact, DI Webber entered onto the certificate para (f) of \nthe definition of \u201cemergency\u201d rather than para (a), the evidence shows the principal matters he was aware about at \nthe time he made the declaration at Townsville airport were the fires and, if the declaration was within another part \nof the definition of \u201cemergency situation\u201d, his mistaken reliance on para (f) would not invalidate the exercise of \npower: Brown v West at 203; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) at [124]; Australian Education Union \nv Department of Education and Children\u2019s Services at [34]; Attorney-General (SA) v Corporation of the City of \n\n\n\nAdelaide at [175].  Thus, there was no necessity, effectively to deal with the fires and explosions which had been \nthe emergency situation the day before, for individuals\u2019 properties to be entered and searched in the way they were. \nThe same is true on the respondents\u2019 extended construction of \u201cany other accident\u201d as including riots: these had \nceased an hour after they started, the day before.  An example of a lawful exercise of power under s 8 would be, for \nexample, where in a situation of a fire, private property must be entered in order to put a fire out, or remove \naccelerants which are in the path of the fire. As the applicants submitted, the locations of all the houses entered \nand searched during the SERT operation were well away from the areas affected by any of the rock-throwing, \nlooting or other anti-social behaviour with which the police were concerned. There was no connection on the \nevidence with the fires and explosions in the sense intended by s 8 of the PSP Act. The entry and search of Mrs \nAgnes Wotton\u2019s house occurred in the early evening of 27 November 2004, when there were no signs of \ndisturbance anywhere.  I turn now to s 19 of the PPR Act. It provided:General power to enter to arrest or detain \nsomeone or enforce warrant\n\n (1) A police officer may enter a place and stay for a reasonable time on the place\u2014(a) to arrest a person without \nwarrant; or\n\n (b) to arrest a person named in a warrant; or\n\n (c) to detain a person named in a forensic procedure order or a registered corresponding forensic procedure order; \nor\n\n (d) to detain a person who may be detained under an order made under section 298, 311, 312, 316, 318D or \n318ZF; or\n\n (e) to detain a person under another Act.(2) If the place contains a dwelling, a police officer may enter the dwelling \nwithout the consent of the occupier to arrest or detain a person only if the police officer reasonably suspects the \nperson to be arrested or detained is at the dwelling.\n\n (3) If the place is a vehicle, a police officer may stop and detain the vehicle and enter it to arrest or detain the \nperson.\n\n (4) A police officer who enters a place under this section may search the place for the person.\n\n (5) In this section\u2014arrest, a person named in a warrant, includes apprehend, take into custody, detain, and remove \nto another place for examination or treatment.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    In my opinion, s 19 did not authorise the entries and searches by the SERT teams either. \nSection 19(1) is facultative: it is not itself the source of any power to arrest without a warrant. Rather, it authorises \nwhat would otherwise be a trespass, so that an otherwise lawful arrest can be undertaken. As I have found, there \nwere no lawful arrests undertaken at the applicants\u2019 properties on 27 November 2004 and s 19(1) could not support \nthe entry onto private property of the SERT officers. Section 19(2) is also facultative, and authorises entry into a \ndwelling on private property for the same purpose. The same reasoning applies and that provision cannot support \nwhat occurred at the applicants\u2019 properties on 27 November 2004.  In my opinion, the entries by SERT officers onto \nthe applicants\u2019 properties and into their houses, and the searches of their houses, were unlawful. The unlawfulness \nstems from the lack of statutory authorisation to enter and search houses without a warrant. Unlawfulness of this \nkind does not inform the questions to be answered by s 9 of the RDA and I do not consider it any further.  As to the \napplicants\u2019 third and fourth allegations (the use of unnecessary force and the unnecessary disturbance of occupants \nin the entry and search of the homes of the first, second and third applicants), those matters in my opinion are \nappropriately considered below, because they are properly characterised as the distinctions and restrictions \n\n\n\ninvolved in acts rather than acts themselves.  In submissions, the applicants concentrated on the allegation that the \nentries and searches of the house of Mr Wotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton, and the house of Mrs Agnes Wotton, were \nunlawful. Little if any time was spent on the lawfulness of the entries and searches of the houses of the subgroup. \nNevertheless, the pleadings extend to the subgroup on this issue: see [287], [303], [309(e)], [313] and [323] of the \nthird further amended statement of claim. In my opinion, the entries and searches of the houses of the subgroup \nmembers were unlawful for the same reasons I have given in relation to the three applicants.\n\nWere the arrests, entries and searches acts involving distinctions or restrictions based on race?  In their written \nsummary of argument document, the applicants identify, in this part of their case, four distinctions they say were \ninvolved in the conduct of the SERT officers. They are said to be: \u201c(a) breaches of laws and procedures; (b) failures \nto meet the cultural needs of the community; (c) the unique circumstances; [and] (d) the SERT methodology was \npeculiar to the operation.\u201d  As far as I can tell, these four sets of distinctions were said on the facts to be established \nby: (a) the attributes of the arrests and entries relied on to establish they were unlawful; (b) not considering or \naddressing Palm Island community needs and expectations following the death of an Aboriginal man in custody \n(which has been rehearsed earlier in several categories of allegations made by the applicants); (c) the remoteness \nof Palm Island and its particular history, including lack of media access and scrutiny; and (d) that the SERT teams \ndeparted from their usual methodology by entering and searching houses where there were women and children, \narresting a 13-year-old boy, and operating on stereotypical information given to them about the transient nature of \nlocal residents, the fact they would sleep with weapons, and the like.  I do not consider that any of the matters \nidentified by the applicants in this part of their claim constitute distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences \ninvolved in the conduct of the SERT officers for the purposes of s 9. As I have set out earlier in these reasons, I do \nnot consider the status of conduct as unlawful necessarily involves a distinction.  That said, the continuation of the \nemergency declaration beyond what I have found was authorised by s 5 of the PSP Act forms part of the evidence \non which I base my findings below that the methods of the SERT teams evident during the arrests, entries and \nsearches did involve distinctions and restrictions based on race. That is, the circumstances which give rise to the \nunlawfulness of the emergency declaration contributes to my conclusion that the way the arrests, entries and \nsearches were conducted was referable to Palm Island being an Aboriginal community and the \u2018targets\u2019 of the \narrests, entries and searches being Aboriginal people. There is no such connection between the circumstances \ngiving rise to the unlawfulness of the arrests (need for the arresting officer to hold the reasonable suspicion) and the \nquestion whether the arrests were acts involving distinctions or restrictions based on race.  The second and third \ndistinctions identified by the applicants do not arise from the conduct of the arrests, entries and searches and \ntherefore are not consequences \u201cinvolved\u201d in the act of discrimination. Relevantly, the act of discrimination is the \narrest of Mr Wotton or, to take another example, the entry into and search of his house. Failing to meet the cultural \nneeds of the Palm Island community is not \u201cinvolved\u201d in either of those acts, even if failing to meet cultural needs \ncould be described as differential treatment and therefore a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference. They \nare circumstances. It is possible such circumstances may give rise to an inference that the conduct involving a \ndistinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference (if one gets that far) was based on race. But they do not constitute, \nin and of themselves, the distinctions, exclusions, restrictions, or preferences involved in the acts of arrest, entry \nand search.  The fourth category of distinctions relied on by the applicants \u2013 the methods adopted in the arrests, \nsearches and entries \u2013 should in my opinion be viewed differently. To take the examples I have used above, the act \nof arresting Mr Wotton, and the act of entering and searching his house by using the methods of SERT officers did \ninvolve both distinctions and restrictions for the purposes of s 9. That is, the consequence of the methods adopted \nby the QPS (using SERT officers) was differential treatment of those individuals who were the subjects of the \narrests, the searches and the entries into private homes. Mr Wotton was arrested differently \u2013 with more force \n(including being tasered) \u2013 than otherwise would have been the case. Ms Cecilia Wotton and the Wotton children \nwere subjected to higher levels of aggression and force in the way police officers searched for suspects than \notherwise would have been the case. Ms Wotton and the Wotton children were also subject to restrictions on their \nprivacy, their sense of safety and wellbeing in and around their own homes, on their freedom of movement and (in \nrelation to those arrested) on their liberty.  The same proposition holds good for all the occupants of all the houses \nwhich were entered and searched by SERT officers. There were also restrictions on people\u2019s sense of safety and \nwellbeing in their own neighbourhoods as well as in their own houses. As the SERT officers moved about the \nisland searching and apprehending suspects, they created an intimidatory atmosphere. The following evidence \ndemonstrates what it was like for members of the community other than the applicants.  I was persuaded by Ms \n\n\n\nSailor\u2019s descriptions of what she saw from her house in Butler Bay. Butler Bay is a small settlement on largely \nunpaved roads, with forested hills behind one side of it and the sea to the other side. It is near the airport, but the \nsea dominates. It is beautiful, lush, and quiet. The houses are like any other collection of houses reflecting the \nordinary lives of their inhabitants: there are childrens\u2019 bikes and toys outside, dogs ambling around or sitting in the \ndirt or the shade, unfinished building projects apparent at some houses, cars parked, boats on trailers, gardens in \nvarious states of care and wilderness. With that picture in mind, this was Ms Sailor\u2019s evidence:the only interaction I \nhad at home was sitting \u2013 my German \u2013 yes, I owned a German Shepherd, and \u2013 well, my mum did, and he was \nold and disabled and he was barking, barking, barking, and that, sort of, gave us the indication that there\u2019s \nsomebody in the yard, or something\u2019s happening. So I walked down to the front of our driveway. Our house is \nclearly overgrown with trees, and I walked down, and as I \u2013 he was standing at the end of the driveway, barking, \nbarking, and when I looked there was probably 60 \u2013 60, four across, police officers in full gear, marching, and my \ndog had been barking at their dog, and I sort of laughed, because I think those dogs would have easily killed my \ndog, and I just stood there and just watched as they walked up the road. I just was wondering what was happening \nout at Butler Bay for a team of police to be there. After they kept marching up the road I then went upstairs and sat \nin my kitchen, and I\u2019ve got a clear view out the back of my neighbour\u2019s house, and we didn\u2019t have a fence at the \ntime of the yard, and when I looked the officers were in the next door neighbour\u2019s yard, marching up towards the \nbush, because behind our place is just all overgrown bush, and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m not sure where they\u2019re going,\u201d at the \ntime. But, as it turned out, I found out that they were actually looking for William Blackman. Yes.  Later, in answer to \nsome questions from me, she gave a further description of the police she had seen:can you just describe in a bit \nmore detail for me what gear you mean by [the full gear]?--- The full gear. The entire dress was black \u2013 helmet, \nshield, a shield as well in front, black boots, black pants. Yes. So you \u2013 I couldn\u2019t see anybody\u2019s face. They just \nmarched straight ahead. I just stood on the side.\n\n But what could you hear? Were there any noises?---No. Only my dog barking and the \u2013 the thumping of the feet.  \nMs Sailor was challenged in cross-examination whether the police were really marching, in step. She confirmed \nthat they were and, despite the denials of Inspector McKay and Superintendent Kruger, I accept her evidence.  Ms \nCollette Wotton, who is the sister of Mr Lex Wotton, gave evidence about the effects she saw of the police \npresence on the children she was working with at St Michael\u2019s School:... we didn\u2019t have much kids then when the \npolice was here. We only got \u2013 I think the highest we ended up with \u2013 it was 165 kids at the time. So during the first \nweek we was looking at 50 kids max, but from the Friday [26 November 2004] to the Wednesday I think we had \nabout 25 or 30 kids in the school. Well, of course, you can\u2019t blame them. You know, their house got raided, seeing \nfull gear of police walking around, you know. They were disengaged. We tried to talk to parents if they can \nencourage them to come school, but, you know, they didn\u2019t want to. The ones at the school were \u2013 you know, we \ntook notice when we had them out of the playground where all the buses were going past. They was using our bus. \nThey knew our bus, the kids. They said \u2013 you know, they used to say, \u201cWhen they going to give us our bus back? \nI\u2019m sick of walking to school. I\u2019m sick of, you know, walking home from school. It\u2019s too hot, the ground.\u201d You know, \nour kids used to complain, and during lunchtime, big lunch, when they see ..... Some kids were back. They used to \nhide round the building, and, you know, some of us indigenous staff said, \u201cWhy are you hiding?\u201d \u201cBecause they \nknow I\u2019m ..... Them. They came into my place. They came to my nanny place\u201d, you know. It was really hard, you \nknow. They came to my house.  Ms Collette Wotton also gave evidence about what she witnessed and experienced \nduring the arrests, entries and searches. She lived at Butler Bay, near Mr William Blackman. She described how \nshe was sitting on her back verandah at about 7 am in the morning and saw the SERT teams:they went to John \u2013 \nJohn Bull\u2019s place, because he\u2019s the other side opposite of me, and then \u2013 you know ..... Everybody out of their \nhouses. They can see it and \u2013same thing. You could hear, like ...They\u2019re running in the full gear with \u2013 with the \nshield and everything. They were all covered, and they were there for 30, 40 minutes, and they had the cars there. \nAnd then they came out and they went \u2013 went back in the mission ...  The \u201cMission\u201d is what some local residents \ncall the central area of Palm Island, where the public buildings and shops are located. It is indeed where the \nmission buildings used to be. Ms Collette Wotton then described what happened when the SERT officers could not \nlocate William Blackman at his house. After taking a call from her niece Krysten Harvey, who was crying and upset \nafter her experience at Agnes Wotton\u2019s house, Ms Collette Wotton then found herself faced with SERT officers at \nher own house:Police officers were around the house and running out. So I went back inside of the house. I told the \nkids, \u201cQuickly go under with your nana .....\u201d This is my partner\u2019s mother. She was a dialysis patient too. She was in \n\n\n\nthe \u2013 in the room, because I\u2019ve got a four-bedroom. So she was in this room. They\u2019re coming through the back \ndoor. I said, \u201cRun in there with your nanny.\u201d So they all ran, and they were all screaming and crying, and I walked \nback to the front door, with my cup of tea, and \u2013 yes. They were around my house. One was standing right at the \ndoor. One was right there. I stand there, holding my cup of tea. And he was fully covered. The thing I remember \nabout him: he has blue eyes. He had a gun aimed at me, and he said to me, \u201cHave you got a William Blackman \nhere? Does he stay here?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here. He lives at the back.\u201d \u201cCan we \nsearch under the bed and look in the cupboards?\u201d and I said, \u201cIf you want to search my house, can you leave the \ngun outside? Can\u2019t you hear all the kids screaming in the other room there?\u201d Because we were standing with the \ndoor, I could see the \u2013 the kids where they cry. There was another officer \u2013 officer there, with a gun, by the window, \ntelling the grandmother \u2013 because all the kids was screaming \u2013 tell them to shut all their mouths. So I would have \nhad \u2013 the age \u2013 the kids were between 10 and four, in my house, because they all went straight into one room, and \nI \u2013 and I was really confused, because I couldn\u2019t attend to them and, like, my \u2013 they was crying. They were singing \nout to me, saying, \u201cMum, Mum, come here. Dad, come here,\u201d because my partner was in the kitchen, and he didn\u2019t \nwant to move from the kitchen because he had \u2013 he just froze himself, and at that time, you know, like, you\u2019ve got a \nriot \u2013 a gun pointing at you and you\u2019ve got the kids screaming. You know, like, you know, is he going to shoot me or \nnot, and my kids going to go ..... You know, there was a lot of things rushing through my mind. I said \u2013 this should \nnot happen.  Ms Wotton adhered to her evidence in cross-examination and there is no reason not to accept it: she \nwas clearly reliving what had occurred as she described it. The SERT officers did not enter Ms Collette Wotton\u2019s \nhouse: instead, they ran off looking for Mr Blackman, through into the neighbouring property.  I have set out a \ngeneral description of what occurred at [348]-[362] above, but it is necessary, given my findings, to here set out in \nmore detail what I find occurred, especially at the houses of the applicants. I also propose to set out some of the \nevidence I heard from the other children who had been subjected to the effects of the arrests, entries and searches, \nbecause their evidence illustrates the disproportion involved in the conduct of SERT officers, and the distinctions \nand restrictions involved in the arrests, entries and searches.  I turn first to what happened at the house of Mr \nWotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton, then to what happened at the house of Mrs Agnes Wotton, and lastly to the \nevidence of the other lay witnesses, including those who were children at the time.  Inspector McKay described \nwhat occurred outside Mr and Ms Wotton\u2019s house. Subject to making some additional findings based on Mr and Ms \nWotton\u2019s evidence, I accept this account:Detective Sergeant Robinson approached the house with another \u2013 with \u2013 \nprimarily with another SERT operative, SERT Operative 3 [A/S Kruger], who was right beside him. I saw a male \nperson who \u2013 who I now know to be Mr Wotton come out of the address, dressed in shorts, stood on the verandah \nor the patio of the address, and a \u2013 and \u2013 and he was told by SERT Operative 3 to \u2013 to get down on the ground. He \ndidn\u2019t get down on the ground. He looked around and, when I say \u201clooked around\u201d, at the time \u2013 we\u2019re trained to \nidentify threat cues, and one of the things that \u2013 my initial thought was when \u2013 when you ask someone to do \nsomething and they fail to comply with that in the first instance, that is a concern, because (1) we\u2019ve already \u2013 \nwe\u2019ve used two use of force options. One is presence, and particularly the fact that we\u2019ve got police officers \ndressed like this. That\u2019s an \u2013 that\u2019s an escalated use of presence. So people that will be compliant when they see \npolice in that configuration generally comply straightaway. Now, I noticed Mr Wotton didn\u2019t comply straightaway, \nand for me that \u2013 that is a threat cue and the potential that the person is not going to be compliant. In addition to \nthat, he looked around. So he had his hands out to the side, from memory, but he looked around to the perimeter of \nwhere the SERT officers \u2013 SERT officers and PSRT was. And again, from experience, another threat cue that \u2013 \npotentially looking for an escape route, potentially looking to get away from that location. And \u2013 and \u2013 and after I \nsaw that occur, I\u2019ve then looked out to where the cordon positions were to make sure that it was well-contained and \nthat we didn\u2019t have any gaps in the containment, and I heard further instructions \u2013 and I think there were a total of \nfour \u2013 before I heard the popping sound of the taser, and Mr Wotton was tasered. I looked back to see Mr Wotton \nslowly get down onto the ground, and he was then handcuffed by the SERT operatives.  Ms Cecilia Wotton \ndescribed this event from her perspective inside the house, which I accept.And what happened the next morning?---\nWell, Lex came and woke me up.\n\n Okay. Just take your time?---And he said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me\u201d, and I jumped up out of bed and looked \nthrough the window, seen all the cars coming down to the dirt road to the house where we were staying, about 10 \ncars.\n\n\n\n And did you see anyone get out of the cars?---Yes.\n\n What did you see?---Police with helmets, guns, shields, dogs.\n\n And do you remember how they were dressed?---Yes. In black clothing, helmets.\n\n And did you watch where they went?---Yes. They was on the veranda, but I didn\u2019t see the \u2013 they was all on the \nveranda with Lex.\n\n And could you see Lex from where you were looking?---No. That\u2019s when I walked out\n\n So just tell her Honour what happened then. So you walked out of the bedroom?---My brother came out from the \nfront room, and he was screaming, said they shot Lex, and as I ran down the hallway Detective Robinson shined a \ntorch in my face. The kids were behind me, and he told me to get the fucking hell inside and lay down, and I lie \ndown on the bed with my daughter who couldn\u2019t hear anything. My brother got down on the floor. Schanara [the \nWottons\u2019 eldest daughter] was with the door.\n\n So you lay on the bed with Nazine, and that\u2019s why you say she couldn\u2019t hear anything?---She couldn\u2019t.\n\n She didn\u2019t know what was happening?---No.\n\n And could you \u2013 while you were lying on the bed, what could you see?---The policeman had his gun to my \ndaughter\u2019s [Schanara\u2019s] head.\n\n Did any of the policemen say anything to you when you were in the bedroom?---No. There was one on that side \nwith that window on that side standing there with the gun, just the side my daughter was laying, Nazine.\n\n So that was outside the window?---No. The bed inside. There\u2019s a window on that side and a window this side on \nthe veranda. About six or seven of them run in the house. They tipped everything upside down and Schanara ..... \nWhat they was looking for. And Detective Robinson asked me to grab a pair of ..... And a ..... For Lex, and I got up.\n\n And you knew it was Detective Robinson?---Yes, I know him. That was him.\n\n How did you know him? You had met him before this day?---Yes.\n\n And then what happened? You were asked to get shoes and a shirt for Lex?---I got up and I grabbed a pair of blue \nsinglets and joggers, and gave it to - - -\n\n You gave it to the police officer or to Lex?---To the police officer.\n\n And did you go outside and see Lex?---No. I was too scared. I was shaking, crying.\n\n And how many of your family were in the room at that time?---In my room? Me and Nazine on the bed, and my \nbrother on the floor and Schanara was with the door.\n\n And could you speak to the other boys?---No. They were in the front room. Two police had them in the front room.\n\n\n\n And did you call out to the kids in the front room?---When they left.\n\n When \u2013 and how long were the police inside the house?---For about 10 to 20 minutes.\n\n And did they tell you they were leaving?---No.\n\n So they just left?---They just left.  Ms Wotton then described how she saw the SERT officers go across the road \nfrom her house to another house, where they \u201cpulled up and smashed the door down of the other house, and yelling \nto some people there to get down\u201d.  Reproducing Ms Wotton\u2019s evidence simply as text does not do justice to it. It \nwas clear to me that, as she gave her evidence, Ms Wotton was reliving those events and remained terrified and \nprofoundly disturbed by them. I am satisfied that when her brother called out, \u201cthey shot Lex\u201d she thought Mr \nWotton had indeed been shot, and possibly killed. I am satisfied that she thought there was a real possibility the \nguns the SERT officers pointed at her and her children might be fired. She was in fear of her life, and the lives of \nher husband and children. That fear was palpable as she gave her evidence 10 years later. In its text, her evidence \nmay appear unemotional, but that was not the case. Although in my opinion what also came through in her oral \nevidence was a sense of disbelief, even after all these years, about what had occurred in their very modest family \nhome, in her children\u2019s bedrooms, in her living area, and on her porch. The family continues to live in that house \nand I am confident, and prepared to find, that the memories of the entry and search, and the arrest of Mr Wotton, \nwill never be far from their minds.  In cross-examination, Ms Wotton emphasised what it was about the events that \nday which most shocked and disturbed her:No. And, Mrs Wotton, are you able, in your own mind \u2013 I know this is \nprobably very difficult, but are you able, in your own mind, to sort of think about these things and tell me whether \nthose deaths affected you more than what happened when the police came to your house and your husband was \narrested and went on trial or- - -?---When they came to my house, this affected me more.\n\n You think that has affected you more - - -?---Yes.\n\n - - - than - - -?---Yes.\n\n - - - these deaths. Okay. And is that because it\u2019s more personal? What happened to you at the house and your \nhusband, that\u2019s more personal to you. You\u2019re more directly involved in it. Is that why you think it has affected you \nmore?---No. It\u2019s how they held a gun up to my daughter and swore, shouted at us, told us to get down. You see that \non TV, on movies, but this happened in real life.\n\n Right. So is that really the big thing that you think has affected you, the - - -?---Yes.\n\n - - pointing of the gun at your daughter\u2019s head?---Yes.\n\n That\u2019s the thing that sticks in your mind that - - -?---Yes.\n\n Yes. Okay?---They could have killed her.\n\n Sorry?---They could have shot her, killed her.  Ms Wotton also gave evidence about subsequent attempts by DS \nRobinson, apparently, to extract information from her children about Mr Wotton\u2019s offending. This evidence was \nuncontradicted and unchallenged and I accept it. It does not reflect well on the QPS that this occurred. It is further \nevidence, in my opinion, of the different policing behaviours used on Palm Island, where trying to get children to \nincriminate their father after having had armed SERT officers enter and search their house that morning seems to \n\n\n\nhave been considered appropriate. Again, in my opinion, the boundaries of behaviour for the QPS seemed to have \nbeen drawn differently, and adversely to local residents, because this was an Aboriginal community. This was Ms \nWotton\u2019s evidence:Okay? Do you recall later in the morning, when you were back home?---That Saturday afternoon \nwhen I \u2013 me and the kids were on our verandah. Detective Darren Robinson came down. He came on the verandah \nand he said to the kids, \u201cCome here and sit down. I need to talk to you about your father. What did your father do? \nDo you know what he did?\u201d And I said to Detective Robinson, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be asking these kids that \nquestion. They\u2019re only kids.\u201d Told them to go back inside, and he asked me, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer you \ntill I get legal advice.\u201d So he went, but he came there that afternoon and parked in front of the house, and he went \nlike that to me. That must have been about 4.30 that afternoon, and when I went out he said, \u201cYou have to come to \nthe school,\u201d and I said,\n\n \u201cWhat for?\u201d and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re doing some counselling there.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m right.\u201d He went, and he \ncame back a second time, but I didn\u2019t go out.\n\n And after he left the first time, what did you do?---I was just sitting there on the verandah. I didn\u2019t move.\n\n And what were the kids doing?---They was inside, watching TV.\n\n How were they?---They was very upset.\n\n Who was there at the time? Do you remember?---All the children.\n\n And what were they saying to you?---They was keep asking where their father was.\n\n And did they say anything about Mr Robinson?---No  Something was made by the respondents, faintly, about the \nfailure of people such as Ms Wotton to avail themselves of the counselling offered by DS Robinson. The evidence \nsuggests in any event the offer was made as something of a throwaway line. The location of the counselling was at \nthe local school, which was the QPS command centre. At the same time, local residents were being apprehended \nand questioned there. The school was swarming with police officers, including SERT and PSRT officers. Ms \nWotton\u2019s husband had just been arrested in violent circumstances (for that is what tasering is), while she and her \nfamily were held inside by armed SERT officers. She had no idea what had happened to him, where he had been \ntaken or for how long. In those circumstances, DS Robinson\u2019s offer of counselling could hardly be taken seriously, \nand it is difficult to understand how he could have considered it an appropriate offer to make. Ms Wotton gave \ncogent evidence about her reasoning on that day:Well, one of my friends walked past my place, and she came to sit \non the veranda with me to talk about \u2013 we was talking about what happened, and she said that they was taking \npeople into the school to question them and charge them. Detective Robinson came down after when she left that \nafternoon.\n\n All right. So what did you think might happen if you went to the school?---Well, I was scared, if I would have went \nthere, what would have happened. They probably would have \u2013 I was thinking they might have locked me up or \ncharge me for anything.  Mr and Ms Wotton\u2019s daughter, Ms Schanara Bulsey, also gave evidence about this entry \nand search:I remember being woken up early hours of the morning. It was still dark. Mum knocked on the door. As I \nwoke up I can see lights at my windows, people just shining a torch. So we all got up. Mum woke us all up, and \nsaid, \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d Dad was already outside. He has been sleeping outside all that morning, in the lounge, for \nthem \u2013 you know, waiting on them so they don\u2019t have to come in the house. We woke up. We all tried to rush \noutside to see what was going on and if Dad was all right. Then the men in black balaclavas came in the house as \nwe all tried to walk out. So we all rushed back into the house, to the hallway, into Mum and Dad\u2019s room. My uncle, \nbrother, my mum, myself, all went into Mum and Dad\u2019s room. I was \u2013 Mum was on the bed. Uncle Sonny was on \nthe floor. I was sitting near the doorway against a wall. So there was still men coming in by that time. Sitting down \nall we can [hear] is, \u201cThey\u2019re here. We got them. We\u2019re here. They\u2019re here. We got them.\u201d After that I kind of was \n\n\n\nscared at that time, sitting down, couldn\u2019t move, crying at the same time, and Mum was telling me to, \u201cShut up, shut \nup.\u201d I couldn\u2019t.\n\n ...\n\n And so you get to the front door and what do you see out the front door?---Men standing around Dad. Dad was on \nhis knees with his arm up to his head then they rushed in. So we had to walk back into the hallway and run into the \nbedroom.\n\n ...\n\n And so when you\u2019re walking back into your mum\u2019s room did you hear any noises?---A big bang.\n\n A big bang and what did you think that was?---Not sure.\n\n Well, what did you think happened when you heard the big bang?---That they was hitting him with something.\n\n Hitting him \u2013 who? Your dad or - - -?---Yes. Dad.\n\n And so you get back on the floor. You\u2019re sitting on the floor. How were you sitting?---With my knees up against my \nchest, my arms around my legs and my head in between my knees.\n\n And did anything happen while you were sitting on the floor?---Sitting on the floor all I can hear \u2013 the yelling, \nscreaming, me crying. All that time I was hitting on the floor, crying ..... Myself.\n\n And so you said you heard yelling and screaming. Who was yelling and screaming?---Mum was yelling and \nscreaming telling me to shut up ..... Crying and I couldn\u2019t stop.\n\n And were there any of the men in the room or ..... At that stage?---Yes. There was.\n\n And where were the men? Were there \u2013 was there \u2013 how many men were there?---One standing up in the doorway \nand then you had the rest in the hallway.\n\n So one standing up in the doorway?---Yes.\n\n So how far would he have been away from you then?---Two rulers.\n\n ...\n\n And what \u2013 was there anything else that you noticed about him \u2013 the way he was standing?---He was standing \nthere holding the gun.\n\n And what was he doing with the gun \u2013 just holding it?---Holding it.\n\n And how was he holding it, do you remember?---Holding it where my head - - -\n\n Holding it where your head is?---Yes.\n\n\n\n [Ms Bulsey then was given a short break in her evidence to settle herself.]\n\n Can you describe how he was pointing that and where it was pointed to?---Holding it up just placing it where my \nhead was.\n\n [She was then asked some leading questions which did not assist me in understanding what she could next recall \nand I omit her answers to those questions.]\n\n It [the gun] was facing my head because mum kept on yelling at me to get me to stop crying. I told her, \u201cI can\u2019t stop \ncrying. He\u2019s got the gun with my head.\u201d\n\n And so do you remember when you were sitting there \u2013 do you remember anything \u2013what happened next after that \nwhen you were sitting there?---After everything was done they had dad locked up. One of the officers came in the \nroom and asked for clothes for dad. Mum got those clothes handed up to them.\n\n ...\n\n They all left out of the room, so we waited into the room until they all left, went outside to the ledge and see if we \ncould still see dad. We couldn\u2019t because they already left. We all sat in the lounge and started crying. Mum was \ntrying to calm us down ...  Ms Bulsey\u2019s evidence was acutely credible. She had a quiet demeanour, but her terror, \nlike her mother\u2019s, was still palpable 10 years later. I accept that what most terrified her, and the thing she cannot \nforget, was the gun pointed at her head. This is what she said about her memory:And when you think about what \nhappened in these events do you think about those?---I think about the gun always to my head.  The respondents \ndid not call the officers who entered Mr and Ms Wotton\u2019s house. Superintendent Kruger gave evidence he thought it \nwas unlikely that officers had pointed their guns in the way Ms Bulsey described, however he did not enter the \nhouse. Ms Bulsey was challenged in cross-examination on the basis she may have been mistaken, but she \nadhered to her evidence with a conviction which I found persuasive. This was her evidence, relevantly, in cross-\nexamination:Is that possible, that he was pointing it forward, but he wasn\u2019t pointing it at you, that it only felt like he \nwas pointing it at you. Is that possible?---No. As I put my head up I can see from the corner of my eye that he did \nhave it at my head.\n\n Okay. And I think you told Mr Creamer that the gun was two ruler-lengths away from you?---Yes.\n\n Is that right? Is it possible that you\u2019ve got that slightly wrong as well, and that what actually happened was he was \na bit further away from you than that, at least a metre and a half or something like that?---No.  Ms Bulsey was 15 \nyears old at the time of these events. Other children present were Billo (who was approximately 14), Nazine (who \nwas approximately 8), and Robert (who was approximately 12). Mr and Ms Wotton were rearing some children who \nwere not their biological children. Schanara Bulsey was one of these. She is the granddaughter of David Bulsey.  \nAlso present at the Wottons\u2019 house during the arrests, entries and searches was Mr and Ms Wotton\u2019s son Albert. \nHe was approximately 12 years old at the time. Again, there were some leading questions asked of Mr Albert \nWotton, and I have not placed much weight on his answers to such questions. What follows are those aspects of \nhis evidence I found reliable:So the police come in. How \u2013 what did you see? Did you see a number of cars or - - -\n?---I saw cars, about eight to 10 cars.\n\n Eight to 10 cars. And what did those cars do?---Beg your pardon?\n\n ...\n\n\n\n And what happens once the police cars stop?---When the police cars stops, about 15 to 20 men jumped out. Half \nwent to one side of the house and the other went to the other side.\n\n So when those men jumped out, did they have anything \u2013 how would you describe those men? What were they - - \n-?---They had guns, rifles with a strap around them. They had masks, all dressed in black.\n\n So was there anything else that you remember about them?---They also had red lights on the guns.\n\n ...\n\n And you say they go all round the house. What do you mean by that?---Well, half went \u2013 about 10 men went to one \nside, and maybe another eight went to the other side.\n\n So 10 one side, and eight the other. And this is all \u2013 is this while you\u2019re standing in the lounge still?---Lounge. By \nthe time I went from the lounge to the kitchen, they were already out the back, standing.\n\n Okay. So you saw them. Did you then go into the kitchen, did you?---Yes.\n\n And so when you went into the kitchen, what did you see when you were in the kitchen?---I saw red lights on the \nwall, coming through the windows and stuff.\n\n You saw red lights coming through the windows?---Yes.\n\n And once you saw those red lights, what was the next thing that happened after that?---I walked back out of the \nkitchen. That\u2019s when I saw about six men coming through the house, through the front door.\n\n ...\n\n They were coming \u2013 they \u2013 as they were coming in, I was already down the hallway into the room. So they already \ncame in, came down and two \u2013 two to three went to the second bedroom, and there were two in the front bedroom, \nstanding by the door.\n\n So the front bedroom: is that the room you were in?---Yes.\n\n And so who was in the room with you when you were in there?---There was my cousin Michael.\n\n Your cousin Michael. Was there anyone else there?---Also my uncle.\n\n Your uncle. And what\u2019s his name?---Sonny.\n\n Sonny. And was there anyone else in there with you?---No.\n\n So you were in there with your uncle and your cousin, and were there \u2013 you said that two police officers came into \nyour room?---Yes.\n\n And what did they do once they came into your room?---They told us to get down \u2013get on the ground.\n\n\n\n ...\n\n It was in a very \u2013 tone of voice that they used - - -\n\n Sorry?--- - - - scary - - -\n\n It was a scary voice?---Yes.\n\n And were you scared then? You say - - -?---I was. At the time I was.  Albert then described moving to the window \nin the bedroom he was in, and looking out onto the verandah where his father and the police officers were:And \nwhat \u2013 when you get to the window, what\u2019s the first thing that you remember seeing?---I saw my dad outside.\n\n You saw your dad outside?---Kneeling down.\n\n He was kneeling down?---Yes.\n\n And so he\u2019s kneeling down, and what happens then?---Then I saw about maybe six officers around him, telling him \nto get down: \u201cGet down. Get down.\u201d\n\n So he\u2019s kneeling down?---He\u2019s kneeling down with his - - -\n\n They\u2019re yelling, \u201cGet down. Get down\u201d?--- - - - hands behind his head.\n\n His hands are behind his head?---Yes.\n\n They\u2019re saying, \u201cGet down. Get down\u201d?---\u201dGet down.\u201d\n\n What\u2019s the next thing you see then?---I then saw \u2013 when I looked back out the door, I saw the police officers still \nstanding there. When I turned back around, I saw the stun gun.\n\n You - - -?---I saw them touch him with the stun gun.\n\n They touched him with the stun gun. And how do you know it was a stun gun?---I saw electricity come across it.\n\n Electricity?---Yes.\n\n And what happened once they stunned him?---He went down to the ground shaking like he was taking a fit, but it \nwas from that.\n\n And what did you think when you saw him on the ground?---I thought that he was going to die, and a lot of things \nwere just rushing through my mind.\n\n A lot of things? What sort of things?---I was \u2013 what had happened to Mulrunji was going to happen to my dad and \nstuff, you know, once they took him and that.\n\n\n\n What do you mean by what happened to Mulrunji was going to happen to your dad?--- ..... Can you repeat that \nagain? Sorry.\n\n You said you thought what was going to happen to Mulrunji was going to happen to your dad. That was running \nthrough your head?---Yes.\n\n What did you mean by that?---I don\u2019t know. I just thought something was going to happen as they took him away, \nafter the stun gun and stuff.\n\n So they stun him, and then do they take him - - -?---And they picked him up and took him to the vehicle.\n\n They pick him up, took him to the vehicle, and what do you do then after that?---And then I shut the window and \nwalked back to the bed and sat down, and they were \u2013 I also heard a lot of screaming from the other room, because \nthe police were in there as well.\n\n You heard screaming from the other room?---Pardon?\n\n So that\u2019s the room next to your \u2013 where you were?---Yes. That\u2019s .....\n\n And do you know who was in there?---It was my mum, my brother, sister \u2013Schanara, Maisie, Billo, Robert. Also my \nUncle Sonny ended up in that room as well.\n\n He ended up in there?---Yes.\n\n So you stayed in your room with Michael?---Yes.\n\n So you hear screaming in the other room?---Yes.\n\n What happened? What\u2019s the next thing after you recall the screaming?---The cops just turned around and walked \nback down the hallway and back out.\n\n So when you heard that screaming, what were you thinking? What do you think is happening?---I thought \nsomething were going on, like, the gun \u2013 they were going to fire the guns and stuff.\n\n You thought they were going to fire the guns?---Mmm.\n\n And so you say when the officers \u2013 did they say anything to you before they left?---Not that I can recall.  In cross-\nexamination, it was suggested to Albert that he, like other witnesses who gave the same evidence, was mistaken in \nrecalling that there were red dots on the guns carried by the SERT teams. He denied he was mistaken.  Both \nSuperintendent Kruger and Inspector McKay gave evidence that there were no such red laser target mechanisms \non the guns they were carrying. Inspector McKay gave evidence that there were red dot sighting systems on the \nSERT assault rifles, in a cylinder or a sight with prisms at either end, so that to the officer holding the rifle a red dot \nwas projected into the middle of the sight. His evidence was that this red dot would not be visible to the person at \nwhom the gun was pointed, and would not be visible forward of the weapon.  I do not feel able to make a positive \nfinding one way or the other about the presence or absence of red dots. Such a finding is not material to the matters \nI need to determine in any event. The terror I find these children experienced was not dependent on their \nrecollection about red lights or dots.  It was also submitted in final submissions that Mr Albert Wotton may have \n\n\n\nbeen mistaken that his father was on his knees when tasered. It is correct that Mr Wotton himself did not give this \nevidence. I accept the timing of what Albert said he saw may not be precise. I do accept however that he saw his \nfather on his knees at some stage, and I accept that he saw him being tasered. Importantly, I also accept that the \nreaction he saw his father have to being tasered looked to Albert like his father was having a fit, and that Albert \nthought his father might be going to die. That was a sight no 12-year-old should have to witness, and thoughts no \n12-year-old should have to have.  As for Mr Wotton\u2019s own evidence of the sequence of events, I find his evidence \ndoes not add significantly to the findings I have made above. As I set out elsewhere, although subjectively he may \nhave had no intention of fleeing, SERT officers trained to react to what they describe as \u201ccues\u201d may well have had \ndifferent perceptions and this explains why he was tasered. I do accept the officers were acting somewhat pre-\nemptively, and, in my opinion, this is part of what was likely to happen once a highly trained squad like SERT was \ngiven the task of apprehending offenders. There would be no second chances, no delays, no opportunities: they \nwould execute their orders clinically and quickly, which is what they did.  As to what Mr Wotton himself \napprehended might happen to his family during the entry and search, I accept the following evidence he gave:An \nofficer said, \u201cGet down on your knees. Get down on your knees.\u201d And so in all of that I heard \u2013 I could hear my \nchildren crying, singing out loud. And I said, \u201cStay inside. Don\u2019t worry. Stay inside.\u201d And at the same time there was \nthis police officer still singing out, \u201cGet down on your knees. Get down on your knees. Place your hands behind \nyour back of your head.\u201d But I was concerned for my children and my wife because my thoughts were if they walked \nor came out, someone would panic out of the police officers and shoot them. I turned towards them and I said, \n\u201cStay in there. Don\u2019t worry. Stay in there.\u201d And as I turned back, I could see something like \u2013 it was so quick, like \nlightning, and I just remember being hit with something, and my thoughts were I was shot, and I thought, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s \nrubber bullet,\u201d because \u2013 because I was still standing, and then I could feel this current running through me, and \nthen I knew it wasn\u2019t a bullet, so \u2013 because I could hear these orders to get down, and then I got down on my \nknees, and the current started to \u2013 it was getting stronger and stronger. So when I got on my knees I actually fell \nforward, and while I was down there they said to put my hands behind my back, and I couldn\u2019t do it because of my \nshoulders. I had the four reconstructions on my shoulder, and just a police officer \u2013 two grabbed me, one on each \nleg, at the back. Another had me round the neck, and I had my head turned to the side, and I had a barrel pointed \nin my head, and I felt another one in my back.\n\n Another one? You mean another gun?---Another gun, and I could actually see it, and a police officer leaned on top \nof me. He had his knee into my back, and they had me pinned down, and then when he did \u2013 when they had me \npinned down he got off. He pulled his knee off of my back, and then they grabbed me by the hands and forced my \nhands behind my back, and handcuffed me, and I was there for possibly a couple of minutes, and I could hear my \nfamily going off and I could hear \u2013 as I got up \u2013 they lifted me up. I was in a bit of pain, because of the shoulders \nand stuff, or they asked me to get up and I couldn\u2019t because of my balance, because of the shoulder. So they lifted \nme up, and one of the officers sang out, \u201cWhat about in the house?\u201d and Robinson said, \u201cYeah, go in,\u201d and \u2013 but at \nthe same time I could hear \u2013 before the orders was given, I could hear that they were already in the house. They \u2013 \nbecause I left the back door open. They must have went in through there. I could hear them, and I could hear they \nwere throwing things around in the house, and \u2013 and I could hear the kids screaming. I could hear them told to, \u201cGet \non the ground. Lie down.\u201d I \u2013 when Robinson gave that order I said, \u201cYou got all you want. There\u2019s no need to go \ninto the house. You got who you come to grab,\u201d and then they had torches shining on me, in my face. At the same \ntime I could see the red laser light before I was hit with the taser. They\u2019re shining in my face and \u2013 and I was trying \nto \u2013 trying to look \u2013 look around at the same time. I could see all of this stuff, and just trying to, I suppose, look away \nfrom the light, but at the same time you\u2019re trying to see who\u2019s who, and stuff. But I \u2013 I \u2013 there was a couple of \nofficers walked forward, and then one of them pulled out the prods \u2013 it looked like little darts, little round things \u2013 \nfrom my chest. There was a lead attached to it, and they put them in a Mount Franklin water bottle, and after that I \nsaid, \u201cCould I have some \u2013 could I have a shoe, please, and a \u2013 and a shirt?\u201d and Robinson said \u2013 I heard him. He \nwalked in \u2013 he ran into the house and he said, \u201cGet him a bloody shirt. Get him a shoe. Quick. Hurry up. Get it,\u201d and \nI could hear all the crying and thing, and Cecilia trying to do what she could do thing, and so they marched me over \ntowards the vehicle that was parked at our gate, and they opened up the back.  He was not challenged in cross-\nexamination on this evidence, and I accept it.  I turn now to the evidence about what happened at Mrs Agnes \nWotton\u2019s house. The evidence on this issue came from Mrs Wotton herself, Krysten Harvey, who was in the kitchen \nwhen the SERT officers entered, and Chevez Morton, who was at that time a young boy playing outside in the yard \n\n\n\nof Mrs Wotton\u2019s house.  I have elsewhere explained why Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s evidence needs to be treated with \nsome care, through no fault of her own. Mrs Wotton was approximately 60 years old at the time of the events in \nNovember 2004. Although she gave evidence on other matters, she did not give evidence about the events at her \nhouse, because she was not there. Ms Harvey\u2019s evidence was the main evidence about what happened at Mrs \nWotton\u2019s house. It will be recalled that the SERT teams went to this house looking for Richard Poynter, whom they \napprehended there while he was having a shower.  Ms Harvey was 16 years old at the time of the arrests, entries \nand searches. Mrs Agnes Wotton is her grandmother. Richard Poynter was at that time her step-father. Tracy \nTwaddle, Mulrunji\u2019s partner, is Ms Harvey\u2019s godmother. I mention that fact as but one of the many illustrations in the \nevidence in this trial about the multi-layered connections between people who live on Palm Island and the way that \nMulrunji\u2019s death reverberated through that community.  Ms Harvey described how she saw two car loads of police \nofficers pull up outside her grandmother\u2019s house, and saw officers run up both sets of steps (front and back) to the \nupper level of the house, where the living accommodation is situated. She described how she ran to the back door \nas she saw the police officers coming up the stairs, because she was scared. At this point in her evidence, she \nbroke down. Like the other witnesses who were recalling these events, in my opinion she remained genuinely and \nsignificantly scarred from them. Ms Harvey then described what happened:As I ran to the back door before I got to \nthe door a police officer ..... Came in with guns and were fully dressed with heavy shoes and every material, \nclothing. They told me to get down on the ground, and so I did, and at the time they were still running from the back \nside to the \u2013 from the front entrance. As I was lying there I was scared, and I thought that when I ran to the back \u2013 I \nthought they was going to shoot me because they might have thought that I was Richard, and I was scared, and as \nI lay down \u2013 when they told me to lay down I lay down on my stomach in front of the stove, and my face facing \ntowards the fridge.  She described how the guns they were carrying \u201clooked big\u201d and how the officers shouted \u201cGet \ndown, get down\u201d.  I interpolate here that, during his oral evidence, I asked Sergeant Folpp to mimic for the Court the \ntone of voice and loudness he routinely used as a SERT officer when on a task such as this and when ordering \npeople in houses that were being searched to get down. It is fair to say that the volume and tone were relatively \nintimidating even in a court setting, where it was no more than a reconstruction and those listening knew in advance \nwhat was about to happen. For a young girl such as Ms Harvey, there is no doubt those commands would have \nbeen terrifying.  Ms Harvey described where the officers were and what they did once she was lying down:And so \nyou\u2019re in the kitchen. Are there any police officers that come into the kitchen with you then?---There were \u2013 there \u2013 \nthere were two of them. One standing in front of me, and one standing at the back of me. \n\n So in front of you. Whereabouts in front of you? What do you mean by that?---Near my head, and one standing at \nthe foot \u2013 foot end of me.\n\n And what were they doing when they were standing there next to you?---They were facing their guns at me.\n\n Facing their guns at you?---Yes.\n\n And how do you know that?---Because when I \u2013 when I looked to turn, I seen \u2013 I could see on the side of my eye \nthat they were facing their guns at me, towards me.\n\n And were they pointing their guns at you? Whereabouts on your body?---Probably on my back, or my head \nsomewhere.\n\n Your back or your head do you mean?---Yes.\n\n And how close to you was the police officer that was standing near your head?---He was just a step away.\n\n Just a step - - -?---He wasn\u2019t so far away from me.\n\n Just a step away?---Yes.\n\n\n\n And what about the police officer \u2013 did you say there was another one near your feet?---Yes.\n\n And how close to you was he?---Well, he was near \u2013 somewhere near my feet, I remember. He wasn\u2019t \u2013 because \nmy nan got a small kitchen. He was leaning against the kitchen bench, or standing near the kitchen bench, near the \nsink way.\n\n And so as you\u2019re laying on the ground with the two police officers near you, what happens then? What\u2019s the next \nthing that you remember after that?---Can you repeat that, please?\n\n So you\u2019re laying on the ground with two police officers standing near you. What else do you remember about that \nhappening at that time?---As I was laying there, there were more police officers running in, when those two \u2013 when \nthose coppers were standing one in front of me and one at the back, where there were coppers all running up the \nstairs at that time. I can\u2019t recall how much of them, but there were more than five.  It is the case that Mrs Wotton\u2019s \nkitchen is small. Once two fully kitted-up SERT officers were in that space, together with Ms Harvey, there would \nnot have been much room left. Ms Harvey then described how the officers searched the house, found the door to \nthe bathroom locked and were \u201csinging out\u201d to Mr Poynter. She could not recall much about how Mr Poynter was \nactually apprehended. In cross-examination, it was suggested (based on the evidence Sergeant Folpp would later \ngive) that the officer who pointed his gun at her and ordered her to get down, who was (then) Constable Folpp, \nmight have stopped pointing his gun at her once she was down on her stomach. Ms Harvey very properly conceded \nthat she may have thought Constable Folpp continued to point his gun at her, but she may not have been able to \nsee if he actually was. Sergeant Folpp\u2019s evidence was that he lowered his gun after Ms Harvey had complied and \nlaid on the floor. His evidence was that Ms Harvey sat down, whereas Ms Harvey\u2019s evidence was that she was told \nto lie on her stomach and that is what she did. I accept Ms Harvey\u2019s version of this, as I consider she still has a \nclear recollection of these events, whereas for Mr Folpp this was one of many operations he performed. Ms Harvey \nalso stated she could not recall whether the officer (Constable Folpp) took his balaclava off. It was Sergeant Folpp\u2019s \nevidence that he did. Again, if she was on the floor on her stomach, Ms Harvey may not have seen this action.  I am \nprepared to accept that Constable Folpp may well have lowered his gun at some stage, and not kept it trained on \nMs Harvey. I am also prepared to accept that he may have taken his balaclava off. In my opinion, neither of those \nactions would have had any real effect in lessening or ameliorating the terror already induced in Ms Harvey and \nwhich has obviously damaged her on a long-term basis. The damage was done by this time. Whether or not \nConstable Folpp had decided she was no longer a \u2018threat\u2019 (as he described), Ms Harvey did not know this. All she \nknew was that she had rifles pointed at her by two heavily armed and masked officers who had stormed into the \nhouse and she had been yelled at to get down on her stomach while several more officers entered and searched \nthe house, and were yelling out for Mr Poynter and apprehending him. She was entitled to assume, as it seems to \nme she did, that all the officers were armed, and that was indeed correct. She was entitled to be fearful for her \nsafety, as indeed she was. She was entitled to be fearful that if she made the wrong move, she might be shot: that \nwas not a fanciful possibility in the circumstances. In my opinion it was the reality that, if things had gone wrong, \nshots could well have been fired and Ms Harvey could have been caught in the crossfire. And indeed, if she had \ntried to flee, I am far from persuaded that shots would not have been fired in her direction. That may have been \nunlikely, but given the evidence I have heard, it was not impossible.  Although the individual officers who gave \nevidence before me seemed impervious to this, the risk that local Aboriginal people may have been shot and \ninjured (or worse) during these arrests, entries and searches was a much more real risk than the risk that any \npolice officer was going to suffer material personal injury during the protests and fires on Friday, 26 November \n2004. Indeed, the contemporaneous executive briefing notes stated that no police injuries were reported as a result \nof the protests and fires. The Aboriginal people who were in those houses when the SERT teams conducted these \noperations had real grounds to be fearful for their lives. They had assault rifles pointed at them. One did not see \nmention of this in any of the media reports at the time, nor in any of the police statements made at the time, nor in \nthe briefing notes to government.  Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house was, as I have noted, where Mr Poynter was \narrested. He was in the shower, and was forced to come out of the shower in the presence of the SERT officers and \n\n\n\nthen directed to put some clothes on. Ms Collette Wotton also gave evidence there was a two-year-old boy present \nin the house when the SERT officers came in. Ms Harvey placed the age of the child at one year old.  Two further \nwitnesses gave evidence about what had happened to them, having been children at the time. One was Mr Morton, \nwho was at Mrs Agnes Wotton\u2019s house when the SERT teams arrived, although he was outside.  Mr Morton was \nnine years old at the time of these operations. Mrs Agnes Wotton is his grandmother. This is how he described what \nhe and some of his cousins were doing when the SERT teams arrived:Do you remember what time of day it was?---\nIt was afternoon.\n\n In the afternoon?---Yes.\n\n What were you doing at the time that the police first arrived?---Me and all the brothers, we were all playing hide-\nand-seek in the backyard.\n\n All the brothers? Who are they?---They\u2019re all \u2013 all my cousins.\n\n And do you remember who was there with you?---Yes. Excuse me. Hold on. Can you ask that question again?\n\n Are you okay? Do you need to have a break? Do you need a little break?---No, I\u2019m fine.\n\n You said you were playing hide-and-seek in the yard?---Yes.\n\n With your cousins?---Yes.\n\n Do you remember who was there, who your cousins were there at the time?---Yes. There was my cousin, \nChandon, Wayne, William and \u2013 and Michael.\n\n And so how old were you then?---I was nine years old.\n\n How old was Chandon? Do you remember?---He was eight.\n\n And Wade [sic]?---Same with Wayne, he was eight\n\n William?---William, he was nine.\n\n And Michael?---And Michael was 11.\n\n And so you\u2019re playing hide-and-go-seek you said?---Yes.\n\n Where were you in the yard when you first saw the police?---I was at the back.\n\n At the back?---On the back path beside the steps, yes.  He then described the arrival of the SERT officers:And \nwhat\u2019s the first thing you remember when you saw the police?---The bus pulled up, and they all jumped out with the \nbalaclavas and all the gear on, with the assault rifles.\n\n You said \u201cthe bus\u201d. What bus were you talking about?---It was a school bus.\n\n\n\n School bus?---A 14-seater, and there was two of them that pulled up out in front of Agnes\u2019 house.\n\n Two vehicles?---Two vehicles, yes.\n\n And there was a bus, and what other type of vehicle?---There was two \u2013 two buses.\n\n Two buses?---Yes.\n\n And so they pulled out, and you said they had masks on?---Yes.\n\n What else did they have? Sorry?---They had assault rifles, and all their gear on, and they had riot shields, and they \nhad dogs as well.\n\n ...\n\n They came running into the yard, telling everyone to get on the ground. At that \u2013 when they came into the yard all \nthe brothers, they ran away quickly, but I was too slow to run, and they told me to get on the ground when they \ncame running in the yard.\n\n And did you get on the ground?---Yes.\n\n And where were you on the ground in the yard? Whereabouts were you?---I was beside the step, not far from the \u2013 \nfrom the fenceline.\n\n And when you got down, how were you positioned on the ground?---I was on my belly, like that, face down with my \nhands beside me, and he told me to put my face in the dirt, to put my face on the ground, and for that moment I \ndidn\u2019t want to do it, because there was \u2013 there was mud in my face, on the ground.\n\n And could you see the mud there, could you?---Yes.\n\n So what did the officer say to you?---He told me to put my head on the ground.\n\n And did you do that then?---And I looked up at him and I saw the gun pointed at me. So then I put \u2013 I had to my \nhead in the ground because I was scared.\n\n So what do you mean you saw the gun pointed at you?---I looked up and the barrel was pointed straight at me, like \n\u2013 it was pointed at me, like that.\n\n And how far was the officer away that had the gun?---He was maybe a metre away, maybe half a metre away from \nme.\n\n And so you\u2019re laying on your belly?---Yes.\n\n With the gun. Were there any officers around you?---There were two other posted just up from the one that was in \nfront of me.\n\n\n\n And while you were on the ground, what\u2019s the next thing you remember after that?---I was on the ground and I \nheard everybody in the \u2013 in the house, all the officers in the house screaming and that, and then \u2013 excuse me.\n\n Okay?---Sorry. Can you ask me that question again?\n\n Whilst you were on the ground, what\u2019s the next thing you remember after that?---Yes. I \u2013 I remember all the \u2013 there \nwas officers in the house. They were calling out to people in the house to get on the ground, and \u2013 hold on. Yes.  \nMr Morton then asked for a short break. He was visibly distressed. Indeed, he was one of the most visibly \ndistressed of the applicants\u2019 witnesses. He described how he remained scared as he watched Richard Poynter \nbeing brought out of the house and into custody. He was too terrified (his own word) to tell his mother what had \nhappened, and did not tell her for about a week.  In cross-examination, it was suggested to Mr Morton that he was \nmistaken in virtually his entire account. This is despite no SERT officer being called who could directly contradict \nwhat he said. Constable Folpp went into Mrs Wotton\u2019s house through the front stairs and could not have seen very \nmuch, if anything, of what went on outside. SS McKay was not, on his own evidence, in the yard at all. Mr Morton \nrejected the suggestion put to him that, because he was on his belly, he could not have seen whether a gun was \npointed at him. He said \u201cit was easy for me to look up like that\u201d, and insisted he had a clear recollection of this \nsequence of events. It was somewhat hopefully suggested to him that he may have laid down of his own accord \nbecause he was frightened. He denied this.  I accept Mr Morton\u2019s evidence. Other evidence before me (including \nthe police logs) demonstrates that it had been raining on Palm Island during the preceding days. His account of \nhow he was forced to lie face down in the mud was compelling and, in my opinion, he was most obviously \nrecollecting something that had happened to him. It was clear to me he had been highly disturbed by the event at \nthe time and, just as importantly, that it remained a damaging event in his life to the point he gave evidence in this \nproceeding. His mistrust of police was clearly deep and sustained. This was his evidence about his fear of \npolice:Do you think that this incident has had any effect on you?---Yes. I can\u2019t really talk to the police, and I get \nscared. I walk the other way when I see them, sort of, coming towards me or if they\u2019re in the car and they\u2019re coming \ntowards me, I just turn off into a yard, and I wait there until they\u2019ve passed.\n\n Even today?---Even today.\n\n And has it had any other effect on you?---My sister works at the police station, and I try to go there to the police \nstation and see my sister, but when I step into the police station I get real scared. It feels like I\u2019m going to be locked \nup in the back.  This evidence is not without its significance on a broader level, accepting it is clear evidence of the \ndamage done to Mr Morton. It demonstrates how the disproportionate and violent policing reaction during these \nevents has had a lasting and negative impact on the relationship between Aboriginal people on Palm Island and \nthose members of the QPS who are required to serve them, and to help ensure they feel safe. Clearly, for people \nlike Mr Morton, that will never be achieved.  The other witness who was a child at the time of the arrests, entries \nand searches was William Blackman Junior, who was then 12 years old, and was at home in Butler Bay at the time \nthe SERT officers came looking for his father, William Blackman Senior. He recalled that he was in the lounge room \nof the house with his father when the police arrived. He described how his father got up and ran. He stood up and \nlooked out the window. He then gave this evidence:What did you see when you looked through the window?---I see \na bunch of SWATs come running through the front gate, yes.\n\n SWATs? What do you mean by SWATs?---I\u2019m not sure if you call it SWATs, but it was \u2013 was people all in black, \nhad guns and that. Yes.\n\n All in black?---Yes.\n\n And what sort of guns did they have?---Big guns.\n\n\n\n Big guns?---Yes.\n\n And do you remember anything else about the men, what they were wearing?---They were just fully black with \nmask over their face and that.\n\n Fully black, mask over their face. And what did you think when you saw them?---Scared for my life.\n\n You got scared for your life?---Yes.\n\n Why would you get scared?---Well, they come running in the house, pointing a gun at us, telling us to get on the \nground.\n\n So they came running in the house, did they?---Yes.\n\n So which door did they come running through?---The front door.\n\n They came through the front door?---Yes.\n\n And how many do you remember coming in the front door?---Really can\u2019t remember. About \u2013 between three and \nfive, I think. Yes.\n\n Between three and five?---Yes.\n\n And did you stay in the lounge?---Yes.\n\n And so what happened when they came through the front door?---Told me \u2013 told everyone to get on the ground, \nyes. Yelling at us, telling us to get on the ground, pointing the gun at us.\n\n Pointing the gun. Whereabouts did they point the gun at you on your body?---Straight at us, yes.\n\n Straight at you. And what did you do when they were yelling at you to get on the ground? What did you do next?---\nGot on the ground.\n\n You got on the ground?---Yes.\n\n And is this the ground in the lounge room?---Yes.\n\n So how were you laying when you were on the ground?---I really can\u2019t remember.\n\n Just remember laying down. Yes.  Mr Blackman Junior was, as I have said, 12 years old. There was no suggestion \nany SERT officer removed his balaclava for Mr Blackman Junior. He described how the officers stayed for about \nfive to 10 minutes, then went off looking for his father. He then gave this evidence:Five or 10 minutes. And so how \nwere you the whole time they were there?---Scared for my life. I thought I was going to die.\n\n And why did you think you were going to die?---Well, they\u2019re carrying big guns around there. Carrying big guns \npointed at me.\n\n\n\n And then after they leave, what happens as soon as they leave the house?---Got up, and I think I hugged my mum. \nYes.  He then described how he went outside looking for his father, whom he thought must have been shot by the \npolice officers, but could not find him.  Under cross-examination, it was suggested to Mr Blackman Junior that he \nwas mistaken, and the SERT officers were not pointing guns at him, but rather at his grandfather who was in the \nroom with him. Mr Blackman Junior denied this, saying he thought they were pointing guns at \u201ceveryone\u201d. I accept \nhis evidence, although I am not sure how it is said to reflect any better on the QPS if SERT officers are admittedly \nbursting into a house and pointing an assault rifle at an older man, with a child present. However, no evidence was \ngiven by any SERT officer about what happened inside the Blackman house and I have no reason to doubt Mr \nBlackman Junior\u2019s evidence, since I found him to be a credible witness. I find it is likely the SERT officers indeed \nwere treating each and every person they came across as a potential suspect, and potentially dangerous, including \n12-year-olds. After all, one of the suspects they were instructed to arrest (and did arrest), was 13 years old.  Ms \nOui\u2019s evidence about this entry and search was also persuasive. As I have said above, she is the mother of Mr \nBlackman Junior and the de facto partner of Mr Blackman Senior. She gave evidence that the police came in two \ncars with balaclavas, masks and rifles. Four or five officers came in through the front door and said \u201cdon\u2019t move\u201d. \nOne officer pointed a gun at her in the kitchen, then DS Robinson told her to go and sit in the lounge. DS Robinson \nthen kneeled down and asked her questions for what she said was 10 to 20 minutes. The other officers went \noutside during this period. The entry and search left her and her three children (including William Blackman Junior) \nupset, shaken and crying.  I also note the evidence of William Blackman Senior about the SERT operation at his \nhome. At some stages during evidence and submissions, it appeared to be suggested, at least implicitly, that Mr \nBlackman Senior fled entirely to avoid arrest. There are two reasons that is not an accurate reflection of the \nevidence. The first is what Mr Blackman Senior said about what happened when the SERT officers arrived at his \nhouse. The second is the matter I discuss at [1427] below, about him going to the police command centre at the \nschool, on the same day. As to the first reason, this was Mr Blackman Senior\u2019s evidence about what happened \nwhen the SERT teams arrived at his house at Butler Bay:And what happened?---I was sitting on my recliner, \nwatching TV with my son, William Junior, and ..... Was in the kitchen cooking \u2013 cooking supper, and I looked at the \nwindow and I seen a \u2013 two utes pull up with all men on the back floor, all suited up.\n\n What do you mean by \u201call suited up\u201d?---Riot squad, and I - - -\n\n And how were they dressed? Sorry?---Pardon?\n\n How were they dressed?---Black helmets, black long sleeves, black jeans, vests, and rifles.\n\n And what did they do?---Well, as they were jumping off the ute \u2013 yes, they all jumped off the ute.\n\n What did you do?---I jumped off my chair and I said to my partner, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to lead them away from the \nhouse.\u201d I went straight for the back.\n\n Why did you want to lead them away from the house?---Because this is the riot squad, you know, and I have kids, \nand I \u2013 even my neighbour\u2019s kids were all in the yard, you know, and \u2013 and I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to see our kids \u2013 \nyou know, like, terrorists, you know, terrorising our kids. Don\u2019t know what it does, and they haven\u2019t seen those \nthings before in their life, you know. Haven\u2019t even watched those things on TV.\n\n And how many officers do you think you saw?---About five or six on the back of each ute, on \u2013 on a tray.\n\n So about 10 or 12 in total?---Yes. Could\u2019ve been \u2013 could\u2019ve been more inside there. They were \u2013 they were a troop \nute. They were four door.\n\n Right?---Dual cabs.\n\n\n\n So you\u2019re out the back?---Yes.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    He then described how he ran through some neighbouring properties and up into the hills. It \nbeing late afternoon (the SERT officers on his evidence arrived at his house at approximately 4.30 pm), it then \nbecame dark and he stayed away from his house for some time. His evidence then was:And what did you do then?-\n--My mother was practically crying and begging me to \u2013 she was going to bring me into the school.\n\n And why the school?---Because that\u2019s where they set up their \u2013 that\u2019s where the police set up their quarters, I \nthink, or the little .....\n\n That\u2019s this school?---Pardon?\n\n That\u2019s this school?---Yes.\n\n But not in this hall because it wasn\u2019t built then?---No, no.\n\n And did you understand why your mother was crying?---Yes.\n\n Why?---She thought they would shoot me.\n\nAnd were you worried about that?---Yes.\n\n And so what did your mother ask you to do?---Well, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n\n She was going to bring me in.\n\n And did that happen?---Yes.\n\n Was that that night or the next day?---Yes, that night.\n\n That night. So you came here to the school?---Yes.\n\n With your mother?---Yes.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    So it was that Mr Blackman Senior went down to the police command centre at the local \nschool, with his mother. There were no SERT officers on guard to greet him. He simply walked into the school with \nhis mother. He was asked to give a statement, and agreed to, but instead was arrested, charged and handcuffed.  It \nis necessary to say something about the way the police then treated Mr Blackman Senior, which had no \njustification whatsoever in the evidence before me. In my opinion, this treatment was squarely based on race. When \nasked what happened after he had gone down to the school with his mother, and been arrested, Mr Blackman \nSenior\u2019s evidence was:And did they take you into custody, that is, did they not let you go home?---Yes. They put \nhandcuffs on me and arrested me, yes.\n\n And then where did they take you?---They put me in the back of the paddy wagon and took me round the airport.\n\n And how long were you at the airport? I\u2019m sorry. I stopped you there. Do you have any idea what sort of time they \ntook you to the airport?---Could have been round 9 or 10 pm .....\n\n\n\n And what happened then?---He left me in the back of the paddy wagon all bloody night with handcuffs on.\n\n So you stayed in the paddy wagon with handcuffs on?---Yes.\n\n Did anyone give you any water?---Yes, they gave me a bit of water, and they let me go use the toilet.\n\n And then what happened?---And then they flew me out the next morning.  There was no evidence whether the \ndoors of the paddy wagon were open or shut, allowing in any fresh air. Palm Island has a very warm, tropical \nclimate and November is a steamy and humid time of year; so much is apparent from much of the video evidence, \nas well as my own observations on the view which took place in September, at the start of the build-up to more \nhumid weather. The space in the back of a paddy wagon is on any view extremely confined, and for Mr Blackman \nSenior to be forced to sit or lie in that space, handcuffed, for a period of approximately six hours according to the \npolice logs, is disgraceful.  The respondents advanced no submissions or positive evidence justifying this treatment \nof Mr Blackman Senior. Mr Campbell was cross-examined about Mr Blackman Senior\u2019s treatment, and sought to \njustify it by saying there were not secure premises available because the police station had been burned down. He \nwas reminded that the QPS had taken sole and entire control of the local school, but he steadfastly maintained \nthere was no other option. He did concede that, if it had been his decision, he might not have handcuffed Mr \nBlackman Senior all night, however he professed to have no knowledge of what happened. I found Mr Campbell\u2019s \nevidence unconvincing. The evidence demonstrates that there were large numbers of local people being \nquestioned at the school and that, indeed, the QPS had taken over the school in a wholesale form. There is no \nevidence at all that Mr Blackman Senior posed any particular risk and, since he handed himself in, I am at a loss to \nsee why it would reasonably have been thought that he would run away again. He could have been kept under \nwatch at the school perfectly easily. Instead, what occurred was part of the punishment and subjugation of \nmembers of this Aboriginal community for rising up against the police that in my opinion was clearly evident during \nthese days on Palm Island.  The applicants described Mr Blackman Senior\u2019s treatment as \u201ccallous\u201d in their written \nsubmissions. In my opinion, it was more than that. It was inhumane and degrading. It may also have been positively \ndangerous to leave a man locked up and handcuffed in conditions like this, bearing, as it does, some resemblance \nto the atrocious treatment of the Aboriginal elder Mr Ward, who in 2008 died of heatstroke in the back of a prison \nvan (which had no air conditioning) in the middle of summer, while being transported from Laverton to Kalgoorlie, \nWestern Australia, to face a drink-driving charge: see Inquest into the death of Ian Ward, State Coroner Alastair \nNeil Hope, Coroner\u2019s Court of Western Australia at Warburton, WA, 12 June 2009.  I have no doubt at all that a \nnon-Aboriginal person would not have been treated in that way. The QPS officers behaved as if they were entitled \nto treat a black man on Palm Island in that way. It seems from the description given by Mr Blackman Senior that no \npolice officer gave this a second thought. Mr Campbell\u2019s lack of concern in his evidence before me about Mr \nBlackman Senior\u2019s treatment confirms my views of this incident.  Finally, there was the evidence of Ms Jacinta \nBarry. Mulrunji was a cousin of Ms Barry: again, I refer to that fact simply to illustrate how many people on Palm \nIsland, who were also directly affected by QPS actions, had connections to Mulrunji. While QPS officers may have \nseen the arrests, entries and searches as entirely separate from Mulrunji\u2019s death and its aftermath, none of the local \nPalm Island residents did.  Ms Barry was asleep when, early on the Saturday morning, SERT officers entered her \nhome. It is an agreed fact this occurred at approximately 6.35 am. Also in her home at this time were her daughter \nGail (who was about 20), her grandson Ricky (who was about seven) and Gail\u2019s boyfriend Solomon Nona (who was \nabout 19). This was her evidence about what happened:Front door. And so what\u2019s the first thing you recall about \nthat morning?---I just heard a bang from the laundry door, and then I laid there for a while, wait for some noises, got \nup out of bed and just went to open the door. I heard a bang on my door.\n\n And you heard a bang on your door, and what did you do after that?---I opened it. That\u2019s when a fella with a \nbalaclava come with a gun, pushed me in the chest and said, \u201cSit the hell down.\u201d\n\n So I will just stop you there. So a fella in a balaclava?---Yes.\n\n\n\n And what else do you recall about him?---He just sat down and held a gun, and \u2013 and there was another fella came \nin.\n\n Sorry. Just take you back \u2013 so you said a gun pushed you in the chest?---Yes. I sat down on the bed.\n\n Okay. You see a fella in a balaclava with a gun and he pushed you in the chest. What was the next thing that \nhappened then?---I was sitting down there. Then the next \u2013 the other fella came in with a balaclava with a gun too, \nsearching my cupboard and on the side of the bed. The cupboards were all open.\n\n And was there anything that you remember about what type of gun it was that you got pushed with?---It was like a \nlong one. It had a little infrared on it, because the light \u2013 the other one came in with a light on it, which shined on \nmy forehead\n\n Okay?---Yes. It had a magazine in it. It was like them M16 ..... thing, like in the movies. But it was in real life.\n\n Like from the movies?---Yes.\n\n And so once he pushed you in the chest with the gun, what did he \u2013 what did you do then?---I just sat there and I \nasked him if I could go to the toilet, because I was \u2013wanted to have a piss. But he said, \u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n And so at this time, you were in the room. The other \u2013 the officer with 10 the gun: is he in the room?---He came \nlooking into the cupboards and on the side of the bed, and he went back out.\n\n And whilst one was looking through the cupboards, where was the other one standing?---He was standing just in \nfront of me, like close up here, because my bed was here. He was just standing ..... door was open.\n\n And what was he doing whilst he was standing there?---Holding a gun to me.\n\n And where was the gun pointed?---At my forehead.\n\n And did you see it pointed at your forehead?---Yes. I was sitting down looking at him like that.\n\n ...\n\n And whilst you\u2019re sitting there you said to the officer you needed to go to the toilet?---Yes.\n\n And what did he say?---He said, \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n And did you say anything after that?---I said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to piss myself here soon.\u201d\n\n And did he respond at all?---No, he didn\u2019t.  Ms Barry described how she could then hear Mr Nona \u201csinging out\u201d like \nhe was in pain. She then decided to get up and try to go to the toilet. She saw about six officers in her hallway, all \nwith rifles and balaclavas. She then gave this evidence:And so after you went out to the hallway, what happened \nthen?---I \u2013 I thought he was going to turn around and shoot me, because I rushed behind when he just walked to \nthe door. He walked away from my bedroom door, because I wanted to go to the toilet, but I couldn\u2019t. I just peed \nmyself in front of the toilet door, and they was all in the hallway, just walking out, talking away. I don\u2019t know what \nthey were talking about.  Mr Nona was arrested. He was not, however, on the list of suspects. Inspector McKay \n\n\n\ngave evidence that he was arrested on an outstanding warrant which, as far as he was aware, had nothing to do \nwith the events on 26 November 2004. Ms Barry\u2019s laundry door was damaged.  This recitation of the evidence \nestablishes comfortably to my mind that the arrests of suspects, and the entries and searches of houses, were acts \ninvolving distinctions and restrictions: namely, the methodology of having SERT officers perform the arrests and the \nentries and searches of the houses of the applicants and the subgroup members.  The arrest of Mr Blackman \nSenior involved additional restrictions and distinctions based on race. His confinement, overnight, handcuffed in the \nback of a paddy wagon at the airport in the circumstances I have described at [1428]-[1431] above, was in my \nopinion both a distinction (in the sense of differential treatment) and a restriction (in the sense of the manner in \nwhich his liberty was affected), and these were distinctions and restrictions based on race. He was treated like that \nbecause the QPS officers involved saw nothing wrong with locking an Aboriginal man in the back of a paddy wagon \nin that way.  The entries and searches of the houses of subgroup members also involved additional distinctions and \nrestrictions. The distinctions were constituted by the way the houses were surrounded by large numbers of armed \nSERT officers, with police dogs, the way the houses were violently broken into if a door was not immediately \nopened (and on some occasion without waiting for a door to be opened), and the way the houses were searched \u2013 \nthe SERT officers with their assault rifles raised, yelling instructions at the people they found in the houses, and \npointing rifles at them until the search was concluded. This was differential treatment to the way innocent \nbystanders and house occupants would be treated when an unarmed individual is arrested in a family home for \nwhat were, in the main, public order and property offences. I do not consider that, in other circumstances where it \nwas known children would be in the homes of suspects, SERT officers would be authorised to effect an arrest in \nthis way of a person suspected of comparable public order and property offences.  The restrictions were \nconstituted by risks to the occupants\u2019 safety, impositions on their personal dignity (Ms Barry\u2019s experience is an \nexample), and temporary restrictions of their freedom of movement and liberty.  All of the arrests, entries and \nsearches involved distinctions and restrictions that were based on race. As I have noted at several points in these \nreasons, the evidence I have heard, and read, satisfies me on the balance of probabilities that this particular \npolicing reaction occurred because this was an Aboriginal community. At work were the following attitudes:(1) \nimpunity (that the police could take whatever action they deemed appropriate and there was no ability or \nentitlement in the local Aboriginal community to protest or dispute that action);\n\n (2) disregard (that the police did not feel accountable to the local community because they were \u2018only\u2019 Aboriginal \npeople, who could either be treated with less regard than other sections of the community, or who could be \nignored); \n\n (3) lack of care (that it did not matter if Aboriginal women and children were terrified, or felt their lives and safety \nwere threatened \u2013 that Aboriginal women and children were less sensitive to treatment of this kind, or less \ndeserving of protection); and \n\n (4) a wish to retaliate (against an Aboriginal community which had risen up against, and questioned, police \noperations on Palm Island).  To take one of the starkest examples: I am comfortably satisfied that two teams of \narmed SERT officers with dogs would not be instructed to force their way into family homes known to be occupied \nby significant numbers of young children, in order to arrest unarmed individuals suspected of committing offences \ncomprising public order and property damage offences.  Four other matters in the evidence which in my opinion \nconfirm that the methodology adopted in using SERT teams involved distinctions and restrictions based on race are \nthe following. First, there was evidence the method of arrest was unnecessary. Mr William Blackman Senior gave \nevidence that earlier on the same day the SERT teams came to his house (27 November 2004), he had been at a \nmeeting at the Council chambers with SS Dini, where SS Dini was talking to some of the local people mostly about \nthe rifle that was missing from the police barracks, rather than about Mulrunji\u2019s death, a focus which Mr Blackman \nSenior made clear in his evidence had frustrated him. The point to be made here, however, is that the supposedly \ndangerous suspect that it was necessary to send SERT teams to arrest a few hours later had attended a public \nmeeting with members of the QPS in the local Council chambers. He could have been arrested there and then, if \nnecessary. Or he could have been asked by SS Dini to accompany him to the police command centre. Any number \n\n\n\nof options were available, other than sending teams of armed and masked officers to storm his house and terrorise \nhis family later in the afternoon. It will be recalled Mr Blackman Senior was the person who eventually walked into \nthe local school with his mother and gave himself up \u2013apparently without needing to be surrounded by SERT \nofficers when he did so.  Second, it was common ground that one of the targets of the SERT operations was a 13-\nyear-old boy. The police logs record that he was wanted for \u201cthrowing rocks, in possession of Molotov type device \nand running toward police station\u201d. The third house that the SERT teams attended on 27 November 2004 was \nwhere they had been informed they could find the 13-year-old. They did not find him there, but they found Mr \nGarrison Sibley and arrested him, having smashed the door open with a sledgehammer. Mr Campbell\u2019s evidence \nwas that the 13-year-old was subsequently apprehended \u2013 I infer, without the assistance of any SERT officers. \nInspector McKay could not recall SERT teams ever having been sent out to arrest a 13-year-old before. He had a \ncareer with SERT spanning some 24 years. As with the treatment of Mr Blackman Senior, a plethora of other \noptions spring to mind about how a 13-year-old boy might be brought in for questioning, on a small island with a \nsmall and close-knit population, bearing in mind the emergency declaration was still in place and there were no \nflights or ferries available to leave. No evidence or explanation was given on behalf of the respondents about why it \nwas proposed to treat a child in that way.  Third, the information provided to the SERT officers, which fed into their \nunderstanding of the circumstances they would face, included stereotypical assumptions about Aboriginal people, \ntheir lifestyles and their tendencies. In cross-examination, Inspector McKay agreed that DS Robinson had briefed \nthe SERT officers about \u201cthe itinerant nature of some of the people that live on Palm Island\u201d and had said this \nmeant a house should be searched even if a person who was expected to be at the house was apprehended \noutside the house because \u201cit was more than possible there were other people there that were also needed to be \napprehended\u201d. He also agreed that DS Robinson suggested \u201cpeople\u201d could be sleeping with \u201cedged weapons\u201d \nunder their pillows. There was no evidence that suggested this was in fact the case.  There was also the matter of \nthe rifle which was said to be missing from the police barracks. As I have related above, on 26 November 2004, \nwhen QPS officers moved from the police station to the police barracks during the protests, Constable Robertson \ntook a Ruger \u2018Mini-14\u2019 .223 calibre rifle with him, although he quickly realised he did not have any ammunition or \nmagazines for the Mini-14. When QPS officers moved from the police barracks to the Palm Island Hospital at \nabout 1 pm, Constable Robertson did not take the Mini-14 with him. On the evening of 26 November 2004, SS \nWhyte reported to DSS Kitching, who recorded in the police running log the following entry at 8.54 pm:Station issue \n223 rifle in black case is missing. Rifle was removed from the Station during the seige situation and was hidden in \nthe barracks. Confirms that barracks have been entered by community persons since that time and a search is now \nunable to locate the rifle. No ammunition or magazine was with the rifle.  Thus, as the applicants emphasised, QPS \nofficers knew on the evening of 26 November 2004 that the rifle, even if missing, was not capable of being used. \nDespite this, Inspector Dini\u2019s evidence in cross-examination was:See, I suggest to you the gun was never missing?-\n--Yes, it was.\n\n And it was at all times missing because a police officer had left it where he had put it?---Well, yes. He had locked it \nsomewhere else and when they went through and did the sweep they noticed a gun case there with the gun not in \nit. And Craig [Robertson] and the officers that were there during the riot had been taken off the island, and so when \nwe saw the empty case it was assumed that the firearm had been taken. I didn\u2019t find it, somebody else did, and they \ntold me that, \u201cWe \u2013 we think we\u2019re missing a 223[\u201d].\n\n But Constable Robinson, by 27 November at around 11 o\u2019clock, had said exactly what had happened. When they \nhanded out the ammunition there were no bullets and no magazine for the gun, so it was therefore not able to work, \nyou would agree, if it didn\u2019t have bullets?---That \u2013 that information didn\u2019t filter through to us.\n\n And that information was available within the police service from that time. And the suggestion that there was a \ngun missing and in the community was a false suggestion, wasn\u2019t it?---No. All I was told was that we were missing a \ngun, \u201cSee if you can get the council to help you find where the gun is.\u201d\n\n And I\u2019m suggesting to you that at all times it was not missing; would you agree?---No. It was missing. We \u2013 well, \nwe believed it was missing.\n\n\n\n Yes?---We were operating under the assumption that the gun was missing.\n\n ...\n\n And you would agree that a weapon without ammunition is not dangerous?---Well, you can get ammunition \nanywhere.\n\n ...\n\n You alleged the gun had been stolen by a resident?---I don\u2019t know if I made that allegation, but the assumption we \nwere working under was the gun wasn\u2019t where it was supposed to be and because we knew that the residents had \nbeen through that area, the assumption was that one of them had taken the weapon.  The Mini-14 was \nsubsequently found in the police barracks on or about 8 December 2004, where Constable Robertson had left it.  It \nis difficult to understand the focus of QPS officers on the rifle. There were references in the evidence to local people \nhunting and it seems likely there were other firearms on the island. Despite this, there was not a single piece of \nevidence that any local person ever threatened anyone with a firearm. There is not a single piece of evidence that \nany local person was seen with a firearm. The protests were never even suggested to be attended with threats of \nthis kind. What the QPS response to the missing rifle reveals is how suspicious QPS officers were of local \n(Aboriginal) residents. It shows the tendency of police officers to hold inflammatory and exaggerated views of what \nlocal (Aboriginal) people were likely to do, and what their motives were.  It is clear on the evidence, and the \nrespondents did not dispute, that these kinds of matters (DS Robinson\u2019s information about the \u2018transient nature\u2019 of \nPalm Islanders, people sleeping with edged weapons, and the missing rifle) contributed to the thinking of SS McKay \nand the other SERT officers about how they should carry out their tasks. Inspector McKay explained this in re-\nexamination:All right. Two final matters, please, inspector. You\u2019re asked some questions by Ms Ronalds yesterday \nabout forcing entry through doors after allowing a period of time which \u2013 the period discussed was 10 seconds or \nso. And for your Honour\u2019s reference, this is at page P59 of the \u2013 of yesterday\u2019s transcript. And you in answer to a \nquestion from Ms Ronalds spoke about understanding the rational \u2013 rationale behind the decision to undertake that \nas a tactic, that is, forcing entry. Can you just explain what that rationale is?---Yes. So I mentioned yesterday about \nthe appreciation process, and one of the things we try to \u2013 we aim to always do is identify the courses of action that \nare open to the person that is to be apprehended. Now, in this particular situation we had advice, 1, that there was \na fire-arm at large in the community and, 2, that there was a potential for people in the community to arm \nthemselves with edged weapons. In addition to that a key factor was that there was an extreme degree of what I \nwould call anger within the community, demonstrated by the actions the day before. So cognisant of all that \ninformation we then have to respond to take that person into custody in a manner that\u2019s safe to them and to the \npolice and to the public in general. So if we were to at every address knock on the door and call the person out of \nthe residence or call the people out of the residence to come and talk to us, whilst on the face value that might \nsound like a very effective way to achieve our aim, what it can also do, particularly based on the amount of emotion \nin the community at that point in time \u2013 what it can also do is provide an opportunity for that person to take another \ncourse of action, like arm themself, like refuse to come out of the premises, like try to flee from the premises and \npotentially, if they\u2019re armed with a weapon, use that weapon against the police. So it can be a very fine balance \nbetween allowing the person sufficient time to be able to come to the door and open the door versus scenario \nwhere you fear that situation could occur, where someone could arm themselves or put themselves in a position \nwhich is in greater danger to them. So a rapid entry into the premises to the location of the person to be able to \nchallenge them and prevent them from undertaking another course of action is a valid course of action under \ncertain circumstances, and those circumstances were present on Palm Island in the operation that we executed.  It \nis also clear that the information was not accurate. It is true to say, therefore, that many Palm Island residents may \nhave been unfairly tarnished with DS Robinson\u2019s brush.  Fourth, and of considerable significance in my opinion, DS \nRobinson, who was a key participant in the arrests, entries and searches, was dressed in plain clothes and wore no \nprotective clothing at any time during the operations. His role was to identify the suspects at the premises, and to \nprovide any other local information or advice to the SERT officers. I infer he also helped them navigate their way \n\n\n\naround the island. The evidence demonstrates that at each house it was DS Robinson who went to the door with \none of the two lead SERT officers in each team, as they rotated through the task of either surrounding the house or \nbeing the apprehending team. However, in most cases, it was DS Robinson who went to the door and spoke to the \noccupants of the house. He was, as I have noted, the officer with the most local knowledge, having lived and \nworked on Palm Island for two years.  The inference is plainly open that DS Robinson well knew there was no real \ndanger from any of the locals at the houses the SERT officers were scheduled to attend. He knew these people, \nand they him. He knew the houses had children, elderly people, and family members in them. No explanation was \noffered on behalf of the respondents, or their witnesses, for why DS Robinson was dressed in plain clothes with no \nprotective gear. It was entirely incongruous with every other aspect of these operations. That is because, in my \nopinion, in truth there was no real danger and this was a deliberate, but unnecessary, show of force by the QPS, \nand an inappropriate exercise in subjugation.  A show of force of that kind occurred because there was an \u2018us and \nthem\u2019 mentality at work amongst the QPS officers on Palm Island at this time \u2013 evident from contemporaneous \ndescriptions in the police logs and in other evidence of this as a siege. Stereotyping played a role; officers were \nprepared to believe without a second thought that local residents were capable of levels of violence for which there \nwas no objective evidence. Property damage of the kind that occurred does not provide an objective basis. If it was \nnot stereotyping, then the other explanation in my opinion, which was also at work, was a simple exercise in \nsubjugation of an Aboriginal community that had risen up. Police should be able to, and generally do, separate \nassumption and rumour from objective risk, but on Palm Island in November 2004 there was no such separation.  \nThe QPS officers were not interested in finding solutions that did not involve subjugation because they did not know \nhow to go about that with Aboriginal people \u2013 their liaison processes failed, they had not established, or tried to \nestablish, good working relationships with local elders and the Council and they had not been inclusive and \nproactive. They preferred a show of force against local people they were prepared to stereotype as incapable of \npartnership, riddled with alcohol and prone to unpredictable violence, and whose family lives and connections they \ndid not understand, and were not interested in understanding. They were not interested in finding out the depths to \nwhich Mulrunji\u2019s death might have affected a wide range of people, in discovering how many people were friends \nwith him, related to him, close to him, and in understanding the anger that was shown from that perspective. They \nwere not prepared to allow for the depth of feelings of injustice arising from a local man dying in police custody, on \nan island with a history of oppression by the police. The QPS had refused to adopt an approach to their \ninvestigation which located SS Hurley as a suspect, which on any view he should have been, right from the start. \nAnd when there was a powerful reaction from the local community against that, the option sought was coercive, \narmed subjugation.  I am comfortably satisfied that the kind of wholly violent and disproportionate police action \nwhich was the arrests, entries and searches on 27 and 28 November 2004 would not have occurred elsewhere in \nAustralia, nor in Queensland, outside an Aboriginal community. I find that is especially the case if one thinks of what \nwould have happened in a small community of no more than 2,000 people. In other circumstances and in other \ncommunities, or suburbs, a SERT team would not have been sent to the house of an unarmed 13-year-old to \napprehend him for throwing rocks and being in possession of a \u201cmolotov device\u201d. The houses of innocent local \nresidents would not have been entered and searched by 18 SERT officers armed with assault rifles and dressed in \nbulletproof gear and balaclavas, with PSRT officers and police dogs outside, for the purpose of arresting \nindividuals suspected of public order and property offences, even if arson was one of those offences. Children \nwould not have had assault rifles pointed at them and would not have been ordered by officers to get down on their \nstomachs. These things would not have happened in the homes of a non-Aboriginal community, in particular an \noverwhelmingly white (European) community, whether in regional or urban Australia and whether in better or similar \nsocioeconomic circumstances. The dividing line for this treatment was race.  It will be apparent from the findings I \nhave already made that I accept the applicants\u2019 alternative arguments (see [303] of the third further amended \nstatement of claim) that there was unnecessary force used against and unnecessary disturbance of occupants in \nthe entries and searches of the homes of the first, second and third applicants. Those descriptions in the third \nfurther amended statement of claim are another way of expressing the findings I have already made: namely that \nthe arrests, entries and searches involved distinctions and restrictions (unnecessary force and unnecessary \ndisturbance because SERT officers were employed to effect the arrests, entries and searches), and those \ndistinctions and restrictions were based on race.\n\nConclusions on the arrests, searches and entries  To summarise, I find that the arrests of suspects, and the entries \nand searches of the houses identified at [351] above, were acts for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA. They were acts \n\n\n\ninvolving a distinction, being the use of SERT officers rather than ordinary QPS officers to enter and search houses \nand to undertake the arrests. The use of SERT officers meant the suspects, and those local residents who \nhappened to be and around the houses which were searched and entered were subjected to a higher level of \nviolence, confrontation and aggression than would have been the case if ordinary uniformed QPS officers had been \nused, or people had been arrested other than in a coordinated, military-style operation. Those people were \nsubjected to treatment such as having assault rifles pointed at them and causing them to fear being shot. That is \ntreatment quite different to what would have occurred if the suspects had been arrested by ordinary uniformed \nQPS officers, and other than in a coordinated operation.  The acts involved a particular distinction in relation to Mr \nWotton, in that he was tasered when, I find, he otherwise would not have been because at that time ordinary \nuniformed QPS officers did not carry tasers. I am satisfied that if QPS officers were conducting an ordinary arrest \non Palm Island in 2004, they would not have been armed at all, and certainly would not have had a taser on them.  \nThe acts also involved a particular restriction in relation to Mr Blackman, being locked in a police wagon overnight.  \nFurther, the acts involved restrictions on the freedom of movement of people who were in and around the houses \nwhen SERT officers arrived, and a restriction of their sense of privacy, safety and wellbeing in and around their own \nhomes. Those people were not able to move: they were held against their will, often on the ground, until the SERT \nofficers decided the operation at a particular house was at an end. They were subjected to circumstances which \nwould have caused any ordinary person to fear for their safety and the safety of their families around them.  For the \nreasons I have set out at [1366]-[1457] above, all of those acts involved distinctions and restrictions based on race.\n\nThe second limb of s 9(1): nullification or impairment of human rights or fundamental freedoms    I propose in this \nsection to deal only with the conduct of the QPS which I have found to be acts involving distinctions, restrictions and \npreferences based on race. Where I have rejected the applicants\u2019 allegations on what I have called the first limb of s \n9(1), I do not propose to consider all those allegations again on the basis I may be wrong in my findings on the first \nlimb.  The conduct of the QPS which I have found to constitute acts involving distinctions, restrictions or \npreferences based on race is:(1) the inappropriate and partial treatment of SS Hurley; \n\n (2) the treatment of Aboriginal witnesses;\n\n (3) the conduct of DSS Kitching in relation to the autopsy report; \n\n (4) the failure to suspend SS Hurley;\n\n (5) the failure to communicate with Palm Islanders and defuse tensions in the intervening week between Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath and the protests and fires; \n\n (6) the making and continuation of the emergency declaration;\n\n (7) the arrests, entries and searches of the houses of the applicants and the subgroup members.\n\nThe conduct of QPS officers during the investigation and the intervening week  As to the first five of the findings \nlisted at [1464] above, in my opinion each of those acts impaired the rights of the class members to access services \nwithin the meaning of Art 5(f): namely the service provided by police officers in the impartial investigation of both a \ndeath in custody and the possible commission of criminal offences.  The functions of the prevention of crime, the \ndetection of offenders and bringing them to justice, the upholding of the law generally and the administration of the \nlaw in a \u201cresponsible, fair and efficient manner\u201d (see s 2.3(c)-(f) of the PSA Act) are services which are intended for \nuse by the general public, within the meaning of Art 5(f) of the ICERD.  The impartial, independent and effective \ninvestigation of a death in police custody is a function which falls within the terms of s 2.3(c)-(f) of the PSA Act. For \nthe reasons I have given at [624] above, it is properly characterised as a service intended for use by the general \npublic. It is a service which every member of the community has a right to access, where she or he is affected by a \ndeath in police custody.  In a confined (physically, culturally and socially) community such as Palm Island, where \nfamilies\u2019 lives are intertwined with each other, I am satisfied it is a proper characterisation of the content and \n\n\n\noperation of Art 5(f) to find that all group members as defined in this proceeding had a right of access to the service \nof an impartial, independent and effective investigation into the death in custody of a member of their community. I \nam satisfied that by s 2.3(c)-(f) of the PSA Act there was a legislative intention that members of the public, including \nmembers of a community such as the Palm Island community, have access to that service. There is sufficient \nevidence to infer that all group members were, in some way (although to varying degrees), interested in and \naffected by the death of Mulrunji and the outcome of the police investigation. As I have found at [826] above, the \npurpose of that investigation was not, or should not have been, only to provide information to the coroner. Its \npurpose was, or should have been, also to determine whether there was a reasonable suspicion that any criminal \noffences may have been committed (including assault, for example).  Further, and separately, I am satisfied that the \nfunction of the provision of services within the terms of s 2.3(g) of the PSA Act are properly characterised as \nservices which are intended for use by the general public, within the meaning of Art 5(f) of the ICERD.  On the \nbases I have outlined above, the conduct of an impartial, independent and effective investigation into a death in \npolice custody was a \u201cservice\u201d required of QPS officers under the PSA Act, the Coroners Actand the general and \nstatutory criminal law of Queensland (recalling the twin purposes of the investigation). It was also a service required \nof QPS officers on the basis of the reasonable expectations of the Palm Island community, within the terms of s \n2.3(g) of the PSA Act.  People ordinarily resident on Palm Island in November 2004 were entitled to expect there \nwould be an investigation of that kind into Mulrunji\u2019s death. Whether or not they were related to him, friends with him \nor grew up with him, in this close-knit community of approximately 2,000 people, his death was a loss felt by all \nmembers of the community, for various reasons and in various ways. This was the death of an Aboriginal man in \npolice custody \u2013 the very occurrence with which the RCIADIC had been concerned. It also occurred in an \nAboriginal community with a history of oppression by white authorities and police, and a history of mistrust of \npolice officers. Impartiality, transparency and thoroughness were especially important to a police investigation in \nthose circumstances.  Palm Islanders (that is, the group members, including the applicants) were entitled to expect, \nand were entitled to, an investigation that gave no special treatment to individuals who might reasonably be \nsuspected of involvement in Mulrunji\u2019s death because they were police officers, and because they were non-\nAboriginal. They were entitled to an investigation that did not discount potential evidence because it came from \nAboriginal people, an investigation which kept the whole of this close-knit and specially constituted community \ninformed in a timely, respectful and accountable way, about the progress of the investigation, and the outcome of \nthe autopsy.  An impartial and transparent investigation would have been one whose officers appreciated the \nsensitivities of a person in SS Hurley\u2019s position remaining on duty, apparently immune to criticism or suspicion, and \nable to continue to arrest local people as if nothing had happened. Officers conducting such an investigation would \nhave approached the concept of holding a reasonable suspicion in relation to the commission of offences in an \neven-handed way as between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, which was not the case in relation to the \nfailure to suspend SS Hurley, whether or not this suspension was accompanied by a charge.  The features I have \nset out in [1472] and [1473] above disclose that the Palm Island community did not have access to the service of a \npolice investigation \u2018on an equal footing\u2019 with other communities.  Putting the conduct of the investigating and \ncommanding officers to one side, SS Hurley himself was obliged to appreciate these matters, recognise the \nimportance of impartiality and independence in the investigation, and remove himself from the island. The Palm \nIsland community was entitled to expect he would do so. He was the most senior police officer stationed on Palm \nIsland, yet he ignored (with an apparent sense of impunity) these fundamental precepts of any police investigation. \nBy engaging in inappropriate contact with the investigating officers, continuing on duty and failing to leave the \nisland until 22 November 2004, SS Hurley contributed in a material way to the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death \nhaving no appearance of impartiality or independence.  The acts of DI Webber, DSS Kitching, Inspector Williams, \nInspector Richardson and SS Whyte, as the QPS officers in positions of command, control and responsibility at \nrelevant times in:(1) the inappropriate and partial treatment of SS Hurley; \n\n (2) the treatment of Aboriginal witnesses;\n\n (3) the conduct of DSS Kitching in relation to the autopsy report; \n\n (4) the failure to suspend SS Hurley; and\n\n\n\n (5) the failure to communicate with Palm Islanders and defuse tensions in the intervening week between Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath and the protests and fires,\n\ninvolved distinctions based on race that had the effect of impairing the enjoyment, on an equal footing, of the rights \nof the applicants and group members under Art 5(f) of the ICERD. Those rights comprised the right to access an \nimpartial, independent and effective investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death.  \n\nThe making and continuation of the emergency declaration  I have found at [1101]-[1200] above that the making of \nthe emergency declaration under s 5 of the PSP Act by DI Webber, and its continuation until 28 November 2004, \nwas an act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race. Separately, I have found that \nthe making of the emergency declaration was lawful, but its continuation past 26 November 2004 was not. The only \nrelevance of this latter finding is its effect on the content of the human rights to be considered under the second \nlimb of s 9(1) (bearing in mind some of the content of some of the rights depends on lawfulness).  The making and \ncontinuation of the emergency declaration is put as an act of discrimination that affected the applicants and the \ngroup members in the same way. Just as with the claims about the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death and the \nevents in the intervening week, no different or particular claims are made on behalf of the applicants in relation to \nthe making and continuation of the emergency declaration.  On the basis of the findings I have made, can it be said \n\u2013 for the purposes of the second limb of s 9(1) \u2013 that the act of making and continuing the emergency declaration \ninvolved distinctions, restrictions or preferences based on race that had the effect of impairing or nullifying the \nenjoyment, on an equal footing, of any human rights or freedoms of the group members in the \u201cpolitical, economic, \nsocial, cultural or any other field of public life\u201d?  The rights enjoyed by the group members (including the applicants) \nwhich were identified as impaired or nullified by the making and continuation of the emergency declaration were the \nrights contained in Art 26 of the ICCPR and Arts 5(a) and 5(f) of the ICERD.  I have found Art 5(a) inapplicable to \nthe claims in this proceeding: see [577]-[581] above.  As to Art 5(f), the making and continuation of the emergency \ndeclaration is not appropriately characterised as a service performed by the QPS intended to be used by the \napplicants and group members. Although it can be seen as having a protective function, the terms of the PSP Act, \nthe function to be performed by the incident coordinator under it and the coercive powers which flow from the \nmaking of a declaration and its continuation in force indicate that the making of an emergency declaration is not \nintended to be beneficial, or helpful, to a community or to particular individuals. Although any community is entitled \nto expect, consistently with s 2.3 of the PSA Act, that there will be a fair, prompt, effective and appropriate policing \nresponse to any emergency situation, a response by way of making an emergency declaration under s 5(1) of the \nPSP Act is a targeted response confined by the PSP Act to specific circumstances. It is intended to facilitate and \nempower the relevant government authorities to deal, in the manner they see fit, with what arises from an \nemergency situation, as that term is defined in the PSP Act. It may carry with it protective objectives (of people, \nresources and infrastructure) but its intention is to authorise a series of coercive actions that may sometimes be \nsignificantly restrictive of individual freedoms.  In contrast to the conduct of an impartial, independent and effective \ninvestigation into the death of Mulrunji, it was not intended that the Palm Island community affected by the \nemergency declaration would receive anything by way of a service from the making of the emergency declaration. \nThere is no evidence members of the Palm Island community sought, or asked, for the declaration to be made. \nThere is evidence (in the contemporaneous video evidence and in some of the witness evidence) that it was \nopposed, and some people felt the island was under martial law.  In contrast, the legislature did intend that, by the \nperformance of the constellation of functions under s 2.3 of the PSA Act which were involved in the conduct of the \ninvestigation into a death in custody, a community would use or secure the help it was entitled to expect in finding \nout how and why the person died, and how to prevent such a death happening again. It was intended a police \ninvestigation would secure accountability under the criminal law for any persons who caused or contributed to a \ndeath in custody, or committed any other criminal offences in relation to the person who died. In the circumstances \nof November 2004, the police investigation was supposed to be a function of benefit to the Palm Island \ncommunity, and helpful to that community. The investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death was also a function the Palm \nIsland community sought to be performed, and relied on being performed.  The emergency declaration was \ndifferent. It was a restrictive and coercive measure imposed upon Palm Islanders, which (as I have found) involved \na series of distinctions and restrictions for all members of that community. It was not helpful; it was not a benefit to \nthat community: it was a burden and an imposition. It was not a function which fell within the terms of Art 5(f) of the \n\n\n\nICERD.  That leaves Art 26 of the ICCPR as the only other human right relied on by the applicants for the purposes \nof s 9(1) of the RDA. Article 26 expresses two guarantees. First, all persons are equal \u201cbefore the law\u201d. Second, all \npersons are entitled without any discrimination to the \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d. The guarantees are directed at \ndifferent subject matter.  The first guarantee, consistently with the common law concept of equal justice, concerns \nthe administration and application of the law \u201ceven-handedly, free from bias and without irrational distinction\u201d: see J \nJowell; \u201cIs Equality a Constitutional Principle?\u201d (1994) 47 CLP 1 at 4. It is an aspect of the rule of law.  In Railway \nExpress Agency v New York, [1949] USSC 13; 336 US 106 (1949) at 112-13 Justice Jackson described the \nimportance of the principle. The case concerned whether New York City traffic rules regulating the use of vehicles \nfor advertising purposes violated the due process clause in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution:I \nregard it as a salutary doctrine that cities, states and the Federal Government must exercise their powers so as not \nto discriminate between their inhabitants except upon some reasonable differentiation fairly related to the object of \nregulation. This equality is not merely abstract justice. The framers of the Constitution knew, and we should not \nforget today, that there is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than \nto require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally. \nConversely, nothing opens the door to arbitrary action so effectively as to allow those officials to pick and choose \nonly a few to whom they will apply legislation and thus escape the political retribution that might be visited upon \nthem if larger numbers were affected. Courts can take no better measure to assure that laws will be just than to \nrequire that laws be equal in operation.  In Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23; 175 CLR 1, Brennan J \nemphasised that the concept of equal justice is one of the foundational values of the common law of Australia (at \n57-58):The preferable rule, supported by the authorities cited, is that a mere change in sovereignty does not \nextinguish native title to land. (The term \u201cnative title\u201d conveniently describes the interests and rights of indigenous \ninhabitants in land, whether communal, group or individual, possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged by \nand the traditional customs observed by the indigenous inhabitants.) The preferable rule equates the indigenous \ninhabitants of a settled colony with the inhabitants of a conquered colony in respect of their rights and interests in \nland and recognizes in the indigenous inhabitants of a settled colony the rights and interests recognized by the \nPrivy Council in In re Southern Rhodesia as surviving to the benefit of the residents of a conquered colony.\n\n ... the common law of Australia rejects the notion that, when the Crown acquired sovereignty over territory which is \nnow part of Australia it thereby acquired the absolute beneficial ownership of the land therein, and accepts that the \nantecedent rights and interests in land possessed by the indigenous inhabitants of the territory survived the change \nin sovereignty. Those antecedent rights and interests thus constitute a burden on the radical title of the Crown.\n\n It must be acknowledged that, to state the common law in this way involves the overruling of cases which have \nheld the contrary. To maintain the authority of those cases would destroy the equality of all Australian citizens \nbefore the law. The common law of this country would perpetuate injustice if it were to continue to embrace the \nenlarged notion of terra nullius and to persist in characterizing the indigenous inhabitants of the Australian colonies \nas people too low in the scale of social organization to be acknowledged as possessing rights and interests in land.\n\n(Emphasis added, footnotes omitted.)    A final example of the meaning to be given to the concept of equality \n\u201cbefore\u201d the law is this statement from Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, a sentencing case, in \nwhich French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said at [28]:\u201cEqual justice\u201d embodies the norm expressed in the term \n\u201cequality before the law\u201d. It is an aspect of the rule of law. It was characterised by Kelsen as \u201cthe principle of \nlegality, of lawfulness, which is immanent in every legal order\u201d. It has been called \u201cthe starting point of all other \nliberties\u201d. It applies to the interpretation of statutes and thereby to the exercise of statutory powers. It requires, so \nfar as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law \npermits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and \nsubject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen:\u201cEqual justice requires \nidentity of outcome in cases that are relevantlyidentical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in \nsome relevant respect.\u201d(Emphasis in original.) \n\n Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is \u201ca reflection of the notion of equal justice\u201d \nand \u201cis a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice\u201d. It finds expression in the \u201cparity \nprinciple\u201d which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of \u201cequal justice\u201d, \n\n\n\nwhich is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect \ndifferent degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.\n\n(Emphasis added, footnotes omitted.)    The content of the first guarantee in Art 26 thus protects a person, or a \ngroup of people, or a minority, from (amongst other things) the exercise of statutory powers in a way that does not \ntreat like circumstances alike. The guarantee in s 15 of the Canadian Constitution of equality before the law has \nreceived a similar construction by the Supreme Court of Canada: see Andrews v Law Society (British Columbia) \n1989 CanLII 2 (SCC); [1989] 1 SCR 143 at 174-75 (McIntyre J, writing for the majority on this issue). Andrews was \na case involving alleged discrimination on the grounds of citizenship.  The second guarantee, of equal protection, \nlooks not to administration of the law so much as to what the law itself does, substantively, to \u201cprotect\u201d individuals. \nNowak records (at pp 606-07 of CCPR Commentary) that this second guarantee was only inserted into Art 26 on \nthe basis of a motion by the Indian delegate at the Third Committee of the General Assembly. Nowak describes the \ncontent of the second guarantee as having to do with \u201can obligation on States parties to ensure substantive equality \nby way of legislation\u201d (at p 608, emphasis in original).  By reference to the (now) historical curiosity that was the \nAustralian Bill of Rights Bill 1985 (Cth) Wojciech Sadurski puts the distinction in a helpful way (\u2018Equality Before the \nLaw: A Conceptual Analysis (1986) 60 ALJ 131 at 131):Equality as applied to law may have two distinct meanings: \nequality before the law (or, in other words, equality in the enforcement of legal rules) and equality in law (that is, \nequality in the content of legal rules). The principle of legal equality may therefore mean either that valid legal rules \nshould be applied to all in the same way (equality before the law); or that legal rules themselves should not contain \nany discriminating and privileging provisions (equality in the law). These two meanings correspond, respectively, to \nwhat the Australian Bill of Rights Bill 1985 calls \u201centitlement to rights and freedoms without distinction\u201d (cl. 1 which \nuses the terminology of \u201cequality before the law\u201d) on one hand, and \u201cthe right without any discrimination to the equal \nprotection of the law\u201d (cl. 4, par. 1) on the other. This dichotomy represents the view that, while \u201cequality before the \nlaw\u201d stricto sensu simply means the principle of impartial application of law to everyone, \u201cequal protection of the \nlaw\u201d deals with the content of the law and proclaims that the substance of the law should not be discriminatory ...\n\n(Emphasis in original.)    While the two concepts are distinct, in some instances both concepts will have application. \nFor example, the passage of Brennan J\u2019s reasons in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) extracted at [1489] above involves \naspects of both equality before the law (in whether the Court should overrule previous authorities) and equal \nprotection of the law (in the content of the common law and the manner in which it gives effect to the principle of \nequal justice).  The general operation and purpose of both ss 9 and 10 of the RDA (read with s 8) can be seen as \nconcerned with the subject matter of the second guarantee of equal protection. However, the second guarantee in \nArt 26 is not relevant to the application of s 9 in this proceeding. In the context of the present discussion, it is not \nrelevant to the making and continuation of the emergency declaration by DI Webber. It is the first guarantee in Art \n26 which has relevance, as I have explained in the section of these reasons beginning at [635] above.  What is \nmeant by the use of the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in Art 26 has been addressed by the HRC in General Comment 18 (at \n[7]):While these conventions deal only with cases of discrimination on specific grounds, the Committee believes that \nthe term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as used in the Covenant should be understood to imply any distinction, exclusion, \nrestriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or \nother opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and which has the purpose or effect of \nnullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and \nfreedoms.  The similarities to the definition of racial discrimination in Art 1(1) of the ICERD are apparent. The \ncircularity of which some judges have spoken in relation to Art 26 is also apparent. However, what can be said (for \nthe reasons I have given earlier) is that the focus on \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d demonstrates \nthat the gravamen of the freedom conferred by Art 26 is, relevantly, a freedom against differential treatment in the \napplication of the law, where that differential treatment is based on an irrelevant attribute.  Unlike Australian state \nand federal anti-discrimination legislation, Art 26 is not limited to particular spheres of activity or particular subject \nmatter. In contrast, Art 2 of the ICCPR (which concerns the assumption by states parties of obligations to implement \nmeasures to give effect to the Covenant) is limited by reference to subject matter and provides:     Each State Party \nto the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its \njurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, \nlanguage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.   Where not \nalready provided for by existing legislative or other measures, each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes \nto take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional processes and with the provisions of the present \n\n\n\nCovenant, to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the \npresent Covenant.   Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes:    (a) To ensure that any person whose \nrights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the \nviolation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity;\n\n (b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent \njudicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system \nof the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy;\n\n (c) To ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted.  The contrast between the \ntwo Articles was the subject of part of General Comment 18 by the HRC:While article 2 limits the scope of the rights \nto be protected against discrimination to those provided for in the Covenant, article 26 does not specify such \nlimitations. That is to say, article 26 provides that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal \nprotection of the law without discrimination, and that the law shall guarantee to all persons equal and effective \nprotection against discrimination on any of the enumerated grounds. In the view of the Committee, article 26 does \nnot merely duplicate the guarantee already provided for in article 2 but provides in itself an autonomous right. It \nprohibits discrimination in law or in fact in any field regulated and protected by public authorities. Article 26 is \ntherefore concerned with the obligations imposed on States parties in regard to their legislation and the application \nthereof.Thus, when legislation is adopted by a State party, it must comply with the requirement of article 26 that its \ncontent should not be discriminatory. In other words, the application of the principle of non-discrimination contained \nin article 26 is not limited to those rights which are provided for in the Covenant.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    The breadth of coverage of Art 26 is illustrated by some of the cases to which I have earlier \nreferred at [656]-[667] above, and by this summary by Tufyal Choudhury and Gay Moon in \u2018Complying with Its \nInternational Human Rights Obligations: The United Kingdom and Article 26 of the ICCPR\u2019 [2003] 3 EHRLR 283 at \n293-94 where the authors state:Since the Broeks decision, Art.26 has been applied to other areas outside the rights \nin the Covenant, most frequently in areas involving social security and other forms of social protection payments \nincluding disability pensions, unemployment benefit, veterans\u2019 pensions, severance pay, children\u2019s benefits, \nsurvivor\u2019s pensions and retirement pensions. They have also covered educational subsidies, employment, the right \nof conscientious objection, and schemes for restitution of confiscated property.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    It is not difficult to see how, with this breadth of coverage, there are many circumstances in \nwhich the first guarantee in Art 26 may have independent work to do well outside the field of race discrimination. As \nI have noted earlier, it is not possible to say that the effect of s 10 of the RDA is coextensive with the effect of Art \n26. Further, Art 26, where it is the human right relied upon for the purposes of s 9(1), has a specific rather than a \ngeneral role to play in the scheme. In s 9(1), the question whether a person\u2019s Art 26 right has been nullified or \nimpaired will not arise unless the Court finds there is an act involving a distinction based on race. Therefore, while \nthe reasons supporting such a finding may also support a finding that the Art 26 right has been impaired, there is no \nlogical circularity in that sequence of findings. Not every act involving a distinction based on race will have the effect \nof impairing the Art 26 right \u2013 for example, it would be unlikely to do so where the actor was a private person or \nentity rather than a public official. Conversely, not every impairment of the Art 26 right will necessitate a finding that \nthere was an act involving a distinction based on race because the scope of Art 26 extends beyond race to other \ngrounds of discrimination including sex, language, religion and political opinion. Moreover, as this case illustrates, in \nthe context of s 9(1) the component of Art 26 that is most likely to have application is equality before the law, and in \nparticular, equality in the application of the law by public officials. That is because s 9(1) operates principally in \nrespect of conduct. Section 10(1) operates principally in respect of laws, not conduct, and in that context the \nguarantee of equal protection of the law in Art 26 may produce the circularity to which Gageler J referred inMaloney \n(although it is unnecessary to express a concluded view on that question in this case). That difficulty does not arise \nin respect of s 9(1) because of the different subject matter to which the provision is directed.  In the making and \ncontinuation of the emergency declaration, DI Webber was applying the law (and the legal authority conferred on \nhim, under the PSP Act) to the people of, and on, Palm Island. All those living and working on Palm Island would \nbe affected by the making of the declaration. All those who sought, or needed, to travel to Palm Island would be \naffected. The declaration, by its nature, had a global effect in relation to the area it covered. The PSP Act intends \n\n\n\nthat a declaration, once made, will operate across the area it purports to cover and thus affect all persons and \nproperty within that area.  The applicants and other group members had a right (or a freedom, depending on how \none expresses it) under Art 26 of the ICCPR to have the law applied \u2013 in the making and continuation of the \nemergency declaration under the PSP Act \u2013 in a way which did not involve, or result in, any differential treatment of \nthem because of an irrelevant attribute. It is, on the terms of s 9(1) of the RDA, unnecessary to conclude that the \nperson exercising the power intended that differential treatment occur, because the second limb of s 9(1) can be \nmade out either by purpose or effect. Or, in the description given by the Canadian Supreme Court, by way of \n\u201cdesign or impact\u201d: see CN v Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) [1987] 1 SCR 1114 at 1138-39, \nDickson CJ (quoting a description of discrimination in a Royal Commission report on equality in employment).  The \nemergency declaration involved a number of consequences: the NOTAM and the suspension of commercial flights, \nthe suspension of the ferry service and the evacuation of non-Aboriginal people. I have found that all those \nconsequences were distinctions, restrictions or preferences involved in the act of making and continuing the \nemergency declaration, and were based on race. The declaration was also designed to facilitate and support the \nuse of the SERT officers generally on the island. In particular, the emergency declaration was intended by DI \nWebber, mistakenly as it turned out, to provide a lawful basis for the entries and searches of houses without \nwarrant and the arrests of suspects without warrant (see [1301] above).  The applicants\u2019 right (in common with the \nother group members) to have the discretion in s 5 of the PSP Act exercised in respect of them, and their \ncommunity on Palm Island, in the same way it would be exercised in respect of any other community in \nQueensland in similar circumstances, is a right guaranteed by Art 26 of the ICCPR. The applicants (in common with \nother group members) had a right that they, and the members of their community, would be equal before the law of \nQueensland when the law was applied by a public officer so as to impose a series of coercive, intrusive and \nrestrictive consequences on that community. The making and continuation of the emergency declaration involved \ndistinctions and restrictions based on race that had the effect of impairing that right to equality before the law of \nQueensland. That is because the declaration was made and continued in circumstances where it would not have \nbeen made and continued if a different, non-Aboriginal community were affected by protests and fires, and it had a \nseries of consequences which had an adverse impact only on the Aboriginal people of Palm Island, including the \napplicants. The enjoyment by the group members (including the applicants) of their right to the application of the \nlaw in the PSP Act to their community, on an equal footing with the way it would be applied to any other community \nin Queensland, was impaired by the making and continuation of the emergency declaration in the way I have \ndescribed.  In relation to the emergency declaration, there was no reliance by the applicants on rights such as \nfreedom of movement (see, eg, Art 12 of the ICCPR), although the effects of the NOTAM and the suspension of \nferry services may have impaired the enjoyment of such rights. Accordingly, I do not consider the application of s \n9(1) in the context of those rights.\n\nThe arrests, entries and searches  In relation to the arrests, entries and searches, I am satisfied that the arrests of \nthe suspected individuals and the entries and searches of houses by SERT officers impaired the recognition, \nenjoyment and exercise, on an equal footing, of the rights to privacy (Art 17 of the ICCPR) of the applicants and the \nsubgroup members. Since I have found the arrests, entries and searches were unlawful, that is sufficient for an \nimpairment (and probably a nullification) of the rights of the applicants and the subgroup members under Art 17 of \nthe ICCPR.  Even if the conduct were not unlawful, I am satisfied in any event that the use of SERT officers to \nconduct the arrests, entries and searches impaired the recognition, enjoyment and exercise, on an equal footing, of \nthe rights of the applicants and the subgroup members to be free of any arbitrary interference with their privacy, \nfamily and homes. In making this finding I adopt, as I have explained at [1280]-[1282], a construction of \narbitrariness which includes lack of proportionality to the ends sought, and lack of justification.  At the time of the \narrests, entries and searches, there were no present, or even recent, threats to public order and safety. There was \nno reasonable or objective basis to believe any of the suspects would be armed, and the only information available \nwas speculative, stereotyped and generalised suspicions conveyed by DS Robinson. A 13-year-old boy was \namongst the suspects to be arrested in this orchestrated, military-style operation. It was known there were likely to \nbe innocent women and children in most of the houses. There were other less drastic and obviously available \nmethods of arrest available in relation to all the suspects, given no one could leave the island and this was a very \nsmall community.  The means chosen were violent and invasive. They resulted in a reasonable apprehension by \nthe occupants of the houses that their lives and safety were imperilled in circumstances where the alleged offending \nwas historic and not contemporaneous.  All these features also apply to the persons who were arrested and to the \n\n\n\ntasering of Mr Wotton.  The use of the SERT to conduct the entries, searches and arrests was disproportionate and \nlacked justification, and was carried out to serve other, inappropriate, punitive and race-based, objectives. I am \nsatisfied that the conduct of the QPS in using SERT officers in this way substantially damaged the sense of safety \nand wellbeing the applicants and the subgroup members were entitled to enjoy in their own homes, and in their \nprivate lives. It was an arbitrary interference with their privacy, family or home.  I do not consider that the arrests \ncan be characterised as a \u201cservice\u201d to the persons being arrested for the purposes of Art 5(f) of the ICERD. As Sully \nJ held in the passage of Russell [2001] NSWSC 745 extracted at [603] above, an arrest might be characterised as a \nservice provided to the community as a whole. Nevertheless, as Yates J held in Robinson at [168]-[169], it cannot \nbe characterised as a service provided to the person being arrested, nor to persons in the vicinity who are affected \nby the police operation. For those reasons, I find that the right in Art 5(f) has no application in respect of the \narrests, entries and searches.  I am satisfied that the arrest of Mr Wotton by A/S Kruger, and his tasering as part of \nthat arrest, impaired the recognition, enjoyment and exercise, on an equal footing, of his right to liberty and security \nof the person. He was not only tasered, but he was handcuffed and shackled. The content of Art 9(1) of the ICCPR \nand that of Art 5(b) of the ICERD protect against interference with bodily integrity, against deprivation of liberty, and \nagainst a range of unwarranted and intrusive treatments while a person is detained. In my opinion, the way Mr \nWotton was treated was disproportionate and deliberately harsh. I have no doubt he was being punished by QPS \nofficers for being the perceived ringleader in what they saw as an uprising of Aboriginal people against police. \nArticle 9(1) is engaged if arrest or detention is unlawful, and if arrest or detention is arbitrary. Both aspects are \nsatisfied in relation to Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest. Article 5(b) protects \u201csecurity of person\u201d and bodily integrity. As I have \nfound at [703] above, it is engaged if arrest or detention is racially discriminatory. I have found the first limb of s 9(1) \nto be satisfied in relation to Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest. Therefore, his right to security of person and bodily integrity under \nArt 5(b) was also impaired.  The decision to use SERT to effect the arrests (and entries and searches) was made, \non the evidence, before SERT was deployed to the island, although SS McKay was only told about the nature of \nhis teams\u2019 tasks once he and his teams arrived on the island. DI Webber\u2019s evidence made it clear he knew, and \nunderstood, that when he made the emergency declaration it could and would trigger the deployment of SERT (see \n[1212] above). His written memorandum to A/C McDonnell expressly states (see [1222] above) SERT would \nundertake the task of assisting investigators to locate and detain wanted persons by \u201ctactical methods\u201d which I find \nis a reference to the kind of methods in fact used by SERT.  This use of SERT was, on the evidence before the \nCourt, decided upon by DI Webber, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel as the three officers DI Webber \nidentified in his evidence (see [1228] above) as \u201cin charge\u201d and working on the action plan for SERT. On the \nevidence it was approved by DC Conder as the person who subsequently signed the authorisation form (see [337] \nabove).  Punishment, subjugation, a show of force \u2013 these were all intended objectives of the use of SERT. The \nmethods used to arrest Mr Wotton and the other suspects were without justification, disproportionate and, as I \nhave found, adopted for inappropriate objectives. The arrests had the character of arbitrariness described by the \nFull Court in Al Masri: see [701] above.\n\nOther rights  As to the other rights pleaded in [316]-[320] of the third further amended statement of claim, being the \nright to enjoy culture under Art 27 of the ICCPR and the rights to social services and participation in cultural \nactivities under Arts 5(e)(iv) and 5(e)(vi) of the ICERD, I do not consider any of those human rights were applicable \nto the circumstances where I have found the first limb of s 9(1) to be made out. The content of those rights is simply \ntoo far removed from the effects of the police conduct I have found proven by the applicants. In relation to some \nrights (for example, the right to enjoy culture), the applicants failed to prove how that right was exercised on Palm \nIsland at or about the time of the events in question and how it was impaired or nullified.\n\nSummary of conclusions  \n\nConclusions on the applicants\u2019 claims of contraventions of s 9(1)  I have found that the applicants have not made \nout their claims under s 9(1) of the RDA with respect to their allegations dealing with the following matters:(1) the \ninvolvement of DS Robinson in the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death (see [898] above);\n\n (2) failures by the QPS to consider the \u201ccultural needs\u201d of the Palm Island community in the aftermath of Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath (see [1010], [1016] and [1018] above);\n\n\n\n (3) delay in notifying Mulrunji\u2019s family of his death (see [1024]-[1027] above);\n\n (4) the handling of the autopsy report (see [1095] above);\n\n (5) delay in completing the emergency declaration certificate (see [1093] above) and the level of detail in the \nparticulars in the certificate (see [1095] above);\n\n (6) \u2018disrespectful behaviour\u2019 or a \u2018militaristic presence\u2019 of QPS officers on Palm Island in the week following \nMulrunji\u2019s death (see [1255] and [1268] above);\n\n (7) the formation of the action plan to arrest suspects following the protests and fires on 26 November 2004, the \npreparation of a list of suspects, and the failure to obtain warrants for the arrests (see [1274] above); and\n\n (8) arbitrary conduct of SERT officers during the entries and searches of homes and the arrests of subgroup \nmembers (see [1277] above).  The claims I have found proven are summarised at [1540] below.\n\nFindings on common questions: group members  The questions common to the claims of the group members are \nset out in the further amended originating application. I summarise my findings here, with appropriate cross \nreferences back to my reasons.      Whether the investigation by members of the Queensland Police Service into \nthe death of Mulrunji lacked independence, did not comply with the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Code of Conduct \nor the Queensland Police Service Operational Procedures Manual and/or was otherwise flawed.      Answer: The \ninvestigation did lack independence, and impartiality, in the ways I have found at [1028]-[1032] above. I have not \nfound the compliance or non-compliance with either the Code of Conduct or the OPM, in and of themselves, to be \nrelevant to whether there was a contravention of s 9(1) of the RDA.     Whether the review by members of the \nQueensland Police Service\u2019s Investigation Review Team of the investigation into the death of Mulrunji failed to \ncomply with the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Code of Conduct or the Queensland Police Service Human \nResources Management Manual and/or was otherwise flawed.      Answer: This matter was not the subject of final \nsubmissions by the applicant. I do not find any allegations about insufficiencies of the IRT Review to have been \nestablished.     Whether the declaration of the existence of an emergency situation on Palm Island was made \nunreasonably and/or unlawfully.      Answer: The emergency declaration had a lawful basis at the time it was made \nuntil (as an outer limit) the early morning of 27 November 2004. Its continuation until the morning of Sunday, 28 \nNovember 2004 had no lawful basis, as there was nothing which could be characterised as an \u201cemergency \nsituation\u201d after, at the latest, early in the morning of 27 November 2004. The emergency situation was continued to \nfacilitate the use of SERT officers to apprehend suspects and to enter and search houses without warrant. This \nwas not a lawful reason for the continuation of the emergency declaration under the PSP Act.     Whether members \nof the Queensland Police Service subjected the Applicants and group members to arbitrary and unlawful \ninterference with their security, liberty, privacy, family and home, between 26 and 28 November 2004.      Answer: \nYes, as to the arrest of the first applicant, and the entry and search of the house of the second applicant, and the \nentry and search of the house in which the third applicant was present and living with the first applicant. The first \napplicant\u2019s arrest was unlawful for the same reasons as those set out by the Court of Appeal in Bulsey. Therefore, \nthe entries and searches had no lawful basis. The use of SERT officers was arbitrary in the sense that it was \nunjustified and disproportionate. This question is not applicable to group members in general.     Whether members \nof the Queensland Police Service responded unreasonably and/or unlawfully to the riots on Palm Island in \nNovember 2004.      Answer: I have found the use of SERT officers to effect the arrests of the first applicant and \nsubgroup members, and to enter and search the houses of the applicants and subgroup members, was \ndisproportionate and unnecessary.     Whether any or all of the acts omissions or practices described in the claims \nin paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above:    (a) involved a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, \ncolour, descent or ethnic origin;\n\n\n\n (b) had the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, by the Applicants and \ngroup members, on an equal footing of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, \ncultural or any other field of public life; and/or\n\n (c) constituted unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the AHRCA.  Answer: the conduct of QPS officers that I \nhave set out in [1028]-[1032], [1096]-[1100], [1196]-[1200] and [1458]-[1462] above contravened s 9(1) of the RDA \nand constituted unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the AHRC Act. The first respondent is liable pursuant to \ns 18A of the RDA for their conduct.      Whether the Applicants and group members are entitled to any and, if so, \nwhat relief under s 46PO of the AHRCA.      Answer: the applicants and group members are entitled to the \ndeclaratory relief I have set out at [1545] below. The applicants are entitled to damages in the sums I have set out \nat [1683]-[1685], [1695] and [1724]-[1725] below. The conduct pleaded to aggravate the damage should not result \nin any orders for aggravated damages or damages to the applicants. The Court has no power to award exemplary \ndamages under s 46PO. Whether any orders should be made in relation to an apology will be determined after the \nreceipt of further submissions as indicated at [1597] below.\n\nFindings on common questions: subgroup members  The questions common to the claims of the subgroup \nmembers are set out in the further amended originating application. The questions, and my answers to them, are as \nfollows.      Whether the arrests of the First Applicant and some of the sub-group members in the course of the \nRaids without warrant were unlawful.      Answer: The arrests of the first applicant, and those subgroup members \nwho were arrested, were unlawful on the basis set out by the Court of Appeal in Bulsey, except for the arrests of \nWilliam Blackman Senior and Solomon Nona.     Whether the entry into the dwellings of the Applicants and the sub-\ngroup members in the course of the Raids were unlawful.      Answer: Given there was no lawful basis for the \narrests of the first applicant and the subgroup members who were arrested, and no independent source of lawful \nauthority was otherwise identified, the entry and searches of the houses of the subgroup members was also \nunlawful.     Whether the Applicants and sub-group members are entitled to any and, if so, what relief under s 46PO \nof the AHRCA and/or at common law.      Answer: I have found QPS officers contravened s 9(1) of the RDA in the \nway I have set out at [1028]-[1032], [1096]-[1100], [1196]-[1200] and [1458]-[1462] above, in relation to the \napplicants, the subgroup members and the group members. The first respondent is liable under s 18A of the RDA \nfor their conduct. The applicants and subgroup members are entitled to the declaratory relief I have set out at [1545] \nbelow. Subject to any submissions received on the potential common questions identified in the section below, the \nsubgroup members (those who were arrested, and those who were present in or around the houses that were \nentered and searched) may be entitled to damages under s 46PO, to be assessed in accordance with these \nreasons. The conduct pleaded to aggravate the damage should not result in any orders for aggravated damages in \nrelation to the applicants. The Court has no power to award exemplary damages under s 46PO. Whether any \norders should be made in relation to an apology will be determined after the receipt of further submissions as \nindicated at [1597] below.\n\nPotential further common questions  Aside from Mr William Blackman Senior, whom I deal with below, there is little \nevidence before the Court about the individual circumstances of the arrest of the members of the subgroup, namely \nGarrison Sibley, Russell Parker Senior, David Bulsey, John Clumpoint, Solomon Nona, Lance Poynter, Shane \nRobertson, Richard Poynter, Russell Parker Junior and Robert Nugent. The applicants submit:The Applicants do \nnot allege that breaches of the rights of the Sub-Group can be established based on the pleaded facts and the \nevidence adduced at trial. However, as the SERT raids were conducted systematically and with a consistent \nmethodology, the Court\u2019s findings of law in relation to the particular circumstances of the Applicants will be common \nto the claims of the Sub-Group. The individual facts of each Sub-Group member\u2019s case will then need to be \nconsidered and determined.  The respondents\u2019 submissions in respect of the rights of subgroup members proceed \non that basis.  In my opinion, the applicants\u2019 submission directs attention to other common questions that are not \nidentified in the further amended originating application, but which clearly arise from the applicants\u2019 pleadings and \nsubmissions, from the evidence led at trial and what was contested by the respondents, and from the findings I \nhave made in these reasons. I consider that the following further common questions, and answers based on my \nfindings, arise:(a) Question: What methods and appearance did SERT officers adopt at houses other than the \napplicants? Answer: The evidence demonstrates that SERT officers had the same appearance and adopted the \nsame methods and the same tactical response at each of the houses of subgroup members they attended, as set \nout at [351] above, as they used at the houses of the applicants.\n\n\n\n (b) Question: Were the arrests of the subgroup members lawful? Answer:No. Aside from the arrests of William \nBlackman Senior and Solomon Nona, all of the arrests were unlawful.\n\n (c) Question: Were the entries and searches of houses other than the applicants\u2019 houses unlawful? Answer: Yes. \nAll of the entries and searches of the houses were unlawful.\n\n (d) Question: Did the use of SERT officers impair or nullify the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal \nfooting, of subgroup members\u2019 human rights under Art 17 of the ICCPR? Answer: Yes. Given the appearance, \nmethods and tactics of SERT officers were the same at each house they attended, the use of SERT to effect \narrests of the members of the subgroup and the entries and searches of the houses identified was an arbitrary \ninterference with the rights of the subgroup members to family, privacy and home under Art 17 of the ICCPR, as I \nhave determined the concept of arbitrariness should be construed. It was also an unlawful interference for the \npurposes of Art 17.  I do not consider the findings in (a), (c) and (d) above can extend to the arrests of Russell \nParker Junior and Robert Nugent at Wallaby Point on 29 November 2004.  While I consider these are further \ncommon questions, and that they can on the basis of my findings be answered in the way I have set out, I propose \nto give the parties an opportunity to make submissions regarding whether findings in those terms address questions \nthat are in fact common to the subgroup: see, generally, Merck Sharp & Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd v Peterson \n[2009] FCAFC 26. A direction will be made accordingly.  I have not made comprehensive findings about whether \nthe arrests of the suspects other than Mr Wotton impaired the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal \nfooting, of their human rights under Art 9 of the ICCPR and Art 5(b) of the ICERD. Those may well give rise to \nfurther common questions. I do wish to mention the treatment of Mr Blackman Senior after he was arrested. While it \nis not a common question, if it were necessary to make findings on his treatment I would be inclined to find the \ntreatement did impair several of his human rights: namely his rights to liberty, security of person, and not to be \nsubjected to inhumane and degrading treatment (Arts 7 and 9 of the ICCPR and Art 5(b) of the ICERD) by reason \nof the way he was locked and handcuffed in the back of the paddy wagon for several hours.  The parties will also be \ngiven an opportunity to address in submissions whether further common questions (that is, beyond those I have \nidentified) arise and can be answered on the basis of the Court\u2019s findings.\n\nRELIEF  \n\nConduct founding relief    I have found the following conduct of QPS officers contravened s 9(1) of the RDA:(1) the \ninappropriate and partial treatment of SS Hurley; \n\n (2) the treatment of Aboriginal witnesses;\n\n (3) the conduct of DSS Kitching in relation to the autopsy report; \n\n (4) the failure to suspend SS Hurley;\n\n (5) the failure to communicate with Palm Islanders and defuse tensions in the intervening week between Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath and the protests and fires; \n\n (6) the making and continuation of the emergency declaration after the evening of 26 November 2004; and\n\n (7) the arrests, entries and searches of the houses of the applicants and the subgroup members.  Section 46PO(4) \nof the AHRC Act authorises the making of the following kinds of orders:If the court concerned is satisfied that there \nhas been unlawful discrimination by any respondent, the court may make such orders (including a declaration of \nright) as it thinks fit, including any of the following orders or any order to a similar effect:\n\n\n\n (a) an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not \nto repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination;\n\n (b) an order requiring a respondent to perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress any loss or \ndamage suffered by an applicant;\n\n (c) an order requiring a respondent to employ or reemploy an applicant; \n\n (d) an order requiring a respondent to pay to an applicant damages by way of compensation for any loss or \ndamage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent;\n\n (e) an order requiring a respondent to vary the termination of a contract or agreement to redress any loss or \ndamage suffered by an applicant;\n\n (f) an order declaring that it would be inappropriate for any further action to be taken in the matter.  In addition, the \nCourt has available to it the powers under ss 21 and 23 of the Federal Court Act, read with s 22 of that Act.  The \nparties\u2019 submissions on damages, as to principle, authority and quantum, were somewhat cursory, and of limited \nassistance in that many of the propositions in them were not developed in a way which was conducive to detailed \nexamination of the parties\u2019 competing positions.\n\nDeclaratory relief    The respondents did not dispute that if the Court found any contraventions of s 9 to have been \nproven, declaratory relief would be appropriate. Correctly, they submitted that the form of the declarations proposed \nby the applicants \u2013 that \u201cthe respondents\u201d had engaged in certain contraventions of s 9 \u2013 was not appropriate.  \nAccordingly the declaratory relief will be in the form of declarations of specific contraventions by identified QPS \nofficers. I have decided it is appropriate to grant a declaration concerning the State\u2019s vicarious liability pursuant to s \n18A of the RDA, but that is the only declaratory relief appropriate to be made as against the State.  In some \ninstances there are allegations made against the second respondent interchangeably with individual QPS officers: \nsee, eg, [245(e)], [246], [248], [295], [312]. The applicants did not develop submissions as to how the second \nrespondent\u2019s liability arose, apart from general allegations that the Commissioner has the command and control of \nthe QPS. If any separate or additional liability was intended, it has not been proven.  The only substantive allegation \nremaining against the second respondent appears to be that in [343] of the third further amended statement of \nclaim:Neither the First Respondent nor the Second Respondent [took] any steps to prevent its employees from \nperforming any acts outlined above.  There is a typographical error in the pleadings which I have corrected to \nremove a double negative.  This allegation was not developed in the evidence or final submissions of the \napplicants. It was not in any event made out on the evidence.\n\nApology    The applicants seek a specific kind of apology. They submit such an apology is necessary because \u201cthe \nApplicants\u2019 damage has been prolonged and exacerbated\u201d by the absence of such an apology. In this form, the \nproposition is attended with some doubt. Albeit in a different context, in Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1993] \nHCA 31; 178 CLR 44 at 66, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:we have difficulty in understanding \nhow the mere absence of an apology can aggravate damages. Whereas publication of an apology may mitigate \ndamage, thereby reducing the harm suffered by a plaintiff in a defamation case, and so reduce the damages \nawarded, the failure to publish an apology does not increase the plaintiff's hurt or widen the area of publication. No \ndoubt want of apology may be a relevant factor in establishing that a defendant is motivated by a desire to injure the \nplaintiff but that does not mean that want of apology itself aggravates the plaintiff's injury. Furthermore, it is of the \nutmost importance that juries should be instructed that any award of aggravated damages must be confined to what \nis truly compensation for the relevant harm and must not include any element of punitive damages.  Separately, the \napplicants submit an apology would acknowledge the community\u2019s grievances and allow the community to move \non. They make the following submissions as to the nature and form of the apology sought:The terms of the apology \nshould include a formal recognition of the findings of this Court in these proceedings, that the Applicants and the \nGroup Members were required to pursue this litigation because of wilful blindness of the Respondents for over 11 \n\n\n\nyears and that the residents of Palm Island were entitled to appropriate levels of protection as other citizens living \nin Queensland and subject to the actions of the QPS. \n\n The apology should be made in a formal, public ceremony on Palm Island by an appropriate senior politician or \npoliticians, ideally the Premier and the Minister for Police, accompanied by the Commissioner of Police. These \nreflect the status and standing of the three people who went to Palm Island on Sunday 28 November 2004, after \nthe fire. \n\n Further, it should be published in a full page advertisement in at least The Australian, The Courier-Mail and The \nTownsville Bulletin on a Saturday and in the first eight pages of each paper.  The respondents correctly accept that \nthe nature of the power conferred on this Court by s 46PO(4)(b) (to make an order requiring a respondent to \n\u201cperform any reasonable act to redress any loss or damage suffered by an applicant\u201d) extends to ordering a \nrespondent to apologise to an applicant. The powers in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act would also \nsupport such an order.  Nevertheless, while the power to order an apology is not in doubt, courts have generally \nbeen reluctant to exercise that power under either s 46PO(4) or cognate provisions in other statutes. The applicants \nrefer to no authorities in support of their submission that an apology order should be made. The respondents refer \nto the observations of Hely J in Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080; 120 FCR 243 at [245] that \u201cthe idea of ordering \nsomeone to make an apology is a contradiction in terms\u201d. That observation has some force and it has been \nfollowed in a number of other decisions of this Court to which the parties did not refer. In Jones v Toben [2002] FCA \n1150; 71 ALD 629, Branson J said (at [106]) that \u201cI do not consider it appropriate to seek to compel the respondent \nto articulate a sentiment that he plainly enough does not feel\u201d. In Jones v The Bible Believers\u2019 Church [2007] FCA \n55, Conti J similarly said (at [65]) that such an order would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d.  All three of those cases dealt with \nclaims of offensive behaviour based on race arising under s 18C of the RDA, but the approach taken by Hely J in \nJones v Scully has also been followed in cases dealing with other types of discrimination. In Forest v Queensland \nHealth [2007] FCA 1236, which dealt with disability discrimination, Collier J expressed the view (at [13]) that \u201ca \ncourt-ordered apology serves little purpose\u201d. The Full Court allowed an appeal from her Honour\u2019s decision in \nQueensland v Forest [2008] FCAFC 96; 168 FCR 532 without reference to her Honour\u2019s comments regarding an \napology. In Poniatowska v Hickinbotham [2009] FCA 680, a sex discrimination case, Mansfield J expanded on the \nview that an ordered apology might be inappropriate, focusing on whether such an order would go further than was \nnecessary to \u201crecognise\u201d wrongdoing and whether it would result in an apology that lacked sincerity (at [324]-\n[325]):I do not propose to direct that any apology should be ordered against any respondent in the particular \ncircumstances. Ms Poniatowska has already received an apology from Ms Sharrad in respect of the June 2005 \nallegations, and from Mr Lotito in respect of the Lotito allegations. Although I have made adverse findings against \nthe respondents other than Mr A Hickinbotham and Homes, in my discretion under s 46PO(4) of the HREOC Act, I \ndo not propose to order that any further apology be given.\n\n There are a number of reasons for that. In the first place, in my view, the adverse findings made against the \nrespondents in respect of the conduct concerning them individually is sufficient recognition for Ms Poniatowska of \nthe inappropriateness of that conduct. The imposition upon those respondents, who variously denied the conduct \nspecifically attributed to them or in some respects denied its significance, would put them in the position of requiring \nthem to apologise for conduct which they did not accept that they had severally engaged in: see for instance the \nobservations of Branson J in Jones v Toben [2002] FCA 1150; (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106]; Jones v The Bible \nBelievers\u2019 Church [2007] FCA 55 at [65].  An appeal in Poniatowska was dismissed without reference to the \napology point: Employment Services Australia Pty Ltd v Poniatowska [2010] FCAFC 92.  Apology orders were also \nconsidered in a handful of cases that preceded, or did not refer to, Jones v Scully. In Grulke v KC Canvas Pty Ltd \n[2000] FCA 1415, Ryan J held in short reasons that, while sex discrimination was made out against the employer \nrespondent, it would not be appropriate to make an apology order under s 46PO(2)(b) because (at [4]):In my view, \nhaving regard to the fact that the respondent here is not a natural legal person but is a corporation, and the fact that \nI have endeavoured to compensate for loss or damage suffered by the applicant by making a pecuniary award of \ndamages, it is inappropriate to exercise the discretion reposed in the Court by additionally ordering the making of an \napology.  His Honour did not develop his reasoning on why it might be relevant that the respondent was not a \n\n\n\nnatural legal person and his approach to that issue has not been followed in other cases.  In Creek v Cairns Post \nPty Ltd [2001] FCA 1007; 112 FCR 352, the applicant, an Aboriginal woman, sued a newspaper publisher in \nrelation to a report about a decision of the Queensland Department of Family Services, Youth and Community Care \nto take a two-year-old Aboriginal girl out of foster care with a white family and place her into the care of the \napplicant, who had care of the child\u2019s two brothers and was a relative of the deceased mother of the children (at \n[1]). The report included a photograph of the white family in a comfortable living room and a photograph of the \napplicant in a bush camp with a shed or lean-to in which young children could be seen (at [4]). Kiefel J held that the \napplicant\u2019s complaint under s 18C of the RDA was not made out because there was no evidence to suggest race \nhad \u201cactuated\u201d the respondent\u2019s decision to publish the photographs (at [28]-[29]). Her Honour nevertheless went \non to consider the orders she would have made had the complaint been successful (at [33]). One of the orders \nsought by the applicant was an apology. Kiefel J said (at [34]):It does not seem to me, after a lapse of almost four \nyears, that an extensive apology would be particularly worthwhile with respect to the wider readership. It may \nhowever have helped to vindicate the applicant in the eyes of her own community and for that reason I would have \nbeen minded to order a short apology.  Her Honour also said (at [35]):A finding of contravention would have meant \nthat the respondent had acted for racist reasons. Its failure or inability to acknowledge this and the withholding of an \napology are matters to be taken into account in assessing the extent of the injury felt by the plaintiff and the \ncompensation to be awarded to redress that. It is not in my view necessary to consider separate and additional \nawards of aggravated damages. I would have awarded $8,000 damages.  While these comments were made in \nobiter, her Honour\u2019s reasoning supports the view that there may be cases in which it is appropriate for a court to \norder an apology for race discrimination. It also supports the view that a respondent withholding an apology may \naggravate damages payable for race discrimination. There is no suggestion in her Honour\u2019s reasoning that an \napology, ordered together with a monetary award, could somehow constitute double compensation, although that is \nnot to deny the force of observations such as those made by Mansfield J in Poniatowska that an apology should not \nbe ordered where other findings and orders provide sufficient recognition of wrongdoing and sufficient redress to \nthe complainant.  In Forbes v Australian Federal Police (Commonwealth of Australia) [2004] FCAFC 95, a Federal \nMagistrate had made a declaration that \u201cthe Australian Federal Police\u201d had engaged in disability discrimination \nagainst the complainant employee and ordered \u201cthe Australian Federal Police\u201d to provide a written apology: at [3]. \nThe Full Court of this Court held that the Magistrate had erred by failing to ask whether the applicant\u2019s disability (a \ndepressive illness) was the reason for the impugned conduct: at [70] (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sackville JJ). At the \nstart of their reasons, their Honours noted that \u201cthe Australian Federal Police\u201d is not a legal person and that the \nCommissioner of Police is empowered by legislation to engage employees on behalf of the Commonwealth: at [4]. \nTheir Honours therefore said at [7]:The Magistrate did not identify the source of power to direct \u2018The Australian \nFederal Police\u2019 to make an apology and the issue was not raised on the appeal. In view of the outcome of the \nappeal, however, it is not necessary to consider this issue further.  In an article titled \u2018You Can\u2019t Order Sorriness, So \nIs There Any Value in an Ordered Apology? An Analysis of Ordered Apologies in Anti-Discrimination Cases\u2019 [2010] \nUNSWLawJl 16; (2010) 33 UNSW Law Journal 360, Robyn Carroll cites Grulke and Forbes as cases in which \n\u201cdoubts [were] expressed about the power to make an [apology] order ... against an entity that is not a natural \nperson, including government authorities\u201d: at 378. That is true of Grulke, but I do not consider Forbes should be \nread in that way. The Full Court\u2019s comments were addressed to the fact that \u201cthe Australian Federal Police\u201d was \nnot a legal person. The Court made no comment on the appropriateness of apology orders generally, whether \nagainst government authorities or otherwise. It did not, for example, say that an apology order cannot be made \nagainst the Commonwealth.  In Eatock v Bolt [2011] FCA 1103; 197 FCR 261, the Court found that a journalist and \na newspaper publisher had contravened s 18C of the RDA by writing and publishing two newspaper articles which \nconveyed imputations that fair-skinned people with some Aboriginal descent who identified as Aboriginal were not \ngenuinely Aboriginal and were pretending to be Aboriginal in order to access perceived benefits or for political \nreasons: see [452]-[453] (Bromberg J). The applicant sought, inter alia, an order requiring the publisher to publish \nan apology. At [465]-[468], Bromberg J said:There is force in the contention of HWT [the publisher] that an apology \nshould not be compelled by an order of the Court because that compels a person to articulate a sentiment that is \nnot genuinely held. An apology is one means of achieving the public vindication of those that have been injured by \na contravention of s 18C. The power granted to the Court to require a respondent to redress any loss or damage is \na wide power. There are other means by which public vindication may be achieved.\n\n\n\n Public vindication is important. It will go some way to redressing the hurt felt by those injured. It will serve to restore \nthe esteem and social standing which has been lost as a consequence of the contravention. It will serve to inform \nthose influenced by the contravening conduct of the wrongdoing involved. It may help to negate the dissemination \nof racial prejudice. \n\n Whilst I will not order HWT to apologise, in the absence of an appropriate apology, I am minded to make an order \nwhich fulfils the purposes which I have identified.\n\n My preliminary view is that a corrective order should be made which would require HWT to publish a notice in the \nHerald Sun in print and online. The terms of the notice would include an introduction which referred to this \nproceeding and the order requiring its publication and set out the declaration made by the Court. In order to give the \npublication of the corrective notice a prominence and frequency commensurate with the publication of the \nNewspaper Articles and to facilitate it being communicated to those likely to have read the Newspaper Articles, I \nhave in mind that the corrective order would require the publication of the notice in the Herald Sun newspaper and \nonline, on two separate occasions in a prominent place immediately adjacent to Mr Bolt\u2019s regular column.  After \nfurther submissions from the parties on the form of orders that should be made, Bromberg J said in Eatock v Bolt \n(No 2) [2011] FCA 1180; 284 ALR 114 (at [14]):In her claim for relief, Ms Eatock sought an apology from HWT. As I \nsaid in my earlier reasons for judgment at [465], I am not persuaded that I should compel HWT to articulate a \nsentiment that is not genuinely held. I noted, however, that an apology is but one means of addressing the public \nvindication sought by those who have been injured by the contravention of s 18C.  His Honour therefore ordered \nthat a corrective notice be published instead of requiring an apology: Eatock v Bolt (No 2) at [17]. As with the earlier \ndecisions to which I have referred above, the salient point to draw from his Honour\u2019s reasons is that an ordered \napology may be an appropriate way of redressing loss and damage caused by racial discrimination, including by \nachieving \u201cpublic vindication\u201d of those injured by it, but may not be appropriate where such an order would compel \nthe articulation of a sentiment that is not genuinely held. To compel an apology of that kind is unlikely to be the most \nappropriate method of redressing loss and damage and achieving vindication.  Apart from Jones v Scully, the \nparties did not refer the Court to any of these cases. Nor did they refer to De Simone v Bevacqua (unreported, Sup \nCt, Vic, McDonald J, 15 September 1994), which appears to be the only Australian case in which a superior court \nordered an apology. In the context of a sex discrimination complaint made under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 \n(Vic), McDonald J said at p 45:Having regard to the provisions of s.46(2)(c) of the Act I am of the opinion that the \nBoard is empowered under it to order a respondent to make an apology with a view to redressing any loss, damage \nor injury suffered by the complainant as a result of the act of discrimination, the subject of the complaint and found \nto have been established.  His Honour ordered an amended form of the apology that had been ordered by the \nEqual Opportunity Board, removing a reference to the employer company, which was vicariously liable for the \ncontravening conduct, not having a program to counter sexual harassment on the basis that this was not part of its \nliability under the Act: p 50.  As I have noted, De Simone v Bevacqua has not been followed in decisions of this \nCourt: see, esp, Forest at [13] (Collier J). However, apologies have been ordered in a number of anti-discrimination \ndecisions at tribunal level: see R Carroll, \u2018You Can\u2019t Order Sorriness\u2019, which usefully summarises a number of \ndecisions of that kind; and see R Carroll, \u2018Apologies as a Legal Remedy\u2019 (2013) 23 Sydney Law Review 317. Some \nstate anti-discrimination statutes specifically provide power to order apologies: see, eg, s 108(2)(d) of the Anti-\nDiscrimination Act 1977 (NSW); s 209(1)(d) and (e) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 (Qld). Apology orders were \nmade pursuant to the New South Wales statute in Margan v Manias [2013] NSWADT 177, a homosexual vilification \ncase in which the respondent was ordered to publish an apology at his expense in a quarter-page advertisement in \nthe Sydney Star Observer; and in Russell v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Service [2001] \nNSWADT 32, which I discuss at [600]-[604] above. A public apology was ordered pursuant to the Queensland \nstatute in Fischer v Byrnes [2006] QADT 33, a sexual harassment case.  Even in jurisdictions where relevant anti-\ndiscrimination statutes do not include a specific power to order an apology, tribunals have occasionally made such \nan order. For example, in Falun Dafa v Melbourne [2004] VCAT 625, in which the Victorian Civil and Administrative \nTribunal, acting pursuant to s 136(a) Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic), ordered the Melbourne City Council to \npublish in three Chinese-language newspapers an apology for excluding the Falun Dafa Association of Victoria from \nthe 2003 Moomba Parade on the basis of its political affiliations. Apologies have also been ordered by the Federal \nMagistrates Court of Australia in a small number of cases: see, eg, Zheng v Beamish [2004] FMCA 61, a sexual \n\n\n\nharassment claim brought under s 28B of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth); and Oberoi v Human Rights and \nEqual Opportunity Commission [2001] FMCA 34, a disability discrimination case in which Raphael FM ordered the \nfirst respondent to apologise but left the wording of the apology to the President of the first respondent (the Human \nRights and Equal Opportunity Commission).  While the utility of ordering an apology has been questioned in a \nnumber of the decisions to which I have referred, it does not appear that a respondent\u2019s freedom of speech has \nbeen viewed as a limiting factor. In Attorney General v 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 349; 97 ALD 426, the \ntribunal had ordered two radio presenters to broadcast an apology for comments they made vilifying homosexuals. \nThe issue before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales was whether the tribunal had jurisdiction to determine \nwhether s 49ZT of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibited homosexual vilification, should \nbe read down to comply with the implied freedom of political communication identified in Lange [1997] HCA 25; 189 \nCLR 520. In circumstances where s 114 of the Act provided that \u201cupon filing in the Supreme Court [the Tribunal\u2019s \napology order] operates as a judgment of the court\u201d (at [64] (Spigelman CJ)), the Court of Appeal held that the High \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1995] HCA 10; 183 CLR 245 \napplied to state tribunals. The Court therefore made a declaration that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine \nwhether s 49ZT should be read down because to do so would be an impermissible exercise of federal judicial \npower by the tribunal: see [76]-[80] (Spigelman CJ), [114] (Hodgson JA), [118] (Ipp JA, agreeing with Spigelman CJ \nand Hodgson JA). However, the Court made no comments about the apology order itself. There is no suggestion in \ntheir Honours\u2019 reasons that an apology order, made by a tribunal or a court, might be inconsistent with the implied \nfreedom.  There is at least one case in which it was held that specific performance of an agreement to apologise \nshould not be ordered because it would interfere with freedom of expression: Summertime Holdings Pty Ltd v \nEnvironmental Defender's Office Ltd (1998) 45 NSWLR 291, which also involved a radio station. There, Young J \nsaid at 297:Even though there is no Australian law which governs freedom of speech in the same way as the \nConstitution of the United States of America, I consider that it needs to be an exceptional case before the courts \nshould exercise their discretion to grant an order like specific performance to compel a person to give an apology. I \nappreciate that in the instant case the form of the apology had, with slight exception, been settled, and that the first \nthree defendants were contractually obliged to give it, but it still seems to me that I should not, in the absence of \nsome special reason, compel the defendants to utter the words.  In this case, the respondents made no contention \nthat any principle of freedom of speech should limit the Court\u2019s power, or guide its discretion, to order an apology \nunder s 46PO(4). As the matter does not arise for decision, I say no more about it, other than to observe that in \nCanada it has been recognised that an ordered apology will not necessarily infringe a defendant\u2019s right to freedom \nof expression under s 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In Moore v Canadian Newspapers Co \nLtd, 1989 CarswellOnt 423; 60 DLR (4th) 113, Rosenberg J acknowledged that an ordered apology, which his \nHonour did not make in that case, would interfere with that right but that (at 117):Notwithstanding this interference, \nthe court could make such an order as being a reasonable limit prescribed by law under s. 1 of the Charter since it \ncan be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society that the court should have the right to determine \nwhen such an apology is required. The court would be in effect considering the same issues in determining whether \nto make the order as another court would be considering in determining whether or not the right to make such an \norder is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society: Slaight Communications Incorporated v. Davidson, \ndecision of the Supreme Court of Canada, heard October 8, 1987, judgment rendered May 4, 1989 (unreported) \n[since reported 59 D.L.R. (4th) 416, 89 C.L.L.C. 14,031, 93 N.R. 183].  Slaight Communications Incorporated v \nDavidson (1989) 59 DLR (4th) 416 dealt with an order for a corrective notice rather than an apology. The Supreme \nCourt of Canada upheld an order that the defendant employer give the complainant employee a letter of \nrecommendation with correct descriptions of his sales targets and results and a statement that an adjudicator had \nfound the defendant had unjustly dismissed the employee. No apology was required, however. In Perera v Canada \n[1998] 3 FC 381; 158 DLR (4th) 341 at[27], the Federal Court of Appeal refused to strike out a claim for an apology \norder, citing Slaight but not Moore, but with reasoning substantially identical to that in Moore. However, there does \nnot appear to be any reported case in which a Canadian superior court actually ordered an apology and academic \ncommentary indicates there is resistance to doing so in the criminal jurisdiction: see JC Kleefeld, \u2018Thinking Like a \nHuman: British Columbia\u2019s Apology Act\u2019 (2007) 40 University of British Columbia Law Review 769 at 793-74.  Other \nforeign courts have also shown reluctance to order apologies, including in anti-discrimination cases. In Ma Bik Yung \nv Ko Chuen [2001] HKCFA 56; [2002] 2 HKLRD 1, a disability discrimination case, the Hong Kong Court of Final \nAppeal considered whether an apology order should be made against an unwilling defendant. Section 72(4)(b) of \n\n\n\nthe Disability Discrimination Ordinance, Cap 487 (HK) was in terms almost identical to s 46PO(4)(b) of the AHRC \nAct:Without limiting the generality of the power conferred by subsection (3), the District Court may \u2013\n\n ...\n\n (b) order that the respondent shall perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress any loss or damage \nsuffered by the claimant;  Li CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, did not doubt that s 72(4)(b) \ngave the Court power to order an apology, stating at [30]:The circumstances of the cases brought under the \nOrdinance would be of an infinite variety. With the wide range of available remedies, it is for the court to fashion the \nremedies that are appropriate for the case in question.  However, his Honour went on to say that such an order \nshould be made against an \u201cunwilling defendant\u201d only in rare circumstances (at [52]):Before an order for an apology \ncould be made against an unwilling defendant, s.72(4)(b) requires the court to be satisfied that an apology is a \nreasonable act for the defendant to perform in the circumstances of the case in question. The requirement of \n\u201creasonable\u201d in the provision may not necessarily lead to the conclusion that an order for an apology can never be \nmade against an unwilling defendant. With an unwilling defendant, it may well be that an apology, which will be an \ninsincere one, would usually not be a reasonable act for him to perform. In this context, it must be borne in mind \nthat there are many other remedies at the court\u2019s disposal which could be considered. But there may be rare cases \nwhere the court could be satisfied that an apology, albeit insincere, would be a reasonable act for the defendant to \nperform. Further, in these rare cases, enforcement could not be said to be futile or disproportionate and contrary to \nthe interests of the administration of justice. The circumstances in these rare cases, including the degree of gravity \nof the defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct as well as the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s loss and damage, would have \nto be exceptional. Under s.72(4)(b) the court does have the power to order an unwilling defendant to make an \napology. It is in these rare cases that the court could consider exercising this power against an unwilling defendant.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)    Li CJ also discussed De Simone v Bevacqua in the course of his reasons, noting that the \nquestion whether an apology order should be made against an unwilling defendant was not specifically considered \nin that case (at [55]). In my opinion, the principles articulated by Li CJ in Ma Bik Yung are consistent with those \narticulated by Bromberg J in Eatock v Bolt and the other decisions of this Court to which I have referred. The \nprincipal reason tending against ordering an apology in relation to an unwilling respondent is that the court has \nother remedies at its disposal that could better achieve the objectives of such an order. Nevertheless, in some \ncases it may well be appropriate to order an apology. With respect, I agree with Li CJ that the gravity of the \ncontravening conduct is an important factor to consider when determining whether such an order should be made in \na particular case. That factor is likely to affect an assessment of both the extent to which the order will be \nappropriate to achieve redress and vindication in light of other remedies granted and whether the order is justified.  \nIn some jurisdictions with civil law traditions, apology orders appear to be more readily available than in common \nlaw jurisdictions. Such orders are made with varying degrees of frequency in countries including Japan, China, and \nthe Netherlands: see A Zwart-Hink et al, \u2018Compelled Apologies as a Legal Remedy: Some Thoughts from a Civil \nLaw Jurisdiction\u2019 [2014] UWALawRw 17; (2014) 38 University of Western Australia Law Review 100. In Le Roux v \nDey [2011] ZACC 4; [2011] 3 SA 274, the Constitutional Court of South Africa ordered an apology in a defamation \ncase involving an offensive image of a deputy principal created by the defendant schoolchildren. After noting (at \n[195]) that \u201c[t]he present position in our Roman Dutch common law\u201d was that an apology could not be ordered in \nsuch a case, Froneman J and Cameron J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) expressed the \njustification for reversing that position as follows (at [200]):Respect for the dignity of others lies at the heart of the \nConstitution and the society we aspire to. That respect breeds tolerance for one another in the diverse society we \nlive in. Without that respect for each other\u2019s dignity our aim to create a better society may come to naught. It is the \nfoundation of our young democracy. And reconciliation between people who opposed each other in the past is \nsomething which was, and remains, central and crucial to our constitutional endeavour. Part of reconciliation, at all \ndifferent levels, consists of recantation of past wrongs and apology for them. That experience has become part of \nthe fabric of our society. The law cannot enforce reconciliation but it should create the best conditions for making it \npossible. We can see no reason why the creation of those conditions should not extend to personal relationships \nwhere the actionable dignity of one has been impaired by another.  The Constitutional Court\u2019s emphasis on \nreconciliation is one which may be a relevant factor in the context of the current proceeding (as a recantation of \n\n\n\npast wrongs and an apology for them). While there are many important differences between the experiences of \nAboriginal people in Australia and those of black people in South Africa, what is today required of police and other \npublic officials in South Africa to combat the legacy of apartheid, and the judicial language used to describe the \nwrongs of the past, is not inapposite for the history of Palm Island. The findings I have made are that lack of \nrespect and understanding, a desire to control and subjugate, and a difficulty treating Aboriginal people equally \nwere all features of the conduct of QPS officers on Palm Island between 19 and 28 November 2004. It is \nworthwhile referring to the judicial language of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in several decisions.  In The \nCitizen 1978 (Pty) Ltd v McBride [2011] ZACC 11; 2011 (4) SA 191, Ngcobo CJ said (at [144]-[145]):We have \nrecently emerged from a legal order that was founded on racism and characterised by gross discrimination against \nblack people, in particular, black Africans. It sought to dehumanise its victims and strip them of their human dignity \nby relegating them to an inferior status. \n\n ... what was obnoxious with discrimination was not merely the physical separation it promulgated, but its basic \npremise. It was premised on the inferiority of black people. They had no dignity worth protecting. Thus, it was \ndefamatory to call a white man black. Our Constitution rejected this. Under our new constitutional order, the \nrecognition and protection of human dignity is a foundational value.\n\n(Footnotes omitted.)    In Bertie Van Zyl (Pty) Ltd v Minister for Safety and Security [2009] ZACC 11; 2010 (2) SA \n181, Mogkoro J said of police harassment that formed part of the background to the case (at [77]):This sort of \nconduct is reminiscent of the abuse of power and police harassment of people and communities which were rife in \nour past. In a constitutional democracy, based on the values of equality, human dignity and freedom, the \nharassment to which the applicants were subjected was most regrettable. In public service where policing must \nhave regard to the values of ubuntu, the conduct of the police was indeed disappointing, and, frankly sanctionable.\n\n(Footnote omitted.)    Langa J in S v Makwanyane [1995] ZACC 3; 1995 (3) SA 391 at [224] explained that the \nconcept of ubuntu, which is referred to but not defined in the South African Constitution, relates to the recognition of \n\u201ca person\u2019s status as a human being, entitled to unconditional respect, dignity, value and acceptance from the \nmembers of the community such person happens to be part of\u201d.  Acknowledging the dignity and equal value of \nAboriginal people living on Palm Island, acknowledging their continuing sense of injustice about the events in \nNovember 2004, and recognising the failures in the QPS response, including its racial basis, is capable of being, as \nthe South African Constitutional Court put it, a \u201crecantation of past wrongs\u201d and of real benefit in circumstances \nsuch as the present one.  Drawing these authorities together, I consider that in the current proceeding the critical \nquestion is whether a court-ordered apology is an act which the Court is satisfied would redress damage suffered \nby the applicants. Whether more appropriate methods of achieving that redress are available is also relevant. The \nfirst, second and third applicants rely on evidence from Mr Ralph to the effect that an apology was capable of \nhaving \u201cbeneficial psychological effects\u201d for each of the applicants, although in his written report he had only \nmentioned an apology as beneficial for Mrs Agnes Wotton. Mr Ralph described an apology as a \u201cstep towards \nhealing\u201d. That description is resonant of the \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of Le Roux. \nAlthough in cross-examination Mr Ralph began to make a concession that any apology should not cover QPS \nconduct connected with Mr Wotton\u2019s criminal convictions, when he was asked specifically about Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest, \nthis was his answer:The parties and the community have a sense that an injustice has been done in terms of the \ninvestigation into the death in custody and the events that followed on from that, as well, have been cause \u2013 further \ncause for considerable grievance in terms of the response of the Queensland Police Service and the events that \nhave followed on from there. Some acknowledgment that \u2013 that what happened was \u2013should not have happened \nand some expression of regret or remorse, combined into an apology, as I said, would be a process that would \nallow the community and \u2013 or the parties and community members to feel that their grievances have, to some \nextent, at least been acknowledged as being correct and allow them to move on from that point.  When pressed to \nexplain how an apology would sit against the kind of specific findings of contraventions of s 9 which the applicants \nsought to have the Court make, Mr Ralph said:Certainly an \u2013 if it is found that the parties and the community have \nbeen \u2013 have experienced racial discrimination, then I think that is certainly something that there needs to be an \napology for. The sense of injustice that the parties and the communities have go way back to the police \ninvestigation and findings that had been made in other tribunals that have not been acted upon. And there is this \nsense that they have that that \u2013 their concerns, their grievances have simply been ignored and ignored on the basis \n\n\n\nof racial grounds.  The evidence in this proceeding supports the opinion expressed by Mr Ralph and, with one \nqualification, I accept it. The qualification is that I am satisfied on the evidence that individuals who gave evidence in \nthis proceeding still have the sense of grievance and injustice they had in November 2004. They still feel the QPS \nand its officers have not been held accountable for the way Mulrunji\u2019s death was dealt with, nor for the \ndisproportionate reaction to the protests and fires. I am satisfied on the evidence that a sense of grievance and \ninjustice was much more widely felt across the Palm Island community in November 2004. Does it continue across \nthe Palm Island community, or have those less directly affected by the events of November 2004 \u201cput the matter \nbehind them\u201d, to resort to a platitude? If I were satisfied that the community no longer felt a sense of grievance, I \nwould be unlikely to order any relief centred on accountability and public statements.  The view I take of the function \nof an apology by the Commissioner is a broader public function directed to the Aboriginal community on Palm \nIsland, of which the applicants are members. In many of the cases about apologies, the court has been dealing \nwith an individual applicant and an individual or corporate respondent. No exercises of public power were involved \nin those cases. I accept that, in those circumstances, the unwillingness of the contravener, and therefore the \nprospect of an insincere statement, is a material consideration. That is not this case. None of the cases deal with \ncircumstances such as those in this proceeding. The issue is, like many others in this proceeding, a novel one.  It is \ndifficult to ascertain whether there remains a community-wide sense of grievance and injustice about the events in \n2004. The applicants did not seek to establish any such proposition through calling a large number of witnesses to \nthat effect. As I have noted, there were many individuals who were relevant witnesses for the applicants who were \nabsent. The events occurred approximately 12 years ago. That said, there are plausible explanations for why the \nclaims in this proceeding have taken so long to be expressed and determined, not the least of which is the long \nprocess experienced by many subgroup members, and the Wotton family in particular, of finalising criminal charges \nagainst them arising out of the protests and fires. Further, the group members are identified in the pleadings as \n\u201cIndigenous people resident on Palm Island on 19 November 2004 who remained ordinarily resident on Palm \nIsland until 25 March 2010\u201d, the latter date being the date on which the applicants lodged a written complaint with \nthe Commission. Therefore the group members whose sense of injustice and grievance is to be redressed by the \nCourt\u2019s orders are those who come within the class defined in the pleadings. On balance, I am sufficiently \npersuaded persons within that class continue to be affected by the events of November 2004. It is clear Mulrunji \nwas widely known and liked on the island. It is clear that connections \u2013 of family or friendship or both \u2013 to the 18 \nfamilies whose houses were entered and searched exist widely across the majority of class members. There were \nalso others involved in those events \u2013 members of the local Council, and concerned community members who \nattended meetings \u2013 who are likely still to be on the island, and whose families are likely also to fall within the class \nas pleaded.  The need for an apology, and the nature of any apology, as Mr Ralph implies, is context dependent. In \nany context, an apology is a way of recognising wrongdoing (large or small, moral, personal, social, public or legal) \nand acknowledging hurt and grievance caused or felt in others because of that wrongdoing. An apology is intended, \nas Mr Ralph said, to be a step towards healing. Or, as the Constitutional Court put it in Le Roux, a step towards \nreconciliation.  It may well be the case that the observations made in cases such as Jones v Scully and Eatock v \nBolt are apposite for controversies which arise between private parties. If an apology is seen as some kind of \nadmission of personal responsibility or wrongdoing, or a statement of personal regret, then in a dispute between \nprivate individuals (or entities) it may well be inappropriate to force an individual to say something she or he does \nnot really mean. Between private individuals, sincerity has a different and more immediate quality, in the sense of \nan individual taking personal responsibility for wrongdoing and acknowledging hurt or grievance caused to or felt by \nothers.  Where public entities or office holders are concerned, and especially where government is concerned, the \nsituation is quite different. Responsibility is not, in those circumstances personal: it is institutional. The individuals \nwho occupy office in government, or the apex of a public entity, do so in a representative capacity, and for public \nnot private purposes. They exercise public power, and an apology by them is an exercise of public power. The \napology is given as an exercise in responsible and representative government. It is not a statement of personal \nregret, and personal sincerity is not such a key ingredient, although no doubt it is desirable. An apology given on \nbehalf of a public entity or by an office holder may be given by an individual who had nothing at all to do with the \ncontravening conduct.  Nevertheless, there remains the question about the appropriateness of ordering a public \noffice holder to give an apology. The premise underlying an order is that the public office holder will not, of her or \nhis own accord, apologise. There is something of an analogy with the difference between an undertaking and an \ninjunction, although the analogy is imperfect because an injunction is a remedy to enforce legal rights.  Once the \nfindings of the Court have been made, and published, one possible course is for the Court to require, by a court \n\n\n\norder, that a choice be made whether or not to apologise. In this proceeding, if there were to be an apology, in my \nopinion it should come from the second respondent, although vicarious liability lies with the first respondent. As the \nrespondents have admitted in their defence, the occupant of the office of Commissioner of Police is the individual \nwith responsibility for the efficient and proper administration, management and functioning of the Queensland \nPolice Service. Part of that function is to ensure compliance with the requirements of all Acts and laws binding \nmembers of the QPS, and with directions of the Commissioner. The Court has found that the conduct of those QPS \nofficers in charge of the investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death, and those having some command responsibility for \npolicing functions on Palm Island between 19 and 29 November 2004, contravened s 9 of the RDA, a law which \nbinds each and every QPS officer in the performance of her or his functions as a police officer.  On the evidence, \none of the attributes found wanting in the QPS by the Palm Island witnesses, and those who spoke or were \ninterviewed in the contemporaneous video footage, was accountability. It is appropriate, in order to redress the \ndamage done by the way QPS officers conducted themselves on Palm Island, for the group members to see the \nQPS having to be accountable for what the Court has found occurred. Accordingly what I propose to do is to direct \nthe second respondent to consider whether, on the basis of the findings of the Court, it is appropriate to apologise \non behalf of the QPS to the community on Palm Island. If the second respondent considers it is appropriate, the \nsecond respondent would then issue a public apology. The terms of that apology are a matter for the second \nrespondent. I would be inclined to order it be published on Palm Island, in The Australian, The Courier-Mail and \nThe Townsville Bulletin on a Saturday and in the first eight pages of each newspaper, and on the QPS website. If \nthe second respondent, having considered the Court\u2019s reasons, decides it is not appropriate to apologise, then the \nsecond respondent will be directed to publish reasons for that decision and those reasons are to be published in the \nsame places as the apology would have been published. In that way, the Commissioner must take responsibility for \ndeciding whether an apology is appropriate, and what that apology should say in light of the Court\u2019s findings. The \nCommissioner will be accountable publicly for that decision. As I have said, the Court will not however impose an \napology on the Commissioner. The Commissioner must sincerely and genuinely decide to offer one; or explain why \nhe will not.  The terms of the apology sought by the applicants would not be appropriate under any circumstances. \nThis Court has made no findings about the \u201cwilful blindness\u201d of the State of Queensland and the Commissioner of \nPolice, nor did the applicants\u2019 pleadings require any such findings to be made. Further, the references in the \napplicants\u2019 proposed wording to Palm Islanders being entitled to \u201cappropriate levels of protection\u201d from the QPS do \nnot sit comfortably with the majority of the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning contraventions of s 9, which are not \nabout the protection of residents on Palm Island.  Another option I am prepared to consider is that an order be \nmade for the Commissioner to make a public statement about the Court\u2019s findings in this case in lieu of an apology, \nbut to be published in the same way as the apology would have been published. The statement could be in similar \nform to that ordered inEatock v Bolt (No 2), adapted to the circumstances of this case.  Since the parties made very \nshort submissions on the matter of an apology, and I have considered it at length, it is appropriate the parties have \nan opportunity to make further submissions on the matters I have raised. There will be directions accordingly.\n\nCompensation    The parameters of this proceeding as a class action mean the only orders for compensation which \nthe Court is considering at this time are orders in favour of the first, second and third applicants. It is apparent from \nthe evidence and the findings I have made that other individuals, especially those within the subgroup, may have \nindependent claims for compensation.  There was no real dispute between the parties about the applicable \nprinciples to an order for compensation under s 46PO(4) and both parties relied on the Full Court\u2019s decision in \nRichardson v Oracle Corporation Australia Pty Ltd [2014] FCAFC 82; 223 FCR 334, and the cases there referred to.  \nThe power to order compensation for loss and damage suffered \u201cbecause of\u201d the conduct of a respondent is a \nstatutory power. It is conferred in the context of a legislative scheme dealing with unlawful discrimination in relation \nto attributes identified in the four pieces of federal legislation picked up the AHRC Act. As the other subsections in s \n46PO make clear, unlawful discrimination is proscribed in several different fields of activity which give rise to the \nneed for different kinds of remedies. Unlawful discrimination may occur in a setting which aligns its consequences \nclosely with the consequences of common law causes of action such as breach of contract (for example, \ndiscrimination by termination of employment). Or it may occur in a setting which aligns its consequences with \ncommon law causes of action such as intentional torts (for example, physical sexual harassment). In other \ncircumstances, the statutory cause of action for unlawful discrimination has no close relative in the common law. \nThat is why it is important to recall that it is the words of the statute which provide the criterion for such an order, not \ncommon law principles: see Qantas Airways v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69; 167 FCR 537 at [94] (French and Jacobson \nJJ).  In Richardson at [26], Kenny J relied upon the observations of Gleeson CJ in I & L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW \n\n\n\nValuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41; 210 CLR 109 at [26] where his Honour considered the nature of orders \nfor damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). At the time, s 82(1) provided:A person who suffers \nloss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV or V may \nrecover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the \ncontravention.  Gleeson CJ said at [25]-[26]:the possible existence, in different circumstances, of those and other \ncomplications directs attention to the kinds of problem inherent in the word \u201cby\u201d in s 82. Where the kind of \ncontravention of s 52 of the Act that is involved is a misrepresentation, including the expression of an erroneous \nopinion, which induces a person to enter into a transaction which results in financial loss then, depending upon the \nway in which a claim for loss or damage under s 82 is formulated, it will be common for the amount of the loss or \ndamage as claimed to be affected by factors in addition to the particular factor that was the subject of the \nmisrepresentation. The misrepresentation will rarely be the sole cause of the loss. In statements of principle \nconcerning the common law of contract or tort, additional factors which affect loss or damage are often discussed \nunder the rubrics of remoteness, mitigation, or contributory negligence. Here we are concerned, not with common \nlaw principles, but with statutory rights and liabilities. However, the same problems arise, and must be dealt with in \nconformity with the statute.\n\n The relationship between conduct of a person that is in contravention of the statute, and loss or damage suffered, \nexpressed in the word \u201cby\u201d, is one of legal responsibility. Such responsibility is vindicated by an award of damages. \nWhen a court assesses an amount of loss or damage for the purpose of making an order under s 82, it is not \nmerely engaged in the factual, or historical, exercise of explaining, and calculating the financial consequences of, a \nsequence of events, of which the contravention forms part. It is attributing legal responsibility; blame. This is not \ndone in a conceptual vacuum. It is done in order to give effect to a statute with a discernible purpose; and that \npurpose provides a guide as to the requirements of justice and equity in the case. Those requirements are not \ndetermined by a visceral response on the part of the judge assessing damages, but by the judge\u2019s concept of \nprinciple and of the statutory purpose.  In Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3; 216 CLR 388 at [44] \nthe High Court reiterated the inappropriateness of assuming a general law, rather than statutory, framework for the \nconsideration of compensation orders of the kind in s 46PO(4), while allowing for the possibility that analogies may \nbe helpful. General law analogies, as the decision in Murphy illustrates, can also lead to error.  Unlike the Trade \nPractices Act, contravention and enforcement are split in the legislative structure of the AHRC Act between that Act \nand the four federal anti-discrimination statutes. Thus, when one comes to apply concepts of \u201cprinciple and \nstatutory purpose\u201d, to use Gleeson CJ\u2019s phrase, the statutory purpose must be not only that of the AHRC Act, but \nalso that of the federal anti-discrimination statute which has been invoked by an applicant. Indeed, in my opinion the \nprincipal statutory purpose which will operate on orders under s 46PO(4) will be the purpose in the applicable anti-\ndiscrimination statute. As a matter of text, that is because what s 46PO identifies as the basis for attributing legal \nresponsibility is the \u201cconduct\u201d of a respondent, and that conduct is the conduct constituting the contravention of the \napplicable anti-discrimination statute.  The purpose of the RDA was described by Stephen J in Koowarta at 210. His \nHonour\u2019s description was for the purpose of determining whether the RDA was supported by s 51(xxvi) of the \nConstitution, but in my opinion that does not detract from its force:[The RDA] legislates about race and proscribes \ndiscrimination upon the basis of race. But it is a perfectly general law, addressed to all persons regardless of their \nrace and requiring that the members of all races shall be free from discrimination on account of race. It protects no \nparticular race or races. As its recitals attest, its purpose is to give effect to the International Convention, a copy of \nwhich is scheduled to the Act. That Convention, in its opening recitals, stresses the promotion of universal respect \nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction; universality of application lies very much at its \nheart. The Act takes from the Convention this quality, thereby denying to it the character of a special law to which \npar. (xxvi) refers.  In Mabo v Queensland [1988] HCA 69; 166 CLR 186 (Mabo (No 1)), Brennan, Toohey and \nGaudron JJ described the role of the reference in both s 9 and s 10 of the RDA to Art 5 of the ICERD, and had this \nto say about what ss 9 and 10 are intended to protect (at 216-17):The rights referred to in Art.5 are human rights for \nwhich, as the Preamble to the Convention testifies, \u201cuniversal respect ... and observance\u201d are encouraged. Human \nrights are calculated to preserve and advance \u201cthe dignity and equality inherent in all human beings\u201d. The Preamble \nstates that the Convention was agreed to in furtherance of the purpose of the United Nations \u201cto promote and \nencourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without \ndistinction as to race, sex, language or religion\u201d.  As cases such as Koowarta, Mabo (No 1), Gerhardy, and more \n\n\n\nrecently Maloney make clear, the incorporation of internationally recognised human rights into the text of ss 9 and \n10 of the RDA (as well as the special measures provisions in s 8) is intended to enable Australian domestic law to \nadvance and protect the enjoyment of those rights by all members of the Australian community, in a real and \nenforceable sense. Although attended with challenges in determining their content and sphere of operation, \nParliament has by the text and context of ss 8, 9 and 10 signalled its intention that reliance on the existence of \nthose rights is to be more than aspirational.  As I have noted, failure to observe standards of substantive equality \nhas a spectrum of effects depending on the sphere of activity concerned and the nature of the conduct constituting \nthe contravention. Compensation awarded for loss or damage \u201cbecause of\u201d contravening conduct must take into \naccount the particular human rights nullified or impaired. It should also reflect the measure of causal connection \nbetween the contravening conduct and the loss or damage suffered.  In Richardson, Besanko and Perram JJ \npointed out at [153] that in cases where a respondent is vicariously liable for the conduct of another, the requisite \ncausal connection is not between the conduct of the vicariously liable party and the loss and damage, but between \nthe actor (for whom the State is vicariously liable) and the loss or damage; see also Kenny J at [33]. Here, the \nindividual QPS officers (the \u2018actors\u2019) have not been named as respondents. However, the State\u2019s vicarious liability \nmust be determined on the basis of the requisite causal connection between the conduct of the individual QPS \nofficers and the loss or damage said to have been suffered by the applicant.  In some cases, tortious principles may \nbe helpful to inform the fixing of compensation, but those principles are not the governing criteria: see Richardson at \n[30] and [95] per Kenny J; and at [131] per Besanko and Perram JJ.  For example, in Richardson, Besanko and \nPerram JJ looked at the causation issue from both statutory and common law perspectives (see [154]-[155]) and \ndid not take a \u201cbut for\u201d approach to the terms of s 46PO. Their Honours also confirmed that they would have \nreached the same conclusion on the \u201ccommon sense and experience\u201d approach applicable to common law \ncausation following March v E & MH Stramare Pty Ltd[1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506.  In this case, there is no \neconomic loss claimed, or apparent on the evidence, aside from the property damage to some of the houses in the \narrests, entries and searches. I deal separately with that at [1726] below.  It will be apparent from what I have said \nthat I do not accept the position of the applicants in their written submissions (at [666]) that torts principles are the \n\u201cstarting point\u201d for an assessment of damages. Therefore, I do not accept (contrary to the applicants\u2019 submissions \nat [667]) that the aim of an order for compensation under s 46PO(4) is to place the applicant in the position the \napplicant would have been in if the unlawful discrimination had not taken place. The authorities on which the \napplicants rely for this proposition in their written submissions do not support the proposition. Qantas Airways v \nGama at [94] (which I quote at [1754] below) contains no such proposition. Richardson at [27]-[28] also contains no \nsuch proposition and indeed Kenny J is careful to emphasise that tortious principles may be a guide, but even that \nproposition, as her Honour emphasises, is context dependent. In Hall v A & A Sheiban Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 72; 20 \nFCR 217 at 239 (Hall v Sheiban), it is true that Lockhart J does refer to the general approach taken in tort, having \nnoted that tort provides \u201cthe closest analogy that I can find\u201d, although also noting (at 239) it would be \u201cunwise to \nprescribe an inflexible measure of damage in cases of this kind and, in particular, to do so exclusively by reference \nto the common law tests in branches of the law that are not the same, though analogous to varying degrees, with \nanti-discrimination law\u201d.  Those observations were made, as his Honour expressly stated, in the context of anti-\ndiscrimination legislation and case law being \u201cat an early stage of development in Australia\u201d, in circumstances \nwhere the entitlement to compensation for injury to feelings or humiliation was still contestable. That is no longer \nthe case.  To take the approach suggested by the applicants would be to fail to give primacy to compensation in this \ncontext having a statutory basis, and purpose. The facts of this case provide a good illustration of how the \nsomewhat linear approach of restoring a common law plaintiff to the position she or he would have been in if the \ntortious conduct had not occurred cannot be applied in any meaningful way. The question for the Court is what loss \nor damage has been suffered by the first, second and third applicants because of the conduct of QPS officers that I \nhave identified in [1540] above.  The respondents did not take issue with this aspect of the applicants\u2019 submissions, \nand therefore I consider the respondents\u2019 position to be equally erroneous.  In their reply submissions, the \napplicants contend that the respondents have approached the claim to damages as if it is a claim for personal injury \narising from negligence, and they contend that is an erroneous approach. They contend if there is an analogy it is \nwith the intentional torts of battery and false imprisonment. They also contend that, beyond medical injury (whether \nphysical or physiological), orders for compensation should reflect \u201cthe seriousness and impact of the wrong\u201d, \nreferring to Bulsey at [108] (Fraser JA) and New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; 229 CLR 638 at [31].  \nWhether or not it is correct to characterise the respondents\u2019 approach as one based on negligence, the applicants\u2019 \nresort to intentional torts also tends to frame the question by reference to the common law. The applicants\u2019 \n\n\n\nsubmissions are, in my opinion, more appropriate when they emphasise that orders under s 46PO(4) are directed at \nloss arising from unlawful discrimination and, I accept, the impact of unlawful discrimination in terms of hurt and \nhumiliation is damage of the kind for which compensation orders under s 46PO(4) can be made. Where a \ncomponent of the compensation is to reflect physical harm, such as the tasering of Mr Wotton, it should be recalled \nthat the purpose of the compensation remains connected to unlawful discrimination.\n\nConduct for which orders under s 46PO(4) are available  I turn now to consider each of the categories of unlawful \ndiscrimination I have found proven and whether each of the applicants have suffered loss or damage because of \nthe conduct comprising all or any of those acts of unlawful discrimination.  There is no evidence before me that any \nof the first, second or third applicants suffered loss or damage of any kind because of any or all of the first six \ncategories of conduct I have found contravened s 9 of the RDA. The applicants\u2019 submissions on damages did not \nfocus on conduct of this kind, but rather on the arrest of Mr Wotton and the entries and searches of the applicants\u2019 \nhouses.  It is true that Mr Wotton, as a key participant in many of the community meetings, and in the protests, was \nangry and outraged by conduct such as the failure to suspend SS Hurley, and by what he (correctly, I have found) \nperceived to be a partial investigation. His anger and outrage was visible and vocal: however, that does not mean \nhe was any more or less angry and outraged than other Palm Islanders who did or did not attend, or speak at, the \nmeetings and protests. It is clear from both her evidence in this proceeding and the contemporaneous video footage \nthat Mrs Agnes Wotton was also angry, outraged and affected by a real sense of injustice. I have no doubt Ms \nCecilia Wotton experienced the same feelings.  It is true, as the applicants submit (and the respondents do not \ndispute) that compensation can be awarded for what May LJ in Alexander v Home Office called \u201cinjured feelings\u201d: \n[1988] 1 WLR 968 at 975. However, this phrase is generally used interchangeably with descriptions such as \n\u201cdistress\u2019, \u201chumiliation\u201d, \u201cinsult\u201d, \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cstress\u201d. The dominant theme is a feeling, or emotional reaction, with \ndiscernible negative effects. In other words, they are all characterisations of feelings which carry a sense of injury, \nand therefore sufficient connection with the statutory concept of \u201closs\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d. Without questioning their \nsincerity, feelings such as anger, outrage and a sense of injustice, without more, are not susceptible to a \ncharacterisations as an injury, or as damage. They may or may not be negative in character: in some cases they \nare emotions with considerable positive force. In my opinion, reactions and feelings of that kind should not occasion \nan order for compensation in the circumstances of this proceeding, where protest and outrage was a key \ncomponent of the circumstances giving rise to some of the acts of unlawful discrimination.  Therefore, I do not \npropose to make any order for compensation under s 46PO(4) in relation to any of the three applicants because of \nthe contravening conduct of QPS officers falling within the first six categories of conduct set out at [1540] above.  \nFurther, in my opinion the evidence demonstrates that Palm Islanders, including the three applicants, were angry \nand outraged that Mulrunji died at all, probably to a greater extent than they were angry or outraged at the police \nresponse to his death. That is, in my opinion the stronger causal connection is between Mulrunji\u2019s death and the \nanger and outrage evident in the general community, rather than any contravening conduct which began with the \ninvestigation into his death.  The applicants did not seek orders other than the kind usually sought under s 46PO: \nthat is, compensation for actual loss and damage proven to have been suffered by an individual. In that sense, the \napplicants\u2019 case treated proof of non-economic or economic loss or damage as an integral element in securing an \norder for compensation under s 46PO(4).  In my opinion, it was possible for orders to be sought under s 46PO on a \ndifferent basis. In his recent text on Damages and Human Rights (Hart Publishing, 2016), Jason Varuhas draws a \ndistinction (see p 25) between what he calls the \u201cvindicatory torts\u201d (trespass to land or goods, battery, assault, false \nimprisonment, defamation) and the \u201ccompensatory torts\u201d (negligence being the principal example he gives). In the \nformer category, Varuhas contends, correctly in my respectful opinion, that what is being vindicated by an award of \ndamages is the infringement of a right itself, rather than compensation for actual loss or damage. He refers (at p 54) \nto false imprisonment cases where compensation is expressed as given for loss of liberty itself: see, eg, R v \nGovernor of Brockhill Prison; Ex parte Evans (No. 2) [1998] EWCA Civ 1042; [1999] QB 1043 at 1060 (Lord Woolf \nMR). So too (although less frequently, he concedes) for assault, where the infringement of personal bodily integrity \ncan lead to compensation: see, eg, Forde v Skinner [1830] EngR 472; (1830) 4 Car & P 239; 172 ER 687 (in which \nparish officers cut off a woman\u2019s hair by force and without her consent); Loudon v Ryder [1953] 2 QB 202 (in which \nthe defendant broke into the plaintiff\u2019s flat and assaulted her); and Ms B v An NHS Hospital Trust [2002] EWHC 429 \n(in which the claimant was given invasive artificial ventilation without her consent, leading to declarations and a \nnominal award of damages). Trespass to land is, Varuhas contends, in the same category: damages are given for \nthe interference with exclusive possession, whether or not damage is caused to the land: Plenty v Dillon [1991] \n\n\n\nHCA 5; 171 CLR 635 at 647. In Plenty at 654-55, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:True it is that the entry itself \ncaused no damage to the appellant\u2019s land. But the purpose of an action for trespass to land is not merely to \ncompensate the plaintiff for damage to the land. That action also serves the purpose of vindicating the plaintiff\u2019s \nright to the exclusive use and occupation of his or her land. ... The appellant is entitled to have his right of property \nvindicated by a substantial award of damages.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Eschewing any bright lines between human rights law as \u201cpublic law\u201d and torts as \u201cprivate \nlaw\u201d, Varuhas criticises developments in United Kingdom law which diminish the role and importance of damages in \nhuman rights cases. He criticises cases such as Anufrijeva v Southwark LBC [2003] EWCA Civ 1406; [2004] QB \n1124 and R (Faulkner) v Secretary of State for Justice [2013] UKSC 47; [2013] 2 AC 254 which characterise \ndamages as a remedy of last resort in human rights cases because \u201cpublic law\u201d remedies \u2013 bringing the breach of \nrights to an end for example \u2013 are the remedies which it is said should be given prominence. Varuhas instead \ncontends that a \u201cvindicatory\u201d approach should be taken, by analogy with those torts which recognise the need to \nvindicate the importance of basic and fundamental rights by an award of damages for the infringement of the right \nitself.  It should be said at once that Varuhas\u2019 text is concerned principally with human rights law in jurisdictions with \nbills of rights, whether statutory or constitutionally entrenched. It should also be said that, as the authorities to which \nI refer at [1613] demonstrate (Richardson in particular), it is not the case that damages for breaches of statutory \nequality rights (as a subset of human rights) are approached by Australian courts from any secondary perspective, \nas if monetary compensation is less important than other remedies. Quite the opposite. In that sense, Varuhas\u2019 \nconcerns may not be apparent in Australian cases. Further, Varuhas criticises courts in the United Kingdom for \ntying the \u201cquantum of awards for non-pecuniary loss to Strasbourg levels of awards, which are far lower than \ndomestic scales for equivalent losses\u201d (at p 95). The case law of the European Court of Human Rights, to which \nVaruhas refers, is far less of an influence on Australia law.  However, his emphasis on the origins of many torts in \nthe vindication of a fundamental right is not without significance for the grant of relief under statutory provisions \nsuch as s 46PO, especially read with prohibitions such as those in s 9. If s 9 is, as the authorities emphatically \nstate, concerned with the protection of equality before the law, and concerned to prohibit the nullification or \nimpairment of the enjoyment of human rights on an equal footing, then why would it not be the case that \ncompensation could be ordered to vindicate such a right, without proof of actual damage? I do no more than ask the \nquestion, because in this case, the applicants have not sought to develop such an argument. Had they done so, \ninteresting questions might have arisen about what compensation could be ordered for the first five contraventions \nof s 9 that I have found proven \u2013 including whether such orders could be made in a class action of this kind, equally \nin favour of each class member, where the right infringed was a community\u2019s right to have policing services \nfollowing a death in custody provided to that community in an independent and impartial way.\n\nThe arrests, entries and searches: authorities concerning police conduct  This leads me to consideration of the final \ncategory of contravening conduct \u2013 the arrests, entries and searches involving SERT officers. In relation to this \ncategory, I am satisfied there is a basis for a compensation order under s 46PO(4) in respect of each applicant on \nthe basis that each of them has suffered loss and damage because of the conduct of QPS officers. After setting out \nmy approach to Mr Ralph\u2019s report, I deal with each applicant in turn.  There are, so far as I have been able to \nascertain, no reported superior court decisions in Australia involving race discrimination by police officers in which \ndamages have been awarded. Certainly, the parties did not refer to any. At tribunal level, there is at least one: \nRussell v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Service [2001] NSWADT 32.  Bearing in mind the \nwarnings to which I have earlier referred about analogies with tort, it is instructive to consider Bulsey, because of its \nfactual overlap with this proceeding. In the absence of any other anti-discrimination cases, I then consider some \nother tort decisions involving police or custodial authorities.  The facts of Bulsey arise out of the same events with \nwhich this proceeding deals, although the evidence was different. As I have said, Mr Bulsey is a class member, and \nsome interesting questions arise about the extent to which the State (at least) is bound by the Court of Appeal\u2019s \nfactual findings in Bulsey, and how that might affect the submissions it is able to put in this case. The Court of \nAppeal\u2019s findings of fact do not bind this Court, but these same considerations means caution should be exercised \nbefore making a material finding of fact in relation to the same events and the same parties which is inconsistent \nwith a finding in Bulsey. As it has turned out, I do not consider any of the findings I make on damages are \ninconsistent withBulsey. The fact that I do not propose to order compensation in commensurable amounts reflects \nthe different evidence before me and, perhaps, the causal connection required for a compensation order under s \n\n\n\n46PO(4).  The evidence in Mr Bulsey\u2019s case was that he suffered from a chronic adjustment disorder with \ndepressed and anxious mood, as a consequence of the events of 27 November 2004 and their immediate \naftermath when Mr Bulsey was held in prison on the mainland.  It will be recalled that the causes of action pursued \nby Mr Bulsey were trespass to the person by way of assault, battery and false imprisonment. Ms Lenoy\u2019s causes of \naction were assault and false imprisonment. All causes of action were unsuccessful at trial, although the trial judge \ndid assess damages in the alternative. On appeal not only was liability found to exist, but the Court of Appeal \nsubstantially increased the amounts to be awarded by way of damages.  The Court of Appeal decision records (at \n[1]) that when Mr Bulsey was arrested and taken to Townsville, he was initially charged with unlawful assembly and \nremanded in custody on 29 November 2004. That charge was withdrawn by the QPS and he was then charged with \nrioting with destruction of a building contrary to s 65 of the Criminal Code. At committal, the prosecution conceded it \ndid not have a case against him and he was discharged. This, together with the evidence of what had occurred on \n27 November 2004, and medical evidence to which I have referred at [1634], was the factual substratum for the \nCourt of Appeal\u2019s consideration of Mr Bulsey\u2019s causes of action in tort, and of the damages which should be \nawarded. I note the Court of Appeal\u2019s record of the charges against Mr Bulsey does not fully accord with the agreed \nfacts before this Court about the charges against Mr Bulsey (which only mention the unlawful assembly charge), but \nI do not consider the discrepancy to have a material effect on any findings I am required to make.  In terms of the \naccount before the Court of Appeal of what had occurred on 27 November 2004, the following initial description of \nwhat happened is given (at [1]):Early in the morning of 27 November 2004 police officers, including approximately \nsix armed members of the \u201cSpecial Emergency Response Team\u201d (\u201cSERT\u201d) wearing black helmets and masks, \nforcibly entered the appellants\u2019 house, shouted commands at the second appellant, entered the first appellant\u2019s \nbedroom, took him from his bed, placed him on the floor, handcuffed him, and dragged him out to the street. Police \ntransported the first appellant to Townsville.  Later in the reasons (at [105]), Fraser JA sets out a summary of Mr \nBulsey\u2019s evidence as given by the trial judge:[12] His evidence was that on the evening after the riot he was at \nhome and that he went to bed at a normal time of 8 o\u2019clock.\n\n [13] In the morning he heard a big bang which woke him up, the next thing he knew he was on the floor with a boot \nat his head, the men had guns and helmets, he was handcuffed behind his back, he had no pants on, only a shirt. \nHe recognised that Darren Robinson was there, he said he was scared. He gave evidence he was not expecting to \nbe arrested, that if he had been asked he would have gone down to the police station voluntarily to answer any \nquestions as he had nothing to hide.\n\n [14] He recalled guns being held by the SERT operatives pointing at his head and back. He could not recall any \nwords being uttered about him being under arrest after which he was taken out to the police vehicle.\n\n [15] He said that when he was taken outside he had a towel around his body, the police had placed it there. He \ngave evidence that he could hear his wife calling out, \u201cLeave him alone. He never done nothing wrong.\u201d He said \nthat his children were present at the house but he could not see whether they witnessed these events. In addition \nhis sister-in-law had been sleeping in a bedroom. When he was out in the street a pair of his trousers were \nproduced and they were put on him by the police. He said he felt very embarrassed about being exposed in the \nstreet and having trousers put on him in front of people. He was very scared.\n\n [16] Thereafter he was taken to the airport. While he was waiting at the airport he heard that his wife was going to \nbe taken to the Townsville Hospital. He was worried about her pregnancy. She was seven months pregnant. After \narriving in Townsville he was taken to the Mundingburra Police Station where he was locked in a cell and after a \ntime questioned. He said he answered the questions and cooperated with the questioning. He was held in the \nwatchhouse after his interview from Saturday 27th November until Monday 29th when he first appeared before a \nmagistrate and was remanded in custody after bail was refused ...\n\n\n\n [17] ... He said that as a result of his experiences at the incidents and after he would never trust the police again \nand he said that it was very hard on him if he visited the mall at Palm Island. He no longer lives with ... the second \n[appellant] but lives by himself ...\n\n [20] Concerning his arrest he said that he was asleep when the police entered, he did not hear them say anything, \nthat he was thrown on the floor and that he had no clothes on the lower part of his body and that he was very \nscared. When it was suggested that no-one pointed a firearm at the back of his head he said:\u201cWell, I felt boots on \nme. A big boot on my head and on my back. I felt that. Weight was on me and I guess they do that and they hold \nguns on you, that\u2019s what they do. They wouldn\u2019t take guns in the house otherwise. They were looking for me and \nthere was no need for that. If they would\u2019ve knocked in a good way and said, \u2018[the first appellant] can you come \ndown to the police station\u2019; I would\u2019ve happily walked out and jumped in the police car ... I would\u2019ve walked out \nmyself\u201d[21] In re-examination he maintained that he saw that the police who entered the bedroom included SERT \nofficers and Darren Robinson and that some wore helmets and had guns. He did not see Darren Robinson holding \na gun and said that Robinson treated him \u201calright\u201d. He was \u201cpretty good\u201d.  The second account of what occurred \nrecorded in the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasons is the account of Ms Lenoy. That is in part because there was a \nchallenge to the trial judge\u2019s fact finding about her account, because the trial judge had rejected parts of her \naccount as unreliable (although honest). On appeal the Court of Appeal found the trial judge was in error to reject \nMs Lenoy\u2019s account as unreliable. The principal basis for the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion was that Ms Lenoy\u2019s \nevidence bore a \u201cstriking consistency\u201d with the uncontroversial and accepted evidence before the trial judge, and \nthe trial judge had not considered this point. There remained one factual issue outstanding even on the Court of \nAppeal\u2019s finding: whether the SERT officers pointed guns directly at Ms Lenoy. She did not give direct evidence this \noccurred, but even without that evidence the Court of Appeal had no difficulty in finding what had happened \nconstituted an assault on Ms Lenoy. Fraser JA also noted that it was not possible to make a positive finding that \npolice officers had not pointed their guns at her: at [76].  This is how the Court of Appeal recorded Ms Lenoy\u2019s \nprincipal evidence (including the contested aspect about whether she gave direct evidence SERT officers pointed \ntheir guns at her):[49] The second appellant gave evidence that in November 2004 she lived with the first appellant \nand their six children (aged between three and seven years) in a house on Palm Island. A relative and her two \nchildren were staying in the house at the time. The second appellant was then 29 years old and seven months \npregnant. Shortly before 6.00 am on 27 November 2004 she heard a noise from outside. The second appellant was \nthe only person awake in the house. She saw people on the verandah in black wearing black helmets and with a \nmask or goggles covering their eyes. They were carrying rifles. The second appellant was frightened. Some men \nwent around the house and some men came up onto the verandah. The second appellant also saw two police \nofficers who were not dressed in black. Someone shouted to her, \u201cGet away from the door\u201d. She replied, \u201cWait a \nminute, I\u2019ll open the door for youse\u201d. Someone told her to move away from the door. As she put her hand on the \ndoor knob to open it, the door flew open. She heard a big cracking noise and a lot of shouting. About five armed \nmen dressed in black and two police officers in plain clothes, one of whom she recognised as Darren Robinson, \nentered the house. The second appellant was upset and screaming. She asked the men what they were doing. The \nmen told her to shut up and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the suspect?\u201d. Two men ran into the kitchen pointing their guns \naround.\n\n [50] The following exchange occurred in the second appellant\u2019s evidence in chief:\u201cI think you said earlier - I think \nyou used a phrase something like, \u201cThey were waving their guns around?\u201d-- Yes, they was.\n\n Yes. And can you be - I know it happened quickly but can you be more precise about where the guns were being \npointed as they were being waved around?-- As they were walking and they're coming in the house really quick.\n\n Yes?-- And like when they were looking around like pointing it around the place.\u201d[51] The second appellant looked \ntowards other windows and saw a person at the window with a gun. Someone shouted at her to, \u201cShut up, shut up, \nshut up\u201d. The second appellant said that, \u201c[e]verybody was ... screaming and ... shouting at me ... [t]elling me to \nshut up. Somebody shouted at her, \u201cShut up. If you don\u2019t shut up, we\u2019re going to arrest you.\u201d The second appellant \ngave the following evidence:\u201c[T]hey wanted to know which room David was in, who was sleeping in which room, \n\n\n\nhow many was in there. ... I only got to the top of \u2013 just before the laundry where the top of the hallway. ... And they \ngot me to point out who was in which room.\u201dThe laundry adjoined bedrooms at the back of the house. The second \nappellant\u2019s evidence therefore conveyed that she had moved from the front of the house to a position near the back \nof the house from which the various bedroom doors were all visible.[52] The second appellant gave evidence that \npolice officers, \u201ctold me to go and sit down on the couch. Everybody was screaming. They was all shouting.\u201d One \nof the police officers told her \u201cto get down on the floor and lay down\u201d. She was also told to put her hands behind \nher head. The second appellant protested that she was seven months pregnant and could not lie on her stomach. \nShe appealed to Detective Robinson. He told other police officers that she was alright and to leave her alone. The \nsecond appellant was then told to sit on the floor. She replied that she could not. The second appellant was then \ntold to \u201csit on the couch and shut up\u201d. She complied. The second appellant gave evidence that one of the men \ndressed in black and holding a gun was standing on the side of the couch \u201c ... there where they made me sit down, I \ncouldn\u2019t move ... they told me to stay one place ... one was standing beside ... like, they were all over everywhere \nand a heap of them run down the hallway.\u201d She was frightened, in shock, crying, and shaking. Her children were \ncrying and screaming.  The way in which Ms Lenoy\u2019s will was overborne (for the purposes of making out her false \nimprisonment claim) is described by Fraser JA at [74]:The respondent made submissions which supported the trial \njudge\u2019s reasoning and conclusion. I accept the appellants\u2019 argument that evidence given by the second appellant \n(which was supported in material respects by the respondent\u2019s admissions and evidence adduced by it) did prove \nthat the second appellant submitted to the directions of the police and went to different parts of the house against \nher will. What happened after police entered the house must be understood in the context of the circumstances of \nthat entry. The reaction to the second appellant\u2019s offer to open the door was that armed police shouted at her to get \naway from the door, broke the door open, and a group of police dressed in black entered the appellants\u2019 house \nwaving and pointing their firearms and repeatedly shouting commands at the second appellant. This conduct was \ncalculated to have the shocking and frightening effect upon the second appellant of which she gave evidence. As \nthe second appellant said, and as is entirely unsurprising in the circumstances described in the evidence, the \nsecond appellant was frightened, in shock, crying, and shaking whilst her children, doubtless awoken by the noise, \nwere crying and screaming. The effect of the respondent\u2019s own admissions is that the police officers did not ask for \nthe second appellant\u2019s cooperation. They shouted \u201ccommands\u201d at the second appellant to lie on the floor and they \n\u201crequired\u201d her to go to different parts of the house. Consistently with those admissions, the second appellant\u2019s \nevidence was that, in the chaotic situation in which armed men were shouting at her, telling her to shut up, and \nthreatening to arrest her if she did not do so, the police \u201cgot me\u201d to identify the occupants of the rooms. Similarly, \nthe second appellant gave evidence that the police \u201cmade me sit down\u201d and that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t move\u201d. That \noccurred in the context of the manifestly threatening conduct of the police which had occurred and where the threat \nwas reinforced by a man standing at the side of the couch holding a firearm. The inference is readily drawn that the \nsecond appellant\u2019s will was entirely overborne and she felt compelled to obey the police commands and \nrequirements. That this was precisely what police intended is suggested both by their conduct and by the evidence \nof SERT Operative 2 that this was the standard procedure adopted that morning to \u201cshock and awe\u201d and its \nadoption was likely to ensure that those in the house were in fact \u201cshocked, frightened\u201d.  Fraser JA then concluded \nthat in his opinion the \u201cbetter view\u201d is that there was an assault on Ms Lenoy, and his Honour proceeded to explain \nwhy (at [76]):The second appellant\u2019s evidence of a group of armed men, dressed in black, breaking the front door \nand rushing into her home close to where she was standing and waving and pointing their guns around whilst \nshouting commands at her, and thereby shocking and frightening her as that conduct was intended to do, satisfies \nthe definition of an assault. That the police officers pointed their guns \u201cat her\u201d was only one aspect of the \nparticulars of the assault alleged in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim. Although I would not be prepared to find \nthat police officers pointed their firearms at the second appellant in the absence of direct evidence to that effect \nfrom the second appellant, in light of the evidence that it was standard procedure for SERT members to point a \nfirearm at any occupant found in the house there is no basis for a positive finding that it did not occur. In all other \nrespects the second appellant\u2019s evidence fell within the particulars and there was no objection to any of the second \nappellant\u2019s evidence on the ground that it went beyond the particulars. The second appellant\u2019s evidence established \nthe assault.  His Honour added at [77]:I would add that whether or not an assault was established would appear to \nhave no bearing upon the quantum of damages recoverable by the second appellant. The second appellant cannot \nbe compensated for having a firearm pointed directly at her because she did not prove that particular of her claim, \nbut even if she did not prove an assault she should be compensated for the threatening conduct of the police \nholding and waving firearms around in her presence. That is so because that conduct, and every other aspect of the \n\n\n\nconduct of the police in entering the house and detaining and removing the first appellant in the second appellant\u2019s \npresence, bore upon the nature, seriousness and impact upon the second appellant of her false imprisonment.  In \nthat part of his reasons dealing with quantum of damages, Fraser JA said that the \u201cvery great seriousness of the \nwrong\u201d was apparent from the evidence of police as well as lay witnesses. His Honour further described the police \nconduct as involving \u201cviolence and ... particularly distressing and humiliating circumstances\u201d.  What happened to Mr \nBulsey and Ms Lenoy was also described at various points in the reasons as involving (in relation to Mr Bulsey) a \n\u201chigh degree of force\u201d and \u201cgreat intimidation\u201d and (in relation to Ms Lenoy) \u201can extraordinarily traumatic \natmosphere\u201d and the \u201cvery real indignity\u201d of Ms Lenoy watching Mr Bulsey dragged away handcuffed and partially \ndressed. Atkinson J found that the treatment of both appellants \u201cbreached their most fundamental right ... to \npersonal liberty\u201d, and found they were not treated \u201cas one might expect in a civilised society governed by the rule of \nlaw\u201d. McMeekin J described how the appellants were treated as a \u201cstartling feature\u201d of the case and later used the \nword \u201cegregious\u201d in applying relevant authorities. His Honour also set out a description of his view of the \ncircumstances (at [127]):This was not a case of human fallibility. A deliberate decision was made to make a dawn \nraid on a citizen\u2019s home by armed, masked men and to treat those found within as one would dangerous criminals \nwith no regard whatever for their dignity or rights. The imprisonment continued for days. The hurt was great.  The \nreason I have spent some time setting out the evidence and findings on what occurred during the entry and search \nof Mr Bulsey\u2019s and Ms Lenoy\u2019s house is not to adopt those findings in this proceeding, but rather to indicate the \nnature of the evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal to fix the level of damages that it did.  The Court of Appeal \nincreased the damages payable to Mr Bulsey from $80,000 to $165,000. That sum included $5,000 for Mr Bulsey\u2019s \npsychological injury, assessed under the Civil Liability Regulation 2003(Qld), in respect of a 5 per cent impairment. \nExemplary damages were precluded by s 10.5(2) of the PSA Act. Aside from $5,000 for impairment, the sum of \n$165,000 comprised $60,000 for assault, battery and false imprisonment during the wrongful arrest and $100,000 \n(including aggravated damages) for false imprisonment after the wrongful arrest (that is, for the period 27 to 29 \nNovember 2004). The State was ordered to pay interest on that sum.  The damages payable to Ms Lenoy were \nincreased from $30,000 to $70,000, also with interest. The factors in the increase were Ms Lenoy\u2019s offer to open the \ndoor being rebuffed in a violent way, her being rendered helpless to assist her partner and having to witness the \nhumiliating way in which he was arrested, how frightened she was, and the fact that she was heavily pregnant.  The \ndescriptions given by the Justices of the Court of Appeal of what happened to Mr Bulsey and Ms Lenoy accord with \nmy own opinions of the character of the arrests, entries and searches and their effects on the men, women and \nchildren in the houses who gave evidence before me. In particular, for the purposes of making orders for \ncompensation under s 46PO(4), I find that the way the Court of Appeal described the experience of Ms Lenoy \nclosely mirrors my conclusions about what this experience was like for Ms Cecilia Wotton. I return to that below.  I \nturn now to Ibbett. In the early hours of one morning, Mrs Ibbett\u2019s son was pursued by two plain-clothed police \nofficers to her home, where her son was staying. Her son attempted to shut the officers out by lowering the roller \ndoor of the garage, but one officer managed to get underneath it. That officer attempted to arrest Mrs Ibbett\u2019s son, \nwith a gun drawn. Shouting between the men woke Mrs Ibbett, and she came into the garage, whereupon the \nofficer with the gun turned his gun on her. Mrs Ibbett had never seen a gun before and the trial judge described her \nas \u201cpetrified\u201d. Mrs Ibbett sued the two police officers and the State of New South Wales for assault and trespass. \nShe was awarded $25,000 for the assault (comprising $15,000 in general damages and $10,000 in exemplary \ndamages) and $50,000 for the trespass to land (comprising $10,000 in general damages, $20,000 in aggravated \ndamages and $20,000 in exemplary damages). The State appealed and Mrs Ibbett cross-appealed to the Court of \nAppeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on questions of damages. The Court of Appeal (Spigelman CJ \nand Basten JA, Ipp JA dissenting) dismissed the State\u2019s appeal and allowed Mrs Ibbett\u2019s cross-appeal in part, \nincreasing her damages for the assault to $10,000 for aggravated damages and $25,000 for exemplary damages. \nThe High Court dismissed the State\u2019s appeal from the Court of Appeal decision. I return to Ibbett below, because \nthe case is relevant to aggravated and exemplary damages, especially the latter, in circumstances where (as here) \nvicarious liability is made out.  In Beckett v New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 1017 from [672]-[696], Harrison J \nconducted, if I might say so with respect, a comprehensive and illuminating survey of previous decisions concerning \nmalicious prosecution and false imprisonment, and the awards that were given in those decisions. I have had \nregard to that survey in determining the appropriate amounts of compensation in this proceeding.  Although Bulsey, \nIbbett, Beckett, and the cases discussed in Beckett deal with tortious claims, there are two features of all these \ndecisions which I consider can inform the identification of an appropriate level of compensation under s 46PO(4) in \nthe present circumstances. First, they are cases dealing with the conduct of police officers or prosecutorial \n\n\n\nauthorities, or both. Second, they deal with compensation for interference with personal liberty and bodily integrity, \nwhich has some resonance with the contravening conduct in this case. The cases to which Harrison J referred (and \nBeckett itself) also consider aggravated and exemplary damages, and are useful from that perspective.  In Victoria \nv Horvath [2002] VSCA 177; 6 VR 326, the Victorian Court of Appeal said (at [15])[The trial judge] recognised, \nrightly, we think, that the violation of a person\u2019s house and privacy by forced entry is a significant infringement of \nrights which, other than in very unusual circumstances, constitutes a serious breach of the law. If such an act is \ncarried out by the police, his Honour considered, it should be done only where the seriousness of the situation \ndemands it and only after the most careful and reasoned consideration of all the circumstances.  I respectfully \nagree with those observations and consider they must be kept in mind when approaching the awards to be made in \nthis case.\n\nThe extent of the causal connection between Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest, his imprisonment and subsequent harm he \nsuffered  Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was, I have found, unlawful. Thus, his tasering was also unlawful: there was no lawful \njustification for the use of force on him. However in this proceeding he has no accrued cause of action for battery, \nassault, nor indeed for false imprisonment, on which (given the Bulsey decision) he is likely to have succeeded.  I \nhave also found his arrest and tasering by SERT officers contravened s 9 of the RDA. As I have set out earlier in \nthese reasons, the lawfulness or unlawfulness of conduct is not determinative of a contravention of s 9. In Mr \nWotton\u2019s case, if his arrest had been lawful under s 198(2) of the PPR Act then this would not have prevented it \nbeing a contravention of s 9 of the RDA. Its unlawfulness does engage the human rights in Arts 9 and 17 of the \nICCPR, and is relevant to s 9 in that respect. That said, if the arrest had been lawful, the approach to compensation \nunder s 46PO(4) might have been different. In my opinion, the answer to the causal question posed by subs (d) \nwould depend on whether the Court was satisfied Mr Wotton would have been arrested in any event, were it not for \nthe racial discrimination. An arrest on reasonable suspicion leaves room for choice by an officer and there may be \nany number of reasons why an officer may choose not to arrest a person she or he could lawfully arrest. If an officer \nchooses to arrest a person based on race, then a contravention of s 9 may occur, even if the arrest is lawful. The \ncompensation which may be payable under s 46PO(4)(d) may, on proof the officer would not otherwise have \narrested the person, include compensation for the consequences of the arrest, including deprivation of liberty.  That \nis not this case and I say no more about it. Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was unlawful, and therefore so was his tasering (just \nas the handcuffing and other treatment of Mr Bulsey was found by the Court of Appeal to be unlawful in Bulsey). In \nthe present case, the relevance of the unlawfulness is the engagement of the rights in Arts 9 and 17 of the ICCPR.  \nThe applicants did not submit that compensation should be paid to Mr Wotton for any events beyond his arrest and \ntransportation to Townsville. Accordingly, I propose to address the question of compensation for Mr Wotton in \nrelation to the circumstances of his arrest and tasering, and his handcuffing and shackling as he left the island. The \ncompensation is not ordered in relation to the fact of his arrest, but rather its circumstances. It is in these \ncircumstances that there was a contravention of s 9 of the RDA, by the use of SERT.\n\nMr Ralph\u2019s report  Mr Ralph produced a single psychological report for Mr Wotton, Mrs Agnes Wotton and Ms \nCecilia Wotton. He also interviewed Ms Schanara Bulsey. Mr Ralph\u2019s methodology was subject to criticism from Dr \nReddan (see [467] above]). Her criticism related to Mr Ralph producing what she described as a \u201cunitary\u201d report in \nrelation to all three applicants, to him interviewing Ms Bulsey, to the length of the three interviews, to Mr Ralph\u2019s \ndiagnosis of Ms Cecilia Wotton, and to the history he took from Ms Cecilia Wotton. Despite calling Dr Reddan and \nrelying on the criticisms she identified for the purposes of cross-examining Mr Ralph, in final submissions the \nrespondents made no criticism of Mr Ralph\u2019s report, or his evidence, based on the matters identified by Dr Reddan. \nI am satisfied that there is no substance in any of the criticisms made by Dr Reddan, and as I have found at [468] \nabove I am not inclined to give much weight to her evidence, for reasons I there set out.  Mr Ralph visited the Palm \nIsland community on 29 May 2015, and during this visit he conducted interviews with Mr Wotton, Mrs Agnes \nWotton and Ms Cecilia Wotton at the home of Mr Wotton. He also interviewed Ms Schanara Bulsey. In his second \naffidavit, he explained the reason for interviewing Ms Bulsey (whose surname was still \u201cWotton\u201d at the time):I \nconsidered that she has had significant and direct personal experience of the events of 2004 and what followed, \nincluding the experience of being cared for within her family prior to and after the arrest of Mr Wotton. The interview \nwith Ms Schanara Wotton was therefore able to add to my understanding of the effect of these events upon her \nfamily. In my opinion, based on my knowledge, training, and experience, Ms Schanara Wotton\u2019s comments add \nconsiderable weight to the comments provided by others in interview and her comments promote a better \n\n\n\nunderstanding of the issues involved.  I accept this explanation. It is persuasive in part because Ms Cecilia Wotton\u2019s \nevidence made it clear that her capacity to look after her family was affected by the impact the events of 27 \nNovember 2004 had on her.  I have referred to some shortcomings in Mr Ralph\u2019s report at [462] above. My view of \nthose shortcomings has meant that I do not accept all of his opinions about the impact of the events of 27 \nNovember 2004 on the three applicants. Nevertheless, I have afforded his opinion some weight and where I agree \nwith his conclusions I refer to the below. In general terms I accept the history he took from each applicant, and \naside from one issue concerning Ms Cecilia Wotton, the applicants were not cross-examined to suggest that they \nhad given inaccurate, incomplete or skewed histories to Mr Ralph.\n\nMr Lex Wotton  Based on the findings I have made, I am satisfied Mr Wotton suffered temporary physical harm from \nbeing tasered by A/S Kruger. I am satisfied he suffered significant fear and anxiety during the process of his arrest \nin front of his family, and had concerns for the wellbeing and safety of his family in a volatile situation when he and \nhis family were surrounded by a large number of heavily armed men. I am also satisfied that being arrested, \nespecially in the way he was, in front of his partner and children, was a humiliating experience for him, and that it \nwas humiliating for him to be handcuffed, shackled and removed from the island. I have found none of that \ntreatment was justified and I have set out the ways in which it contravened s 9 of the RDA. I am satisfied those \nmatters constitute loss and damage within the meaning of that phrase in s 46PO(4)(d) of the AHRC Act, and I am \nsatisfied that the loss and damage had the requisite causal connection with the contravening conduct of QPS \nofficers (namely those who organised, oversaw and instructed SERT officers to undertake the arrests, entries and \nsearches).  Mr Ralph set out the history given to him by Mr Wotton, which reflected a life lived almost entirely on \nPalm Island, but not without its low points and challenges. I do not propose to set out the contents of Mr Ralph\u2019s \nreport in detail, but it is fair to say that the history given by Mr Wotton and accepted by Mr Ralph (and not \nchallenged in this Court) shows Mr Wotton as a young man with serious alcohol and violence issues, which he \nworked hard to remedy. Contrary to some of the stereotypes about the Palm Islanders involved in the events of 19 \nto 29 November 2004, Mr Wotton reported to Mr Ralph, and gave evidence in this proceeding, that he had not \nconsumed alcohol for more than 20 years. Other significant changes related to his renewal, on a different footing, of \nhis relationship with Ms Cecilia Wotton, and his commitment to qualifying, and then forging a consistent \nemployment history, as a plumber. These matters of background are material to my assessment of compensation in \nthe sense that there is nothing in Mr Wotton\u2019s history to the point of the contravening conduct which needs to be \ntaken into account in assessing the impact on him of that conduct. In contrast, what happened to him after that \ndate, as a result of his arrest, imprisonment, conviction and bail conditions clearly have all contributed to the \nmaterial adverse effects on his psychological and emotional wellbeing on which Mr Ralph reported. Those events \nare without causal connection to the contravening conduct. The manner of Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was the subject \nmatter of a contravention of s 9, but it is highly probable that he would have been arrested in any event, with a \nwarrant and in more proportionate circumstances. The charges he faced, the prosecution\u2019s attitude to bail, the bail \nconditions, the long process of trial and sentence, the dislocation of his family in Townsville and their separation \nfrom him \u2013 none of these matters could be said to arise out of the contravening conduct. They arose as a result of \nhis own conduct on 26 November 2004, and the prosecutorial (and eventually judicial) view taken of that conduct.  I \naccept the respondents\u2019 submissions that although Mr Wotton reported to Mr Ralph he experienced high levels of \npsychological distress following his arrest, and had periods of depression, anxiety and chronic sleep problems up \nuntil his release from prison in 2010, Mr Ralph was could not reliably conclude that Mr Wotton suffers any form of \npsychopathology to the extent that he could be diagnosed as suffering from any condition as described in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V). Mr Ralph\u2019s opinion was that Mr \nWotton had responded with some significant stoicism to what happened to him and there were limited residual \npsychological effects apparent.  For example, Mr Ralph stated:Hence, through his personal resilience, insight and \nstrength, his religious beliefs, the support provided by family and community, and his active commitment to \ncommunity development, Mr Wotton has weathered the physical and emotional hardship and adversity arising from \nhis arrest in 2004 in a manner that has allowed him to remain a functional part of his community and to provide at \nleast adequately for his family.  He subsequently concluded:Although he has experienced very high levels of \npsychological distress his capacity to remain strong, resilient and adaptable, in the face of situations that would \notherwise be debilitating, has allowed him to respond to the adversity and hardship that he has faced with limited \nresidual psychological effects.  Mr Ralph\u2019s opinion is that Mr Wotton\u2019s risk of further emotional or psychological \nharm in the future is small.  In those opinions, Mr Ralph is referring to the entirety of the consequences for Mr \n\n\n\nWotton after his arrest, not simply the direct consequences of the contravening conduct. Mr Ralph\u2019s opinion as to \nthe likely cause of the disturbances he confirmed in Mr Wotton recognises that Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest was the \nbeginning, but only the beginning, of events which contributed to his psychological harm:Mr Wotton continues to \nexperience a degree of psychological distress in the form of anxiety that in my opinion is directly attributable to his \narrest in 2004 and the events that subsequently followed. The manner of his arrest, that caused extreme distress to \nhim and his family, as well the events that followed, including the requirement that he not return to Palm Island as a \ncondition of his bail, have contributed significantly to the psychological distress he has suffered. In the period from \nhis arrest until his conviction in 2008 he has also witnessed firsthand the police and government response to the \ndeath in custody, and has been deeply frustrated and distressed by the perceived injustice of the events that \nfollowed. The criticism of the police investigation into the death in custody by the State Coroner, the fact that no \none has been held accountable for the death, and that no disciplinary action has been taken against the police \nofficers involved in the investigation, are all matters that have added to his level of psychological distress and his \nperception that that the process has been discriminatory and unjust.\n\n(Footnote omitted.)    Mr Ralph\u2019s opinion is consistent with my own in relation to the humiliation and anxiety caused \nby the manner in which Mr Wotton was arrested in front of his family. Mr Wotton may have good capacity to mitigate \nthe effects of traumatic experiences, but that does not mean those effects have not been real. However, I \nrecognise, as Mr Ralph also has, that there were a number of more serious events which occurred after the arrest \ncontributing to Mr Wotton\u2019s impairments. When the duration and severity of the contravening conduct is compared \nwith what subsequently happened to Mr Wotton, it is clear that what subsequently happened to Mr Wotton was of \nmuch greater magnitude, and lasted over a period of many years.  Mr Ralph did not suggest any particular \nrehabilitation or treatment was required, given how Mr Wotton presented in 2015, although as Mr Ralph noted this \nwas in part because Mr Wotton was able to cope with the effects he was experiencing. Mr Ralph expected the \neffects on Mr Wotton would continue to diminish as time passed. Mr Ralph did not identify any real impairment to Mr \nWotton\u2019s daily life arising from his experiences, aside from ongoing sleeping and anxiety issues which, as I have \nfound, are more likely to be due to what happened to Mr Wotton after 27 November 2004 than what happened to \nhim on that day.  Mr Wotton knew police officers would come to arrest him on the morning of 27 November 2004. \nHis evidence was he told his family that was going to happen. He was resigned to being arrested. That said, there \nis no basis in the evidence to believe Mr Wotton knew more than 20 armed SERT and PSRT officers, and police \ndogs, would be coming to his house to arrest him. I find he did experience a degree of shock about the armed \npolice that arrived at his house to arrest him. I find he was afraid for his family, and for their safety if anything went \nwrong and firearms were discharged. He was afraid and worried for how his children would react to his arrest. He \nwas humiliated in front of his partner and children when he was tasered like a highly dangerous criminal and taken \naway.  This was Albert Wotton\u2019s evidence about what he saw:There were about four of them, two on each side. \nThey had to sort of lift him and carry him, because of the taser that had happened. And they put him in \u2013 I can\u2019t \nrecall if it was in the backseat or the \u2013 I\u2019m not too sure if you call it the cage or whatever it\u2019s called on the back of \nthe car.  This was Mr Wotton\u2019s evidence about what happened when he was tasered. I accept this evidence, \nincluding that he feared an officer would shoot one of his children. In the circumstances that was a natural and \nobvious fear for a father to have. And, in my opinion, there was a real risk that could have occurred .An officer said, \n\u201cGet down on your knees. Get down on your knees.\u201d And so in all of that I heard \u2013 I could hear my children crying, \nsinging out loud. And I said, \u201cStay inside. Don\u2019t worry. Stay inside.\u201d And at the same time there was this police \nofficer still singing out, \u201cGet down on your knees. Get down on your knees. Place your hands behind your back of \nyour head.\u201d But I was concerned for my children and my wife because my thoughts were if they walked or came \nout, someone would panic out of the police officers and shoot them. I turned towards them and I said, \u201cStay in \nthere. Don\u2019t worry. Stay in there.\u201d And as I turned back, I could see something like \u2013 it was so quick, like lightning, \nand I just remember being hit with something, and my thoughts were I was shot, and I thought, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s rubber \nbullet,\u201d because \u2013 because I was still standing, and then I could feel this current running through me, and then I \nknew it wasn\u2019t a bullet, so \u2013 because I could hear these orders to get down, and then I got down on my knees, and \nthe current started to \u2013 it was getting stronger and stronger. So when I got on my knees I actually fell forward, and \nwhile I was down there they said to put my hands behind my back, and I couldn\u2019t do it because of my shoulders. I \nhad the four reconstructions on my shoulder, and just a police officer \u2013 two grabbed me, one on each leg, at the \nback. Another had me round the neck, and I had my head turned to the side, and I had a barrel pointed in my head, \nand I felt another one in my back.\n\n\n\n Another one? You mean another gun?---Another gun, and I could actually see it, and a police officer leaned on top \nof me. He had his knee into my back, and they had me pinned down, and then when he did \u2013 when they had me \npinned down he got off. He pulled his knee off of my back, and then they grabbed me by the hands and forced my \nhands behind my back, and handcuffed me, and I was there for possibly a couple of minutes, and I could hear my \nfamily going off and I could hear \u2013 as I got up \u2013 they lifted me up. I was in a bit of pain, because of the shoulders \nand stuff, or they asked me to get up and I couldn\u2019t because of my balance, because of the shoulder. So they lifted \nme up, and one of the officers sang out, \u201cWhat about in the house?\u201d and Robinson said, \u201cYeah, go in,\u201d and \u2013 but at \nthe same time I could hear \u2013 before the orders was given, I could hear that they were already in the house. They \u2013 \nbecause I left the back door open. They must have went in through there. I could hear them, and I could hear they \nwere throwing things around in the house, and \u2013 and I could hear the kids screaming. I could hear them told to, \u201cGet \non the ground. Lie down.\u201d I \u2013 when Robinson gave that order I said, \u201cYou got all you want. There\u2019s no need to go \ninto the house. You got who you come to grab,\u201d and then they had torches shining on me, in my face. At the same \ntime I could see the red laser light before I was hit with the taser. They\u2019re shining in my face and \u2013 and I was trying \nto \u2013 trying to look \u2013 look around at the same time. I could see all of this stuff, and just trying to, I suppose, look away \nfrom the light, but at the same time you\u2019re trying to see who\u2019s who, and stuff. But I \u2013 I \u2013 there was a couple of \nofficers walked forward, and then one of them pulled out the prods \u2013 it looked like little darts, little round things \u2013 \nfrom my chest. There was a lead attached to it, and they put them in a Mount Franklin water bottle, and after that I \nsaid, \u201cCould I have some \u2013 could I have a shoe, please, and a \u2013 and a shirt?\u201d and Robinson said \u2013 I heard him. He \nwalked in \u2013 he ran into the house and he said, \u201cGet him a bloody shirt. Get him a shoe. Quick. Hurry up. Get it,\u201d and \nI could hear all the crying and thing, and Cecilia trying to do what she could do thing, and so they marched me over \ntowards the vehicle that was parked at our gate, and they opened up the back. It was a four wheel drive \u2013 I\u2019m not \nsure. I think it was \u2013 it looked like one of the ones I used to drive when I used to do our men\u2019s group thing, where I \nhave a vehicle. It was a Toyota wagon.  Mr Wotton went on to describe how, once he was placed in the helicopter \nwith some of the QPS officers, his legs were shackled. He also described how painful the handcuffs were, as they \ncut into his wrist. He asked for them to be loosened, and an officer told him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mate. I can\u2019t do anything \nabout that. You just have to, you know, stay like that\u201d. Which he did, all the way to the watchhouse in Townsville, \nwhere the handcuffs were removed.  Inspector McKay described how a taser in probe mode (as used on Mr \nWotton) worked, and what it did:So it can be used in \u2013 in \u2013 in two \u2013 and that\u2019s why I said there\u2019s two manners in \nwhich it can be used. One is in a probe \u2013 or two modes. One is in a probe mode, where the probes are fired from \nthe device from \u2013from compressed nitrogen. The darts fly out from the \u2013 the cartridge, and if two darts strike the \nperson, then the electrical current is complete and the person suffers involuntary muscular contractions and, \ndepending on the spread of the taser, it may call \u2013 cause the person to fall down. Where the spread is really quite \nsmall, it causes pain in that area but doesn\u2019t cause the involuntary contraction where you might see someone \ncompletely fall over as a result of the device being used.  Tasering is painful, as Mr Wotton, Inspector McKay and \nSuperintendent Kruger each testified. A person\u2019s body has small electric shocks sent through it. It is disturbing and \ndisorienting, as well as painful. Tasering compels submission, as it is intended to do. By temporarily disabling a \nperson, it puts the person at the mercy of the individuals who inflicted the taser on her or him. In Mr Wotton\u2019s case \nthis included DS Robinson, one of the very men Mr Wotton was holding accountable for what had happened to \nMulrunji and for the inadequate investigation into his death. Being forced into submissions and compliance by \npolice officers, who were the very people he had been protesting about, was additionally humiliating. That was, I \nfind, part of the aim of the QPS in using the SERT teams \u2013 to teach the residents, and it would seem in particular \nMr Wotton, a \u2018lesson\u2019, to engage in a show of force and a subjugation of the Aboriginal population.  Inspector \nMcKay and Superintendent Kruger both gave evidence about how SERT officer training involves officers \nthemselves being tasered. It was unclear what the purpose of this evidence was. If it was to diminish the \nseriousness of tasering a person, I reject any such suggestion. In any event there was no evidence before me, one \nway or the other, about the risks associated with being tasered, or the complications which might arise. I also have \nno evidence about the circumstances in which any of the officers who gave evidence were tasered and how closely \nthey resembled the circumstances in which Mr Wotton was tasered. It is an obvious inference, for example, that if it \nwas conducted during training any tasering of police officers would have been done with their informed consent, \nafter explanations to them about the effects and sensation of tasering, with appropriate medical care available if \nnecessary, and that the officers knew such care would have been available. Inspector McKay\u2019s evidence tended to \n\n\n\nconfirm that this was the case, in that he said the purpose of SERT officers being tasered in training was to ensure \nthey understood \u201cthe effects of that device\u201d and its \u201climitations\u201d. Therefore, an officer would first, have been fully \nprepared to be tasered, having had the effects and sensation explained to her or him, would be assured of medical \ncare if required and would not be expected to be handcuffed, taken away under armed guard and removed from her \nor his community to face custody and criminal charges. The bare fact of officers having experienced tasering as \npart of their training does not diminish in any way the view I have formed about the shock and harm suffered by Mr \nWotton when he was tasered in the circumstances he was.  I note here an incongruous piece of evidence given by \nMr Wotton during his narrative of how he was arrested and taken to the Palm Island airport. He said:Well, on the \nway to the airport the police officer was driving pretty fast and I knew \u2013 I didn\u2019t actually know his name but he was \nthere for about 12 months before. And he had a relationship with another police officer. And he was driving fast and \nI said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just slow down because you might end up killing us all?\u201d And some \u2013 as we got pretty \nclose to the airport, the second climb on your way to the airport, I could see Erica Kyle, the mayor at the time, \nwalking her dog. And one of the officers said, \u201cThere\u2019s number 2 target there.\u201d  The applicants sought to make \nsomething, by way of a conspiracy theory of some kind, of the fact that Mayor Kyle was initially a suspect, indeed a \nprime suspect with Mr Wotton, in relation to the fires and damage, but was never charged. There is no basis in the \nevidence for any findings about why she was not charged, and the evidence of Mr Wotton is not reproduced for that \npurpose. I refer to it because of the wholesale incongruity of the scene it portrays. There is Mr Wotton, having just \nbeen arrested before it was light by 14 heavily armed SERT officers, tasered, and carried off in handcuffs at high \nspeed to the airport. And there, in what I infer might have been something of a regular ritual for Ms Kyle, was the \nMayor taking her dog for a walk. There was no emergency on the island; there was no danger; no lives were at \nrisk. The mayor was taking her dog for an early morning walk. The juxtaposition of these two images illustrates in \nmy opinion how grossly disproportionate the actions of the QPS were in using SERT.  The applicants submitted the \nrespondents should be ordered to pay Mr Wotton $200,000 by way of compensation. This was the same figure they \nsubmitted should be paid to Mrs Agnes Wotton and to Ms Cecilia Wotton, despite quite different evidence, and \ndifferent contraventions, in respect of each of them. There was no real development of submissions about how this \nfigure was arrived at, save a belated reference to the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Bulsey, which the applicants \nseemed to suggest meant a six figure sum would be appropriate.  The respondents submitted that if the Court \nfound, against their submissions, there had been contraventions of s 9, then each of the first and third applicants \nshould receive the sum of $20,000, and the second applicant should not receive an amount of compensation \nbecause the relevant causal connection was absent. Again, no submissions were developed about why a figure of \n$20,000 was appropriate and nor were there any submissions about why it was appropriate that each of these two \napplicants should receive the same amount.  I do not accept the submissions of either party on quantum: both \nappeared arbitrarily selected, at contrasting ends of the spectrum. In my opinion an appropriate sum to compensate \nMr Wotton for the loss and damage he suffered as a result of being arrested, tasered and taken away as he was is \n$65,000. That sum is to compensate him for the physical shock and temporary pain of being tasered, the \nhumiliation he suffered in front of his family and partner, the fear and anxiety he experienced in relation to listening \nto the terrorised screams of his partner and children, and his justifiable fear about whether his family might be shot \nduring the entry and search. These consequences were real and significant, although temporary in nature. Given \nthe use of the SERT officers resulted in actual physical harm to Mr Wotton, albeit temporary, he should receive a \nsubstantial sum of compensation to reflect the law\u2019s protective attitude to personal and bodily integrity.  Unlike his \npartner, Mr Wotton has found ways to cope with the aftermath of these events, and his subsequent incarceration \nand separation from his family, without long term ill effects to clinical levels. That is not to suggest he has suffered \nno ill effects \u2013 far from it. However, in my opinion the longer term effects he has suffered are more likely due to \nwhat happened to him after he was flown out of Palm Island on 27 November 2004, rather than the effects of the \nconduct constituting a contravention of s 9.  Mr Wotton should also receive compensation for the entry and search \nof his home. Although he was arrested on the verandah out the front of his home, and was not one of the people \nterrified and disturbed by the entry of search officers into his home, nevertheless it was his home. His privacy was \nunlawfully invaded. The safety and security that he was entitled to in his own home was violated. He had to endure \nwatching, and knowing, that the safety and security his partner and children also associated with their home had \nbeen violated. He was powerless to help them, comfort them, or be with them as they sought to recover from what \nhappened. I propose to order the State pay him $30,000 compensation for the violation of his privacy and home.\n\n\n\nMrs Agnes Wotton  Barely any submissions were made about the basis on which the respondents should be \nordered to pay compensation to Mrs Agnes Wotton. The extent of the applicants\u2019 submissions was:Mrs Agnes \nWotton has continued to suffer and \u201cthe experience of the emotional upheaval and trauma associated with the riot \nand its aftermath remained firmly imprinted upon her\u201d.  This was a quotation from Mr Ralph\u2019s report.  Mrs Wotton \nwas not at her house when the SERT officers entered and searched the house looking for Richard Poynter. She \nspent some time in her evidence discussing the events leading up to the protests and fires, and was present when \nthe fires were started. It was clear the entire sequence of events from 26 November 2004 onwards was distressing \nfor her. It is clear she had a sense of outrage that SS Hurley had not been charged with any offence and had stayed \non the island.  Mrs Wotton was at her house when a number of police officers came by a few days later (her \nevidence was not clear about exactly when) and told her and her daughter Fleur that they had to go and make a \nstatement. In fact, both were charged with offences. Mrs Wotton identified DS Robinson as one of the officers who \ncame to her house, and after some suggestions in cross-examination, identified another officer. She then described \nhow she and her daughter had to go to Townsville and stay there for a number of weeks, going to court each day. \nDuring this time they were not allowed to return to Palm Island for Mulrunji\u2019s funeral. I accept Mrs Wotton\u2019s \nevidence that she was distressed at not being able to do so. Neither the manner in which she was charged and \ndealt with in Townsville, nor her inability to return to Mulrunji\u2019s funeral, are the subject of any allegations in the third \nfurther amended statement of claim and I need not consider them further.  As Mr Ralph\u2019s report noted, Mrs Wotton \nhas been an active leader of her community, and has been much involved in local and regional politics and \ncommunity activities. Mrs Wotton gave evidence about being elected to the Palm Island Council and was also as a \nmember of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In the video evidence she is one of the people \nwho is interviewed, expressing her frustration and sense of injustice at SS Hurley remaining on the island and not \nbeing charged. She can also be seen at many of the meetings.  Mr Ralph describes Mrs Wotton\u2019s account to him in \nthe following terms:Ms Wotton described the events surrounding the arrest of Mr Wotton and those that followed as \ndeeply distressing for all involved. She described it as a time of community upheaval with many people distressed \nand traumatized by the death in police custody of Mulrunji and the events that followed, particularly the response of \nthe police in investigating the death and their response following the riot.  Both in Mr Ralph\u2019s report and in her oral \nevidence, Mrs Wotton spoke about the effect Mr Lex Wotton\u2019s arrest and incarceration had on her, and what she \nobserved to be the effect on Ms Cecilia Wotton and the Wotton children. She also described, both to Mr Ralph and \nin her evidence, how stressful it was having to stay in Townsville and to go through the court proceedings. She was \nalso clearly worried about her son. However none of these events are identified as contraventions of s 9 in the \nstatement of claim.  Mrs Wotton was not asked any questions about the impact of having her house entered and \nsearched by SERT officers. It was, as I have found, a breach of her privacy right as expressed in Art 17 of the \nICCPR, but there is no substantive evidence before me about the effect, if any, the entry and search had on Mrs \nWotton.  I do not consider there is any basis in the evidence to make an order for compensation to Mrs Wotton for \nany loss or damage suffered by her in terms of injury to her feelings because of the arrests, entries and searches of \nthe houses. As I have found, Krysten Harvey, who was present at Mrs Wotton\u2019s house, was terrified and damaged \nby the entry and search, but in these reasons I am not currently assessing compensation under s 46PO(4)(d) for Ms \nHarvey. The same is true of Mr Morton, who was the (then) nine-year-old boy playing outside Mrs Wotton\u2019s house.  \nHowever, Mrs Wotton\u2019s house was entered and searched in a way which I have found contravened s 9 of the RDA. \nThe privacy and security of her family home was violated. The fact of that violation of her property and her house is \nin my opinion damage within the terms of s 46PO(4)(d) and she should receive a modest amount of compensation. \nIn my opinion an appropriate amount is $10,000.\n\nMs Cecilia Wotton  Ms Cecilia Wotton gave evidence in this proceeding, but she was a reluctant witness. I say that \nnot to suggest she was anything but truthful and genuine: rather, that the prospect and necessity for her to relive \nthe events of 27 November 2004, their aftermath and effects on her and her family, was obviously the last thing she \nwanted to do. She is, I find, a private person, who prefers \u2013 despite her clear sense of grievance and injustice about \nwhat has happened to her, her family and her community \u2013 to remain out of the spotlight. In that sense, the way she \npresented as a witness was consistent with the content of her evidence.  There were some aspects of Ms Wotton\u2019s \nlife history and experiences which were relevant to the assessment of her psychological condition. Leave was \nsought that she not be examined about those matters on Palm Island: that is, in her local community. The \nrespondents had no objection to those aspects of her evidence being given in Townsville, which is what occurred. \nIn Townsville, applications were made for either closed court or non-publication orders concerning parts of her \n\n\n\nevidence. I refused those applications, giving ex tempore reasons for doing so. In short I held that, having regard to \nthe importance of the principle of open justice, I was not satisfied that Ms Wotton\u2019s evidence should be given other \nthan in open court, particularly as this proceeding involves matters of public interest.  As it turned out, her public \nevidence was able to be given without direct references to those matters, with both parties dealing sensitively with \nthe relevant issues. For similar reasons, I do not propose to set out those matters in detail in these reasons. The \nrespondents did not contest the reliability or genuineness of her accounts, or of the history given to Mr Ralph. What \nthey did put in issue, properly, was the effect these matters may have on any causal link between the events of 27 \nNovember 2004 and Ms Wotton\u2019s somewhat fragile psychological state.  The following summary is taken from both \nMr Ralph\u2019s report and Ms Wotton\u2019s oral evidence. Cecilia Wotton has lived on Palm Island all her life. Her own \nancestors, the Sibleys, are a well-known Palm Island family. Her paternal great uncle was Sonny Sibley, a leading \nfigure in the 1957 strike on Palm Island. She has been in a relationship with Mr Wotton for approximately 20 years, \nalthough they had been partners earlier in life for some time. The first relationship began when Ms Wotton was very \nyoung and ended, it is fair to say, due to Mr Wotton\u2019s violence towards her and his alcoholism \u2013 behaviours he set \nabout, and was successful in, remedying. Ms Wotton\u2019s brother is David Bulsey.  Mr and Ms Wotton had five children \nliving with them on 27 November 2004: Schanara (Bulsey, who was a witness in this proceeding), Billo, Albert \n(Wotton, who was also a witness), Robert (Bulsey, who I infer may be Ms Wotton\u2019s brother) and Nazine. Schanara \nwas 15, Billo was 14, Albert and Robert were both 12, and Nazine was 8. Nazine has a hearing disability, and some \nconsequential learning difficulties.  Ms Wotton knew Mulrunji, having lived in the same street as him when they \nwere children, when Ms Wotton was living with her sister. Mulrunji\u2019s elder sister, Claudelle, lived with Ms Wotton\u2019s \nfamily for some time. This evidence is a good example of the level of interconnectedness and extended family \nresponsibilities which exist between families on Palm Island, all of which should have been well understood by \nQPS officers. These relationships, connecting people not only within extended family groups but between extended \nfamily groups, mean that the death of a single person has real effects throughout the entire community.  Ms Wotton \nhas had a steady working life in various capacities on Palm Island. At the time of giving her evidence she was \nworking as a cleaner at the Joyce Palmer Health Service on Palm Island, which is otherwise referred to in these \nreasons as the hospital. She had been there for seven years, and prior to that she had been working at the Katana \nWomen\u2019s Centre on the island.  Ms Wotton described being at home after the protests and fires on 26 November \n2004, watching the news, and watching all the footage of Lex, including the television reports identifying him as a \nringleader. She described how Mr Wotton told her he was likely to be arrested:And did he say anything to you \nthen?---He just said, \u201cThey probably, you know, come and take me.\u201d\n\n And what did you say to him?---I just broke down and cried.\n\n And were some of the children there then?---Yes, they were there. They ended up just going in the room.\n\n So they were part of this conversation?---Yes.\n\n And what were they doing?---Well, they was upset.\n\n And then what happened?---We went to \u2013 watched some news and went to sleep, went to bed until that \u2013 what \nhappened around 5 that morning.  The next morning, at 5 am, Ms Wotton was in bed with her husband. He woke up \nand said \u201cthey\u2019re going to take me\u201d, and she jumped out of bed and looked out the window to see vehicles arriving \nat her house. She described seeing \u201call the cars coming down to the dirt road to the house where we were staying, \nabout 10 cars\u201d. She then saw police with helmets, dressed in black clothing, guns, shields and dogs. She saw them \nout on the verandah with her husband, and she then walked out of her bedroom. She gave the following description \nof what then happened:My brother came out from the front room, and he was screaming, said they shot Lex, and as \nI ran down the hallway Detective Robinson shined a torch in my face. The kids were behind me, and he told me to \nget the fucking hell inside and lay down, and I lie down on the bed with my daughter who couldn\u2019t hear anything. My \nbrother got down on the floor. Schanara was with the door.\n\n\n\n So you lay on the bed with Nazine, and that\u2019s why you say she couldn\u2019t hear anything?---She couldn\u2019t.\n\n She didn\u2019t know what was happening?---No.\n\n And could you \u2013 while you were lying on the bed, what could you see?---The policeman had his gun to my \ndaughter\u2019s head.  I infer that Robert Bulsey had seen, or perhaps seen and heard, Mr Wotton being tasered and \nmistook it for him being shot.  Ms Wotton then described what the SERT officers did inside the house (ellipses in \noriginal, signifying pauses rather than words removed):Did any of the policemen say anything to you when you were \nin the bedroom?---No. There was one on that side with that window on that side standing there with the gun, just \nthe side my daughter was laying, Nazine.\n\n So that was outside the window?---No. The bed inside. There\u2019s a window on that side and a window this side on \nthe veranda. About six or seven of them run in the house. They tipped everything upside down and Schanara ..... \nWhat they was looking for. And Detective Robinson asked me to grab a pair of ..... And a ..... For Lex, and I got up.\n\n And you knew it was Detective Robinson?---Yes, I know him. That was him.\n\n How did you know him? You had met him before this day?---Yes.\n\n And then what happened? You were asked to get shoes and a shirt for Lex?---I got up and I grabbed a pair of blue \nsinglets and joggers, and gave it to - - -\n\n You gave it to the police officer or to Lex?---To the police officer.\n\n And did you go outside and see Lex?---No. I was too scared. I was shaking, crying.\n\n And how many of your family were in the room at that time?---In my room? Me and Nazine on the bed, and my \nbrother on the floor and Schanara was with the door.\n\n And could you speak to the other boys?---No. They were in the front room. Two police had them in the front room.  \nI repeat that Nazine was 8 years old.  Ms Wotton estimated the SERT officers were in the house for 10 to 20 \nminutes. In my opinion, it was unlikely the officers were in the house for 20 minutes, but I accept it is likely they \nwere in the house for approximately 10 minutes. Ms Wotton saw the vehicles drive away from her house, with her \nhusband. She then watched the SERT officers go across the main road to another house, where she saw them \nsmash down the front door, and heard them yelling at people. This was the Clay house.  Ms Wotton went down to \nthe school, which was the police command centre, about 9 am that morning, looking for her husband. It would have \ntaken some considerable courage in the circumstances for Ms Wotton to go the police command centre, given \nwhat she had been through at her home a few hours earlier. She was met by some police, who were not local \npolice. She asked if Lex was there and they told her he was not. They did not tell her he had been taken to \nTownsville. Ms Wotton called Mayor Kyle for help. Mayor Kyle went down to the command centre but was not \nallowed in. Eventually, that night, some Indigenous people at the Townsville watchhouse called Ms Wotton and told \nher Lex was there. Ms Wotton called them the \u201ccell watch mob\u201d and I infer they may have been ATSILS \nrepresentatives.  That afternoon, DS Robinson paid Ms Wotton and her children a visit. Ms Wotton was not \nchallenged on her account of what DS Robinson said, and DS Robinson was not called as a witness. I accept Ms \nWotton\u2019s account, and it reflects poorly indeed on DS Robinson.Okay? Do you recall later in the morning, when you \nwere back home?---That Saturday afternoon when I \u2013 me and the kids were on our verandah. Detective Darren \nRobinson came down. He came on the verandah and he said to the kids, \u201cCome here and sit down. I need to talk to \nyou about your father. What did your father do? Do you know what he did?\u201d And I said to Detective Robinson, \u201cI \ndon\u2019t think you should be asking these kids that question. They\u2019re only kids.\u201d Told them to go back inside, and he \n\n\n\nasked me, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer you till I get legal advice.\u201d So he went, but he came there that \nafternoon and parked in front of the house, and he went like that to me. That must have been about 4.30 that \nafternoon, and when I went out he said, \u201cYou have to come to the school,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d and he said, \n\u201cThey\u2019re doing some counselling there.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m right.\u201d He went, and he came back a second time, \nbut I didn\u2019t go out.\n\n And after he left the first time, what did you do?---I was just sitting there on the verandah. I didn\u2019t move.\n\n And what were the kids doing?---They was inside, watching TV.\n\n How were they?---They was very upset.\n\n Who was there at the time? Do you remember?---All the children.\n\n And what were they saying to you?---They was keep asking where their father was.\n\n And did they say anything about Mr Robinson?---No.  There are various descriptions which could be applied to DS \nRobinson\u2019s conduct. Harassment is one. Improper attempts to have a man\u2019s children provide evidence against their \nfather is another. Even if one takes a benign view of what appeared to be an offer of \u201ccounselling\u201d, it is difficult to \naccept it was a genuine offer, especially given it was said to be occurring at the police command centre. Ms Wotton \nwould have been entitled to see it as a ruse to lure her to the police command centre for further questioning, or to \nbe arrested. I am inclined to view it as DS Robinson laying the groundwork for what proved to be a successful \nreconstruction of events to make QPS officers look as if they cared about the needs of the local community when, in \nmy opinion, they plainly did not. While this event is not relied on by the applicants as a contravention of s 9 (and I \nam not suggesting it should have been, given my earlier comments about the inappropriateness of excessive \ndissection of police conduct), I am satisfied it is probative of the sense of impunity I have found QPS officers felt \nduring these days on Palm Island. Out of sight in a remote community, dealing with people with no immediate \naccess to legal or other advice, in a community that had just experienced an incredible show of force by the \nauthorities, DS Robinson had no compunction about seeking to extract incriminating evidence from children about \ntheir father. There was, after all, no-one to pull him up about that. I am satisfied DS Robinson\u2019s conduct in returning \nto the Wotton house, asking such inappropriate questions, caused additional anxiety, stress and harm to Ms \nWotton.  Ms Wotton described what she did the next day:Yes, I went that Sunday on the ferry with the kids. Some \npeople paid for accommodations for us, and meals, because I had no money on me. I just went over like that, me \nand the kids.  As I have noted, there were Lifeline counsellors waiting in Townsville for the non-Aboriginal people \ncoming across on the ferry from Palm Island on the evening of 26 November 2004. There were no Lifeline \ncounsellors waiting for Ms Wotton and her children when they took the same trip two days later, although what they \nhad been through was in reality something that cried out for such services. The double standard is obvious.  Ms \nWotton was not allowed to see her husband until the following Tuesday. He was granted bail after a week, but had \nto stay in Townsville. Therefore, as she described, the whole family had to \u201cpack up\u201d and stay in Townsville. The \nchildren all had to go to new schools. The family had to live off Centrelink payments, as Mr Wotton had been the \nprincipal earner, and Ms Wotton\u2019s work was on Palm Island. The slow progress of Mr Wotton\u2019s criminal prosecution \nmeant the family lived like this for years. Ms Wotton described the time as \u201chard\u201d, which was typical of the \nunderstated way in which she gave her evidence. Whether the considerable broader human impact on families was \nconsidered when bail conditions of this kind were set, I was not told.  Ms Wotton described how she eventually \nmoved back to Palm Island with the children because life was too hard in Townsville and she was becoming \nsuicidal. She said it was easier once she was back on Palm Island. Given that is her lifelong community, that is \nunderstandable. She started work at the hospital, shift work, but was given weekends off so she and the children \ncould take the ferry to Townsville to visit Mr Wotton. The ferry takes approximately two hours each way. It is not \nnecessary to go into any further detail at this point about the serious difficulties Ms Wotton and her family faced \nduring Mr Wotton\u2019s incarceration.  Mr Ralph and Dr Reddan disagreed about the correct label to place on the \n\n\n\ndiagnosis of the psychological condition suffered by Ms Wotton. Dr Reddan did not dispute, in substance, that Mr \nRalph was correct to diagnose Ms Wotton as suffering from a psychological condition; rather she disagreed with the \ndiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Further, Mr Ralph\u2019s description of the symptoms experienced by Ms \nWotton was not challenged:These symptoms include recurrent depressed mood, suicidal ideation, intrusive \nthoughts, and chronic anxiety as evidenced by a fear of being alone and recurrent nightmares. She presented as \nsuffering from guilt and low self-esteem as a result of her difficulties in caring for her children, in circumstances \nwhere she has been burdened by a level of psychological distress that has significantly undermined her capacity to \nparent her children.  Mr Ralph also interviewed Ms Schanara Bulsey, who described her mother as \u201cstill stressed, \ntired and emotional\u201d and as \u201cstruggling\u201d at times. In the years following the arrest and during her father\u2019s \nimprisonment, Ms Bulsey had described her mother to Mr Ralph as not coping and as struggling with the basic \ntasks of providing physically and emotionally for Ms Bulsey and her siblings. These descriptions are consistent with \nthe impressions I have formed about Ms Wotton, although in my opinion she works hard to conceal the extent of her \nstruggles, and she has at all times determined to continue to care for and support her husband and family to the \nbest of her ability.  Ms Wotton is a religious woman and in her evidence she described how her Christian faith has \nsupported her through these issues. I accept that evidence.  Ms Wotton was cross-examined about a number of \nother tragedies which may have affected her, such as the suicide of Patrick Bramwell in 2007 (the young man who \nwas in the police van and cell with Mulrunji) and the suicide of Mulrunji\u2019s son. She was asked whether these events \nhad a greater effect on her than the events of 27 November 2004. She was adamant the events of 27 November \n2004 had a greater effect.  I accept her evidence. There is no doubt that a long and tragic series of events have \nplayed out on Palm Island since November 2004, which could be said to have some connections to Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath, the protests and fires, and the police response. Ms Wotton was very clear about what she feels has had the \nmost impact on her and since I consider her to be a sincere and genuine witness, I accept that what happened at \nher house on the morning of 27 November 2004 has had significant and lasting effects for her. That is not to say the \ntremendous challenges and life changes that followed Mr Wotton\u2019s arrest and imprisonment should be \ndisproportionately discounted or ignored. However, what happened on 27 November 2004 remains, in my opinion, \na significant cause of Ms Wotton\u2019s longer term psychological difficulties.  There were also other events in her life, to \nwhich no public reference need be made, that have obviously been highly distressing on a long term basis for her. \nIn other words, it is true that Ms Wotton has suffered throughout her life with several tragedies and they have all \ntaken a long term and serious toll. It is, as the respondents submitted, important but difficult to try to separate out \nthe harm suffered by Ms Wotton which can be said to be \u201cbecause of\u201d the events of 27 November 2004.  Looking at \nall the evidence, in my opinion two matters are clear. First, there were short term and particularly acute effects on \nMs Wotton from the entry and search and the way her husband was tasered and arrested. I find she was truly \nterrified during those events. She was told by Robert Bulsey that Lex had been shot and I accept at the time she \nwas likely to have thought that to be the case, at least temporarily. Her children were screaming and petrified about \nwhat was happening to them, with armed men in their house yelling at them and pointing guns at them. Ms Wotton \nwatched a gun being pointed at her nine-year-old daughter. In that moment, I have no doubt there was a real fear \nthat one or more of her children might be shot. That fear might be said not to have an objective foundation when \none listens to the evidence of the SERT officers, but that is, for the present exercise, beside the point. Any mother \nwatching several men, dressed as the SERT officers were, barging into her house and yelling and searching the \nhouse, would be entitled to fear that if a gun was pointed at her children, it might go off. That is not something any \nparent should have to experience, especially without real cause, as I have found is the case in relation to this \nconduct. She saw her husband taken away and then another house entered and searched across the road, with \nviolence. Her husband was at that time with the officers who were committing that property damage and she was \nrightfully fearful of how he might be treated. She was later turned away from the police command centre at the \nschool and given no information about his safety or whereabouts. All she could do, as she did, was gather up her \nfamily and head to Townsville the next day to try to see her husband. In my opinion, the deep fear, shock, distress \nand anxiety Ms Wotton suffered over the course of the day on 27 November 2004, and for several days thereafter, \nwere because of the contravening conduct of the officers I have identified in [1516] above as those responsible for \nthe decision to employ SERT to effect the arrests, entries and searches.  The second matter is that there has \nplainly been a longer term effect on Ms Wotton from the SERT operations. I am satisfied that the terror she felt \nduring the operations returns from time to time. She and her family still live in the same house. She has nightmares \nrelated to those events. She feels deeply the way her children\u2019s lives have been affected by the conduct of the QPS \nthat day. She has been a witness to the terror and lasting impact on Schanara and Albert, which they displayed in \n\n\n\ntheir evidence as I have discussed earlier in these reasons. The Court saw those effects for a short period of time \non one day, but Ms Wotton has to live with her children having those effects. No party developed any submissions \nabout how to quarantine this suffering from the effects of other events in Ms Wotton\u2019s life and the Court received \nlittle assistance from the parties on this issue generally, consistently with other damages issues. Doing the best I \ncan, I find there has been a material long-term effect on Ms Wotton from the SERT operation at her house and its \nimmediate aftermath, but it is not the principal cause of her ongoing psychological and emotional issues. Greater in \nproportion are some of the challenges and tragedies in her early life, and then the much longer term experiences \nshe had while Mr Wotton was being prosecuted, and then after he was convicted and sentenced.  For both the \nshort term and longer term effects of the contravening conduct on 27 November 2004 I consider Ms Wotton should \nbe compensated with an award of $85,000. This figure appropriately reflects my finding that she continues to live \nwith the terror she experienced during those events, and to have to deal with her children\u2019s ongoing suffering \nbecause of them. It also reflects my judgment that she suffered a more prolonged and serious impact from the \nSERT operations than her partner.  Ms Wotton also suffered the violation of her home and her privacy, in a way \nwhich I have found to be unnecessary and disproportionate. It involved assaults and violence. She still lives in the \nsame house and I am satisfied she will never feel completely safe in her home again. For that violation of the \nprivacy, safety and security of her family home she should be compensated in the sum of $30,000.\n\nCompensation for property damage  None of the three applicants make any claim for property damage. The \nevidence discloses some of the other subgroup members had their houses damaged. They are entitled in my \nopinion to recover compensation for any property damage. Compensation may also be available under s 46 of the \nPSP Act, although no party drew the Court\u2019s attention to this provision.\n\nAn argument not put  It is of sufficient importance that I consider I should note that the respondents did not put any \nargument to the effect that Mr Wotton, or any of the other subgroup members who were arrested, unlawfully and in \ncontravention of s 9 as I have found, would have been arrested in any event in the days after 26 November 2004 \nand that any compensation or other damages payable to them should be reduced accordingly: see R (Lumba) v \nSecretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2012] 1 AC 245 and R (Kambadzi) v Secretary of \nState for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 23; [2011] 1 WLR 1299, and the adoption of that approach by a Full \nCourt of this Court in Fernando v Commonwealth [2014] FCAFC 181; 231 FCR 251 at [76], [81]-[89] (Besanko and \nRobertson JJ) and at [166] (Barker J).\n\nAggravated damages claim    The applicants rely on Lockhart J\u2019s reasons in Hall v Sheiban at 239-40 for the \nproposition that aggravated damages can be awarded under s 46PO(4) because they are compensatory in nature. \nAs I have noted at [1777] below, on present authorities, the power under s 46PO(4) has been construed as \nauthorising awards which are in the nature of compensation, rather than those which are punitive.  The respondents \ndid not expressly dispute that aggravated damages were an available form of compensation under s 46PO(4): that \nis, they did not submit there was no power to make such an order. Rather, they made two submissions: first, that \nthe applicants\u2019 submissions departed from their pleaded case on aggravated damages; and second, that the factors \nidentified by the applicants as aggravating the applicants\u2019 damages could not properly be characterised in that way \nbecause of the absence of sufficient connection between them.  At Part M of the third further amended statement of \nclaim the applicants set out what they claim is the conduct of the QPS that aggravated the loss and damage \nsuffered by the applicants. That conduct is identified as:(a) Inquest  In September 2006, Acting State Coroner \nChristine Clements delivered the results of an inquest into the death of Mulrunji, finding that SS Hurley had caused \nthe death of Mulrunji, and calling SS Hurley\u2019s treatment of Mulrunji \u201ccallous and deficient\u201d and his arrest \u201ccompletely \nunjustified\u201d.  On 19 December 2006, in response to the Acting State Coroner\u2019s comments, the Commissioner of \nPolice formed an Investigation Review Team (IRT) to examine in detail any criticisms of the QPS and its members \narising from the Inquest and the Acting State Coroner\u2019s findings. The Commissioner also requested the CMC to \nreview the internal investigation.  The IRT conducted a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of members of the \nQPS, pursuant to section 18 of the HRMM [the QPS Human Resource Management Manual].  In November 2008 \nthe IRT delivered the three-volume report of its internal investigation, entitled Palm Island Review, to the CMC.(b) \nFailure to discipline QPS officers  Between 19 November 2004 and the time these proceedings were commenced:     \nno member of the QPS faced any disciplinary action over the events the subject of this claim;   no member of the \nQPS was charged with criminal proceedings in relation to Mulrunji\u2019s death or the subsequent investigation, except \nfor SS Hurley; and        DS Robinson was awarded the top police bravery medal, the Queensland Police Valour \nAward, for his actions on Palm Island on 26 to 29 2004; and        SS Hurley was promoted to Acting Inspector.      \n\n\n\nThe First and Second Applicants and eighteen Group Members were charged with various offences almost \nimmediately after 26 November 2004.  SS Hurley was not charged with an offence until 5 February 2007. The \nSecond Applicant had had the charges against her abandoned at that time, and all Group Members who faced \ncharges had already either faced trial or had the charges against them abandoned by that time.  In about June \n2010, the CMC handed down a report entitled \u201cCMC Review of the Queensland Police Service\u2019s Palm Island \nReview\u201d, which recommended that the QPS commence disciplinary proceedings for misconduct, in relation to their \nconduct on Palm Island in November 2004, against each of:a. DI Webber;\n\n b. DSS Kitching;\n\n c. DS Robinson; and\n\n d. Inspector Williams.  The QPS did not commence disciplinary proceedings against any of those officers.  The \nQPS has not, at any time, commenced an investigation into, or implemented disciplinary proceedings in respect of, \nthe actions of any of the QPS officers involved in the Further Failures. Rather, DS Robinson was awarded the top \npolice bravery medal, the Queensland Police Valour Award, for his actions during that period, and a number of \nother QPS officers were recommended for commendation for their actions during that period.Particulars\n\n Document 351.  In about August 2011, pursuant to the IRT\u2019s recommendations, the QPS issued \u2018Managerial \nGuidance\u2019 to each of Inspector Williams, DI Webber, and DSS Kitching. The fact of those officers receiving \nmanagerial guidance was not made known to the public or to persons who had complained about the conduct of \nthose officers in the course of the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s death, because Senior Sergeant Michael Bond of the \nLegal and Policy Unit of the QPS Ethical Standards Command was of the view that such advice may be viewed as \n\u201csomewhat antagonistic\u201d given the notoriety of the relevant events.Particulars\n\n Documents 370 and 372.  Aggravated damages were described by Lord Diplock in Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome \n[1972] UKHL 3; [1972] AC 1027 at 1124 (citing with approval the description given by Lord Devlin in Rookes v \nBarnard [1964] UKHL 1;[1964] AC 1129) as \u201c[a]dditional compensation for the injured feelings of the plaintiff where \nhis sense of injury resulting from the wrongful physical act is justifiably heightened by the manner in which or the \nmotive for which the defendant did it.\u201d That formulation was applied with approval by Clarke JA in the New South \nWales Court of Appeal in Spautz v Butterworth [1996] NSWSC 614; 41 NSWLR 1 at 15-18, although it should be \nnoted that the High Court has acknowledged criticism of Rookes v Barnard on other issues, notably that case\u2019s \napproach to exemplary damages: see Gray v Motor Accident Commission [1998] HCA 70;196 CLR 1 at [18]- [19] \n(Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) and the authorities there cited, especially Uren v John Fairfax & \nSons Pty Ltd [1966] HCA 40; 117 CLR 118.  Another description of the function of aggravated damages was given \nby Windeyer J in Uren at 149, where his Honour said that aggravated damages \u201ccompensate the plaintiff where the \nharm done to him by a wrongful act was aggravated by the manner in which the act was done\u201d. This passage was \ncited with apparent approval in Gray v Motor Accident Commission at [6] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and \nHayne JJ). The plurality opinion in Gray emphasises that exemplary damages are punitive, by finding that once a \nperson has been convicted and sentenced for conduct she or he has been punished and exemplary damages for \nsubstantially the same conduct are not available: at [40]. The character of the conduct necessary for an award of \naggravated damages was described by the High Court in Triggell v Pheeney [1951] HCA 23; 82 CLR 497 at 514 as \nlacking bona fides, or being improper or unjustifiable.  In some cases, the aggravation comes not from conduct \ndirectly associated with or following on from the contravening conduct, but from subsequent conduct that has the \nsame effect. In Elliott v Nanda [2001] FCA 418; 111 FCR 240 at [179]- [185], Moore J set out the kinds of additional \ncircumstances which might justify such an award. All concerned the manner in which a respondent or defendant \nconducted proceedings brought against her, him or it. An example is Houda v New South Wales [2005] NSWSC \n1053, in which aggravated damages of $20,000 were awarded for the way the defendant conducted its defence of \nthe proceedings against the plaintiff.  Neither party referred the Court to any anti-discrimination cases (whether \nunder s 46PO(4) of the AHRC Act or otherwise) in which aggravated damages had been awarded for acts of \n\n\n\nunlawful discrimination, although clearly Elliott v Nanda is such a case. In Hall v Sheiban Lockhart J (at 239-40) and \nFrench J (at 282) were prepared to assume, without deciding, that aggravated damages may be available under s \n81(1)(b)(iv) of the Sex Discrimination Act.  In McIntyre v Tully (1999) 90 IR 9, an age discrimination case, Atkinson J \nupheld an award of aggravated damages for the way the complainant was cross-examined, saying at [25]-[26]:It \nhas been recognised that in those category of cases where damages are awarded for hurt and humiliation, \naggravated damages may be awarded because of the defendant\u2019s conduct of the case. Aggravated damages are \ncompensatory in nature being awarded for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings caused by insult, humiliation and the like \n(Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47; (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 8; Mafo v Adams [1970] 1 QB 548at 558). Such injury may \nbe exacerbated by the defendant\u2019s conduct of the case. In John v MGN Ltd [1997] QB 586 at 608, Bingham MR \nheld that the fact that the plaintiff had been cross-examined in a wounding and insulting way could be taken into \naccount in the assessment of damages. In false imprisonment cases, damages for an initial false imprisonment may \nbe aggravated by persistence with the assertion of facts alleged to justify the imprisonment up to the moment when \ndamages are assessed which continue the slur on the plaintiff\u2019s reputation (Spautz v Butterworth [1996] NSWSC \n614; (1996) 41 NSWLR 1 at 14; Myer Stores Ltd v Soo [1991] VicRp 97; [1991] 2 VR 597 at 603, 606; Walter v \nAlltools (1944) 61 TLR 39 at 40; Warwick v Foulkes [1844] EngR 144; (1844) 12 M&W 507; 152 ER 1298).\n\n There is no reason in principle why this head of damages should not be awarded in appropriate cases for unlawful \ndiscrimination when damages are awarded for distress, loss of dignity and injury to feelings (see O\u2019Neill v Steiler at \n40; Whittle v Paulette [1994] EOC 92-621 at 77,306; McNeill v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] HREOCA 9; \n[1995] EOC 92-714 at 78,369-78,370; W v Abrop Pty Ltd [1996] EOC 92-858 at 79,369).  Nor did either party refer \nto any case law on whether aggravated damages can be awarded under provisions of other statutory schemes that \nbear some similarity to s 46PO(4). In Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer \nCommission [1998] NSWSC 32; 43 NSWLR 131, for example, the New South Wales Court of Appeal approved \ntheir availability under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act, for reasons similar to those of Atkinson J in McIntyre v Tully: \nat 155-56 (Cole JA, with whom Stein JA and Sheppard AJA agreed).  The weight of authority therefore favours the \nview that aggravated damages may be awarded under s 46PO(4). Even on general principles, however, there are \ntwo principal difficulties with the way the applicants put their aggravated damages claim. The first is that the State\u2019s \nliability is solely vicarious, yet none of the identified aggravating conduct is alleged to have been undertaken by the \nsame police officers responsible for the contravening conduct. Nor is any of the aggravating conduct alleged to \nhave been undertaken by the State itself: for example, in the way it conducted the proceeding. At least, not on the \napplicants\u2019 pleaded case. There were some general submissions made about the \u201cwilful blindness\u201d of the State\u2019s \ndefence of these proceedings. I should make it clear that I consider the State conducted these proceedings \nresponsibly and courteously, and was consistently mindful of its model litigant obligations.  Instead of relying on \nanything to do with the \u201cmanner\u201d in which the harm was caused to the individual applicants, the applicants\u2019 \npleadings and submissions relied on various functions, decisions and conduct of other individuals and bodies, \nexercising public powers of various kinds.  To take some examples, the inquiry by the Investigation Review Team \nwas not conduct undertaken by those officers I have found contravened s 9. Nor was it undertaken by the State. \nThat team was separately established by the then Commissioner of Police, some two years after the events of \nNovember 2004, to perform an inquiry function under s 18 of the QPS Human Resource Management Manual, in \norder to determine whether individual officers should face disciplinary action. I fail to see how the pursuit of such an \ninquiry by the Commissioner could be said to have the requisite lack of bona fides for aggravated damages to be \nconsidered; nor can I see how the establishment of that review has the close connection with the contravening \nconduct required to be able to describe it as going to the manner or motive of the respondents for the contravening \nconduct. The way a defendant or respondent conducts a defence to a proceeding is quite a different issue. There, \nthe very subject matter of the proceeding is the alleged unlawful or contravening conduct and the way in which a \ndefendant or respondent defends that conduct can well be seen as capable of heightening an applicant\u2019s or \nplaintiff\u2019s sense of injury.  Allegations such as the failure to charge SS Hurley until February 2007 are too remote \nfrom the loss or damage suffered because of the contravening conduct and are not connected to the manner in \nwhich the loss and damage was inflicted. They have a connection in subject matter, but no more than that. The \ndecision by the QPS officers I have identified to use SERT officers to perform the arrests, entries and searches is \nunconnected other than in the most general of senses with the prosecutorial decision whether, and when, to charge \nSS Hurley. The extraordinarily long time taken to decide whether to charge SS Hurley exacerbated, I accept, the \n\n\n\nsense of outrage and injustice felt by many members of the Palm Island community, including the applicants. \nFeelings of outrage and injustice are, as I have noted, separate and distinct from the compensable loss and \ndamage suffered by the applicants for the purposes of s 46PO(4).  The second difficulty is an evidentiary one. \nAllegations of this kind (see also [335] of the matters set out at [1730] above, concerning disciplinary proceedings, \nand [336], concerning the valour and bravery awards) also suffer from the absence of a proper evidentiary \nfoundation. Why SS Hurley was not charged until February 2007 was not explained in the evidence. Why \ndisciplinary proceedings were not commenced against particular officers was not the subject of any evidence, or \ncross-examination, or subpoenas to those who might have been responsible for that decision. The basis for the \nbravery and valour awards was not the subject of any evidence. While DC Rynders\u2019 Report and CS Wall\u2019s \nmemorandum shed some light on these matters, each of those documents was written for a particular purpose and \ncannot provide an evidentiary basis for findings that would support an award of aggravated damages for the \nreasons advanced by the applicants. In my opinion, direct evidence from relevant witnesses was required.  The last \npiece of conduct relied on in the third further amended statement of claim \u2013 the failure to make known to the public \nor to persons who had complained about the conduct of QPS officers in the course of the investigation of Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath that certain officers would be given \u2018managerial guidance\u2019 \u2013 is in my opinion unjustifiable, but still not within \nthe applicable principles for aggravated damages. The evidence about this decision was scant, but unflattering to \nthe QPS. It is contained in a confidential memorandum to the Office Manager of the Legal and Policy Unit, dated 12 \nAugust 2011. The author is Senior Sergeant Michael Bond of the Ethical Standards Command. The subject is DC \nRynders\u2019 Report and the \u201cfinalisation of Palm Island matters\u201d. DC Rynders had, as I have noted elsewhere, \ndeclined to impose any disciplinary sanctions on any officer but had recommended \u201cmanagerial guidance\u201d. SS \nBond writes:Given the history, publicity and sensitivity of this matter, I recommend the complainants are not notified \nof the outcome; specifically the fact officers received \u2018managerial guidance\u2019. Such advice may be viewed as \nsomewhat antagonistic given the widespread publication of Deputy Commissioner Rynders\u2019 determination of the \nmatters and subsequent events.  The \u201ccomplainants\u201d to whom SS Bond refers are not identified but I infer this is a \nreference to the two complainants to the CMC, whose identities appear to have remained confidential. Why SS \nBond is referring to them in the context of DC Rynders\u2019 review is difficult to understand. In any event, the \nmemorandum records that Inspector TJ Goldsworthy of the Ethical Standards Command concurred with SS Bond\u2019s \nrecommendation and that the recommendation was approved.  This conscious attempt to conceal the fact that any \nofficer was subjected to any performance management arising out of the events on Palm Island, no matter how \nobjectively weak that performance management was, does not reflect well on those QPS officers involved. It is \nhowever consistent with the lack of transparency from the QPS right from the start of its investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s \ndeath. Nevertheless, the fact of this concealment did not aggravate the loss and damage suffered by any of the \napplicants because of the s 9 contraventions. Since it was concealed, none of the applicants were aware of this \ndecision until this proceeding. In any event, the complex processes of review and further review that have been \nundertaken were not matters to which the applicants referred in evidence when describing what events had affected \nthem after 27 November 2004.  Although, in my opinion, the applicants have not made out their claim of \naggravation by reference to them, the internal service awards and recognition given to QPS officers by those in \npositions of command should be considered in some detail. These matters are covered in a memorandum dated 29 \nMay 2006 from CS Wall and addressed to the Assistant Commissioner, to which I refer at [369] above. In that \nmemorandum, the awards were said to be \u201crecognition for officer and staff members who made significant \ncontribution to the overall police response to the November 2004 Palm Island Riots.\u201d The officers listed in the \nmemorandum as nominated for various forms of awards is long indeed, and includes officers in the MIR at \nTownsville, and other officers who did not set foot on Palm Island.  The descriptions in CS Wall\u2019s memorandum of \nwhat occurred during, and after, the protests and fires are, on the basis of the evidence before me, inaccurate, \ninflammatory, exaggerated and one-sided. Descriptions of aggressive and violent tactics of the SERT officers and \ntheir effects on local families are nowhere to be found in that memorandum. There is no mention of QPS officers \nauthorising in excess of 20 armed officers to conduct an operation with, amongst other objectives, the aim of \narresting a 13-year-old child, who like all the other suspects was unarmed. Instead the memorandum simply states \nthat:In the following weeks an extensive investigation under the operational code name \u201cCharlie Clover\u201d was carried \nout on Palm Island which resulted in 34 persons being arrested on a total of 81 charges which included riot, arson, \nserious assault etc.  Of course, the number of 34 persons includes people such as Mrs Agnes Wotton, against \nwhom all charges were dropped a few weeks later in Townsville. I note also that on the basis of facts agreed by the \nrespondents in this proceeding, no person was charged with \u201cserious assault\u201d.  It is readily understandable that \n\n\n\nmembers of the Palm Island community would be outraged that police officers were receiving commendations \nwhile no police officer was held responsible for the circumstances of Mulrunji\u2019s death: SS Hurley was not charged \nby the time these awards were given. No doubt it fuelled the sense of outrage and injustice on the island that white \npolice officers received bravery awards while a large number of Aboriginal Palm Islanders protesting about \nMulrunji\u2019s death and the biased investigation of it were arrested in shocking and humiliating circumstances, \nincarcerated and kept by bail conditions away from their homes for lengthy periods of time, and had their lives and \nfamilies disrupted only for many of them to have charges dropped or to be acquitted. No doubt it appeared as if the \nonly wrongdoers in the series of events were the local Aboriginal people, and the only people worth honouring were \nthe white police officers, in circumstances where no police officer was injured but an Aboriginal man was dead in \npolice custody and the lives of many Aboriginal families on Palm Island had been torn apart. The behaviour of \nQPS in electing to honour its officers in this way at a time where no persons had been held to account in any way \nfor Mulrunji\u2019s death was insensitive and lacking in insight in the extreme. It took an unjustifiably one-sided view of \nthe entire sequence of events and paid no attention to the context of the protests and fires, which was a death in \ncustody and tremendous dissatisfaction with the ensuing investigation. It perpetuated the impression of impunity \nand superiority which in my opinion had been apparent in much of the conduct of QPS officers on Palm Island \nduring these events.  Notwithstanding the views I have expressed about both the way the memorandum was written \nand the way QPS commanding officers chose to elevate and honour the conduct of officers involved in events both \non and off Palm Island, I do not consider that this conduct by CS Wall and other commanding officers can be seen, \nwithin applicable legal principles, as conduct heightening the injury suffered by the applicants as a result of the \ncontraventions of s 9 of the RDA through the arrests, searches and entries. It is not conduct concerning the manner \nin which the harm caused by those arrests, entries and searches was inflicted. It is subsequent conduct, neither \ndesigned nor intended to have anything to do with the Palm Island community: indeed, it is the disconformity \nbetween what is recounted in CS Wall\u2019s memorandum and what happened on Palm Island, on my view of the \nevidence, that is the infirmity in the whole process of conferring awards on the officers concerned.  If there had \nbeen available claims for damages in respect of the contraventions of s 9 I have found occurred in the conduct of \nthe investigation into Mulrunji\u2019s death, then the conduct of QPS commanding officers in elevating and honouring \nofficers I have found were responsible for those contraventions may well have been capable of aggravating the \ninjury suffered. However, no damages have been claimed, nor have I found they are available, for those \ncontraventions of s 9.  If one examines, for example, the findings of Harrison J in Beckett at [810]-[816] about why \nMs Beckett was entitled to aggravated damages, one can see in my opinion the proper scope of these principles. \nHarrison J\u2019s focus is on conduct by New South Wales police officers directly affecting Ms Beckett \u2013 such as \nhandcuffing her, parading her in front of the media, opposing her being granted bail, and seeking to revoke her bail. \nIn a case for damages arising from malicious prosecution one can readily see how this conduct is conduct that \ncould be said to have heightened the damage suffered by Ms Beckett as a result of the malicious prosecution.  In \nthe present case, it may have been open to the applicants to plead that Mr Wotton\u2019s handcuffing and shackling \nshould be the subject of an award of aggravated damages. The dragging of Mr Bulsey semi-naked out of his house \nmight be in the same category. Making Mr Morton, a child, lie face down in the mud might be another. It may be \nopen to characterise the imprisonment of Mr Blackman in the back of a police van overnight as conduct \naggravating any damages award he should receive. None of these matters concerning Mr Wotton were pleaded in \nthe context of aggravated damages and I say no more about them. The matters in relation to other subgroup \nmembers are for another day.\n\nExemplary damages claim    Exemplary damages are sought by the applicants based on alleged differences \nbetween the findings and recommendations of public reviews of police conduct in relation to the events on Palm \nIsland in November 2004, and internal police reviews of that conduct. The applicants submit the internal police \nreviews (the IRT and Rynders reports) never resulted in any disciplinary action being taken against any QPS \nofficers. In contrast, the public reviews (the CMC report and the second inquest decision) made recommendations \nto that effect.  The respondents deny there is power to make orders for exemplary damages under s 46PO(4), \nrelying on the following statement of French and Jacobson JJ in Qantas Airways v Gama at [94]:The damages \nwhich can be awarded under s 46PO(4) of the HREOC Act are damages \u201cby way of compensation for any loss or \ndamage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent\u201d. Such damages are entirely compensatory. In many \ncases, as in damages awarded under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) the appropriate measure will be \nanalogous to the tortious. That may not be every case. Ultimately it is the words of the statute that set the criterion \n\n\n\nfor any award. In any case the discretionary character of the remedy allows an award of an amount \"by way of \ncompensation\" which does not fully compensate for the loss suffered.  The applicants submit that the list of \nspecified orders in section 46PO(4) is not exhaustive. They submit the language of the chapeau \u2013 \u201cthe court may \nmake such orders (including a declaration of right) as it thinks fit\u201d \u2013 suggests the power extends to orders for \nexemplary damages if, in an appropriate case, the Court sees fit to make orders of that kind.  Before I turn to \nconsider these arguments, I note that the respondents did not rely on s 10.5(2) of the PSA Act, which provides:In no \ncase does the Crown\u2019s liability for a tort committed by any officer, staff member, recruit or volunteer extend to a \nliability to pay damages in the nature of punitive damages.  I assume that is because of the reference to torts in the \nprovision, and its operation being seen as confined to that circumstance. That would appear to be correct, and I say \nno more about this provision: cf Bulsey at [94].  Exemplary damages at common law have a different character to \ncompensatory and aggravated damages: they are punitive. Brennan J explained their purpose, and the nature of \nthe conduct which must exist for such damages to be awarded, in XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil \n(Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 12;155 CLR 448 at 471:As an award of exemplary damages is intended to punish \nthe defendant for conduct showing a conscious and contumelious disregard for the plaintiff\u2019s rights and to deter him \nfrom committing like conduct again, the considerations that enter into the assessment of exemplary damages are \nquite different from the considerations that govern the assessment of compensatory damages. There is no \nnecessary proportionality between the assessment of the two categories.  In a passage approved by the High Court \non appeal at [34], Spigelman CJ in New South Wales v Ibbett [2005] NSWCA 445; 65 NSWLR 168 at [83] \ndescribed the differences in perspective between aggravated and exemplary damages:The difference is that in the \ncase of aggravated damages the assessment is made from the point of view of the Plaintiff and in the case of \nexemplary damages the focus is on the conduct of the Defendant. Nevertheless, it is necessary, as I have noted \nabove, to determine both heads of compensatory damages before deciding whether or not the quantum is such that \na further award is necessary to serve the objectives of punishment or deterrence or, if it be a separate purpose, \ncondemnation.  The awarding of sums for exemplary damages far in excess of what is awarded for compensatory \ndamages (see, as an example, the award in Nye v New South Wales [2003] NSWSC 1212) reflects their different \npurpose. The combination of the egregiousness of the conduct and the Court\u2019s opinion that there should be \ncondemnation by way of an order for the payment of money, the character of the conduct (for example, whether it is \nconduct engaged in by a public official and the capacity of that official), together with the need to deter future \nconduct of the same kind can all lead to awards of very significant sums. As Priestley JA observed in Adams v \nKennedy [2000] NSWCA 152; 49 NSWLR 78 at [35], the only guide to the sum which should be awarded in a given \ncase is \u201cthe somewhat opaque rule that the damages must not be out of all proportion in the circumstances\u201d.  In \nNew South Wales v Delly [2007] NSWCA 303; 70 NSWLR 125 at [116]- [117], Basten JA, speaking particularly of \npolice officers, emphasised the exceptional nature of exemplary damages:One purpose of an award of exemplary \ndamages is to deter both the wrongdoer and others who may be in his or her position from a repetition of the kind of \nconduct under scrutiny. In the present case, it is the State of New South Wales, rather than the individual police \nofficers who will suffer the financial burden of an award. Further ... such an award may indirectly have a deterrent \neffect on the police officers concerned through the response of the Police Service. It is, therefore, important to \npreserve the deterrent effect of such an award. That effect will tend to be diminished if the preconditions for an \naward are not tightly controlled. No doubt it is important that police officers know and observe the limits of their \npowers: however that desirable end will not make a careless or mistaken exercise of power outrageous or high-\nhanded.\n\n The fact that an award of exemplary damages constitutes an expression of the Court\u2019s disapproval of the conduct \ndoes not mean that the Court\u2019s disapproval is a sufficient reason to make an award.  For example, in Adams v \nKennedy, in awarding an aggregate sum of $100,000 in exemplary damages for several causes of action (trespass, \nassault, battery and false imprisonment) Priestley JA said at [36] (Sheller JA and Beazley JA agreeing):The amount \nshould also be such as to bring home to those officials of the State who are responsible for the overseeing of the \npolice force that police officers must be trained and disciplined so that abuses of the kind that occurred in the \npresent case do not happen.  In Beckett, Harrison J awarded Ms Beckett the sum of $1,825,200 for false \nimprisonment following upon what his Honour found to be malicious prosecution in relation to several criminal \ncharges, although Ms Beckett remained convicted of two offences, for which she had, his Honour accepted, lawfully \nserved a sentence of imprisonment. His Honour awarded Ms Beckett $100,000 in aggravated damages for the \n\n\n\nmanner in which she was arrested (including being handcuffed when his Honour found that was unnecessary) and \nthe way she was conveyed through a \u201cmedia scrum\u201d, apparently on the \u2018tip off\u2019 of the police. His Honour also \nawarded $200,000 in exemplary damages, specifically by reference to the conduct of a particular detective whom \nhis Honour found had long demonstrated a partiality against Ms Beckett and had been determined to \u201cget square\u201d \nwith her, in what Harrison J described (at [817]) in the following terms:Detective Thomas remained in charge of the \ninvestigation and prosecution of Ms Beckett long after his partiality had been identified and commented upon by \njudges and police Internal Affairs investigators. Detective Thomas\u2019 own written words demonstrated that he saw Ms \nBeckett as his nemesis and that it has adversely affected his career. This was, or should have been, apparent from \nas early as, and certainly by no later than, Ms Beckett\u2019s complaints about him following the delicatessen fire in \n1983. The fact that he was permitted to remain connected in any way with the charges preferred against Ms Beckett \nafter that represents an egregious failure in policing and an institutional failure of remarkable proportions.  Many of \nthe New South Wales cases discussed by Harrison J in his comprehensive survey in Beckettinvolved deliberate \nfabrication of evidence by police, or other egregious and deliberate conduct. For example, Harrison J described \nDetective Thomas in Beckett as a bully and a person who \u201cclearly treated many people with an arrogant contempt \nthat was intimidating and frightening for them\u201d: at [839].  There have been other circumstances in other states \nwhere awards of common law exemplary damages have been made against police officers.  In White v South \nAustralia [2010] SASC 95; 106 SASR 521, a group of about 30 protesters were beaten, sprayed with OC spray, \narrested and detained by police for breach of the peace after staging a walk-on protest at the Beverley uranium \nmine. Once arrested, they were taken to another part of the mine site by police cars and then placed in a disused \nshipping container. A wire cage was also welded onto the outside of the container. Most were held in the shipping \ncontainer for about three hours and then outside in the wire cage for another three hours. Later that day, they were \ntaken to a separate location and released after having spent up to seven hours in custody.  Eight of the protesters \nand a Channel Seven cameraman sued for assault and false imprisonment, and an 11-year-old girl who was not \nparticipating in the protests sued for assault. Anderson J held that the plaintiffs had not been asked to leave the \nland so they were not trespassing. Therefore all of the arrests and detentions were unlawful. His Honour awarded \ndamages to each plaintiff and awarded all but one of the plaintiffs $15,000 each in exemplary damages for \ndemeaning remarks about them made in the press by two ministers of the South Australian government: see [461]-\n[470]. Inclusive of exemplary damages and interest, nine of the protestors were awarded between $53,000 and \n$95,110 (see [527]), with the 11-year-old girl being awarded $18,000.  In Carter v Walker [2010] VSCA 340; 32 VR \n1, two police constables forcibly entered a residential unit in response to a call concerning a domestic violence \nincident. In the course of a physical altercation between a son alleged to be responsible for the domestic violence \nincident, his mother (who lived next door), and the police officers, the son and mother were injured, including the \nmother\u2019s shoulder being dislocated. A second son then arrived home and suffered nervous shock at what he saw. \nAt first instance, Smith J upheld the plaintiffs\u2019 assault and battery claims, awarding: (a) the first son $300,000 for \ngeneral damages, $883,413 for past loss of earnings and lost future earning capacity, $200,000 as aggravated \ncompensatory damages, and $400,000 by way of exemplary damages; (b) the second son $200,000 for general \ndamages, $643,610 for past loss of earnings and lost future earning capacity, and $75,000 as aggravated \ncompensatory damages; and (c) the mother\u2019s estate $100,000 as general damages and aggravated damages of \n$100,000. The Court of Appeal (Buchanan, Ashley and Weinberg JJA) criticised some of the primary judge\u2019s fact \nfinding and allowed the appeal in relation to the second son on the basis that nervous shock of a third party is not \ncompensable in battery (at [251]). However, their Honours upheld most of the balance of his Honour\u2019s judgment, \nalthough they reduced the amounts of aggravated and exemplary damages awarded to the first son from $200,000 \nto $100,000 and from $400,000 to $100,000 respectively.  In Sadler v Madigan [1998] VSCA 53, a jury awarded the \nplaintiff $40,000 in damages and $10,000 in exemplary damages for false imprisonment by an officer in a police \nstation. The plaintiff had been lawfully arrested, but then held for longer than was reasonably necessary, although \nthe period of in which he was unlawfully detained was no more than 1 190; hours: at [10]. The Court of Appeal set \naside the award and substituted an award of $15,000 in damages only, declining to award exemplary damages, on \nthe basis that the police conduct was not \u201coutrageous\u201d so as to justify such an award: see [55] (Winneke P, Charles \nJA and Batt JA agreeing).  In Coleman v Watson [2007] QSC 343 in a trial in the Supreme Court sitting at \nTownsville, the defendants were two officers and the State of Queensland. Liability, principal and vicarious, was \nadmitted. The plaintiff was attempting to enter the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre to attend a \nceremonial sitting of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. At [14]-[15], Cullinane J described the plaintiff in the \n\n\n\nfollowing terms:It can be said that there is a history of clashes between the plaintiff and the police arising out of the \nplaintiff\u2019s activities as an activist. I think that the word agitator would not be a term that the plaintiff would cavil with.\n\n By 3 September 2002 it is obvious that police treated the plaintiff as someone to be kept under observation when \nhe appeared in a public place or at a public event.  After several exchanges outside the venue, where police \nofficers were preventing the plaintiff from entering (being aware of his intent to protest inside), he was eventually \narrested and taken to the cells at the Townsville Magistrates Court, and subsequently granted bail. The damages \nrelated to a short period in which he was unnecessarily detained before being granted bail. The action was for false \nimprisonment, assault and trespass to the person. The plaintiff was charged with two offences of obstructing a \npolice officer in the exercise of his duty, and acquitted of both charges. Noting (at [53]) that damages in such \ncircumstances are \u201cprimarily awarded to compensate for a sense of outrage, injury to feeling, humiliation and \ndisgrace, indignity and the like\u201d, Cullinane J awarded the plaintiff $20,000 compensatory damages plus interest. At \n[69]-[72], Cullinane J explained why he declined to order any exemplary damages:So far as exemplary damages is \nconcerned I do not think this is a matter which calls for such an award. Although it is acknowledged that the \ndefendants acted unlawfully and at the commencement of the trial admitted their liability there is nothing to suggest \nthat they were acting in anything other than good faith.\n\n The defendants had been instructed by their superiors to prevent the plaintiff from entering the premises.\n\n It is not a case in which their attention to the plaintiff was in any sense arbitrary. There was evidence of conduct on \nhis part in the past which would to any reasonable person have justified paying some attention to him when he was \nseen at the convention centre. The defendants were part of a group of police officers having the obligation to \nprovide security at a gathering of parliamentarians. Members of the public who had a variety of interests including \ngrievances were in attendance and the police undoubtedly were obviously going to be fully occupied.\n\n There is nothing about the manner in which the defendants spoke to or otherwise dealt with the plaintiff which \ncould be regarded as high handed or unreasonable. The audio tape rather suggests they dealt with him with \nconsiderable patience and courtesy.  It can be seen that in common law actions where allegations are found \nproven, courts have no difficulty in awarding exemplary damages against police officers for conduct occurring in \nthe exercise of their powers, where the conduct was sufficiently egregious, rather than simply mistaken or negligent.  \nIt is also important to note that the tort of malicious prosecution requires that a prosecution was commenced or \nmaintained without reasonable and probable cause: A v New South Wales [2007] HCA 10;230 CLR 500 at [1], [58]-\n[59] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ). Unlike s 9 of the RDA (which applies to public \nand private actors) it is, of its nature, a tort directed at the use and abuse of public power. Further, malicious \nprosecution involves an examination of the intention of those responsible for the prosecution, in a way that an \ninquiry under s 9 of the RDA does not, or does not necessarily involve. While Lamb establishes that \u2018malice\u2019 is not a \nnecessary prerequisite for an award of exemplary damages, it is consistent with an inquiry into motive or intention \nforming part of the elements of a tort that, in an appropriate case, the nature of that motive or intention and the \nconduct that accompanied it might be seen as deserving of punishment, and of requiring orders calculated to deter \nothers from deliberately abusing public powers in similar ways.  There are no straightforward parallels between \ncases of the kind I have discussed and successful proceedings under s 9 of the RDA. Nevertheless, it is \nconceivable that there can be cases of deliberate and conscious racial discrimination under s 9, and in those \ncircumstances, there may be greater parallels with the malicious prosecution cases.  There being ample authority in \nAustralian tort cases for awards of exemplary damages against police officers in respect of the exercise of their \npowers, I turn now to consider the position under s 46PO.  Two parts of s 46PO must be considered: the chapeau \nto subs (4) and subs (4)(d).  Current authority suggests that the power under s 46PO(4) is a power to make orders \nthat are compensatory in nature. As I have noted, in Qantas Airways v Gama French and Jacobson JJ said at \n[94]:The damages which can be awarded under s 46PO(4) of the HREOC Act are damages \u201cby way of \ncompensation for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent\u201d. Such damages are \nentirely compensatory. In many cases, as in damages awarded under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) \n\n\n\nthe appropriate measure will be analogous to the tortious. That may not be every case. Ultimately it is the words of \nthe statute that set the criterion for any award. In any case the discretionary character of the remedy allows an \naward of an amount \u201cby way of compensation\u201d which does not fully compensate for the loss suffered.  In \nRichardson the Court did not endorse a submission suggesting this passage was authority for the proposition there \nwas a discretion in a trial judge to decide to award less than a sum of compensation which reflected the loss and \ndamages because of the contravening conduct: see Richardson at [137]-[138] (Besanko and Perram JJ). The \napproach of Besanko and Perram JJ again emphasises the compensatory purpose of s 46PO(4).  In Clarke v \nNationwide News Pty Limited [2012] FCA 307; 201 FCR 389 at [340], Barker J referred to Qantas Airways v Gama, \nand to some academic views about whether s 46PO(4) extends to exemplary damages. His Honour did not find it \nnecessary to decide the matter, although at [342] he expressed the opinion that if he had needed to decide the \nmatter, he would not have considered the conduct in the proceeding before him sufficiently outrageous or egregious \nto warrant such an order.  Barker J also referred (at [340]) to a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court in Hughes \n(formerly De Jager) v Car Buyers Pty Ltd [2004] FMCA 526; 210 ALR 645, a case concerning allegations of sexual \nharassment. Walters FM expressed a view that no power to make orders for exemplary damages existed, and \nexpressed his disagreement with an earlier decision of Raphael FM (Font v Paspaley Pearls Pty Ltd [2002] FMCA \n142)that s 46PO(4) extended that far: Hughes at [74].  In the context of a primary judge\u2019s decision not to make any \norders under s 46PO(4) for aggravated or exemplary damages, in Employment Services Australia Pty Ltd v \nPoniatowska [2010] FCAFC 92 at [133]Stone and Bennett JJ (somewhat equivocally) said:We note that, while s \n46PO(4) refers only to orders for damages of a compensatory nature, there is no exclusion of other orders that may \nbe made. However, we do not need to determine whether or not there is power to make such an award under this \nsection as, in our view, his Honour\u2019s approach [declining to award aggravated or exemplary damages] was \nreasonable in the circumstances.  The question of power to award exemplary damages was also left open by \nBromberg J in Ewin v Vergara (No 3) [2013] FCA 1311; 307 ALR 576 at [681]- [684], in observations the Full Court \non appeal approved: see Vergara v Ewin [2014] FCAFC 100; 223 FCR 151 at [106]- [112] (White J, dissenting in \nthe result, but North and Pagone JJ agreeing with his Honour on this issue at [123]). In particular, on appeal White J \napproved the proposition that exemplary damages are awarded only when a court is satisfied that the amount of the \ncompensatory damages has insufficient punitive effect.  Most recently, a Full Court of this Court has described the \n\u201cdebate\u201d about the availability of exemplary damages under s 46PO as \u201cunresolved\u201d but also declined to decide the \nmatter: see Mulligan v Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd [2015] FCAFC 130; 234 FCR 207 at [166] (Flick, Reeves and \nGriffiths JJ).  The parties did not refer the Court to any of these authorities. In this case, the applicants have \npressed for exemplary damages, and for the reasons I give below, if I was of the view there was power to award \nthem, I would consider doing so. That being the case, it is necessary to determine whether they are available. In my \nview they are not.  Section 46PO(4) establishes a suite of statutory remedies the Parliament has chosen as \nexpressly available where unlawful discrimination has occurred. It is true that the suite is not expressed to be \nexhaustive, and that is consistent with the context and purpose of s 46PO as prescribing remedies to be available \nacross a range of federal anti-discrimination statutes, which must deal with unlawful discrimination occurring in a \nwide variety of circumstances. In its inclusive nature, s 46PO(4) recognises the realities of the exercise of federal \njudicial power and the need to allow courts to do justice between the parties in a way which finally and appropriately \nsettles the controversy between them. That is emphasised by the use of the phrase \u201cas it thinks fit\u201d in the chapeau, \nwhich has an established meaning, and also emphasises the discretionary nature of all these remedies.  The \nphrase \u201cas it thinks fit\u201d, like phrases such as \u201cas the Court thinks just\u201d (see for example s 22 of theFederal Court \nAct) or \u201cas the Court thinks appropriate\u201d (s 23 of the Act), is a phrase intended to confer on the Court a wide \ndiscretionary power. However, even such widely expressed discretions have functional limits, requiring sufficient \nconnection with the jurisdiction to be exercised, ensuring a court\u2019s processes are not frustrated, preserving the \nsubject matter of a proceeding, ensuring effective relief can be granted at the end of a proceeding, preventing \nabuse of the court\u2019s processes and the like: see, generally, Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime \nUnion of Australia [1998] HCA 30; 195 CLR 1 at [35] (Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ).  \nHowever, to see such a power as extending to the conferral of a punitive power is a more ambitious constructional \nchoice. It sits less easily with the objectives of each federal anti-discrimination statute (the achievement of \nsubstantive equality in the areas in which each statute operates) and it does not reflect any other aspect of the \nstatutory schemes either in the individual anti-discrimination statutes or in the AHRC Act (in particular, the \nconciliation function of the Commission).  Unlike other statutory regimes where there are similarly worded \ncompensation clauses (such as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) ss 76, 82 and 87 and the Fair Work \n\n\n\nAct 2007 (Cth) ss 545 and 546), there are no penalty provisions in the RDA, nor does the AHRC Act provide in \nterms that a penalty may be imposed for unlawful discrimination. Although that feature could tend in different ways \non the construction of s 46PO(4), in my opinion it demonstrates that what Parliament was enacting with s 46PO(4) \nwas a compensatory and remedial regime and not a regime designed to punish, or confer any deterrent or punitive \nfunctions on a court by its orders. There is also the specific use of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in s 46PO(4)(d) which \nin my opinion gives a clear indication of the nature of power conferred by the provision, including the ancillary power \nconferred in the chapeau. In my opinion the better constructional choice is that Parliament did not intend to confer \non this Court the ability to make punitive orders as part of resolving a dispute between parties concerning unlawful \ndiscrimination.  This approach appears consistent with the approach taken to trade practices and consumer law \nlegislation. As I have noted, there is an increasing trend to construe federal anti-discrimination statutes as \nembodying their own compensation regimes, without drawing too close an analogy with tort law, and support for this \napproach is drawn from authorities dealing with trade practices and consumer law. In some circumstances, orders \nfor exemplary damages are expressly prohibited. For example, s 87ZB of the Competition and Consumer Act \nspecifically prohibits aggravated or exemplary damages in a claim for damages or compensation for death or \npersonal injury made under Pt VIB.  In Marks v Gio Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69; 196 CLR 494 at [9] \nGaudron J held that exemplary damages were not available under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act \nproviding for damages (s 82)and other relief (s 87):Before turning to the argument, it is convenient to note two \nmatters which are clear from the terms of ss 82 and 87. The first is that for a person to obtain relief under those \nsections he or she must have suffered loss or damage or, in the case of s 87, be likely to suffer loss or damage. \nThe second is that there is no punitive aspect to these provisions, they being concerned solely to provide for \nrecovery of \u201cthe amount of the loss or damage [suffered]\u201d (s 82) or to \u201ccompensate\u201d for or \u201cprevent or reduce\u201d loss \nor damage (s 87).  Similar observations could be made of s 46PO(4). To obtain relief under subs (b), (d), or (e) of s \n46PO(4), a person must have suffered \u201closs or damage\u201d. Nothing in those subsections \u2013 nor in subs (a), (c) or (f) \u2013 \nprovides support for a conclusion that the reference in the chapeau to orders the court \u201cthinks fit\u201d includes orders \nthat aim to punish a respondent.  Earlier Federal Court authority on the availability of exemplary damages under the \nTrade Practices Act had reached the same conclusion: see Musca v Astle Corporation Pty Ltd [1988] FCA 4; 80 \nALR 251 at 262 (French J). A Full Court agreed with that approach: see Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio \n[1988] FCA 413; 58 FCR 274 at 287-88 (Fisher, Gummow and Lee JJ).  In Musca, French J also held that s 22 of \nthe Federal Court Act empowered the Court to order exemplary damages in exercise of its accrued jurisdiction in \nrelation to the tort of deceit. I do not see that example as detracting from the view I have taken. If the applicants had \ninvoked this Court\u2019s accrued jurisdiction to claim relief in relation to false imprisonment or assault, the same \napproach could have been taken. However, that exercise of power, relying on s 22, would originate in the \ncontinuing common law recognition of the role of exemplary damages, not in the Court\u2019s statutory task under s \n46PO(4).  In Nixon v Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd [1999] FCA 1107; 95 FCR 453, Wilcox J agreed with the approach \ntaken by French J. His Honour said (at [99]-[103]):In the present case, counsel for the applicants accept that \nexemplary damages are not recoverable under s 82 or 87 of the Trade Practices Act. But they argue, in effect, that \nFrench J\u2019s approach leads logically to the conclusion that exemplary damages are available under s 22 even in \nrelation to a contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act. They say:\u201cHaving been granted power under Section \n22 (a power which should be given a liberal construction \u2013 see French J at 263) to grant such remedies as are \nnecessary to resolve disputes before it, why should that power not extend to granting an award of exemplary \ndamages where appropriate, pursuant not to Section 82, or Section 87, but to that power?\u201dAlternatively, counsel \nsuggest, exemplary damages ought to be regarded as compensatory in character, at least in part. In support of that \nsubmission, they refer to comments in various cases about the role of exemplary damages in assuaging victims\u2019 \nfeelings.\n\n I reject both these submissions. French J took some trouble to explore and explain the limits on damages awards \nimposed by the terms of ss 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 22 is an exhortatory provision requiring \nthe Court, in every matter before it, to grant \u201call remedies to which any of the parties appears to be entitled in \nrespect of a legal or equitable claim properly brought forward by him in the matter\u201d, so as to avoid multiplicity of \nproceedings. It ought to be construed liberally: see the Full Court decision in McLeish v Faure [1979] FCA 38; \n(1979) 40 FLR 462 at 471-473; [1979] FCA 38;25 ALR 403 at 413-414. However, s 22 does not confer on the Court \nany additional jurisdiction: see Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd at 489-490 per Gibbs J, at \n\n\n\n505-506 per Mason J and at 529 per Aickin J. Section 22 does not give the Court a general charter to make \nwhatever orders it might think to be just, independently of any legal or equitable claim the parties may succeed in \nestablishing. In determining Musca, French J was aware of the existence and limitations of s 22. His approach has \nbeen indorsed at Full Court level and is supported by Gaudron J\u2019s observation in Marks. Having regard to these \ncircumstances, I would follow his Honour even if I had reservations about the correctness of his view. I do not; I \nthink he was plainly correct.\n\n In relation to the second submission, it is true that some judges have drawn attention to the role of exemplary \ndamages in assuaging the feeling of hurt or outrage which is often experienced by victims of tortious conduct. In a \nsense, that role might be regarded as compensatory. However, the distinction between compensatory (including \naggravated) damages and exemplary damages is deeply entrenched. It is enough to recall the decision of the \nHouse of Lords in Rookes v Barnard [1964] UKHL 1; [1964] AC 1129 and the reaction to that decision of the High \nCourt of Australia in Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd [1966] HCA 40; (1966) 117 CLR 118. In considering the \nmatter of aggravated damages, the Court examines the effect of the defendant\u2019s conduct on the plaintiff; in \nconsidering exemplary damages it focuses on the conduct itself. The distinction was succinctly explained by the \nHigh Court in Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47; (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 8:\u201cAggravated damages, in contrast to \nexemplary damages, are compensatory in nature, being awarded for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings caused by \ninsult, humiliation and the like. Exemplary damages, on the other hand, go beyond compensation and are awarded \n\u2018as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of \nthe jury to the action itself\u2019.\u201dI accept it may be possible, in an appropriate case, to recover aggravated damages as \n\u201closs or damage\u201d, within the meaning of s 82 or 87 of the Trade Practices Act. However, it seems to me clear that \nexemplary damages cannot fall into that category. I am of the opinion that, in the present case, it is not open to any \nof the applicants or group members to recover exemplary damages in relation to any contravention of s 52 of \ntheTrade Practices Act they may prove.  On appeal, Wilcox J\u2019s decision was set aside on other grounds and the \nFull Court refrained from expressing a view on the availability of exemplary damages: Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v \nNixon [2000] FCA 229; 170 ALR 487 at [185]- [186] (Sackville J, Spender J agreeing at [1] and Hill J agreeing at \n[13]).  In the 16 years since Nixon was decided, it does not appear that the issue of orders for exemplary damages \nin consumer law cases has arisen again. One possible reason for that is, as I have noted above, the existence \nunder these regimes of a variety of other kinds of punitive orders.  If, contrary to my opinion, there is power to make \norders for exemplary damages under s 46PO(4) (or, if one recalls the possibility raised and discounted by Wilcox J \nin Nixon, s 22 of the Federal Court Act), then I would have foreshadowed the making of such orders in relation to \nsome of the subgroup members. I explain briefly what those orders would have been. I say \u201cforeshadowed\u201d \nbecause I am not asked at the current stage of this proceeding to make orders by way of compensation or damages \nin relation to the subgroup members. However, it is only those members (or rather, some of them) in respect of \nwhom I consider orders for exemplary damages would have been appropriate.  First, I would have foreshadowed \norders for exemplary damages in relation to the treatment of William Blackman Senior. The way Mr Blackman was \nlocked overnight in a police vehicle should be deprecated in the strongest terms. It is inhumane and under no \ncircumstances appropriate to lock a human being, handcuffed, in a tropical climate and in the confines of a police \nvan for an extended period of time. There was no shortage of police officers on the island \u2013 indeed there were \napproximately 100 officers on the island that night. Mr Blackman could have been kept, in safety and with dignity \nand human decency, in any locked room and guarded if need be by officers on rotating shift. In any event, there is \nnot the slightest evidence that he posed any risk whatsoever to any person, which simply adds to the \noutrageousness of the way he was treated. I have not the slightest doubt that QPS officers considered they could \ntreat Mr Blackman like this because he was Aboriginal. That only adds to the egregiousness of their conduct. There \nis no evidence before me about the identities of the individual officers who undertook this conduct, although the \npolice log reveals that DS Campbell requested a \u201ctravel arrangement\u201d for Mr Blackman and that Inspector Kachel \nwas on duty when Mr Blackman was taken to the airport. In cross-examination, Mr Campbell said he could not \nremember anything about the incident. In any event, the officers who were responsible for Mr Blackman\u2019s treatment \nshould be publicly named, and no doubt that may occur in due course whether or not an award of exemplary \ndamages is made.  The second category of subgroup members in whose favour I would have foreshadowed \nmaking awards of exemplary damages are the people who were children at the time of the entries and searches of \nthe houses, and who were the innocent victims in the aggressive, confrontational and violent conduct that \n\n\n\nnecessarily accompanies the entry and search of properties by two large teams of SERT and PSRT officers, with \npolice dogs. I would have foreshadowed such orders against those QPS officers who together appear to have \ndecided to use SERT to undertake the arrests, searches and entries (namely: DI Webber, Inspector Underwood \nand Inspector Kachel) because, on the evidence before me, it was known, or ought reasonably to have been \nknown, to each of those officers, that there would likely be children in and around the houses the SERT officers \nwere sent to. In circumstances, as I have found them to be, where there was no reasonable basis to suppose the \nsuspects would be armed (or even if there was, it was only with sticks and spears, on the best evidence for the \nrespondents, which I have not accepted in any event) it was unnecessary and disproportionate to send SERT \nofficers at all. Those teams were sent to subjugate, punish and \u2018send a message\u2019 to the Aboriginal population of \nPalm Island about the consequences of rising up against police. That was an improper purpose. Be that as it may, \nit transforms an improper purpose into a callous and cruel choice when it was plain that children would be in those \nhouses.  The evidence which supports those opinions is as follows. First, it is a notorious fact if one looks at any of \nthe contemporaneous evidence that Palm Island had a high proportion of children in its population. They were also \na visible component of the population: that is, they were out and about, playing on the streets and in the \nneighbourhoods. They were mobile and curious and therefore highly likely to be at and around the houses to be \nattended by the SERT officers. I find DS Robinson, having been on the island for two years, would have been well \naware of this feature of the Palm Island community. Indeed he knew the members of the community well enough to \nhave a good idea of which houses were likely to have children in them when entered and searched. There is no \nevidence he attempted to modify in any way what should happen at those houses. Further, the entry and search of \nMr Wotton\u2019s house was timed expressly and deliberately for a time at which he and his family were likely to be \nthere, and asleep. There was a deliberate choice to target that house knowing the whole family was likely to be \nthere.  Second, the particular evidence about knowledge of the presence of children is as follows. DI Webber \nconceded that he knew there might be children and elderly people in the houses that were to be entered and \nsearched. Mr Campbell agreed he knew there was a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d that women, children and elderly people \nwould likely be in the homes to which SERT officers were sent. Inspector McKay accepted that he briefed the SERT \nofficers \u201caround the fact that there were potentially children in the addresses\u201d. Inspector McKay\u2019s evidence was that \nthis information came from DS Robinson, and Superintendent Kruger confirmed this in his evidence. On the day \nfollowing the arrests, entries and searches, being Sunday, 28 November 2004, several people raised concerns with \nInspector Kachel and DI Webber about police pointing guns at children. The latter I consider a mild and inaccurate \ndescription of what happened during the arrests, entries and searches, on the evidence before me.  In my opinion, \nthe determination to subjugate and punish the Aboriginal people suspected of being the \u2018ringleaders\u2019 in the uprising \nagainst police the day before overwhelmed all sense of proportion and decency which should have pulled each and \nevery one of these officers up, when they knew there would be children present in and around those houses. Fully \nunderstanding what was involved in two teams of SERT officers going to each house to apprehend suspects, and \nenter and search the houses, they consciously abandoned concerns for the safety and wellbeing of innocent \nchildren in favour of pursuing the purposes I have outlined above. That came at an unforgivable cost to those \nchildren, as the evidence in this proceeding has demonstrated.  As with Mr Blackman, the amount of any exemplary \ndamages for subgroup members who were children (had exemplary damages been available under s 46PO(4), \nwhich I have found they are not) would have needed to be considered in the context of awards of compensatory \ndamages to those individuals, now all adults, some of whom gave evidence in this proceeding. As I have said, any \nawards of compensatory damages for subgroup members is a matter reserved for a future stage of this proceeding.\n\nCONCLUSION    The Court\u2019s findings result in a number of declarations of contraventions of s 9(1) of the RDA, a \ndeclaration concerning the application of s 18A of the RDA, and orders for compensation by way of damages in \nrespect of each of the applicants. A number of issues remain to be determined, both in relation to the applicants \nand in relation to the group and subgroup members. In the first category fall the questions of an apology, interest on \nthe damages, and appropriate orders for costs of the proceeding. In the second category fall the questions of the \npotential additional common questions, and the future conduct of the remainder of the proceeding in accordance \nwith Pt IVA of the Federal Court Act. Directions will be made to accommodate submissions on all these matters. \nLiberty to apply will also be given to the parties for any variations to the final orders which they submit are \nnecessary or appropriate upon consideration of the Court\u2019s reasons.  It has been said, in relation to the events on \nPalm Island on 26 November 2004, that:\u201cTo riot against the police service is an affront to the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\n\n (R v Poynter, Norman & Parker; ex parte A-G (Qld) [2006] QCA 517 at [34] (de Jersey CJ))  For those in command \nand control of particular policing activities, and for those in charge of a police investigation into the death of a \nperson in police custody, to perform their functions differently by reference to the race of the people they are \ndealing with is also, in my respectful opinion, an affront to the rule of law.              \n\nI certify that the preceding one thousand, eight hundred and six (1806) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the \nReasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mortimer.         \n\n Associate: \n\n Dated: 5 December 2016\n"}
