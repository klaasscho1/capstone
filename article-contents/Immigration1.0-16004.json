{"title": "IMMIG RAPS VS. PAKISTANI", "body": "\nA PAKISTANI man from Queens who videotaped office buildings and landmarks in New York and throughout the \nSouth was indicted yesterday on unrelated immigration charges.\n\nKamran Akhtar, 35, was hit with six immigration counts, including lying and failing to leave the U.S. when ordered to \ndo so in 1998 by a judge who rejected his plea for political asylum.\n\nThe unemployed father of three faces deportation or up to 55 years in prison. None of the charges involves \nterrorism.\n\nAkhtar was arrested last month after a North Carolina cop spotted him taping a bank tower in downtown Charlotte \nand he gave evasive answers when questioned.\n\nBesides a dam in Austin, Tex., and transit systems across the South, Akhtar's tapes included the American Express \nbuilding, the Circle Line, the American Museum of Natural History, South Street Seaport, the Verizon telephone \nbuilding, the Statue of Liberty and the Williamsburg and Brooklyn bridges, all in New York.\n\nAkhtar says he is simply a video buff. His arrest took place amid fears Al Qaeda could be making plans for a new \nterror attack before the fall presidential elections. Relatives say Akhtar is a harmless, apolitical man and a doting \ndad. His wife is a permanent U.S. resident.\n"}
