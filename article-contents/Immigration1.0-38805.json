{"title": "A century of change: the U.S. labor force, 1950-2050: with slower growth, aging, and increasing diversity, the profile of the U.S. labor force is undergoing a gradual, but significant, change. (Labor Force Change, 1950-2050); US civilian noninstitutional population by sex, age and race / ethnicity for 1950 forecast to 2050 in ten-year increments", "body": "\nThe history of the U.S. labor force is a story of dramatic change. The rippling effects of the massive demographic \nchanges that occurred within the U.S. population over the latter part of the 20th century will create further changes \nin the first half of the 21st century. The labor force--the number of people working or looking for work--is a dynamic \nconcept that demonstrates the net impact of all demographic, social, political, and historical forces affecting a \npopulation. The growth of the labor force is one of the main ingredients of economic growth and prosperity.\n\nThis article profiles and projects U.S. labor force trends for a period of 100 years, from 1950 to 2050, on a decennial \nbasis. Changes in both growth rates of the population and labor force participation rates have created a steadily \ngrowing labor force that, compared with 1950, is today older, more diversified, and increasingly made up of women. \nThe same forces that have influenced the size and composition of the U.S. labor force over the past 50 years are \nexpected to shape the future of the workforce as well. Some of the key findings emanating from the research upon \nwhich the article is based are as follows:\n\n* Slowdown in growth of the labor force. The high growth rate of the civilian labor force (1) in the last 50 years will \nbe replaced by much lower growth rates in the next 50 years. The civilian labor force was 62 million in 1950 and \ngrew to 141 million in 2000, an increase of nearly 79 million, or an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent per year, \nbetween 1950 and 2000. It is projected that the labor force will reach 192 million in 2050, an increase of 51 million, \nor a growth rate of 0.6 percent annually, between 2000 and 2050. (See table 1.)\n\n* Changes in gender structure of the labor force. Women in the labor force increased their numbers at an extremely \nrapid pace in the past 50 years. It is anticipated that their labor force growth will slow markedly in the next 50 years. \nThe factor most responsible for the earlier high growth rate was the rapid increase in the labor force participation \nrate of women, which stood at 34 percent in 1950 and increased to 60 percent by 2000. The number of women in \nthe labor force rose from 18 million in 1950 to 66 million in 2000, an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent. The share of \nwomen in the labor force grew from 30 percent in 1950 to almost 47 percent in 2000, and the number of working \nwomen is projected to reach 92 million by 2050--on the basis of an annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. That same \nyear, women's share of the workforce is expected to be nearly 48 percent.\n\n* Changes in the age structure of the labor force. With the aging of the baby-boom generation, the older age \ncohorts are expected to make up a larger proportion of the labor force in the next two decades. The 55-and-older \nage group, which made up 13 percent of the labor force in 2000, is projected to increase to 20 percent by 2020. It is \nanticipated that, by 2050, the group will make up 19 percent of the labor force.\n\n\n* Changes in the racial and ethnic composition of the labor force. The labor force is expected to become more \ndiverse. With higher population growth and increasing participation rates, the share of minorities in the workforce is \nprojected to expand substantially. The share of white non-Hispanics is anticipated to decrease from 73 percent in \n2000 to 53 percent in 2050. Over the same period, Hispanics are expected to more than double their share, from 11 \npercent in 2000 to 24 percent of the labor force in 2050. Blacks also are expected to increase their share, from 12 \npercent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2050. Asians, the fastest-growing group in the labor force, are projected to \nincrease their share from 5 percent to 11 percent between 2000 and 2050.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, the Bureau) publishes medium-term, or 10-year, labor force projections every \n2 years. The latest ones covered the 2000-10 period. (2) The projections presented in this article provide a longer \nterm perspective on the labor force by looking 50 years ahead. As in the decade-long projection, (3) the projected \nlabor force is a product of two factors: the size and growth of the population by age, sex, race, and ethnicity and \nthe future trend of labor force participation rates for various age, sex, race, and ethnicity groups.\n\nThe Current Population Survey (CPS) (4) is the source of historical data on the civilian noninstitutional population \nand the labor force. The population projections and the CPS are based on estimates of births, deaths, and net \nimmigration since the most recent decennial census. The estimates are benchmarked to the census results. \nBecause population projections based on the 2000 census are not yet available, the Census Bureau's population \nprojections used in this article still reflect the 1990 census. (5)\n\nFuture labor force participation rates for 136 different groups, including both genders, 17 age groups, and 4 race \nand ethnicity groups, are estimated on the basis of the labor force participation behavior of each group in the past. \n(See \"Methodology used for the long-term labor force projections\".) By applying the projected labor force \nparticipation rates of each group to the projected population of that group, the size of the labor force is estimated, \nboth for detailed categories and for the economy as a whole.\n\nMethodology used for the long-term labor force projections\n\nProjections of labor force participation rates for each age, sex, race, and ethnicity group are developed initially by \nextrapolating trends, usually on the basis of participation behavior during the previous 7 years. Then, the resulting \nparticipation rates are modified when the projection for a specific labor force group is inconsistent with the results of \ncross-sectional and cohort analysis. This step ensures consistency in the projections across the various \ndemographic groups. Finally, the projected labor force participation rates are applied to the population projections, \nproducing a labor force projection for each of the different age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories. (For further \ninformation, see \"Employment Projections,\" in Handbook of Methods (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1999), Chapter \n13.)\n\nLabor force participation rates for the various sex, age, racial, and ethnic categories were projected, as just \ndescribed, to the year 2015 and were held constant thereafter. In similar long-term projections of the labor force, the \nchange in participation rates for various age and sex groups, usually based on their past behavior, is often assumed \nto approach zero beyond a certain point in the projection horizon. This assumption is due to uncertainties \nassociated with long-term change in factors affecting the decision to participate in the labor force. Still, despite the \nfact that detailed participation rates for various population categories are expected to be constant, the overall labor \nforce participation rate is projected to change through 2050. This overall mutability reflects the impact of changes in \nthe relative sizes of the various sex, age, race, and ethnic groups, each of which can have different levels of \nparticipation.\n\nPopulation growth and the changes in participation rates are the main determinants of labor force growth. Table 2 \npresents the growth rates of the civilian noninstitutional population, (6) the labor force participation rate, (7) and the \ncivilian labor force during the 100 years examined. As the rate of change in labor force participation decreases, \nmore of the growth rate of the labor force is accounted for by the growth rate of the population.\n\nIn the 1950-60 period, population growth alone was responsible for the growth of the labor force. During the \n196070 period, population growth contributed about 94 percent of the growth in the labor force. In the 1970-80 \n\n\n\nperiod, when the labor force participation of women underwent rapid growth, 76 percent of the labor force growth \nwas the result of population growth, and the rest was related to the growth of participation rates, mainly of women. \n(8) From 2000 to 2050, with the expected overall decline in the participation rate, participation growth is projected to \nexert even less influence, and the growth of the labor force will likely be due mostly to the impact of population \ngrowth.\n\nIn what follows, the analysis begins with a discussion of the major factors that have affected the trend of the labor \nforce in the past 50 years and their implications for future labor force change: (1) different birth patterns in the U.S. \npopulation during the previous 50 years; (2) the extremely rapid growth in the participation rate of women; and (3) \nthe growing racial and ethnic diversity of the labor force. Then the results of the long-term labor force projection are \npresented. Finally, two other important concepts in the study of the labor force--the median age and economic \ndependency--are discussed in light of the changes in the composition of the labor force.\n\nMajor factors affecting labor force change\n\nPopulation: birth patterns. A number of distinct birth patterns evolved in the population of the United States in the \nlast century that led to similar labor force patterns as the various cohorts (9) reached 16 years of age and joined the \nworkforce. These demographic patterns can be traced chronologically as follows:\n\n* Birth dearth: the decline in the number of births between the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\n* Baby boom: the significant increase in the number of births between 1946 and 1964, with the peak birth year \nbeing 1957.\n\n* Baby bust: a decrease in the number of births occurring between the end of the baby boom and the late 1970s.\n\n* Baby-boom echo or baby boomlet: a growth in the number of children born to the baby-boom generation during \nthe 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe effect of the foregoing demographic events can be seen in table 3, which shows the civilian noninstitutional \npopulation, by sex, race, age, and Hispanic origin, from 1950 to 2050.\n\nThe birth dearth can be seen in the decrease of a million people in the 25-34 age group during the 1950-60 period \nand a corresponding drop of 948,000 people in the 35-44 age group in the 1960-70 period. The same diminution in \nbirths can be further traced through succeeding decades as this cohort ages. The baby boom can be traced to the \nincrease of nearly 9.4 million people in the 16-24 age group during the 1960-70 period and 7.3 million in the 1970-\n80 period. This increase in births can again be seen in the 25-34 age group a decade later, during the 1970-80 \nperiod. The baby bust is reflected by the decrease of nearly 3.8 million in the 16-24 age group during the 1980-90 \nperiod. The same impact can be seen in succeeding decades in older age groups. The baby-boom echo also can \nbe seen in the increase of more than a million people in the 16-24 age group during the 1990-2000 period.\n\nThese distinct birth patterns can be traced as well in the shape of the population and labor force pyramids in three \nsnapshots for 1950, 2000, and 2050. The birth dearth can be clearly seen in the indentation of the bar representing \nthose in the 15-19 age group in the population pyramid of the 1950s. (See chart 1, top panel.) The surge in the \nbirths of the early baby-boom generation is reflected in the extended length of the bar corresponding to the 0-4 age \ngroup in 1950.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\nThe middle panel of chart 1 shows the population and labor force pyramid for 2000. The birth dearth of the late \n1920s and early 1930s is visible in the 65-69 age group. The swelling at the 35-54 age group in the population \npyramid clearly shows the share of the baby boomers in the total population in 2000. The baby bust is visible as \nthe indentation of the bar representing the 25-29 age group. The baby-boom echo is reflected in the bulge of the \n15-19 age group of the population.\n\n\n\nThe bottom panel of chart 1 shows the projected population pyramid in 2050. It is expected that, in that year, the \nbaby boomers will be concentrated primarily in the 85-and-older age category of the population, represented by \nrelatively longer bars, especially for women, compared with bars representing previous population cohorts. The \npyramid of 2050 looks rectangular in shape in the higher age brackets, indicative of the swelling population of \naging baby boomers.\n\nThe baby bust is reflected in 2050 as the indentation of the bars corresponding to the 80-84 age group of the \npopulation. The baby-boom echo is seen as the bulge in the 65-69 age group. A comparative look at the three \npopulation pyramids shows how their shapes have changed as a result of alterations in the sex and age \ncomposition of the population over the entire 100-year period. In addition, the effect that mortality differentials have \non the composition of the population during the century under examination is worth noting: women's tendency to \nexhibit lower mortality rates than men within specific age cohorts is visible in both tables for 2000 and 2050, \nespecially in the older age groups.\n\nLabor force participation: rapid growth of the participation rates of women. Among the factors that have contributed \nto the growth and development of the U.S. labor force, none has been as pronounced as the rise in the participation \nof women in the labor force. In the two decades after World War II, the U.S. economy enjoyed a major expansion, \ncoupled with increases in productivity, higher standards of living, and rapid acceleration in the growth of college \nenrollments. (10) Rapid economic growth vastly increased the demand for labor. The civil rights movement, \nlegislation promoting equal opportunity in employment, and the women's rights movement created an atmosphere \nthat was hospitable to more women working outside the home. The combination of all of these factors created \nstrong inducements for women to join the workforce, significantly affecting their participation rate.\n\nThe dramatic increase in the labor force participation rates of women during the period was accompanied by many \nother social, economic, and demographic changes in the status of women:\n\n* Women remained single more often.\n\n* Of those who married, many did so later in life, and the median age at first marriage increased substantially.\n\n* Women elected to stay in school longer, achieving higher educational attainment than in the past and pursuing \nbetter paying careers.\n\n* Women postponed childbirth to older ages and had fewer children than in previous decades. As a result of \nimproved child care, women tended to enter the labor force even before their children started school, and they were \nable to maintain a longer job tenure than in previous periods.\n\n* Women got divorced more often; this in itself increased their labor force participation rate. (11)\n\nIn 1950, the overall participation rate of women was 34 percent. (See table 4.) The rate rose to 38 percent in 1960, \n43 percent in 1970, 52 percent in 1980, and 58 percent in 1990 and reached 60 percent by 2000. The overall labor \nforce participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in 2010, at 62 percent. From then on, it is \nanticipated to decline slowly, falling to 57 percent in 2050. The projected decline after 2010 is due to the \nassumption that changes in participation rates will approach zero by 2015, combined with the gradual movement of \nan aging female labor force into age groups that traditionally have lower participation rates.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1980, the labor force participation rates of women in the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups increased \nby 20.5 percentage points and 14.4 percentage points, respectively. No other labor force group has ever \nexperienced an increase in participation rates of this magnitude in one decade. During the same period, the \nparticipation rate of women in the 16-24 age group increased by 10.6 percentage points. From 1980 to 1990, the \nparticipation rate for women in the 35-44 age group increased by 11.0 percentage points, and the rate for women in \nthe 45-54 age group increased by 11.3 percentage points. The Bureau projects that after 2010, the participation \nrates for three age groups--25-34, 35-44, and 45-54 will--remain above the 80-percent mark through 2050.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the participation rates of men and women has been decreasing steadily between 1950 and \n2000, and the Bureau expects this narrowing to continue into the future. As table 4 demonstrates, the difference \nbetween the participation rates of men and women was 53 percentage points in 1950, decreasing to 46 percentage \npoints in 1960. In 1970, the difference was reduced even further, to 36 percentage points. In 1980 and 1990, the \ndifference was 26 percentage points and 19 percentage points, respectively. In 2000, the difference was 15 \npercentage points. It is projected that, during the 2000-50 period, the men-women participation rate difference will \ndecrease even further, to about 10 percentage points in 2050. (See chart 2.)\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\nDiversity. During the last 50 years of the 20th century, the U.S. population grew more and more racially and \nethnically diverse. The greater diversity of the population resulted in an increased diversity in the labor force. \nFollowing the standards provided in the Office of Management and Budget's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, this \narticle divides the population and the labor force into four major racial categories: \"white,\" \"black,\" \"American \nIndian and Alaska Native,\" and \"Asian and Pacific Islander.\" (12) The Office of Management and Budget also \nrecognizes two ethnic groups: \"Hispanic origin\" and \"not of Hispanic origin.\" Although Hispanics can be of any race, \nmost report that they are white. Data on race and ethnicity are based on self-reports or self-identification.\n\nImmigration has been the major source of growing diversity. Most immigrants come to the United States seeking \nbetter job opportunities and higher wages. They tend to be in younger age groups with higher labor force \nparticipation rates. Because many come from high-fertility societies, they have considerably higher fertility rates \nthan those of the resident population, and this factor has contributed in large part to the growing diversity of the \nU.S. population and labor force.\n\nIn 1980, the first year data were available on both race and Hispanic origin, the total civilian noninstitutional \npopulation aged 16 years and older consisted of 87 percent whites (of which 82 percent were non-Hispanic \nwhites), 11 percent blacks, and 2 percent Asians and others. (See table 3.) In 2000, the share of whites had fallen \nto 83 percent (with the share of non-Hispanic whites declining to 73 percent), while the share of the black \npopulation rose to 12 percent and the share of Asians and others jumped to 5 percent. The share of Hispanics, \nwhich was 6 percent in 1980, soared to 11 percent by 2000. It is projected that the share of Hispanics will reach 13 \npercent of the population in 2010 and 23 percent in 2050.\n\nThe shares of the various race and ethnicity groups in the civilian noninstitutional population are projected to \nchange significantly between 2000 and 2050:\n\n* White non-Hispanics are expected to slowly decrease their share, to make up 54 percent of the civilian \nnoninstitutional population by 2050. The population of white non-Hispanics is actually projected to decrease \nbetween 2040 and 2050.\n\n* The Hispanic population, which had a 5.2-percent growth rate in the 1980-90 period and a 3.5-percent growth \nrate in the 1990-2000 period, is projected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2000-10 and is eventually expected to make up \n23 percent of the civilian noninstitutional population by 2050.\n\n* The black population is anticipated to increase at a much lower rate in future decades than in the past, and its \nshare is projected to constitute 15 percent of the total population by 2050.\n\n* The \"Asian and other\" category is projected to grow considerably in the coming years, with its members expected \nto make up 10 percent of the total civilian noninstitutional population in 2050.\n\nWith the influx of immigrants during the last three decades, the U.S. labor force is rapidly diversifying. The new \nimmigrants, mostly Hispanic and Asian, and in younger age groups with higher participation rates, are expected to \nincrease the overall participation rate and diversify the labor force even further in the coming decades. (See table \n4.) It is worth mentioning that the differences in the labor force participation rate by race and Hispanic origin are \nusually not as big as those among different age and sex groups. In 1980, the labor force participation rate was 65 \n\n\n\npercent for Asians, 64 percent for both Hispanics and white non-Hispanics, and 61 percent for blacks. It is projected \nthat in 2050, Asians will still have the highest participation rate, 65 percent, followed by Hispanics, with 64 percent. \nWhite non-Hispanics and blacks are expected to have participation rates of 61 percent and 60 percent, respectively.\n\nLabor force projections\n\nDuring the 1950-2000 period, the annual growth rate of the labor force was 1.6 percent, whereas, from 2000 to \n2050, the annual growth rate is projected to be 0.6 percent. (See table 1.) In the 1950-60 period, the labor force \nincreased at a 1.1-percent rate, the same as that of the population. (See table 5.) During 1960-70, labor force \ngrowth increased to 1.7 percent per year, as the baby-boom generation began entering the labor force and labor \nforce participation rates increased significantly. The annual growth rate of the labor force peaked at 2.6 percent \nduring the 1970-80 period, due mainly to the continued absorption of the baby-boomer cohorts into the job market \nand the even more rapid acceleration in the participation rate of women in the workforce. In the 1980-90 period, \nlabor force growth slowed down, because nearly all baby boomers who were to enter the labor force had already \ndone so. The growth rate during this period decreased to 1.6 percent.\n\nDuring the 1990-2000 period, the growth rate of the labor force decreased further, to 1.1 percent, a little higher than \nthe growth rate of the population. It is projected that the labor force growth rate will remain steady at 1.1 percent \nduring the 2000-10 period, falling to 0.6 percent in 2015-20 and 0.2 percent between 2015 and 2020. It is also \nprojected that during the 2020-30 period, the annual labor force growth rate will fall further, to 0.3 percent, \nwhereupon it will rise to 0.6 percent during both the 2030-40 and 2040-50 periods.\n\nThe size of the labor force was 62 million in 1950, of which nearly 44 million were men and 18 million were women. \nThe 62 million figure more than doubled during the 1950-2000 period, reaching nearly 141 million in 2000, with 75 \nmillion men and 66 million women. The labor force is projected to grow by 0.6 percent between 2000 and 2050, \nreaching 192 million--100 million men and 92 million women--the latter year. Following is a breakdown of the \nprojected labor force by sex and by age.\n\nSex. The number of men in the labor force has always been greater than the number of women, but, historically, the \ngrowth rate of women in the labor force has been significantly higher than that of men. As a result, women's share \nof the labor force has increased considerably during the last 50 years, moving from 30 percent in 1950 to 47 \npercent in 2000. It is projected that in 2050, the shares will be 48 percent for women and 52 percent for men.\n\nDuring the 1950-60 period, the women's workforce grew 2.4 percent annually in comparison with 0.6 percent for \nmen. In the next decade, from 1960 to 1970, the growth rate of the labor force for women was 3.1 percent per year, \nmore than three times greater than the labor force growth rate of men. During the 1970-80 period, the growth rate \nfor women was 3.7 percent, twice that for men. During 1990-2000 and 2000-10, the growth of the women's labor \nforce was 1.4 percent, compared with men's 0.9 percent. The disparity in labor force growth rates for men and \nwomen is expected to continue throughout the projection horizon, causing the gender gap in the U.S. workforce to \nshrink to 8.7 million by 2050.\n\nPopulation and labor force pyramids also show the gains made by women in their share of the workforce during \nthe last 50 years. (See chart 1.) In the 1950 pyramid, the labor force of women at all age groups looks different from \nthat of men. In 2000, however, because of the narrowing of the gender gap in the labor force, the shape and size of \nthe pyramid for both men and women look very much alike. As this trend continues to 2050, the shape of the \npyramid for both men and women becomes even more symmetric--a reflection of a further narrowing of the gender \ngap in the workforce.\n\nAge. Among all the age categories in the labor force, the 55-and-older group is expected to undergo the most \nsweeping changes in the years to come, due primarily to the aging of the baby-boom cohorts. The group's share in \nthe labor force was 17 percent in 1950. As a result of a number of factors, including the availability of Social \nSecurity to men 62 years of age since 1960, the increased availability of disability awards, and the money accrued \nin pensions, the share of those 55 and older decreased to 13 percent in 2000. However, the share is projected to \nincrease again in the next 50 years, reaching 20 percent of the total labor force in 2020 and then decreasing to 19 \n\n\n\npercent in 2050. The growth rate of the 65-and-older age group--1.2 percent in the 1980-90 period--rose to 2.0 \npercent during 1990-2000. The growth rate of this group within the labor force is projected to be 2.6 percent in the \n2000-10 period, 5.1 percent in 2010-15, and 3.4 percent between 2015 and 2020. After 2020, the growth rate of the \n65-and-older age group is projected to taper off as baby boomers begin to leave the labor force in increasing \nnumbers. The decrease in the labor force growth rate over this period is also a result of the increase in population \nin age groups with lower participation rates.\n\nThe share of the 35-44 age group peaked in 2000 at 27 percent. This group is expected to decline in numbers as \nthe baby boomers continue aging, but it will maintain its share of the labor force--between 21 and 22 percent--over \nthe next 50 years. The labor force share of the 45-54 age group is projected to decrease from 22 percent in 2000 to \n20 percent in 2020 as a result of retirements and because of departures from the labor force.\n\nThe 16-24 and 25-34 age groups are expected to maintain their shares of the labor force between 2000 and 2050. \nIn 2000, their shares were 16 percent and 23 percent, respectively. The Bureau projects that by 2050 their \nrespective shares will be about the same.\n\nLabor force rates by race and ethnicity\n\nWhite non-Hispanic labor force. The white non-Hispanic group has the largest share of the U.S. labor force, but that \nshare has been on the decline and is projected to continue to decline over the next 50 years. In 1980, the white \nnon-Hispanic labor force was 88 million, and its share of the labor force was 82 percent. Two decades later, in \n2000, the number of non-Hispanic whites increased to 103 million, but their share of the labor force fell to 73 \npercent. By 2015, the white non-Hispanic group is projected to reach 109 million, or 67 percent of the total labor \nforce. It is anticipated that, in 2020, the white non-Hispanic labor force will actually decrease by a little more than 2 \nmillion, to 107 million, which will constitute 65 percent of the total workforce. The white non-Hispanic share of the \nlabor force is projected to drop even further in later years, reaching a low of 53 percent in 2050.\n\nThe white non-Hispanic labor force grew 1.1 percent between 1980 and 1990 and 0.5 percent between 1990 and \n2000. The growth rate is expected to be 0.6 percent over the 2000-10 period and negative after 2015. These factors \nwill serve to make the labor force even more diverse by 2050.\n\nThe decline in the number of white non-Hispanics currently is accompanied by faster growth of other racial and \nethnic groups in the U.S. workforce. Also, the upcoming retirement of the baby boomers, a group that has a large \nshare of white non-Hispanic men, will lower that group's share of the total labor force. Finally, the low fertility rate \nand low migration of white non-Hispanics relative to other racial groups is another factor that will contribute to the \ngroup's decreasing share of both the population and the labor force.\n\nBlack labor force. In 1980, blacks had the second-largest share of the labor force, 10 percent. Their share \nincreased to 12 percent in 2000, and blacks continued to maintain their relative position as the second largest \namong all racial and ethnic groups. BLS projections indicate that by 2010, their share will increase to nearly 13 \npercent, after which blacks will slip to third place in their share of the labor force as Hispanics jump to a 13-percent \nshare.\n\nThe number of blacks in the labor force was 17 million in 2000 and is expected to be 27 million in 2050. The \nincrease will be due mostly to the faster growth of the black population through higher fertility rates among black \nwomen and relatively high participation rates, also among black women.\n\nHispanic origin. The share of Hispanics in the labor force was 6 percent in 1980 and increased to 11 percent in \n2000. It is projected that in 2010, the share of the Hispanic-origin group in the labor force will be 13 percent. The \nHispanic share is anticipated to increase steadily through 2050. Although the growth rate of Hispanics in the labor \nforce has declined somewhat from its peak of 6 percent during the 1980-90 period, it is still growing very rapidly. \nThe Bureau projects that the Hispanic-origin category will constitute 24 percent of the U.S labor force by 2050. The \ngrowing share of Hispanics in the labor force is due mainly to their high level of immigration from 1950 to 2000. \n\n\n\nThese new immigrants have been mostly in the younger age cohorts, with higher-than-average fertility rates, a \nfactor that, in large measure, contributes to their population growth in the United States.\n\nAsians and others. Asians have been the fastest-growing sector of the labor force in the past and are projected to \nremain so for the next 50 years. With 2.5 million people in the labor force in 1980, the category of \"Asians and \nothers\" had a labor force share of 2 percent that year. By 2000, with nearly 7 million, the group had more than \ndoubled its share, to 5 percent. The high growth of \"Asians and others\" is expected to continue through the \nprojection period. In 2050, the group is anticipated to number 21 million, or 11 percent of the labor force. As a result \nof a large number of immigrants in the last 50 years, this group, although small, is likely to be the fastest-growing \npart of the labor force.\n\nAs can be seen from table 5, racial and ethnic minorities have assumed an increasing presence in the labor force. \nThis presence is evident in the growing diversity of the workforce.\n\nMedian age\n\nThe foregoing analysis has demonstrated that the changes in the age structure of the population result in different \naggregate participation rates and could ultimately affect the number of people in the workforce. The median age \nsummarizes the age structure of the labor force and is defined as the age that splits the population group into two \nequal parts, with 50 percent younger and 50 percent older. (See table 6.)\n\nThe median age of the U.S population was at its highest in 1960, at 40.5 years. With the entry of the baby-boom \ngeneration into the labor force, the median age began to decrease, reaching a low of 34.6 years in 1980. In 1990, \nthe median age increased to 36.6. In 2000, the median age again increased, to 39.3, and was the same for men \nand women.\n\nThe aging of the baby boomers will result in significant changes in the age structure of the labor force, chief among \nthem an increase in its median age. The rise in the median age is projected to continue until 2010 and reach 40.6. \nWith the retirement of the baby-boom generation after 2015, the median age of the labor force will decrease slowly \nand is projected to be 39.7 by 2050. The retirement of a large number of white men in the boomer generation is \nprojected to lower men's median age to 40.2 in 2020 and 39.9 in 2050. Women's median age is expected to be \nhigher, at 40.7, in 2020 and to stay higher than men's in the decades that follow.\n\nThe Hispanic labor force is the youngest group, with a median age of 34.9 in 2000. The median age of Hispanics is \nprojected to increase to 37.6 in 2050, but the group will continue to have the lowest median age among all the race \nand ethnicity groups. The high fertility rate among Hispanics will keep their population and labor force relatively \nyounger throughout the projection period. In addition, the impact of large numbers of Hispanic immigrants, which \nare mostly in the younger age groups, is expected to be significant.\n\nEconomic dependency ratio\n\nThe economic dependency ratio is defined as the number of persons in the total population (including Armed \nForces personnel overseas and children) who are not in the labor force per 100 of those who are in the labor force. \n(See table 7.) For every 100 persons in the 1950 labor force, about 139 were not in the labor force. Of this group, \n48 percent were children under age 16, 43 percent were between 16 and 64 years of age, and only 10 percent \nwere 65 and older. With the influx of the baby boomers into the workforce and a significant drop in the number of \nbirths, the economic dependency ratio has decreased considerably since 1960. The ratio dropped below 100 for the \nfirst time in 1987 and declined further to 94 in 2000, of which 47 percent were children under 16, 30 percent were \nbetween 16 and 64 years of age, and 23 percent were 65 and older.\n\nIt is projected that the economic dependency ratio will continue to decline until 2010, when it is expected to reach a \nlow of 90 people dependent on every 100 workers. As the baby-boom generation retires and leaves the workforce \nsometime between 2010 and 2015, the economic dependency ratio is anticipated to rise again. The Bureau projects \n\n\n\nthat, by 2050, for every 100 people working, there will be 111 who are not in the labor force, of which 44 will be \nchildren under age 16, 30 will be between 16 and 64 years, and 37 will be 65 and older.\n\nWith the passage of each decade, the share of the 65-and-older age group in the total population will rise along \nwith the economic dependency ratio. In 1950, the number of older persons who were out of the workforce per 100 \nworking population was 15. In 2000, the figure rose to 22, and it is expected to reach 37 in 2050. The Census \nBureau anticipates more immigration between 2020 and 2050 in response to this increase in the projected \neconomic dependency ratio of the 65-and-older age group. The increase in the ratio is characterized as a \"dramatic \ndownward shift in the availability of potential workers relative to people outside the normal working age.\" (13)\n\nTHE LAST 50 YEARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY have witnessed momentous changes in the size, composition, \nand characteristics of the U.S. labor force. The same social, demographic, and economic forces that influenced the \nlevel, growth, and composition of the labor force during the past 50 years will continue to influence the workforce in \nthe coming decades. Chief among these forces has been an explosion of women's participation rates for all age \ngroups, which caused the share of women in the labor force to increase from 30 percent in 1950 to 47 percent in \n2000. In contrast to the last 50 years, during which the surge in women's participation propelled labor force growth, \nthe next 50 years will likely see stabilization in the growth of women's participation, resulting in workforce growth \ndropping to 0.6 percent annually.\n\nAnother factor responsible for the labor force growth of the past 50 years is the baby-boom generation. Just as the \nentry of the baby boomers swelled the ranks of the labor force in the last three decades, their exit will have a \nprofound effect on the level and composition of the U.S. labor force in the next two decades. The baby-boom \ngeneration will remain a generator of change even at its retirement.\n\nThe labor force will continue to grow more diverse, despite a slower rate of labor force growth among minorities. \nWith relatively high fertility rates and increasing participation rates, minorities in the workforce are projected to \nexpand their shares substantially. The share of Hispanics especially will rise steadily, approaching one-quarter of \nthe labor force.\n\nThe future is unknown and difficult to predict. Any attempt, such as this one, to glean what will happen in the future \nis an exercise in extrapolation of past trends and is based mainly on the assumption that the future will be subject to \nthe same economic structures as the past. However, by relaxing or otherwise modifying one's assumptions, one \ncan arrive at differing sets of results. In fact, the future is always full of surprises, and 50 years is a relatively long \ntime on the scale of economics, so one should not be surprised if the future labor force changes in ways just as \ndramatic as those of the last 50 years.\n\nNotes\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: The author thanks Howard N Fullerton, Jr., of the Office of Occupational Statistics and \nEmployment Projections, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for valuable comments and guidance in the preparation of this \narticle.\n\n(1) The civilian labor force consists of all employed and unemployed persons actively seeking jobs in the civilian \nnoninstitutional population.\n\n(2) See Howard N Fullerton, Jr., and Mitra Toossi, \"Labor force projections to 2010: steady growth and changing \ncomposition,\" Monthly Labor Review, November 2001, pp. 21-38.\n\n(3) The following assumptions about the future course of events are made before the labor force projections are \ncarried out:\n\n* The current definition of the labor force will remain the same over the projection period.\n\n* Work patterns will not change significantly during the projection period.\n\n\n\n* No major war or social upheaval will occur during the projection period.\n\n* Laws and legislation will not change the conditions under which individuals decide to enter or stay out of the labor \nforce.\n\n* The general structure of economic relationships in the future will be roughly identical to those in the past, and \neconomic condition will follow the basic trends of the post-World War II era.\n\n(4) The CPS is a monthly survey of households, conducted by the Bureau of the Cenusus for the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics.\n\n(5) Fredrick W.
