{"title": "Homegrown Scientists and Engineers", "body": "\nThe May 4 lead editorial, \"Skilled Masses; Keeping the world's talent in America,\" said that \"The tens of thousands \nof H-1B [visa] rejects will constitute some of the world's best and brightest, and America is foolish to block them \nfrom the U.S. economy. After all, according to the National Science Foundation, a third of all science and \nengineering doctorates awarded in the United States go to foreign students (whose numbers are not limited).\"\n\nThe suggestion seems to be that the large percentage of foreigners earning doctorates is an argument for larger H-\n1B visa quotas. But policymakers -- including the National Science Board, which oversees the National Science \nFoundation -- have made it clear that increasing the number of native-born scientists and engineers is a priority. \nThe only way to accomplish that is to raise\n\nsalaries and improve working\n\nconditions for scientists. A large influx of immigrant labor has the opposite effect.\n\nThis is a difficult issue, and it boils down to competing national priorities: Do we favor cheaper and more abundant \nskilled labor -- in which case increased quotas make sense -- or a healthier domestic supply?\n\nJIM AUSTIN\n\nPortland, Maine\n\nThe writer is editor of Science Careers.org, which is published by the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience.\n"}
