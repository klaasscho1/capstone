As officers get out of the van, migrant workers shout, \n'Officers are here for a crackdown,' and then scramble to escape. The Thai man was found some 100 meters away \nfrom the factory and was transferred to a hospital, but died. The cause of his death was severe damage to his \ninternal organs. \n\nWith an investigation into his death still underway, he is believed to have died as he attempted to flee. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acIn the \noperation, eight unregistered migrants -- three from Thailand, four from China and one from Vietnam - were \napprehended. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe tragic incident is only the latest case of migrants who were injured or even killed during \ncrackdowns by immigration officers.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acActivists accuse the immigration authorities of abusing their authority \nand violating the undocumented migrants' human rights. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acMore fundamentally, however, they say the country's \nimmigration policy, which they see as inducing a surge of undocumented migrants, must be fixed. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acCrackdown \non unregistered migrants\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\u00e3\u20ac\u20acActivists see the Thai man's death as a result of excessive force.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'When migrant \nworkers are chased, they panic and start to run around in factories where machines are still running and there are \nmany dangerous objects,' said Kim Kyung-mi, an interpreter who has helped four Chinese nationals captured \nduring the crackdown.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Those caught along with the deceased Thai man were shaken by the crackdown as \nthey feel they could have faced a similar situation. They said they were too afraid to leave their home for days,' said \nthe activist from Gimhae Migrant Human Rights Center. 'It is inhumane.'\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe Justice Ministry says the officers \nfollowed the ministry protocol, saying it was reasonable law enforcement and unnecessary force was not used. \n\u00e3\u20ac\u20acUnder the Justice Ministry's directive, immigration officers are required to gather information about \nunregistered migrants, make plans for a crackdown including safety measures, and visit the scene in advance. \nUpon arrival, they are required to show their identification cards to migrant workers' employer and seek consent \nbefore conducting a raid.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'There are many cases of immigration officers not following legal procedures -- such \nas failing to present their identification cards or seeking the consent of employers before carrying out crackdowns,' \nShekh al-Mamun, a Bangladeshi official from the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants' Trade Union, said.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'The \ncrackdown process is dangerous as immigration officers treat unregistered migrant workers as criminals and \nchase them.'\u00e3\u20ac\u20acIn 2018, Than Zaw Htay, a migrant from Myanmar who was 27, also fell and died at a construction \nsite in Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, while trying to escape a crackdown. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acAccording to government data, seven \npeople were killed and some 70 were injured during crackdowns over the past decade. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acUnder the Moon Jae-in \nadministration, the Justice Ministry has stepped up crackdowns on unregistered migrant workers by partnering \nwith other relevant bodies amid growing complaints that the migrants are 'stealing jobs.' \u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe intensified \ncrackdowns are necessary to discourage migrants from illegally staying in the country, the ministry's official said in \nan email response to The Korea Herald, citing a sharp increase in their number.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acAn estimated 380,000 migrants \nare staying in Korea without valid documents, according to the ministry's data. In comparison, the figure stood at \n208,971 in 2016.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe ministry also pointed out public concerns over foreigners taking jobs, especially at \nconstruction sites. Turning a blind eye to the rise of undocumented migrants is also unfair to those who legally \narrive and stay in the country, it said. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acKim Hyung-jin, head of the Gimhae Migrant Human Rights Center, called \nfor stricter legal procedures regarding crackdowns -- such as making it mandatory to seek a warrant before raiding \n\n\nthe workplaces.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acBut the Justice Ministry is cautious about it. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Crackdowns on foreigners illegally staying and \nliving in Korea is an administrative procedure to address immigration law violations, so applying criminal law \nprocedures -- such as seeking a warrant (to apprehend them) -- is not in line with the administrative purpose of \ncatching and promptly deporting them,' the ministry said.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acRevisiting immigration policy \u00e3\u20ac\u20acSuch crackdowns, \nhowever, have done little to reduce the number of undocumented migrants. If anything, they appear to have pushed \nthem to go into hiding, making them more vulnerable to human rights abuses. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Currently, crackdowns take \nplace only at some workplaces, meaning that the measures are not strong enough to send a warning to employers \nand foreign workers. It is just for show,' Cho Young-kwan, a lawyer for Migrants Center Friend.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe Justice \nMinistry stresses the need to raise the number of personnel in conducting crackdowns on unauthorized migrants. \nAt present, there are 1,461 unauthorized migrants for every officer. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acTo curb illegal immigration, the government \nshould address the fundamental cause -- Korea's short-sighted policy which activists say 'produces' unregistered \nmigrants -- rather than only focus on cracking down on them, he noted. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acKorea opened its doors wider for \nforeigners during national events such as the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and has eased visa \nrequirements for tourists, most recently for those from Thailand and Kazakhstan.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acMost of the undocumented \nworkers overstay their visas after arriving here legally on work or student visas, or remaining here after entering the \ncountry on a visa-free entry scheme, according to the ministry. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Whether they arrive on a visa-free scheme or a \nstudent visa, they come to Korea to find work. There is also a demand for them as domestic employers seek cheap \nlabor,' the lawyer Cho said. 'This structure should be fixed to tackle the rise of foreigners without a legal status and \nto protect the labor market.'\u00e3\u20ac\u20acKorea has signed an agreement under the Employment Permit System with 16 \ncountries in Southeast and Central Asia to fill low-skilled jobs in such sectors as manufacturing, fishing and \nagriculture, which are shunned by Koreans due to the low pay and poor working conditions.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acStill, the influx of \nforeign workers entering the country legally appears to fall short of meeting the demand of small manufacturers and \nfarming sector, which creates opportunities for unregistered migrants. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acAl-Mamun, the Bangladeshi official from \nthe Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants' Trade Union, said that the government should bring them within the legal \nframework. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Unauthorized workers who have been in Korea for more than 15 years should be brought under the \nlegal framework so that their skills and experiences can contribute to the economy. That's what Korean employers \nwant as well,' he said.By Ock Hyun-ju (laeticia.ock@heraldcorp.com)\n"}
