{"title": "Cleaning Executives Indicted in $18 Million Fraud", "body": "\nThree executives of a national cleaning and maintenance company were indicted on Thursday on charges of \ndefrauding the federal government of more than $18 million in employment taxes owed on behalf of hundreds of \nillegal immigrant workers.\n\n  The company, Rosenbaum-Cunningham International, performed janitorial services for theme-restaurant chains \nlike the House of Blues, Hard Rock Cafe and Dave & Busters, as well as for the Grand Traverse Resort and Spa in \nAcme, Mich.\n\nNearly 200 immigrant workers at some of the restaurants were arrested early Thursday in 17 states and the District \nof Columbia as part of the investigation of the company, which is being conducted by United States Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  The indictment says the executives hired illegal immigrants, primarily from Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, \nand then constructed an elaborate scheme of shell companies, bank accounts and cash-only payroll procedures to \navoid paying millions of dollars in federal taxes on the workers' wages from 1999 until today.\n\n  The executives are the company president, Richard M. Rosenbaum; its vice president, Edward Scott \nCunningham; and its controller, Christina A. Flocken. The 23-count indictment was unsealed on Thursday in \nFederal District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich. \n\n  Mr. Rosenbaum, 60, of Longwood, Fla., was arrested on Thursday in Florida and was held in federal custody \nthere. Mr. Cunningham, 43, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Ms. Flocken, 59, also of Longwood, were issued \nsubpoenas and are expected to appear voluntarily in Federal District Court in Western Michigan. No court dates \nhave been set.\n\n  The company is incorporated in Nevada but operates primarily out of West Palm Beach.\n\n  From 2001 to 2005, the government says, Rosenbaum-Cunningham International received gross payments from \nits various clients of $54,327,845.\n\n  By failing to pay taxes on their employees' income, Social Security and Medicare, the three executives cheated \nthe government of $18,640,345 and used about a third of the excess money to finance the ''extravagant lifestyle \ncosts'' of lavish houses, luxury boats, racehorses and college tuition, the indictment said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\n"}
