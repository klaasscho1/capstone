The workers were heading east in search of better jobs on the East \nCoast.\n\nThe 15 injured passengers were taken to area hospitals in Columbia on Sunday. Passengers told the Missouri \nHighway Patrol that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel, the patrol said.\n\nImmigration agents on Tuesday asked the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas City to charge Mancilla-Santiago with \nalien smuggling, Rusnok said. Mancilla-Santiago and two other passengers were being held Tuesday night at a jail \nin Shawnee County, Kan. Rusnok said Mancilla-Santiago has been deported from the United States twice before.\n\nThe 2001 Chevrolet van that crashed had California license plates and was scheduled to make stops in New York, \nWashington, South Carolina and Georgia, Rusnok said.\n"}
