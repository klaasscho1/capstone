{"title": "Facts on immigrants and health care", "body": "\nConcerns about the impact of immigrants on the U.S. health care system spurred the Kaiser Family Foundation to \nlook at the issue. Though non-citizens - both legal and undocumented immigrants - are more likely to lack \ninsurance, they are not the primary cause of the country's growing uninsured problem, according to the foundation. \nKaiser found that:\n\nNon-citizens receive significantly less health care than U.S. citizens. Largely due to their higher uninsured rate, \nnon-citizens are less likely to receive medical care. In 2005, average annual per capita health expenditure for non-\ncitizens was $1,797 versus $3,702 for citizens.\n\nNon-citizens are far less likely to use the ER. Some 13 percent of adult non-citizens report an emergency room visit \nin the last year versus 20 percent for citizens. Also, communities with low rates of ER use tend to have much higher \nconcentrations of non-citizens than areas with high rates of ER use.\n\nNotes\n\n Health business \n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO\n\n PHOTO - (Person listening to a globe with a stethoscope) \n"}
