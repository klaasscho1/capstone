They also swiftly rejected an increased bid   thought to be near--- \u00a310m   from Birmingham \nCity for McGeady.\n\nThe arrival of Keane prompted scenes of celebration as thousands of fans gathered outside Celtic Park last night. \nThe striker was greeted with roars as he said:  It s unbelievable. It s no secret I have always been a Celtic fan.  He \npledged to do his best to bring success to the club as he brandished the iconic No.7 shirt that has been worn by \nJimmy Johnstone and Henrik Larsson. Keane, the Republic of Ireland s all-time top scorer with 41 goals, told a \npacked press conference:  To get a reception like that was brilliant. \n\nHe had decided to come to the club because he  wanted to play football . He added:  I have come here at the peak \nof my career. I want to help Celtic win the league.  Keane will be at Rugby Park tonight for the match against \nKilmarnock and  hopes to be involved .  It s up to me to come here and do well,  he said.\n\nThe Celtic board has thus backed Tony Mowbray in his search for the Clydesdale Bank Premier League title with \neight signings in the transfer window. Keane was joined at Parkhead by Diomansy Kamara, the Senegalese striker \nsigned on loan from Fulham, and Edson Braafheid, the Bayern Munich left-back, also signed on loan. Mowbray has \nalso recruited Ki Sung-Yueng, Jos Hooiveld, Thomas Rogne, Morten Rasmussen and Paul Slane. Celtic concluded \na sale. Scott McDonald left Celtic yesterday to sign for Gordon Strachan s Middlesbrough for \u00a33.5m.\n\nBut it was the signing of Keane that Celtic proved the most sensational of the window. The 29-year-old striker has \nbeen linked consistently with a move to the club. Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, revealed last night that \nhe had been trying to enlist the player for some time.\n\n He did not take a lot of persuading,  he said of the talks with Keane yesterday.  He would not be drawn on whether \nthe striker could become a Celtic player permanently. But he added coyly:  Players who come to Celtic rarely want \nto leave Celtic. \n\nKeane has made 25 appearances for Spurs this season but has recently been confined to the substitutes  bench. \nHe arrives at Celtic with the blessing of his manager, Harry Redknapp.  He needs to be playing and to go to Celtic \nis a dream come true for him,  Redknapp said last night.\n\nKeane signed for Spurs in 2002, making almost 254 appearances and scoring 108 goals, before joining Liverpool \nfor around \u00a320m in July 2008. However, he went on to make only 15 appearances for the Anfield side and rejoined \nSpurs in February 2009 for \u00a312m, taking his cumulative transfer fees to more than \u00a370m. His previous clubs include \nWolverhampton Wanderers, Coventry City, Inter Milan and Leeds United.\n\n\nIvan Ramis of Real Mallorca and Sean St Ledger of Preston North End were thought to be targets for Celtic but the \ndeadline passed without deals for the defenders.

It does not curb \nthe freedom of religious groups. \n\nHuman rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the Pope s comments amounted to a  coded attack on the legal rights \ngranted to women and gay people . He said:  He seems to be defending discrimination by religious institutions and \ndemanding that they should be above the law. \n\nKeith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said:  We have no objection to him coming \nas a spiritual leader but we do have a problem with him coming to Britain as a head of state. We don t believe that \nthe Vatican should have that degree of power and we don t believe the Government should be paying for a formal \nvisit.\n\n The doctrine that the Vatican and the Pope promotes is very much contrary to what the vast majority of people \nbelieve is appropriate, including many Catholics. His views on homosexuality and birth control are totally \nunrepresentative and this [visit] gives him a platform, which we don t think is appropriate. \n\nThe controversy comes amid divisions within the church in Scotland over the traditional Latin Mass, which is being \nchampioned by the Vatican.\n\nFigures compiled by the Archdiocese of Glasgow ahead of the Pope s visit revealed only 26 out of 52,000 practising \nCatholics in Scotland s largest diocese choose to take part in the traditional form of worship.\n\nThe Pope was yesterday addressing bishops from England and Wales who were on a five-yearly visit to the \nVatican.

For \nsome, like Harry Redknapp, it can be the time of year when reputations are reinforced. For others such as Gordon \nStrachan, when they are seriously undermined.\n\nTony Mowbray was not the only manager to adopt a scatter-gun approach to the end of the January transfer \nwindow. While the Celtic manager was completing deals for Edson Braafheid, Diomansy Kamara and Paul Slane \nyesterday, Gordon Strachan, his predecessor at Parkhead, was ushering through the late purchases of Scott \nMcDonald from Celtic, and Lee Miller, the Aberdeen and Scotland striker.\n\nThere was even time for some business with the arch-wheeler-dealer Redknapp, with Mowbray securing  Robbie \nKeane from Tottenham Hotspur on loan for the rest of the season and Strachan adding the promising Spurs right-\nback Kyle Naughton to his ranks.\n\nFor Strachan, just as it has been for Mowbray, this was a board putting its money where its mouth is   a recognition \nthat both managers will be given every opportunity to achieve their respective goals, be it promotion to the  Premier \nLeague or a 43rd Scottish league title.\n\nMcDonald became the fifth player to reunite with his old manager. It would have been six had Gary Caldwell opted \nfor the Riverside Stadium instead of a move to Wigan Athletic, but there is a rationale behind Strachan s thinking \nwhich extends beyond mere sentimental myopia.\n\nMuch mirth has been made following the en masse arrival of Strachan s  duds  at Middlesbrough, but the signings \ndeserve a more reasoned analysis than that.\n\nMcDonald, Stephen McManus and Barry Robson were key figures in a Celtic side which lifted the title little more \nthan 18 months ago. They are seasoned Champions League campaigners, and internationalists. They were also \nStrachan s men and for that they paid a price whether deemed guilty by association or because they felt unwanted \nwhen their mentor moved on. Willo Flood and Chris Killen, peripheral figures, under Strachan were never really \n\n\n\ngiven the opportunity to prove their worth under Mowbray, but have a pedigree at Championship level while the \nlatter is also a regular goalscorer in international football for New Zealand.\n\nIt may be that Killen, however, finds himself on the fringes once more with the arrival of Miller and McDonald. He \nwill take little comfort from the fact that McDonald scored 50 goals in 88 league appearances for Celtic after joining \nthe club in the summer of 2007. The Australian s arrival at Middlesbrough is timely and he will be entering a \ndressing room with familiar faces and a manager who values him.\n\nStrachan has positioned the north-east club on the shoulder of those sides occupying the play-off places. The least \nSteve Gibson, the Middlesbrough chairman, will expect is promotion through the back door.\n\nGranted, Strachan has lost his best player in the highly-rated Adam Johnson, who secured a move to Manchester \nCity for an undisclosed fee just as the transfer window closed, but his mark on the Middlesbrough squad after just \none transfer window is significant. \n\nAs is Mowbray s on Celtic s. Strachan was roundly criticised for failing to act last season with the title all but in the \nbag. Twelve months on, his successor has been given the backing to overhaul a 10-point deficit all of his own \nmaking. \n\nBravery can bring about the downfall of even the most astute gamblers. Or it can bring rich rewards.\n\n THE VERBAL vote of confidence in a manager is not worth the paper it is not written on. The actions of the Celtic \nboard last night have a value far surpassing the millions they have spent in the transfer window. The message from \nthe East End of Glasgow is that the revolution may be bloody, even messy, but it will be bankrolled.\n\nThe signing of Robbie Keane acts as a stunning headline to a fascinating story. Tony Mowbray s position has been \nundermined by whispers. Celtic shouted out a rebuttal. Money does not talk in football, it screams. \n\nThe Keane coup is a central part of the Mowbray revolution. It signifies that Celtic are not frightened to spend and \nthat they are prepared to back their manager. If any further evidence was needed one just had to be at Celtic s \ntraining ground yesterday. The Republic of Ireland captain joins Diomansy Kamara, Edson Braafheid, Ki Sung-\nYueng, Jos Hooiveld, Thomas Rogne, Morten Rasmussen and Paul Slane as arrivals during the transfer window.\n\nThe rural retreat of Lennoxtown has also witnessed a bloodbath reminiscent of a Chicago February of times past. \nMowbray has been portrayed as weak, indecisive and vacillating by his critics. The strongest evidence suggests, \nhowever, that Skinny Tony is a ruthless hitman. Mark Brown, Willo Flood, Chris Killen, Gary Caldwell, Stephen \nMcManus, Danny Fox, Barry Robson and Scott McDonald are players who regularly featured on matchdays, even if \nBrown and Flood were to be found on the bench. Mowbray has counted them out. \n\nOthers have gone, too. Graham Carey, Cillian Sheridan, Ben Hutchinson, Simon Ferry and Ryan Conroy are out on \nloan.  It would have taken a good offer to prise Andreas Hinkel from the club but it could have been done. Lee \nNaylor survives until the summer. Speculation continues over Scott Brown s long-term future. Others stay  on \nsufferance.\n\nBasically, Mowbray has taken Aiden McGeady and Artur Boruc aside and left the rest to be picked off by other \nclubs. It is an audacious, highly risky strategy but it will find favour with many Celtic fans.\n\nThe media has concentrated fire on Mowbray but a substantial section of the support has become tired of the \nmediocrity offered up in a calendar year that has witnessed one title surrendered to Rangers and another almost \npledged to the Ibrox side.\n\nThe Mowbray revolution raises the big questions. The first is: will it work? The second: how long will be Mowbray be \ngiven?\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to answer the first. Football restricts all definitive statements  to the field of play.  Let s wait and see. \nWhat you do is try and bring quality footballers in,  said Mowbray when asked how quickly his reconstructed team \nwould gel.\n\n They have to be quality if they are to replace the ones we ve let go. Ultimately the team will be judged on the pitch \nover the period  of time   whether that be  16 games [left in the league] or invariably for us the next game. \n\nMowbray now has  Marc-Antoine Fortune, Rasmussen, Kamara, Georgios Samaras and Keane jousting for two \nstriking spots. How will he make it work? \n\n That s the balancing act for any coach. You try to get the chemistry right in the team,  he said of his options before \nthe Keane deal was completed.  The team is about balance and sometimes that s not right because of injuries or \nsuspensions. I just want to create as many good options for this football team and, hopefully, we ll get the chemistry \nright. \n\nIt is a problem that every other manager in Scotland would love to solve. The Mowbray signings have a degree of \nversatility. Rasmussen is a stereotypical front man but Kamara can play wide and Keane can play up front, in the \nhole or wide in a midfield four. \n\nThe other major question on Keane is just how can Celtic finance this deal? Is it just a gamble to win the league, \nthus pressurising Rangers financially? This reasoning suggests that if Celtic win the title the Ibrox side could be \nlooking at a difficult Champions League qualifier, with still no buyer for the club. This, in turn, could force an exodus \nof Rangers players. \n\nBut Rangers are still 10 points in front at the top of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League. Celtic s strategy can not \nbe based on mere hope.\n\nThere are only two possible sources for the funding of the Keane move. It is not a cheap bit of business. When \nWest Ham United enquired about the availability of the Tottenham Hotspur striker, they were told that Spurs wanted \na \u00a31m loan fee and the striker s \u00a370,000-a-week wages had to be paid in full.\n\nThis was too rich for the East London club. So how can it be a viable option for a club surviving on the scraps \noffered by the SPL? \n\nThe first observation is that Celtic have no debt. The second is that the club s majority shareholder is Dermot \nDesmond. The Irish businessman had input into the arrival of Roy Keane at Celtic. It would be no surprise to learn \nthat he helped in the transfer of the striker from Spurs. \n\nPeter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, also hinted late last night that the Glasgow club might not have to pay all \nof Keane s wages. He said an agreement had been made with Spurs over the salary, fuelling specualtion that the \nNorth London club may be making some contribution to their captain s salary. Lawell, though, would not elaborate, \nciting that the agreement was confidential.\n\nA substantial bill will have to paid for the international striker. But there are solid business reasons, too, for bringing \nKeane to Celtic Park. \n\nMore than 20,000 seats have remained empty at some home matches. That is a lot of unbought pies and \nprogrammes. The top-dollar seats in the executive boxes have been particularly hard hit by the recession in both \nthe economy and Celtic s fortunes. Half-season tickets have also been offered on a regular basis to a largely \nuninterested public.\n\nThis has all changed with one stroke of a pen. Tickets for Celtic games will be at a premium. Merchandising, too, \nwill be given a boost.  It will not be a difficult task to spot a shirt with Keane stamped on it in the West of Scotland, \nand beyond, later this week. \n\n\n\nCeltic have lifted their supporters. There will be excitement about seeing a player of Keane s undoubted ability on a \nScottish football field. But this must be complemented by tangible success. \n\nAnd this brings up the second major question: how long will Mowbray be given? Will Celtic tolerate failure this \nseason in the hope that the manager is building a side capable of sustained domestic success and of competing in \nthe Champions League?\n\nThe enduring joy and constant irritation of football is that it defies any notions of certainty. Keane could fail, \nMowbray could fall and the hopes of Celtic could drown in the dangerous waters of change.\n\nBut Celtic have invested in their future and, crucially, their manager. The stock of the board has already risen in the \neyes of the fans. The team must follow suit. The revolution has started. Its first test awaits tonight at Rugby Park.\n\nTHE VERBAL vote of confidence in a manager is not worth the paper it is not written on. The actions of the Celtic \nboard last night have a value far surpassing the millions they have spent in the transfer window. The message from \nthe East End of Glasgow is that the revolution may be bloody, even messy, but it will be bankrolled.\n\nThe signing of Robbie Keane acts as a stunning headline to a fascinating story.

I just want to create as many good options for this football team and, hopefully, we ll get the chemistry \nright. \n\nIt is a problem that every other manager in Scotland would love to solve. The Mowbray signings have a degree of \nversatility. Rasmussen is a stereotypical front man but Kamara can play wide and Keane can play up front, in the \nhole or wide in a midfield four. \n\nThe other major question on Keane is just how can Celtic finance this deal? Is it just a gamble to win the league, \nthus pressurising Rangers financially? This reasoning suggests that if Celtic win the title the Ibrox side could be \nlooking at a difficult Champions League qualifier, with still no buyer for the club. This, in turn, could force an exodus \nof Rangers players. \n\nBut Rangers are still 10 points in front at the top of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League. Celtic s strategy can not \nbe based on mere hope.\n\nThere are only two possible sources for the funding of the Keane move. It is not a cheap bit of business. When \nWest Ham United enquired about the availability of the Tottenham Hotspur striker, they were told that Spurs wanted \na \u00a31m loan fee and the striker s \u00a370,000-a-week wages had to be paid in full.\n\nThis was too rich for the East London club. So how can it be a viable option for a club surviving on the scraps \noffered by the SPL? \n\nThe first observation is that Celtic have no debt. The second is that the club s majority shareholder is Dermot \nDesmond. The Irish businessman had input into the arrival of Roy Keane at Celtic. It would be no surprise to learn \nthat he helped in the transfer of the striker from Spurs. \n\nPeter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, also hinted late last night that the Glasgow club might not have to pay all \nof Keane s wages. He said an agreement had been made with Spurs over the salary, fuelling specualtion that the \nNorth London club may be making some contribution to their captain s salary. Lawell, though, would not elaborate, \nciting that the agreement was confidential.\n\nA substantial bill will have to paid for the international striker. But there are solid business reasons, too, for bringing \nKeane to Celtic Park. \n\nMore than 20,000 seats have remained empty at some home matches. That is a lot of unbought pies and \nprogrammes. The top-dollar seats in the executive boxes have been particularly hard hit by the recession in both \nthe economy and Celtic s fortunes. Half-season tickets have also been offered on a regular basis to a largely \nuninterested public.\n\nThis has all changed with one stroke of a pen. Tickets for Celtic games will be at a premium. Merchandising, too, \nwill be given a boost.  It will not be a difficult task to spot a shirt with Keane stamped on it in the West of Scotland, \nand beyond, later this week. \n\nCeltic have lifted their supporters. There will be excitement about seeing a player of Keane s undoubted ability on a \nScottish football field. But this must be complemented by tangible success. \n\nAnd this brings up the second major question: how long will Mowbray be given? Will Celtic tolerate failure this \nseason in the hope that the manager is building a side capable of sustained domestic success and of competing in \nthe Champions League?\n\nThe enduring joy and constant irritation of football is that it defies any notions of certainty. Keane could fail, \nMowbray could fall and the hopes of Celtic could drown in the dangerous waters of change.\n\n\n\nBut Celtic have invested in their future and, crucially, their manager. The stock of the board has already risen in the \neyes of the fans. The team must follow suit. The revolution has started. Its first test awaits tonight at Rugby Park.\n\nDONALD Trump has handed the Scottish golfing estate construction contract to an Irish developer.

The appeal judges reserved their ruling to a later date.\n\nHE has picked some of the world s most famous and expensive multi-millionaire footballers during a 24-year career \nas Manchester United s manager.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, Eric Cantona and David Beckham are just some of the star names that trip off Sir Alex Ferguson \ns tongue. \n\nYesterday, the Glasgow-born boss revealed that, despite signing such household names, he can still remember off \nby heart the names of his team-mates in his former school s squad.\n\nSir Alex, 68, was meeting pupils at his alma mater, Govan High School, in the city s south side, when he was \nshown a black and white photograph of himself wearing his striped number 10 shirt.\n\nThen he was Alexander Chapman Ferguson, simply another cheeky schoolboy, so determined to make it as a \nprofessional footballer that he failed to apply himself academically.\n\nAlthough several have since died, the former inside forward said he still keeps in touch with the remainder of the \nteam. He was also quick to remember the under-16 squad s successes   and the name of the teams who beat \nthem.\n\n\n\n I still remember my time on the school under-16 football team vividly,  he said. \n\n We won the Whitefield Cup, the Castle Cup and the Under-15s Cup. We did lose a game to Calder High from \nLothian, I remember that.\n\n Our under-18 team was also beaten by Holyrood and St Mungo schools. The school had a good academic record \nand a very strong sense of discipline. It s important to remember your roots. \n\nOn a whistlestop tour of his former home town, Sir Alex also viewed Glasgow South West Regeneration Agency s \nOrkney Street Enterprise Centre and drugs charity the Preshal Trust.\n\nHowever, it was at Govan High School, which this year celebrates its centenary, that the former Rangers player \nspent the most time.\n\nAlthough he would have given any of his players his famous hairdryer treatment for being late, the managerial \nlegend was 15 minutes behind schedule for his speaking engagement as he was mobbed by eager young \nautograph hunters.\n\nThe school s dux, David Whitten, 16, was given the honour of making a vote of thanks at a special assembly. \n\nDavid, from Drumoyne, said he was terrified to be sharing the stage  with his hero. He said:  I was shaking and \npanicking beforehand   I was so nervous. Sir Alex is a sheer inspiration.\n\n It s so good to see that it doesn t matter what area you come from, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. \n\n It s also amazing to think that at the age of 68 he s still in the position and managing one of the biggest clubs in the \nworld.\n\nGovan s most famous son spoke of his pride in his former school and the strong ethos of discipline that marked his \nschool days. He told pupils and staff about his fond memories of Govan High, today Glasgow s smallest secondary \nschool with a role of  just 344.\n\nAlthough the football manager is its most famous former pupil, the school also boasts Tony Blair s father Leo as \nalumni along with Bill Martin, an Ivor Novello-winning songwriter, \n\nThe school, then based in Langlands Road, opened its doors to its first pupils in February 1910, but was destroyed \nby fire in the 1960s.\n\nA replacement school opened in Ardnish Street in 1969, its current location.\n\nGovan High boasts the city s only fully-working hairdressing salon, a swimming pool and a full-size dance studio, \nand is to celebrate 100 years with a year-long series of events.\n\nSir Alex also told pupils:  You have no worries about the future of this place   with your headteacher you re in very \ngood hands. \n\nHeadteacher Iain White added:  We are so pleased that Sir Alex Ferguson   and many other past pupils   have \nagreed to take part in our centenary celebrations.\n\n He is an inspiration for us all and shows that if you work hard and follow your dreams, they really do come true. \n\nSir Alex last night attended a civic reception of 220 guests held by Lord Provost Bob Winter at Glasgow City \nChambers.\n\n Robbie Keane has always been a player in search of appreciation, something beyond the affection of the crowd \nand the respect or admiration of his team-mates. It is that sense of self-esteem, of dignity even, that comes with \n\n\n\nbeing central to the ambition of his side. The periphery, where he has occasionally found himself during his career, \nis so galling to Keane that it anguishes him.\n\nHis talent is something enigmatic, capable of moments of sublime ingenuity, but still vulnerable to the kind of \nanxious impulses that leave him looking aghast in front of goal. What we can be sure of is that he possesses the \nability, something natural and intuitive, to beguile some of the game s great clubs and figures. But then we can also \nsay that at the very highest level, where the best players are enabled by a profound, almost chilling, sense of \nbelonging, Keane has faltered.\n\nIn moving from Wolves to Coventry for \u00a36.5m in 1999, Keane became the most expensive teenager in English \nfootball, and by 19 he had signed for Internazionale. Yet he lasted only four months in Milan and Sir Alex Ferguson \nonce remarked that he would not have paid more than \u00a3500,000 to Wolves for the striker. This is the essence of \nKeane, a gifted talent, but one who can still divide opinion.\n\nHe is considered bullishly self-confident, and so cocksure that he dribbled impishly round senior players when he \ntook part in his first Republic of Ireland training session at 17 while shouting,  so who is this John Aldridge?  Yet \nthose who have closely observed his career also talk of an insecurity, something that lies beneath the surface and \ncan explain the rush to leave Inter and Liverpool when he considered himself unwanted.\n\nThe goals come often enough, so that at 29, Keane is the Republic of Ireland s all-time top scorer and 10th in the \nlist of Barclays Premier League scorers with 121. That his time at Liverpool ended after six months in January last \nyear was due to the doubt of Rafa Benitez. The Spaniard may have been reluctant in valuing Keane, but he also \ninsists on rigid adherence to his tactical plan, an approach that distrusts spontaneity.\n\nBut this is Keane s great strength, his impetuosity, with his quick feet, sharp mind and agile movement spreading a \nkind of distress among defenders. At Tottenham and with Ireland, he thrived in a role that allows him to flit around \nthe front line, dropping deep or peeling out wide when the notion takes him, but always with a keen eye for \ndevastating bursts into the penalty area. To profit from Keane, a team must adapt themselves around him.\n\nFaced with rescuing Spurs from relegation, Harry Redknapp brought the striker back to White Hart Lane 12 months \nago and made him captain.  He lifted the place with his personality and enthusiasm,  Redknapp later remarked. Yet \nJermain Defoe became the team s talisman, while Keane drifted from prominence. \n\nHe has not played a full fixture since last September and was at the heart of the unauthorised trip to Dublin by 16 \nSpurs players at Christmas that so angered Redknapp.\n\nThere is something unorthodox to Keane. He began the somersault goal celebration that became his trademark as \na 12-year-old at Crumlin United. He is also deeply sentimental, so that he often reaches for the emotional \nengagement of a transfer. When he joined Liverpool, he spoke of the great joy of signing for the team he followed \nas a boy. But like most football fans in Ireland, he shared that devotion with an affection for Celtic.\n\nIn a sense, Keane s move reflects that of Craig Bellamy, another player capable of brilliance but whose career \nseemed still to be fulfilled when he joined Celtic on loan in 2005. At Parkhead, Keane will be engulfed by adoration, \nbut will also find the prominence that he cherishes.\n\nHe found meaning in Scotland once before, when he played against Dundee United and Stirling during a pre-\nseason tour with Wolves in 1997. He impressed enough to make his debut in the first game of the season against \nNorwich. He scored twice.

He said it would be a good step for me to come to Celtic,  \nsaid Braafheid.  He said this would be a good club. In the past, a few Dutch players have played for Celtic and he \nhas been in touch with them over the years. They all said positive things about the club, so Van Maarwijk felt it \nwould be good for me. \n\nBraafheid also talked to Marc-Antoine Fortune, the Celtic forward who was his team-mate at Utrecht.  He told me \nsome good stories about Celtic,  said Braafheid.  He told me that it was a big club, with a nice stadium and some of \nthe best supporters around. He said there was a great atmosphere at the games and that s what I wanted to hear. \nHe also said the coach was really happy that he might be able to sign me. That was also important.\n\n I need to play games, but they have to be at a good level. That s why Celtic suits me. The moment the club called \nme, I said yes   because I knew the level at Celtic is very high. \n\nBraafheid would not rule out a long-term deal at Celtic but his focus is on playing his way into a World Cup berth.\n\n With Celtic, it is the same as Bayern. They have to be champions every year, so the pressure is high,  added \nBraafheid, who will not play tonight against Kilmarnock but who has targeted a winning end to a season he has so \nfar spent on the sidelines in Munich.\n\n Now it is 10 points with one game in hand,  he said of the gap at the top of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League.  \nThat gives a clear goal of what has to be done for the rest of the season.\n\n For me, it s not just about coming here, playing games and leaving again. Every time I play for a club I want to win \nprizes. And there are two prizes Celtic can win this season. My goal is very clear on that. \n\n\n\n THE king has long gone, but his reign may have helped usher another period of prosperity for Celtic. Henrik \nLarsson has now moved into management but his playing days provided the inspiration for Diomansy Kamara, the \n29-year-old striker, who has joined Celtic on loan until the end of the season.\n\n I loved Larsson s kind of play when I was younger,  said Kamara who completed his move from Fulham yesterday.  \nI loved George Weah during his days at Paris St Germain and Larsson. Larsson was not the same kind of player as \nme, but he had great skills and scored amazing goals. He was my hero. \n\nKamara, who played for Celtic manager Tony Mowbray at West Bromwich Albion, sees the move to Scotland as his \nopportunity to reignite a career that stalled because of serious knee injuries. \n\n My main goal is to stay fit and I hope the supporters love me,  he said after completing his first training session at \nLennoxtown. He did much to make the latter ambition come true by saying:  It was an easy decision to make \nbecause Celtic are a massive club. When Tony Mowbray rang me three days ago to tell me Celtic were interested \nin signing me, I said  yes . \n\n I know him and it is a dream for me to play at Celtic because my football hero was Henrik Larsson. I know the \nScottish League is not the Premiership, but I am so happy to come here because the fans are amazing. Playing in a \nstadium like Parkhead is a dream for every player. \n\nMuch of this can be ascribed to the footballer s desire to make a good impression, but there is no doubting Kamara \ns sincerity when he talked about how important the move north could be for him. At 29, the Senegalese \ninternationalist needs to play regularly and he hopes to extend his stay in Glasgow.  I am on loan at the moment, \nbut I have spoken with Tony and there s the option of a contract for another three years,  he said.  I want to be part \nof the project going on here for the next few years. \n\nThe Mowbray factor was crucial to the signing.  I had chances to go back to France and there was something in \nEngland, but I worked with Tony Mowbray at West Brom and he knows exactly what I can do and where I can play,  \nsaid Kamara.  That is the most important reason I chose Celtic.\n\nI played the best football of my career when I was with him at West Brom. I love training with him and I could play \nbehind a big striker or right or left. \n\nKamara, who has never visited Scotland before, revealed he had some knowledge of Scottish football by referring \nto the good form of Hibernian, who beat Celtic only last week. He was not dismayed by his departure from the \nBarclays Premier League.  The Premiership is the best league in the world, but Celtic and Rangers would do so \nwell if they could get down there,  he said.  I think they would be in the top five. \n\nHe is ready for the fray, making himself available for tonight s game at Rugby Park.  It is nice for me to be able to \nplay immediately and we have a good challenge. We can fight for the title,  he said. \n\nKamara was not daunted by the gap at the top of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League.  Yes, there are 10 points in \nit, but we have a game in hand and we will reduce that by winning at Kilmarnock,  he said.  We also have two \ngames against Rangers and the title will be open if we win those games. We can win the title. There is, of course, \nthe Scottish Cup as well.\n\n I know it will be hard, but we need to win something this year. It is hard for Celtic to end a season having won \nnothing. I love to play with pressure on me and I know the fans are crazy. They are the best supporters in the world. \nParkhead also has an atmosphere like Anfield and I just want to see it. \n\nKamara also shrugged off references to his injury problems.  I feel so good now. I am 100% fit and I don t feel \nanything at all in my knee. I had to be fit to come here. I wouldn t have signed if I was feeling any kind of pain. \nI have taken my time to come back strong and I am ready. \n\nHe will have to be if he is to have any chance of replicating just some of the feats of his football hero.\n\n\n\nDiomansy Kamara\n\nage 29 position Forward\n\nheight 6ft 1in\n\ninternational appearances Senegal 49 (9 goals)\n\ncareer 07-present Fulham; 05-07 West Bromwich Albion; 04-05 Portsmouth; 01-05 Modena; 99-01 Catanzaro; 98-\n99 Red Star 93, Paris\n\nEdson Braafheid\n\nage 26 position left-back\n\nheight 5ft 9in\n\ninternational appearances Netherlands 5 (0 goals)\n\ncareer 09-present Bayern Munich; 07-09 Twente Enschede;  03-07 Utrecht\n\nTHE king has long gone, but his reign may have helped usher another period of prosperity for Celtic.

She said her proposals would not apply to people with severe cognitive \nconditions, such as Alzheimer s and other forms of dementia as there appeared to be no way of guaranteeing it was \nwhat the person wanted. \n\nShe said:  I applaud Terry Pratchett for bringing the issue out into the open and causing a debate, causing people \nto think about it and examine it.\n\n I have been doing that for well over a year and I haven t come up with a way in which you could legislate and be \nabsolutely certain the safeguards you have built in to defend someone would stand up for those with illnesses such \nas Alzheimer s.\n\n\n\n My Bill rests on the principals of autonomy of the patient, the capacity of the patient, that it is physician assisted \nand that there is a very strong supporting system. These four elements must be there. \n\n With Alzheimer s, that group of illnesses, people don t have capacity so someone else would have to take the \ndecision. \n\nThe Alzheimer s Society said it  could not support  a change in the law on assisted dying or euthanasia.  People \nwith \n\ndementia need better end-of-life care to provide them with the choice, comfort and dignity they deserve,  a \nspokesman said.\n\n Sir Terry is not alone in his desire to debate end-of-life choices, but his view is a very personal one. \n\nSir Terry told the audience at the Royal College of Physicians in London:  If I knew that I could die, I would live. My \nlife, my death, my choice. \n\nHe was to say that many GPs would support the right to die and that turning to the medical profession to help was  \nsensible .\n\nTHE arguments for and against a change in law on assisted suicide are complex and challenging and there are a \nrange of views within the medical profession, as within wider society. \n\nHowever, the majority of doctors continue to oppose physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. \n\nIf doctors are authorised, by law, to kill or help kill they are taking on an additional role, which we believe is alien to \nthe one of care giver and healer. \n\nThe traditional doctor-patient relationship is founded on trust and this risks being impaired if the doctor s role \nencompasses any form of intentional killing. \n\nThe primary goal of medicine is still seen as promoting welfare and giving all patients as good a quality of life as is \npossible. \n\nThe concept of assisted dying risks undermining this goal.\n\nSIR Terry Pratchett, the best-selling author who suffers from Alzheimer s disease, made an impassioned plea for \nassisted death for seriously ill people last night.\n\nActor Tony Robinson delivered Sir Terry s Richard Dimbleby Lecture, a task that appeared to be beyond the author \ns powers of endurance. He sat nearby as Mr Robinson spoke.\n\nHe said:  We should strive for a good rich life well lived, and at the end of it, in the comfort of our own home in the \ncompany of those that love us, have a death worth dying for.\n\n Care is a lottery and there are those of us who don t wish to be cared for, who don t want to spend their time in \nanyone s waiting room, to have the right not to do what you are told by a nurse, not to obey the doctor, a right in my \ncase to demand here and now the power of attorney over the fate of the Terry Pratchett that at some future date I \nwill become. \n\nAs polls showed a majority of people backed assisted suicide, Sir Terry said he would offer himself as a test case \nbefore such a  strictly non-aggressive  tribunal, which would include a legal expert in family affairs and a doctor who \nhad dealt with serious, long-term illness. \n\nThey would have to judge whether someone was of  sound and informed mind  look to prevent abuses acting  for \nthe good of society as well as that of the applicant .\n\n\n\nSir Terry suffers from a degenerative strain of Alzheimer s which affects visual processing called posterior cortical \natrophy.\n\nMargo MacDonald, the indpendent MSP who has Parkinson s, has put forward a Bill in Scotland that she hopes will \nallow those whose lives have become intolerable a dignified death at home. \n\nShe said her proposals would not apply to people with severe cognitive conditions, such as Alzheimer s and other \nforms of dementia, as there appeared to be no way of guaranteeing it was what the person wanted. \n\nShe said:  I applaud Terry Pratchett for bringing the issue out into the open and causing a debate, causing people \nto think about it and examine it.

The DWP had been \ngiven contact details for the man s GP and psychiatrist, but had not contacted them.\n\nIn the House of Commons yesterday, the SNP s work and pensions spokesman John Mason asked the minister for \nthe disabled, Jonathan Shaw why Atos regularly ignored patients  own GPs. The minister replied that Atos did take \nGPs  representations into account but added that seminars were being arranged for Atos and DWP staff,  so we \ncan set out in detail how those medical assessments are carried on .\n\nFollowing the debate, Mr Mason said the Government s benefit reform had increased pressure on vulnerable \npeople.\n\n These are the very people who need society s protection and it is utterly unacceptable that the system in place to \nhelp is heightening mental strain and anguish,  he said.  It s simply wrong that people with genuine disability and \nincapacity should face such harsh treatment.  \n\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also called for an investigation. The Shadow Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael said:  \nThere is not an MP in Scotland who cannot tell you from his or her own constituency caseload that doctors are \nbeing used by the DWP to cut the number of people on benefits.\n\n This is something which now requires a thorough investigation which is independent of the government and the \ncompanies it employs. \n\nFUNDING to help disadvantaged students gain access to some of Scotland s most prestigious universities   and \nensure they graduate   may be withdrawn under new proposals.\n\nThe Scottish Funding Council (SFC) is considering restricting financial support for widening access and retention to \nuniversities who have the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged areas.\n\nFunding previously shared across all institutions could be closed to the universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh, \nAberdeen and Heriot-Watt.\n\nMark Batho, chief executive of the SFC, said:  Our intention for the year is  to remove the premium from four higher \neducation institutions that have received small proportions of premium. \n\nTREES are growing faster due to man-made global warming, a study suggests.\n\nIn one forest studied by researchers, an extra 1.8 tonnes of timber per acre is appearing each year.\n\nThe trees, in the US state of Maryland, are sprouting up more quickly than at any time in the past 225 years, say \nthe scientists.\n\nThe accelerated growth was put down to rising  levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, higher temperatures, as well \nas longer growing seasons.\n\nResearchers who spent more than 20 years tracking the growth of 55 stands of mixed hardwood forest plots made \nthe discovery.\n\nThey compared trees ranging from five to 225 years old. More than 90% of the stands were found to have grown \ntwo to four times faster than expected.\n\nThe stands were grouped by age, proving it was a recent phenomenon.\n\nPOETRY is often about stripping naked the writer s innermost thoughts and emotions onto the printed page, but \nyesterday three lovers of verse took the philosophy further and disrobed in the unlikely surroundings of Edinburgh \nCentral Library. Charlotte Murray, Ava Mueller and Lynda MacGregor had henna tattoos placed strategically on \ntheir backs to form the words  Carry Your Hearts,  at the launch of the Carry A Poem reading campaign, \ncoordinated by the Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust and the Scottish Poetry Library. The aim is to \nencourage and inspire its the city s residents to carry poems they love with them wherever they go. Actor Alan \nCumming and local school pupils are also supporting the scheme.  The aim is to get people to look, talk and think \nabout poetry and carry a poem with them. Lots of people can recite poetry off by heart, but don t carry them with \nthem. There s always one for every occasion - so take it with you!  said a spokeswoman.\n\nPOETRY is often about baring the writer s innermost thoughts and emotions, but yesterday three lovers of verse \ntook the philosophy further and disrobed in the unlikely surroundings of Edinburgh Central Library. \n\nCharlotte Murray, Ava Mueller and Lynda MacGregor had henna tattoos placed strategically on their backs to form \nthe words  Carry Your Heart,  at the launch of the Carry A Poem reading campaign, co-ordinated by the Edinburgh \nUNESCO City of Literature Trust and the Scottish Poetry Library. \n\n\n\nThe aim is to encourage and inspire its the city s residents to carry poems they love with them wherever they go.

The 39-year-old is currently being \ntreated for head and leg injuries at Glasgow s Southern General Hospital.\n\nThe 71-year-old driver of the Volkswagen Polo was taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley \nwhere she is being treated for a shoulder injury. Her condition was last night said to be stable.\n\nInspector Paul Reilly, of Dumbarton Road traffic policing department, said:  The two men were assisting the elderly \ninjured woman when they were stuck by the van on the carriageway.\n\n Unfortunately this tragic incident also shows how dangerous busy roads can be, and I would urge anyone who \nwitnesses a road crash on a busy road not to walk along the carriageways, but contact the emergency services. \n\nMeanwhile, Nicola Lukjansky is recovering from severe leg injuries in Royal Aberdeen Children s Hospital. Her \nsister has refused to leave her bedside. \n\nA close family friend said:  They were a really lovely family. It s a tragedy for that little girl. She had her mum and \ndad one minute then they were taken away the next. It s awful. She won t understand what has happened. \n\nPolice are trying to work out whether or not the subzero  temperatures and icy conditions played a part in the \naccident.\n\nOfficers investigating the Linwood tragedy appealed for any witnesses to contact them urgently on 01389 822017.\n\nA THIRD round of detailed ground investigations on the site of the proposed new Forth road crossing will begin later \nthis month in a bid to prevent costs of up to \u00a32.3 billion escalating  during construction.\n\nTransport Scotland, the Government agency overseeing the project, is anxious to avoid unforeseen problems \nsimilar to those that have beset construction of Edinburgh s tram system. \n\n\n\nA major factor in its delays has been unexpected ground conditions such as graveyards and unchartered gas and \nwater mains adding to the cost and length of preparatory work.\n\nThe eight-week investigation, which will cover marine conditions and approach roads, has been instigated at the \nrequest of two consortia, Forthspan and Forth Crossing  Constructors, which are bidding to build the replacement \nbridge.\n\nIts announcement came as parliamentary authorities published a list of the 88 individuals and organisations who \nhave formally objected to the Bill  authorising the bridge s construction.\n\nThey include residents in North and South Queensferry as well as bodies and companies including Network Rail, \nRSPB Scotland and Edinburgh Airport, as well as West Lothian and Edinburgh councils.\n\nCONTESTANTS could lose \u00a31 million in a new Channel 4 game show.\n\nParticipants are given the hefty sum at the start of the show, which will be broadcast live from a secret secure \nlocation, but will have to watch their cash disappear down trapdoors if they answer incorrectly.\n\nChannel 4 has commissioned the show, provisionally entitled The Drop, from Endemol, the TV company behind Big \nBrother.\n\nContestants will be plucked from social networking websites and even other Channel 4 programmes in what \nproducers say will  revolutionise how TV gameshows are cast .\n\nThe Drop will go out over a week next year, with viewers watching the show one day and living in the secret \nlocation hoping to take home \u00a31m the next.\n\nProspects for the financially troubled Highland Airways, which serves some of the most fragile island communities, \nappear to be improving.\n\nBookings had been suspended at the beginning  of last week and, while there has also been uncertainty over the \npay of the airline s 100 employees .\n\nHowever a statement on the airline s website reports some headway in its efforts to achieve financial stability:  The \ncompany is making good progress in its discussions with a potential new partner who will bring strong synergies \nand new opportunities to the business. \n\n This development presents the airline with a very promising and timely means to address current difficulties. \n\n The motivation of the Board throughout has been to secure the delivery of the valued services that we offer and \nalso to secure the employment of our highly skilled workforce in Scotland, Wales and the rest of the UK.\n\n We are now accepting bookings on all our scheduled flights until the end of February. \n\n Bookings beyond that point are not currently open, but will be released as soon as possible. \n\nLAST

I was \nhoping to work on the shape we are going to adopt at Dingwall for part of the game at Cowdenbeath but that won t \nhappen now. \n\nArbroath yesterday signed Callum Booth from Hibs on loan while Cklyde have brought striker Jordan White back for \na second loan spell from Dunfermline\n\nJIMMY CALDERWOOD, the Kilmarnock manager, hopes his familiar new faces will help make Tony Mowbray s \nnew-look Celtic side appear to be strangers in the night at Rugby Park this evening.\n\nWhile Mowbray hogged the headlines on transfer deadline day as he added Robbie Keane, Diomansy Kamara and \nEdson Braafheid on loan deals to recent arrivals Morten Rasmussen, Joos Hooiveld, Ki-Sung-Yeung and Thomas \nRogne, Calderwood recruited Scott Severin, his former captain at Aberdeen, and Rob Kiernan, both on loan from \nWatford, as well as striker Chris Maguire from the Pittodrie ranks on a similar arrangement.\n\nWhile Calderwood can reasonably expect at least two of his three new signings to slot in with minimum fuss, he \nbelieves the rough and tumble of the Scottish Premier League can unnerve Celtic s latest recruits.\n\nHe said:  We ve had Celtic watched, but there could be three or four different names in. No matter what team Tony \nputs out, it ll be a very strong team and we know how difficult it is going to be, but Scotland isn t the easiest place in \nthe world to come and play at first. They ll get up to the pace of the game eventually, but in the beginning it might \ntake them a while to settle.\n\n I remember talking to [the then newly-appointed Rangers manager] Paul Le Guen when we [Aberdeen] went to \nSouth African pre-season at the same time. I said to him that the first touch [in the SPL] has to be right because the \nnext one is a tackle. He took it as a joke, but I was being serious and he found that out quickly.\n\n You ve always got to get in their faces. Let s not beat about the bush, they ll have more quality than us and that s \nno disrespect to my boys. But you can t let good players have the time to play. If you are going to beat Rangers or \nCeltic, that s the way to do it. \n\nMeanwhile, Calderwood hopes Kevin Kyle, who scored in the 4-4 draw with Dundee United at the weekend, is back \nto his best now that the captain s armband has been passed to Manuel Pascali.\n\nHe said:  Kevin came to me about the captaincy   he thought it was affecting his game. I told Kevin we d do \nsomething about it and he is playing with a smile on his face again. Hopefully this is the start of a really good run for \nhim. \n\n\n\nWest Ham have bolstered their striking options by completing the signing of the South Africa internationalist, Benni \nMcCarthy, on a two-and-a-half-year deal from Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThe London side have also taken the former Tottenham striker, Mido, on loan until the end of the season from \nEgyptian side Zamalek.\n\nIt was all quiet on transfer deadline day at the Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, while rivals Arsenal and \nManchester United also failed to enter the market.\n\nWigan, meanwhile, won the race to sign highly rated youngster Victor Moses from Crystal Palace in a deal thought \nto be worth \u00a32.5m. Moses has agreed a three-and-a-half-year contract at the DW Stadium while the Bolivia striker, \nMarcelo Moreno, has also joined on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.\n\nOne of the busiest Premier League sides yesterday was Fulham, who brought in Stefano Okaka and Nicky Shorey \non loan from Roma and Aston Villa respectively.\n\nThe Fulham manager, Roy Hodgson, has also signed German youngster Christopher Butchmann from Liverpool \nand allowed Diomansy Kamara, Tony Kallio and Wayne Brown go out on loan to Celtic, Sheffield United and Bristol \nRovers respectively.\n\nSteve Bruce, the Sunderland manager, has also had a busy day as he looked to boost his chances of survival by \nannouncing the signing of the former Rangers defender, Alan Hutton, on loan until the end of the season.\n\nDaryl Murphy and David Healy have left the Stadium of Light to join former manager Roy Keane at Ipswich on six-\nmonth loan deals while Nyron Nosworthy has joined Sheffield United on loan.\n\nThe Burnley manager, Brian Laws, snapped up Jack Cork on loan from Chelsea and also extended the loan deal of \nPortsmouth striker David Nugent until the end of the season.\n\nPortsmouth s relegation rivals, Hull, managed to stave off Wolves  interest in Stephen Hunt while also letting Peter \nHalmosi, Daniel Cousin and Will Atkinson to join Szombathelyi Haladas, Larissa and Rochdale respectively.\n\nOther major moves included Marcus Bent joining QPR on loan from Birmingham while in the Coca-Cola \nChampionship, Geremi left leaders Newcastle for Turkish side Ankaragucu and West Brom signed Feyenoord \nattacking midfielder Andwele Slory on a free transfer.\n\n* CLYDESDALE BANK PREMIER LEAGUE\n\nABERDEEN\n\nIn Paul Marshall (Man City, loan), Steven MacLean (Plymouth, loan), Jim Paterson (Plymouth, loan)\n\nOut Lee Miller (Middlesbrough, undisclosed), Maurice Ross (Beijing Guoan, free), Chris Maguire (Kilmarnock, loan) \nTommy Wright (released), Jonathan Crawford (Peterhead, loan)\n\nDUNDEE UNITED\n\nIn Dusan Pernis (MSK Zilina, free)\n\nOut Nicky Weaver (Burnley, free), Mark Fotheringham (Anorthosis Famagusta, free), Kevin Smith, Johnny Russell \n(Raith Rovers, loan)\n\nFALKIRK\n\nIn Enoch Showunmi (Leeds United, free), Colin Healy (Ipswich, loan), Jack Compton (Weston-super-Mare, free), \nPaul Sludden (East Fife, loan ends)\n\n\n\nOut Chris Mitchell (Ayr United, loan), Brian Allison (Stirling Albion, loan), Kjartan Finnbogason (Sandefjord, loan \nend), Toufik Zerara (released), James Bloom (Alloa, loan)\n\nHAMILTON ACADEMICAL\n\nIn David van Zanten (Morton, free), Stuart Elliot (Doncaster Rovers, free), Mickael Antoine-Curier (loan, Dundee) \nBrian Easton (Burnley, free), Jo\u00ebl Thomas (Colchester United, loan)\n\nOut Gary Mason (released), Leon Knight (Queen of the South, free), Guillaume Beuzelin (Olympiakos Nikosia, \nfree), Kevin Welsh (Alloa, free), Marvin Andrews (Queen of the South, free)\n\nHEARTS\n\nIn Ryan Stevenson (Hearts, undisclosed)  Out Rocky Visconte (Ayr United, loan)\n\nHIBERNIAN\n\nIn Graeme Smith (Brighton, free), Mark Brown (Celtic, free)\n\nOut none\n\nKILMARNOCK\n\nIn Jamie Adams (Partick Thistle, loan), Scott Severin (Watford, loan), Rob Kiernan (Watford, loan), Chris Maguire \n(Aberdeen, loan)\n\nOut Mark Brown (loan ends)\n\nMOTHERWELL\n\nIn none\n\nOut Yassin Moutaouakil (Charlton, loan ends), Paul Slane (Celtic, undisclosed)\n\nST JOHNSTONE\n\nIn Cilian Sheridan (Celtic, loan)\n\nOut Jonatan Johansson (released), Andy Jackson (Arbroath, loan)\n\nST MIRREN\n\nIn Rory Loy (Rangers, loan), Graham Carey (Celtic, loan)\n\nOut Stephen McGinn (Watford, undisclosed), Mo Camara (released), Dennis Wyness (released)\n\nRANGERS\n\nIn none\n\nOut Jerome Rothen (Ankaragucu, loan ends), Pedro Mendes (Sporting Lisbon, \u00a31.5m), Andrew Shinnie (Dundee, \nloan), Paul Emslie (Peterhead, loan), Rory Loy (St Mirren, loan), Steven Lennon (Lincoln City, loan)\n\n* SCOTTISH LEAGUE.

It s important to claw back some points on the teams above us \nand try and get closer to the top.\n\n Obviously, all the teams are looking for Dundee to drop points but when they do we ve got to make sure we take \nadvantage of the situation. That s something Queen of the South will be hoping to do. It will be a tough game as \nthey are a good side and won 4-1 at East End Park earlier in the season. \n\nThe Fifers are set to be without Graham Bayne, Stephen Glass, Scott Muirhead and Steven McDougall through \ninjury.\n\nRecent history, however, favours a Queens side who could move within eight points of Dundee with three games \nstill in hand. The Doonhamers have won on their last four trips to East End Park and, despite being held to a draw, \nproduced an exhilarating attacking display against Dundee last time out. Manager Gordon Chisholm said:  We \ncould do with another performance like that but we also need to start taking more of our chances. \n\n Dundee s result on Saturday was a bonus for us but they still have the points on the board and we have to try to \nmake our games in hand count.  \n\nMarvin Andrews, who has rejoined the Dumfries club following a recent loan spell, could feature along with \nLivingston s Joe Hamill who has signed a loan swap deal that sees Stevie Tosh heading to Almondvale. Stephen \nMcKenna is free of suspension while Leon Knight is another likely starter  for the visitors.\n\nPrediction Away win \n\nLast season 2-1, 0-2 \n\nMARK McGHEE moved quickly last night to offset the loss of Lee Miller to Middlesbrough with the loan-signing of \nstriker Steven MacLean from  Plymouth Argyle.\n\nMacLean, the former Rangers forward, became the Aberdeen manager s principal target after Gordon Strachan \nsecured Miller s services in a surprising \u00a3500,000 deal.\n\nFormer Dundee United and Motherwell left wing-back, Jim Paterson, has also joined the Pittodrie club on a further \nloan deal until the end of the season.\n\nThe new arrivals will give Aberdeen a boost as they attempt to overtake Hearts and move into fifth place in the \nClydesdale Bank Premier League with a victory over Falkirk at Pittodrie tonight.\n\nMcGhee said:  I m very pleased to have Jim Paterson and Steven MacLean here, particularly on the back of losing \nLee. We need somebody   particularly now that Lee has gone   to link the play, to be a centre-forward that can hold \nthe ball up for us. Steven s a boy that can take it in, and he s got a good goalscoring record.\n\n Jim, he was a player who   when he left me at Motherwell   had been our best player. He is an experienced player \nas well and that will be good for our young players.  Both players will go straight into the squad for tonight s match.\n\nMcGhee insisted it would have been  wrong  to deny Miller a move to the Coca-Cola Championship club.   I wouldn \nt want somebody to do that to me, stand in my way,  said McGhee of the 26-year-old who finished top scorer at \n\n\n\nAberdeen for the last two seasons.  He does make a difference to us, however, some things are outwith my control \nin that respect and I have to respect the situation. \n\nJamie Langfield, the Pittodrie goalkeeper, said of Miller s departure:  It s a massive blow to the club on and off the \npitch,  he said. Lee was a great lad to have about the place. But I think he is going back to England as a better \nplayer. \n\nLivingston v Queen s Park\n\nGary Bollan s Livingston side have an immediate opportunity to restore their advantage at the top of the table after \nlast Saturday s postponement allowed East Stirling to join them on 38 points.\n\nThey face a Queen s Park outfit who have won their last three matches, but are still without Zander Cowie and \nMartin Ure. Bollan may not risk Stevie Tosh, who joined the club last week in a loan swap deal which saw Joe \nHamill heading to Queen of the South, but fellow new signing Jim Hamilton, who was released by Partick Thistle \nlast month, will be included. Bollan said of the veteran striker:   He will bring a new dimension to our play which \ncould be vital in the second half of the season. \n\nTHE Conservative lead over Labour is continuing to narrow as the pre-election clashes intensify, with Lord \nMandelson yesterday accusing the Tory leadership of wobbling on economic policies that, he warned, would  \nstrangle the recovery at birth .\n\nYesterday, the fifth snapshot in a row put the Conservative lead below 10 points. \n\nA ComRes telephone  poll of 1000 people undertaken at the weekend sees the Tory lead cut month on month from \nnine points to seven.\n\nThe details are: the Conservatives unchanged on 38%; Labour up two on 31% and the Liberal Democrats also \nunchanged on 19%.\n\nIf repeated at a General Election, David Cameron would be 24 seats short of an overall majority in a hung \nparliament.\n\nHowever, the Tory leader received better news when  a magazine poll of 2000 professional women aged  from 31 \nto 50 showed they were nearly three times more likely to vote Conservative than Labour; 30% to 11%. \n\nAlthough 46% said they were still undecided.\n\nToday, Gordon Brown will seek to cast Labour as the party of renewal with a speech on the constitution.\n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to promise to legislate as early as next week for a post-election referendum to bring \nin the Alternative Vote for Westminster. \n\nHe is also due to promise fundamental reform for a wholly or largely elected House of Lords.\n\nYesterday, the pre-election skirmishes continued with Lord Mandelson, accusing the Tories of being in  disarray  \nafter Mr Cameron assured voters that there would be  no swingeing cuts  in his first year in office.\n\nThis appeared to suggest the Tory leader was toning down his hard-edged policy of moving faster and deeper than \nLabour in cutting the UK s ballooning \u00a3178 billion budget deficit.\n\nThe Business Secretary told reporters:  Instead of bobbing around like a cork in water, David Cameron should level \nwith the British people. \n\nHe branded the Conservative leader and George Osborne, the Shadow Chancellor, a  Laurel and Hardy duo .\n\n\n\nConservative HQ hit back, insisting it was not they but the Labour leadership who were  in chaos  on economic \npolicy.\n\nTHE latest attempt to sign off a Holyrood report into the release of the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing may \nfounder again today.\n\nSNP members are furious that sections of the report have been leaked.\n\nFrom its outset, the Justice Committee inquiry into Kenny MacAskill s handling of the Megrahi decision broke down \nalong rigid party lines, with Labour leading the attack.\n\nThe lines of questioning made clear where the inquiry was going   that the minister would be condemned for his \nhandling of the decision to grant Megrahi compassionate release on medical grounds.\n\nBut the SNP members are believed to have been seeking to ensure their counter-views defending the minister are \nat least reflected in the final report.\n\nHowever, at the weekend, in a leak that Nationalists are saying came from Labour, extracts of the report were given \nto the media. The SNP s Stewart Maxwell will today ask committee chairman Bill Aitken to initiate a leak inquiry.\n\nA TOUGH new stance on Freedom of Information requests by the Scottish Government has been condemned in a \nHolyrood motion. \n\nLibDem MSP Robert Brown claims the new rules are being used to block requests for information about the \ndecision to scrap the Glasgow Airport Rail Link. \n\nMr Brown said:  The secretive approach taken by the SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney is outrageous. The \nproject is of major if not seminal significance to Glasgow and the West of Scotland. \n\nALMOST 60% of MPs believe Scotland will never become independent while only 30% of Labour MPs back the \nidea of allowing the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly to have stronger tax powers, according to a survey.\n\nThe snapshot was produced by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), which asked a series of questions \nabout the post-devolution settlement. Of the 646 MPs at Westminster, some 114, around 17%, responded. The \nthink-tank insisted this was  in line  with similar surveys of  MPs  views.\n\nOn the issue of Scottish independence, 1% thought it would happen in the next five years, 15% in the next 20, 4% \nin the next 50 and 58% never.\n\nWhile only 30% of Labour MPs agreed with the statement about tax powers, support from Conservative MPs was \nstronger at 55%.\n\nTHE head of Glasgow Airport has reiterated her opposition to the scrapping of a rail link with the city ahead of a \ncrucial  parliamentary vote tomorrow when Labour will attempt to have the project reinstated.\n\nAmanda McMillan, managing director of the airport, said its reputation would suffer and  businesses, tourism and \nemployment would be negatively  affected by the cancellation of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (Garl).\n\nIn a letter to MSPs ahead of voting on the Scottish Government s Budget Bill, she said Finance Secretary John  \nSwinney s decision last year to axe the project  leaves a gaping hole in the airport s surface access strategy, an \nissue which has a crucial bearing on passenger choice .\n\nMrs McMillan added:  Unless action is taken to address this challenge, the reputation of our airport and our ability to \nattract passengers beyond metropolitan Glasgow will be seriously  damaged.\n\n Ultimately this has implications for business, tourism and employment throughout Glasgow and Scotland. The \nfuture of Glasgow Airport is an issue of national importance. \n\n\n\nMrs McMillan called for a  comprehensive review of  surface access needs  for the  airport if Garl cannot be saved.\n\n Our message to MSPs is clear. If Garl is abandoned, we need to consider other measures to improve surface \naccess,  she said.  The cancellation of Garl cannot be an end to the matter.\n\n A serious challenge remains: how to ensure continued access to an asset on which our nation s economy \ndepends. Doing  nothing is simply not an option. If passengers cannot easily access Glasgow Airport, they will \nchoose another airport. \n\nIn her letter, Mrs McMillan highlighted the airport s  significant economic contribution to the west of Scotland and the \ncountry as a whole, its role as Scotland s  principal long-haul and transatlantic gateway  and the vital contribution it \nmakes to Scottish tourism and business competitiveness.\n\nRobert Brown, Liberal  Democrat MSP for Glasgow, said:  This is an important statement from BAA. They are an \nintegral stakeholder in Garl but it sounds like they haven t had much engagement from the Scottish Government. \n\nLABOUR MPs have been accused of being  desperate to get off Brown s sinking ship  after Nigel Griffiths became \nthe 83rd from the party to announce he will stand down at the General Election.\n\nSo far 128 MPs in all, around a fifth of the 646 total, have said they will be leaving Westminster.\n\nApproached by The Herald last month about suggestions he was about to announce he would be standing down, \nMr Griffiths, flatly denied them. \n\nHowever, on Sunday night the former Enterprise Minister and close ally of Gordon Brown told his local party in  \nEdinburgh South, which he has represented since 1987, that he would not be seeking  re-election.\n\nHe planned instead to take up a  once in a lifetime  job offer as the director of an  international education  institution \nbased in London.\n\nAround a quarter of Labour s 349 MPs have said they will not be standing again.\n\nJohn McFall, Labour MP for West Dunbartonshire, also announced on Friday that he would be stepping down. He \nand Mr Griffiths revealed their intentions just days before the  three-month countdown to an expected May 6 poll.\n\nBeyond that point, the party s ruling National Executive  Committee takes over control of choosing a candidate from \na local constituency branch and can, if it wants, draw up an  all-women shortlist.\n\nFormer Edinburgh councillor Mr Griffiths has a majority of just 405 and holds the  Conservatives  fourth target seat \nin Scotland. It needs a 4.5% swing to turn it blue.\n\nAngus MacNeil of the SNP said:  With Nigel Griffiths  adding his departure to those of other MPs, it is clear Labour \nMPs are desperate to get off Brown s sinking ship. \n\nLast year, Mr Griffiths escaped a standards  investigation after reports that he had cheated on his wife with another \nwoman in his study at the House of Commons.\n\nAt first, the 54-year-old  dismissed the claims in a  Sunday tabloid as  absolutely groundless , but confessed after \npictures of the liaison were published.\n\nIn 2002, he was criticised by the Commons authorities for not informing them that he owned the property he was \nusing, at taxpayers  expense, as his constituency office.\n\nHEALTH Secretary Nicola Sturgeon signed off hundreds of pounds of improper expenses claims made by her spin \ndoctor, it has emerged.\n\nAfter enquiries by The  Herald, her special adviser Noel Dolan repaid the money to the Scottish Parliament.\n\n\n\nDolan claimed cash for hotels and taxis during an SNP conference in 2006, in a clear-cut breach of Holyrood s \nrules.\n\nThe SNP blamed an  administrative error  for the claims and said Sturgeon did not receive any of the money \nherself.\n\nThe claims were made under the Party Leader s Allowance available to Ms Sturgeon and  her staff when she was \nhead of the SNP in Holyrood   Alex Salmond was then based  at Westminster.\n\nThe rules governing the allowance state it must be used for the  extra duties  that fall on party leaders, such as \ngiving speeches or attending public events.\n\nParty political activities, such as conferences, are explicitly excluded under the rules.\n\nAccording to official records, Dolan charged the public \u00a3260 for four nights  accommodation at a Holiday Inn during \nthe SNP conference in Perth in October 2006, as well as \u00a325 in taxi fares to and from the venue.\n\nThe claims were accepted by the parliamentary authorities  as valid.\n\nAfter The Herald queried the expenses last week, the SNP admitted they were wrong, but said Dolan had acted \nalone and Sturgeon was not involved. \n\nHowever the Parliament later confirmed that Sturgeon had signed off Dolan s claims, and that it had been her \nresponsibility to check they were accurate.\n\nAn SNP insider said the refund was  deeply embarrassing  for Ms Sturgeon, who has a reputation for being great on \ndetails. \n\n Noel has never been the sharpest knife in the cutlery drawer,  the source added.\n\nA parliament spokesman said:  Any reimbursement claim must comply with the Parliament s expenses scheme. We \ncan confirm the member of staff concerned has repaid the amount in full to the Parliament. \n\nAn SNP spokeswoman said:  This as a legitimate expense by the member of staff concerned but due to an \nadministrative error it was claimed from the wrong source. \n\n It should have been claimed from the SNP   as indeed correctly happened in all other years. The member of staff \nhas therefore refunded the Parliament and will be reimbursed by the party. \n\nOn Friday, Ms Sturgeon announced she will marry partner Peter Murrell, SNP chief executive, in Glasgow in July.\n\nCIVIL servants leading the fight against terrorism could be putting the public at risk by being unable to adapt to \nmeet an unpredictable and changing threat, a report has warned.\n\nSome of those leading the national counter-terror effort are paralysed by a dangerous institutional inertia, a group of \nMPs said. The Home Affairs Committee accused  Whitehall officials, spy chiefs and senior police officers of settling \non  sub-optimal  solutions.\n\nIt warned it was  not  confident  that Government institutions have the  desire  to constantly adapt to the changing \nthreats of violent extremists. Keith Vaz,  chairman of the committee, said:  Too often in this inquiry we saw \nsuggestions for reforms to the counter-terrorism structure rebuffed because  it works well at the moment , or  the \nbenefits are not yet proven .\n\n We are very concerned that a degree of inertia has set into the Government s counter-terrorism planning and \noperations. The threat is ever present and ever changing and Government must above all be ever ready to adapt \nand innovate to meet this challenge. \n\n\n\nThe MPs said existing Government counter- terrorism committees should be merged to form a National Security \nCommittee which should be chaired by the Prime Minister or Home Secretary and  assisted by a National  Security \nAdviser in the style of the former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThe committee called for the scrapping of control orders because it is  fundamentally wrong  to deprive people of \ntheir liberty  without explaining why.\n\nl Record Of The Year Use Somebody   Kings Of Leon\n\nl Album Of The Year Fearless   Taylor Swift\n\nl Song Of The Year  Single Ladies   (Put A Ring On It)    Beyonce\n\nl Best Female Pop Vocal  Performance Halo   Beyonce\n\nl Best Male Pop Vocal  Performance Make It Mine   Jason Mraz\n\nl Best Pop Vocal Album The E.N.D.

We are still finding it \nextremely difficult to come to terms with Jeffrey s death.\n\n Jeff was hardworking and was at his happiest when he made his parents proud.\n\n We hope that all those who have known and cared for Jeff will remember him for his larger than life personality and \ngenerosity. \n\nSuicidal tendencies may be driven by genetic defects that affect nerve cell growth, research suggests.\n\nThe finding follows previous research showing suicide can run in families.\n\nScientists investigated genetic variants among 394 patients diagnosed with depression, including 113 who had \nattempted suicide. Their DNA was compared with that of 366 healthy individuals. The results were confirmed by a \nlarger-scale follow-up study.\n\nFive single-letter changes in the genetic code were found to be significantly more common among individuals with a \nhistory of suicide attempts.\n\nThe variants affected two genes associated with nerve cell formation and growth.\n\nThe research was led by Dr Martin Kohli, formally at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany, \nand now at the John P Hussman Institute for Human Genomics in Miami, USA.\n\nReporting their findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry, the authors write:  The genetic risk factors for \nsuicide appear to be independent from the underlying psychiatric disorder. \n\nChannel 4 s biopic of the late politician Mo Mowlam was the highest rated drama for the station for more than eight \nyears.\n\n\n\nThe film, starring Julie Walters, drew an average of 3.5 million viewers when it was screened at 9pm on Sunday \nnight.\n\nThe story of the former Northern Ireland Secretary s battle with cancer and her efforts to unite Ulster s leaders had \na peak audience of 3.7 million viewers, according to overnight ratings.\n\nA spokeswoman said it was Channel 4 s highest rating drama since at least 2001.\n\nAudience figures also showed that C4 s final series of Celebrity Big Brother went out on a high, beating last year s \nfinale shows.\n\nThe second of Friday night s programmes, in which cage fighter Alex Reid was named the winner of the series, had \nan average of 4.1 million, with a quarter of TV viewers tuning in.\n\nA RECORD number of  people   6.4 million   filed their self-assessment tax return online this year.\n\nThe figure accounted for more than three-quarters of the total number of returns submitted by the January 31 \ndeadline, HM Revenue & Customs said.\n\nThe number of people  filing online was up 12% on the 5.8m who did so in 2009. Last year s figure showed an \nincrease of around 50% on 2008 s total of 3.8m.\n\nFriday, January 29, was the busiest day for online  filing, with 384,638 returns received. Between 4pm and 5pm of \nthat day was the busiest hour, with 39,512 tax returns filed.\n\nAround 730 people logged on to HMRC s  website to file their tax return on Christmas Day and 2175 on Boxing \nDay. Just under 20,000 did it on New Year s Eve and New Year s Day.\n\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Timms said filing online is  easier and quicker and HMRC processes \nyour return faster, so any money you re owed is repaid more quickly .\n\nThose who missed the January 31 deadline incur a \u00a3100 late payment charge. If the form has still not been \nsubmitted by July 31, they are liable for a further \u00a3100 penalty. They also have to pay interest on any unpaid tax.\n\nBEYONCE may have won most of the prizes, but it was a  Scottish cat lady  who garnered most praise at the star-\nstudded Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles yesterday morning.\n\nThough she was not invited to attend the glamorous event, Susan Boyle was there in spirit as the host invoked her \nname to bring the elite crowd back down to earth.\n\n You may be the coolest people in the world, but this year your industry was saved by a 48-year-old Scottish cat \nlady in sensible shoes,  comedian Stephen Colbert told the assembly of musical luminaries.\n\nHowever, with a record-breaking haul of six new awards to fit on to her already-crowded mantelpiece, American \nR&B star Beyonce Knowles was the undisputed queen of this year s Grammys night.\n\nThe 28-year-old singer is now the most successful female artist in any one year at the awards, breaking free from a \npack that included Amy Winehouse and Nora Jones with five wins apiece. She now has 16 Grammys, including \nthose won with her former group Destiny s Child.\n\nBeyonce s best-selling hit Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) scooped the award for best song, edging Kings of Leon \nand Lady Gaga into runner-up spots. The single, from her 2008 album I Am...Sasha Fierce, was a Christmas \nNumber One in the US, where it was Beyonce s fifth consecutive chart-topping release.\n\nIn the battle for best album, however, Beyonce s onstage persona Sasha Fierce was overshadowed by a younger \nfemale. Fearless, by country starlet Taylor Swift, took that accolade   and was one of four wins for the 20-year-old.\n\n\n\nOther artists turning heads on Sunday night   or early on Monday morning, for Scottish viewers   included New York \npop act Lady Gaga, who         threatened to steal the show when she took to the stage in a green sequinned \nbodysuit complete with wings.\n\nThe unofficial prize for most outlandish costume was won by Imogen Heap, according to popular opinion, with an \nensemble that left many observers scratching their heads.\n\nDescribed by one website as a  twit dress , her frock featured a huge necklace displaying live messages from her \nTwitter feed, and it was accessorised with a TV-screen handbag that played videos fans were sending to her \naccount.\n\nThe few British winners on the night included Jeff Beck, for best rock instrumental performance, and English heavy \nmetal outfit Judas Priest. \n\nAC/DC, fronted by Glasgow-born brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, picked up  the first Grammy of their career \nfor  best hard rock performance.\n\nCONFIDENCE is high at St Johnstone and manager Derek McInnes is full of belief his team can become club \nlegends by beating Rangers in Wednesday s Co-operative Insurance Cup semi-final.\n\nThe Perth outfit have reached a fourth semi-final in three years, having lost to Hibernian in the same tournament in \nJanuary 2007 and suffered subsequent Scottish Cup losses at the penultimate stage to Celtic in April 2007 and \nRangers a year later.\n\nSaints have ousted Hibs and Dundee United this season to earn their showdown with Rangers at Hampden, and go \ninto the tie buoyed by Saturday s morale-boosting victory over Hearts. McInnes insists his team can go one step \nbetter than their previous hat-trick of disappointments and produce a shock by reaching the final.\n\n We ve been to three semi-finals now and, yes, we ve done well but let s see if we can get to a final and see what \nhappens then.\n\n I believe we can do it,  I believe we re good enough and I think the players think we re good enough   we ll find out \non Wednesday if we can be.\n\n We re here to be successful. We want to try to be remembered as a team that got to a cup final and hopefully lifted \na trophy. That s the motivation for us all. \n\n SOME people stay in football management until the undertakers arrive to take them away. For others, the \nexperience is condensed into a much shorter timeframe but is no less eventful as a result.\n\nTom Hendrie emerged as suddenly and spectacularly as a firework, illuminating Scottish football only to fade away \nalmost as quickly as he had arrived.\n\nThere was a neat symmetry to his coaching career. From combining managing part-time lower league clubs with \nworking as a maths teacher, he moved into full-time football in the first division, spent a season in the Scottish \nPremier League, had another spell in the first division, before returning to part-time management and the education \nsystem.\n\nNow only the teaching remains. His involuntary absence from football has allowed him time to reflect on his \nachievements during a dramatic, four-year spell in charge at St Mirren when he led the Paisley club to the SPL after \nan eight-year wait, as well as to a League Cup semi-final appearance in 2001, their last in that competition until \ntonight.\n\nIt eventually all ended in bitterness and recriminations but, for a time, it seemed as if Hendrie could do no wrong.\n\n\n\nLooking more relaxed than any teacher ought to after a day trying to educate unruly teenagers, he smiles at the \nrecollection of how he inherited a group of workmanlike first division players, and somehow got them promoted 18 \nmonths later.\n\n I was as surprised as anyone when we went on to win the league that season,  he said.  There was no expectation \nthat St Mirren would have a good season, certainly not for us to win it.\n\n But everything just felt into place and we went all the way to win the title. There was a fantastic feelgood factor \ngoing around Paisley. For the first time in a long time they had a football team playing well, scoring goals and sitting \ntop of the league. \n\nHendrie became an instant hero around the town but was not always as popular among opposing managers and \nfans. \n\nThere was a suspicion that he was not  a football man  despite a playing career that took in spells at Dundee, \nMeadowbank Thistle and Berwick Rangers, as well as leading Alloa Athletic to the third division title as manager.\n\nGiven football s propensity to promote from within, it led to Hendrie being cast as something of an outsider.\n\n Football and education don t seem to be the best of friends,  he shrugged.  When I went into full-time football, \nbecause I had an academic background, people thought I was a different breed, a different type. It was unusual to \nhave people in football with that background and it still is.\n\n I was probably treated a bit differently by football people as a result. I had to win my acceptance from the full-time \nmanagers. \n\nHis refusal to pick faults with his own team often saw him labelled as arrogant and over-confident, a stance that did \nnot go down well with some opponents. In one infamous cameo, an enraged Gary Mackay, then Airdrie United \nmanager, chased Hendrie down the tunnel after a match before jumping on his back.\n\n When we were doing well, I had a lot of problems with other managers talking from dug-out to dug-out. People \nwere fed up with me constantly saying how good my team was. People took it the wrong way. There were a lot of \nback-biting and bad words said about me but I was just trying to do my best for St Mirren. I think to get players to \nplay for you, you have to show a supreme belief in them. Sometimes people mistook that as me showing a supreme \nbelief in myself. \n\nWith any available funds needed to make their Love Street stadium SPL-compliant, Hendrie was given little money \nto improve the playing squad when St Mirren reached the top flight in 2000. It was little surprise they were relegated \nafter just one season.\n\n I wasn t daft. I knew we had punched above our weight to get promoted but that the team was nowhere near good \nenough to stay in the Premier League. We had to go and strengthen. But if I went for anybody in Scotland I was \ngetting beat left, right and centre by first division clubs who could offer more money.\n\n By Christmas we were six or seven points clear of Dundee United. And that was a massive turning point. I went to \nthe chairman then and told him we needed to buy players then if we were to capitalise on that lead we had. But the \nboard said they were not prepared to gamble the financial future of the club on staying up. \n\nAfter relegation, most of the squad was gradually sold off and St Mirren floundered in the first division. Hendrie \nknew the tide was turning and he was sacked in September 2002.\n\nFeeling the club had not paid what was due to him, he threatened to take legal action, before eventually settling out \nof court. It severed whatever relationship he had with St Mirren, a situation that has not been repaired to this day.\n\n\n\n The way it all ended was messy and not nice. It s probably the worst part of my football career. These things are \nnever easy but the board had made certain promises to me that they didn t keep. I just stood my ground and fought \nfor what I felt was right for me.\n\n It s a bit sad. I was at the last game at Love Street working for Hearts. A few people saw me and said I should have \nbeen out on the park with all the other former players and managers. But that invitation never arrived. \n\nHendrie looks at the subsequent career path of Jimmy Calderwood, manager of Dunfermline Athletic when they \nwere promoted alongside St Mirren in 2000, and wonders how life might have turned out if he had been allowed to \ninvest in the squad.\n\n You look at Jimmy Calderwood who went up with Dunfermline and spent a fortune, and kept them up for a good \nfew years.\n\n His career went through the roof. He went to Aberdeen and did well there and now he s at Kilmarnock. When he \nwent to Dunfermline they were \u00a33m in the black and he left with them \u00a312m in debt. So he spent \u00a315m and did \nreally well. I managed to make St Mirren a profit and got relegated.\n\n St Mirren have ended up back in the Premier League, so things have worked out fine for them but, from my \npersonal point of view, it s not been as good. I could still have been a Premier League manager now, who knows? \n\n~\n\nJim Jefferies hopes he can savour another glory night at Fir Park to keep alive his chances of making it third time \nlucky in the League Cup.\n\nThe new Hearts manager has fond memories of his last semi-final at the Lanarkshire venue when in charge of \nKilmarnock, namely a thumping 3-0 success over Falkirk just over three years ago.\n\nSteven Naismith grabbed a hat-trick for Kilmarnock to provide Jefferies with one of the highlights of his career.\n\nHearts fans can only hope the ground is a lucky omen for their new manager tonight, with St Mirren standing in the \nway of a Co-operative Insurance Cup final place next month.\n\nJefferies, who could book a Hampden final just days after dramatically succeeding Csaba Laszlo, said:  It was a \nfantastic evening back. The one big advantage of going to Fir Park is that it doesn t need a huge crowd to make a \ngreat atmosphere. But if it happens to be full, it ll be a cracking game. Hopefully we can do enough to be on top.\n\n We know the pitch isn t going to be the best the way the weather has been recently. I don t think it ll be a silky  \nsoccer game, more a blood and thunder cup tie. \n\nKilmarnock went on to lose the final to Hibs in 2007, emphatically beaten 5-1, while Jefferies  Hearts also lost the \n1997 League Cup final to Rangers.\n\nHe added:  It took me three visits to win the Scottish Cup [at Hearts in 1998] and I ve had two League Cup finals, so \nthis is a chance to be third time lucky. \n\nMusselburgh-born Jefferies has been welcomed with open arms back to Tynecastle given his success in charge \nfrom 1995-2000. Hearts are a different club now, one saddled with huge debt and currently cost-cutting under \nVladimir Romanov, but Jefferies feels he is the type of experience figure required to build on Laszlo s work.\n\nThe 59-year-old, who is hoping the club can finalise deals for his desired backroom team of Billy Brown and Gary \nLocke, said:  I think that is why we got a good reception on Saturday at St Johnstone.\n\n Fans remember the side we built here, the passion we had for the club and the way we tried to play. They ve \nalways had high expectations and we ve got to try to give them success. \n\n\n\nJefferies made his first move into the transfer market last night when he signed Ryan Stevenson, the promising \nyoung Ayr midfielder, for an undisclosed fee with Rocky Visconte going to Somerset Park on loan until the end of \nthe season.\n\nHearts  support will be demanding victory tonight after back-to-back defeats by Aberdeen and St Johnstone but \nJefferies has pleaded for patience.\n\n I ve got to know the players a bit better and we ll look to pick what we think is the strongest side available and \nhopefully get through to a final,  he said.\n\n But it s going to take a few weeks to get to know everyone. It s different to when I was last here, there are far more \nstaff about for a start. But that s progress, football moves on.\n\n I thought Csaba did a terrific job here, had his way of doing things, but everybody is different and we have to adapt \nnow how we go about things.\n\n It will take time, everybody is a bit apprehensive and that is normal. We ll endeavour to work hard to get this club \nright. Players are going to find a change, because everybody does it differently.\n\n But I have been in the game a long time. Different routines might just spark something.  \n\nJefferies will have no hesitation in calling on the club s group of youngsters if required.  I think there is a good crop \nhere, maybe a little bit less experienced than the ones I brought through last time. But the club has a great name for \npushing youngsters through and as time goes on I ll be trying to make sure that tradition is kept. If we can get a win \ntomorrow night it will make the next few days a lot more enjoyable, as I can get a bit of time to do things. \n\nJohn Fleck is still finding his way from being considered a player of great promise to something a little more \nmeaningful. He is seeking substance, or to establish the credentials of his ability among the more hardened \nreputations of the Rangers first team, but he has at least gathered some achievements to his name.\n\nIn May 2008, he became the youngest player to appear in the Scottish Cup final, when he came off the bench \nagainst Queen of the South, and another cup competition might allow a return to Hampden for the 18-year-old. \nFleck featured as a substitute in last season s League Cup semi-final, when Rangers defeated Falkirk, and he is \nlikely to be involved in Wednesday night s encounter with St Johnstone at the same stage of the competition.\n\nFleck yesterday received the young player of the round award for his goal and shining performance in the quarter-\nfinal victory over Dundee last October, when Rangers sent a side containing a number of fringe players to Dens \nPark and won 3-1. Having scoring in the 3-0 victory over Falkirk at Ibrox at the weekend, there is now a sense of \nFleck beginning to come of age.\n\n It would be fantastic to play in another Hampden cup final, but St Johnstone will be a difficult game and we will \nneed to play well to progress,  Fleck said.  Dundee made it difficult for us, but that made the result even more \npleasing. To go to Dens and get a win with so many players missing that night says a lot about the character in our \nsquad. I enjoyed playing up front in the second half as that is my natural position. \n\nFleck was joined in the first team that night by Jordan McMillan and Danny Wilson, with the latter now having \nbecome a regular in defence when either Madjid Bougherra or David Weir, the first-choice centre-backs, are \nmissing. With Walter Smith, the Rangers manager, relying on younger players to add depth to his squad, the \nemergence of the kind of talent represented by Fleck and Wilson is significant.\n\n Danny is getting stronger and has already played in Old Firm games and the Champions League,  said Fleck.  \nThere are a lot of talented young players at the club and players like Andrew Little and Jamie Ness regularly train \nwith the first team and are on the bench. \n\nTomorrow in The Herald: the impact on our health service and police forces\n\n\n\nNoel Gallagher s only two concerts planned for this year have been announced as part of a string of charity gigs \nclimaxing with a performance of Quadrophenia by The Who.\n\nSuede, JLS, Arctic Monkeys, The Specials and Depeche Mode are also among the line-up raising cash for the \nTeenage Cancer Trust.\n\nThe 10-night season, taking place between February and March, celebrates the charity s 10th year of music and \ncomedy at London s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThe event will reach its grand finale with The Who s performance of Quadrophenia.\n\nWho singer Roger  Daltrey, patron of Teenage Cancer Trust, said:  When The Who first got together in 2000 to \nraise money for this brilliant charity, I had no idea we d achieve so much from these shows.\n\n In the last 10 years we ve raised more than \u00a38.7 million, helping Teenage Cancer Trust to open nine specialist \ncancer units for young people across the UK.\n\n Our 10th anniversary shows are set to break all records for Teenage Cancer Trust. \n\nTickets go on sale on Friday.

Paul and Rachel have not got a clue what s going on. They are sat \nthere in a hell hole wondering why people aren t helping them.\n\n The door is open for them to be released. Somebody needs to pick up the gauntlet and run with it.\n\n For the amounts involved I don t think it s worth  trying to bring anyone to justice. We just need to get Paul and \nRachel home.\n\n We are the people who know what needs to be done, we just need to be allowed to do it. \n\nMr Davis said he could not act without the  green light  from the Foreign Office and the family.\n\nHe said he planned a \u00a3100,000 deal in November 2009 but the Foreign Office didn t return his calls.\n\nHe said that the price was likely to have risen in the meantime but would remain a  pretty small sum in the scheme \nof things .\n\nHe said that he believed the pirates were unlikely to harm the couple and added:  They don t want Paul and Rachel \nany more. It s costing them a lot of money to keep them alive.\n\n I have a suspicion they will soon lose patience. The Government needs to understand that this could turn against \nthem. \n\nhttp://www.teenagecancertrust.org/\n\n\nMr Miliband said the  Foreign Office was working  very closely  with the Chandler family.\n\nHe told Sky News:  Obviously there s a very high level of concern.\n\n We re using all the networks that we have in that part of the world, and we ve been very clear with the Chandlers \nhere about how we re doing that. \n\nCOUNCILS are preparing to slash services for vulnerable groups as public sector budget cuts begin to bite across \nScotland.\n\nHowever, many are being accused of undermining the very types of provision that are likely to be vital to reshaping \npublic services in the long term.\n\nWith an increasing elderly population and other pressures on council funding, the need in the future will be for more \nservices to be delivered in the community, with people given support to stay in their own homes. \n\nCharity chiefs are warning that many of the organisations providing this sort of support on behalf of councils may \nnot survive the current round of belt-tightening exercises.\n\nIn Glasgow, a city-wide voluntary sector network is opposing the council s plans for grant integration, which include \na target of 20% efficiency savings. \n\nAccording to Glasgow Council for Voluntary Services, this may lead to the closure of several organisations and the  \ncomplete disappearance of well-established and credible names from the Glasgow landscape . \n\nLiz McEntee, head of external relations at the umbrella group, says:  The proposals will affect young children at risk, \nthe elderly, people with disabilities, people with addictions, those with physical and mental health problems, \nminorities groups, asylum seekers and refugees and young people   and this list is not exhaustive. \n\nMany charities fear such a list is representative of what is happening on a wider scale. Leaked plans from \nEdinburgh City Council include cuts to services commissioned by their children and families department, and the \ncouncil has acknowledged that some organisations may be forced to close as a result.\n\nYouth clubs, a women s support centre and a service for vulnerable children run by Barnardo s are among the \npotential targets for cuts.\n\nAberdeen is consulting on a budget which, if passed, would see the closure of a residential unit for vulnerable \npeople, while the council also plans to axe a \u00a3100,000 grant to Citizen s Advice Scotland. \n\nThe picture materialising in other councils is similar. East Ayrshire proposes to save \u00a320,000 by charging homeless \nclients for storing their possessions while they are waiting  for accommodation, while Dumfries and Galloway is \nconsidering charging social work clients more for some services and cutting the budget for classes in English as a \nsecond language. \n\nLucy McTernan, head of policy for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, said:  What s deeply worrying is \nthat local authorities and others seem in danger of taking very short-term decisions, which could be very costly in \nthe long term. \n\nIN the grim financial world of present-day savings and future cuts, the arts have had to make a convincing claim for \ntheir worth and the importance of funding them.\n\nSome of the major names in Scotland s cultural ecosystem   the Edinburgh International Festival, for example   look \nset to lose significant funds from local authorities in the coming years, while others appear to have dodged a \nfinancial bullet.\n\nCertainly, in previous recessions, the arts were seen as the soft touch when it came to slashing local or national \nbudgets.\n\n\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, some savage cuts were made to the nation s theatres, orchestras and arts \ncompanies, when some felt support for the arts perpetuated an  elitist  activity, and when the economic and social \ncase for the support of the arts had not been properly articulated, or had not been listened to.\n\nAlthough it is perhaps foolish, before some councillors even vote, to guess exactly how leading arts companies   \ntheatres, festivals, orchestras, bands, dance groups and arts centres  will fare as councils try to cut a national figure \nof \u00a3270 million from their budgets, it appears this year s cuts may not be as destructive as some feared.\n\nInsiders have told The Herald that none of the financial measures to be recommended by  Culture and Sport \nGlasgow will endanger the future of any major arts organisation in the city.\n\nLast year it was feared that one of the most famous theatres in the city, The Citizens Theatre in Gorbals, could be in \nthe frame for a significant cut because it receives the largest single grant from the Glasgow City Council, one of \nmore than \u00a3450,000. However, a source told The Herald:  There will be nothing that will endanger what they do.  \nThe same is said to apply to another theatre in the city, The Tron, which receives a grant of \u00a3200,000 from the city.  \nIn Glasgow, it is not the bad news story,  a source said.\n\nEdinburgh also seems to have resisted the temptation to severely cut the budgets of arts bodies in the city. Some of \nthe figures involved look stark   with the Edinburgh International Festival receiving predicted cuts of \u00a337,000, then \n\u00a385,316 and then in 2012/13 a cut of \u00a382,330. In total it will see its grant from the council decrease from \u00a32.474m \nthis year to \u00a32.269m in 2012/13.\n\nHowever, a source at the EIF said it was philosophical about the cuts. In proposing only a 1.5% cut in the coming \nyear, the City of Edinburgh Council had shown faith and trust in the power of the festivals to help generate \neconomic benefits for the city, an insider said.\n\nOther venues in the city   such as the Traverse, Royal Lyceum and Filmhouse, are likely to be hit by escalating cuts \nover the next three years of 2.5%, then 4.5% and another 4.5% reduction in their grants. \n\nThe Royal Scottish National Orchestra faces cuts of 3.5% this year   nearly \u00a32000   and then 4.5% and another \n4.5% in 2011/12.\n\nThere is no doubt that local authorities are vital players in the cultural landscape.\n\nA confidential report compiled for Vocal   the voice of chief officers for cultural and leisure services in Scotland   has \nfound the total gross expenditure on culture and sport in local authorities is \u00a3752m, with the sector providing more \nthan 6000 full-time jobs.\n\nIt also shows that in 38% of councils, funding for culture has declined in the last three years. \n\nHowever, 46% said that arts and culture were a  high priority . The three main dangers to continued cultural \nfunding, it said, were reduced financial resources, competing priorities, and reduced staff resources.\n\nIT may be known as the  big day  but more than 40% of Britons want to slim down before their wedding, a study \nrevealed today.\n\nWhile they would like to lose an average of 8lb (3.65kg), 12% of those questioned want to lose at least  two stones \n(13kg) before walking down the aisle.\n\nThere appears to be greater pressure to get in shape for women, who want to lose twice as much as men   an \naverage of 11lb (4.58kg) compared with 5lb (2.25kg)   according to the study by Greenbee Wedding Insurance.\n\nThe survey of more than 2000 people also found that 10% would spend more than a year making pre-wedding \nlifestyle changes.\n\n\n\nScots were the most image conscious, with one in five wanting to lose more than two stones   almost double the \nfigure in Wales and the South West (11%).\n\nPeople in Scotland also expect to spend the most time   8.01 months on average   on wedding preparations.\n\nHowever, researchers found that 58% of men and 36% of women surveyed had no intention of losing weight at all.\n\nJohn Brady, commercial director at Greenbee, said:  Looking good on one of the most important days of life is \nunderstandably very important.\n\n However, while losing the pounds in weight may be a key aim for many brides and grooms-to-be, looking after the \npounds in your pockets and protecting your big day with wedding insurance should also be a key priority. \n\nA GRANDFATHER has died from  horrendous  injuries after slipping on  ice and being run over by a car.\n\nPensioner Robert Quigley, 73, was left with a fractured skull, broken pelvis and serious leg injuries after the freak \naccident.\n\nThe retired bricklayer had been in a dimly lit car park in Paisley, Renfrewshire, when he slipped and struck his head \non the tarmac.\n\nAs he lay semi-conscious on the ground he was run over by a 4x4 after the driver failed to spot him.\n\nMr Quigley, who had 40 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren, fought for his life after the accident on January \n16, but died at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley last Wednesday.\n\nHis distraught daughter Linda Kerr, 47, said:  Everyone is devastated and we are really struggling to come to terms \nwith my dad s death and how it happened \n\nMr Quigley s death comes just 15 months after his best friend was killed after being knocked down just yards from \nthe same car park.\n\nLewis Grocott, 74, died after being struck by a car as he walked in nearby George Street, Paisley.\n\nAn investigation into  the accident involving Mr Quigley is continuing and police are appealing for witnesses to \ncome forward with information.\n\nDepartment store John Lewis will open a shop next to the Olympic Park as part of its sponsorship of the London \n2012 Games.\n\nThe shop in Stratford, east London, will open in 2011 and sell Games-related merchandise.\n\nJohn Lewis staff will also have the chance to work with the London 2012 team in the build-up to the Games, to help \nfurnish lounge and reception areas at Games venues and  provide warehouse space.\n\nLondon 2012 chairman Lord Coe said of the firm:  They supported us during the bid and so it is fantastic to have \nthem on board as a sponsor. They bring a wealth of retail experience, which will be invaluable to us. \n\nLondon 2012 must raise \u00a32 billion from the private sector to stage the Games.\n\nBILLY McLaren was the linchpin of his family; a fit and active father who had worked every day of his adult life to \nsupport his wife and two sons.\n\nHowever, when the then  68-year-old was diagnosed with kidney cancer, his pension did not stretch to cover the \nextra expenses.\n\nFortunately, Macmillan Cancer Support benefits specialist Henri Krishna stepped in to help Mr McLaren and his wife \nElise, 68.\n\n\n\nBilly died in August last year, just six months after being diagnosed, but Elise says the extra help from Henri made \nthat terrible time easier.\n\n I worked for Boots all my days and Billy had worked from the age of 15.

Daniela Hantuchova (Svk) 290\n\nScotland suffered a double blow yesterday when Rory Lamont and Al Strokosch, two of those who started \nNovember s heroic win over Australia, were ruled out of Sunday s RBS 6 Nations opener against France.\n\nBoth have ankle problems and Lamont is staying with the Scotland squad as he continues his rehab, which in turn \nsuggests that Strokosch may have a more serious problem since he is being sent back to  his club Gloucester to be \ntreated by their medical team.\n\nThe saving grace is that there is high-quality cover in both cases and their early withdrawal at least has the benefit \nof clarifying their situation, rather than leaving coaches wondering if they have done the right thing either way.\n\nWith Jason White, the former captain who replaced Strokosch during that defeat of the Wallabies, out with a long-\nterm injury, the in- form Kelly Brown would seem likely to return and join Johnny Barclay and John  Beattie, his \nGlasgow clubmates, in the back-row.\n\nLamont s withdrawal leaves a choice between the ever- reliable Chris Paterson, with his world class goal-kicking \nability, and Hugo Southwell, his former Edinburgh clubmate, which leads into a nice topical discussion.\n\nWe are after all, in election year, so conservative or labour? Paterson or Southwell? Phil Godman or Dan Parks? \nAlex Grove or Graeme Morrison? Al Kellock or Jim Hamilton? The analogy is simplistic, but it cuts to the essence of \nthe options facing Andy Robinson as he announces his first Six Nations Championship side as Scotland coach.\n\nThere are, of course, radical options, most obviously in the shape of uncapped Glasgow pair Ruaridh Jackson and \nRichie Gray. However,  Robinson has enough quality available to believe he need not take too many risks, so in \nlooking for the right combinations generally and in the key play-making area in particular, he is unlikely to deviate \nfrom those who have served him well.\n\nThat in itself represents a bit of a problem for Robinson because in terms of the way he wants to keep opponents \nguessing, the two players who are in terms of their skill sets best equipped to deliver a full array of options have had \ntoo little in the way of exposure to playing in that area.\n\nIn Paterson s case, a decade of agonising has left the most gifted back of his generation admitting to still pondering \nwhat might have been had he played more at stand-off. At the other end of the experience scale Jackson has \nshown, not least when working under Robinson in Romania with Scotland A last summer, that he potentially boasts \nthe most rounded game of the four, but injury has blighted his season.\n\nJackson s loss was Parks  gain allowing him the run that has seen him regain peak form, but his natural playing \nstyle is least well suited to what Robinson seems to aspire to in terms of playing style.\n\nThe coach also knows that Scotland s attacking play, having been utterly uninspired throughout the decade-old Six \nNations version of the International Championship, is an area commentators are fixated upon. It is a case of being \nas efficient with the ball as without it, but that is easier said than done.\n\n Defensively we re making very good good decisions and under pressure we re able to control and stay within the \nframework. In attack we need to be able to keep that shape and framework, but also make decisions under \npressure and produce the execution under pressure,  Robinson said.\n\n It s a little bit easier to achieve in defence because you re aligned together and your roles are fairly simple, \nwhereas in attack it s a little bit harder and what we re always learning is how we can take the shape we have in \nputting pressure on in defence to the attacking structure and the decision-making we need.\n\n For us to be controlling the scoreboard we ll need our quicker guys with the ball in space. We ve also got some \nstrong ball-carriers, but when we get close to the line we just can t dive around the side. We ve got to be able to \nmove the ball. \n\n\n\nThe best way of achieving that might be to align Godman s distributive skills with Alex Grove s reading of the game \nand Max Evans  instinctive ability to beat opponents.\n\nAdmittedly that may look a less than imposing midfield, especially if Paterson was behind them, since Southwell is \ntwo inches taller and more than two and a half stones heavier than Scotland s most-capped player.\n\nThat said, it might surprise a few to discover that, in terms of physical presence, that Scotland midfield would be \nonly a collective two kilos lighter than the Ronan O Gara, Gordon D Arcy, Brian O Driscoll combination that has \nserved Ireland so well down the years.\n\nWhile the Brewin Dolphin Scottish Schools Under-18 Cup pauses before the final at Murrayfield a week on \nThursday, the other layers of the competition have some distance to go before completion. \n\nWest schools are unrepresented in the Cup finals at under level   Hutchesons  Grammar are in the final of the U15 \ncup   but there will be a guaranteed presence in the final of the Plate with either Belmont Academy or Wellington \nSchool certain to be contesting the ultimate round. \n\nThe two Ayrshire schools are drawn in the semi-final of the U18 Plate but as yet the other two semi-finalists have \nstill to be determined. The perennial backlog, made considerably worse by the recent cold snap, has meant that \nthere are still two outstanding quarter-final matches to be played, Royal High School v Kelso High School and \nBanchory Academy v Linlithgow Academy. \n\nOf the four, Royal High School have the pedigree, having been previous winners of the Plate competition and with \nhome advantage they will be favourites to defeat Kelso High School. Banchory Academy v Linlithgow Academy is a \ntougher call but again home advantage for the Deeside team could be significant. \n\nDown a level in the Bowl competition all four semi-finalists are now in place. Williamwood High School s 15-7 win \nover Calderglen High School earned the south Glasgow school a place in the semi-final with a home game against \nBerwickshire High School, where former Scotland winger Cammy Murray is an inspirational presence. \n\nBerwickshire gave notice of their strength with a 95-5 quarter-final win over Ross High. The other semi-final will be \nbetween Kinross High School, who had a walkover against Tain Royal Academy and Aberdeen Grammar School. \n\n Barely 24 hours after Andy Murray s emotional defeat by Roger Federer in the Australian Open final, the two men \nwere back together again last night as they left Melbourne on the long flights back to Europe. As Federer and family \nweaved their way through the airport, Murray must have been wondering when he is ever to going to see the back \nof the world No.1.\n\nUnfortunately for the Scot, that is unlikely to be too soon but Murray boarded his flight knowing that he is getting \never closer to the Swiss and that his own skills are bringing out the best in Federer, to the extent where he \ndescribed his 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 win here as  some of the best tennis he has ever played .\n\nIt will perhaps be of some consolation to Murray, then, that he is forcing the Swiss to improve again to stop him \nfrom winning that coveted first grand-slam title. As he posed with the trophy yesterday, after a night that included \nmore than the odd glass of champagne, Federer admitted that Murray was pushing him hard.\n\n He neutralises you very well,  Federer said.  He tangles you up in these rallies and you can t do anything about it \nbecause if you play too aggressively you lose and if you play too passively you lose. \n\n You have to have this perfect balance, so for me to be able to come out and do it, when I m well known for being \nhot-blooded on court sometimes and going after my shots time and time again, last night was a tricky situation. To \ncome through those moments and prove myself again over all those years is amazing. \n\nIt was indeed amazing and Federer shows no sign of slowing. The way he has kept himself supremely fit and most \nimportantly of all, largely injury free over the best part of a decade is a lesson to everyone, including Murray, who \nknows that winning one of the four major titles will be far from easy.\n\n\n\n At Wimbledon, Federer is still going to be favourite for the next few years, while on the clay Rafa [Nadal] is still the \nbest player when he is fit,  Murray said.\n\n On the hard courts Roger plays great but there are guys who can win against him if they play their best. But if he is \nfit and motivated and his body holds up, which is the most important thing, then he can go on. \n\n Look at someone like [Lleyton] Hewitt who has just had hip surgery, Roger has never had a surgery, he has kept \nhimself in good shape and if his body holds there s no doubt he can play for another four or five years. \n\nMurray is far from despondent though after a month of tennis in which he showed that his game is progressing all \nthe time. The way he prepared for Melbourne was a success, obviously, and he is sure to be a threat at all the \ngrand-slam events from now on.\n\n I only dropped one set going into the final and beat some really tough players on the way. So it s been great,  I \nenjoyed my time over here, just a shame the final didn t go my way,  he said.  There is obviously stuff I need to \nwork on and get better at. I lost to the best player of all time so there s not too much that can get loads better in my \ngame.  I can improve on a few things, I ll keep working on my serve and physically I can still get better. I d have \nliked to have played better in the service box, I missed a few volleys  I shouldn t have done. \n\nHis next tour stop is due to be in Marseille, starting on February 15, before he heads to Dubai and then to the \nUnited States for back-to-back Masters Series events in Indian Wells and Miami.\n\nManaging his schedule in order to maximise his chances is uppermost in Murray s mind and if anything does not fit \nin, he will not be shy to change plans.\n\n I don t feel I have to play every week so I can spend more time at home and pick my schedule a lot better,  he said.  \nI m more relaxed than I was 18 months or two years ago for sure. \n\nJohn Higgins is now favourite to replace Ronnie O Sullivan as the sport s No.1 player next season following his win \nin the totesport.com Welsh Open.\n\nThe Wishaw player beat Ali Carter 9-4 at the Newport Centre on Sunday night to claim his 21st ranking title. With \nthe comprehensive victory over the defending champion, the Scot has now pulled even further ahead of the O \nSullivan in the current world standings.\n\nHiggins is now so far ahead of O Sullivan in the provisional rankings that if he were to match his rival s performance \nin next month s China Open, he will be guaranteed the official top spot before they go to the Crucible in April.\n\n I just want to win as many titles as I can,  said Higgins.   I ve had my time in the doldrums so when you are on a \nhigh you want to keep it going.\n\n I ve always felt that ranking tournaments are the ones to go for so I m just delighted to add another one. I m feeling \nreally confident at the moment and just taking it as it comes. \n\nHiggins is also just one title away from levelling O Sullivan s 22 ranking title trophies, with Steve Davis (28) and \nScottish compatriot Stephen Hendry (36) still the most successful players to have played the game.\n\n China will be a big tournament because it could still be close, although Ronnie will probably have to win that to get \nback into the race,  said Higgins.  It would be good to have it sewn up before Sheffield. But in 1998, a chain of \nevents had to go my way for me to get the No.1, and that s what happened, so I m not taking it for granted. \n\nHiggins said that his 10-8 defeat to Ding Junhui in last month s Pukka Pies UK Championship final had given him \nextra motivation to win this year s Welsh title for the first time in 10 years.\n\n I didn t enjoy losing the UK final so I was trying my hardest. The first five frames [on Sunday] were the hardest I ve \nconcentrated in a long while. I really didn t want to lose this one. \n\n\n\n* Scotland s Six Nations opener against France on Sunday is heading for a sell-out. Andy Robinson will take charge \nof the Scots for the first time in a championship match at Murrayfield (kick-off 3pm).\n\nLast night, just over 6000 tickets were left for sale at the 67,500-capacity venue for the French meeting. \u00a330 adult \nbriefs are now sold out with only \u00a350 and \u00a370 tickets available. Students and U-18 s can attend for \u00a315, \u00a325 or \u00a335 \nwhere applicable.

Mr Murphy \nhailed the MoD contract with Babcock as a boost to the Scottish economy.\n\nHe said:  UK defence contracts provide vital skilled work to companies in Scotland and have generated a welcome \nresurgence in our Scottish shipbuilding industry.\n\n It s heartening to see businesses   some small family owned firms   with full order books, able to take on \napprentices and give them a future.\n\n Aircraft carriers have a crucial role within the armed forces and on operations worldwide, so these upgrades are \npart of the strategy to ensure we have the best people, the best equipment and capabilities to meet modern-day \ndefence challenges. \n\nThe latest work on HMS Illustrious, which has participated in most major UK and Nato campaigns since it was \ncommissioned in Portsmouth in 1982, will involve replacing 500 metres of pipework; 650 valves and all eight \nexhausts; painting the ship with 540,000 litres of paint; and making it more fuel-efficient.\n\nThe contract is part of a  continuous programme of work at the dockyard before the assembly of two new Navy \nsuper carriers begins.\n\nConcern has previously  been raised that the new aircraft carriers would be placed under threat as cuts in public  \nsector spending are pushed through over the next financial year. \n\nIn September, Shadow Chancellor George Osborne signalled that defence would be one area ripe for cutting when \nhe referred to the approved projects, saying that he did not know the detail of the  break clauses  in the  aircraft \ncarriers contract. \n\nIt comes as the first strategic defence review in more than a decade is due to take place after the election of the \nnext Westminster Parliament. It will consider the strategic needs of the UK, lessons learned from British \ninvolvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as technological changes.\n\nFORMER Doctor Who actor David Tennant is to star as former Scottish ambassador Craig Murray in a play on BBC \nRadio 4. Based on Murray s memoirs of his tenure in Uzbekistan, it s aired on February 20. \n\nhttp://www.scottishrugbytickets.com/\n\n\nGLASGOW S oldest building is to close for a month for renovation work. Provand s Lordship in Castle Street, which \ndates from 1471, is now  a museum attracting 100,000 visitors each  year.

ABF The \nSoldiers  Charity, which offers help such as adapting homes after injury, will have to increase fundraising from \u00a37 \nmillion to \u00a314m a year by 2015.\n\nSUPERMODEL Elle Macpherson is to be  the new presenter of Britain s Next Top Model. Macpherson replaces  \nLisa Snowdon as host of the show, which sees 25 aspiring beauties compete for a modelling contract. The new \nseries will be screened this summer.\n\nThe sonnet to mark 1000 days since Madeleine McCann s disappearance  from her family s holiday home in  \nPortugal, composed by our unofficial northern laureate, Simon Armitage, reminds us how powerful words can be. \n\nSometimes, just a few lines can be more effective than reams of text. Less is more. Indeed, sometimes, silence can \nbe the best poem of all. \n\nIt has been a good year for poetry so far. Christopher Reid won the \u00a330,000 Costa Book of the Year for his verse \ncollection A Scattering, while the poem Invictus, which has already had much publicity after Gordon Brown \nmentioned it as a favourite, will enjoy more attention when the film of the same name is released. \n\nAfter the General Election, its line  Beyond this place of wrath and tears  will surely have an extra resonance for Mr \nBrown. \n\nReid s book is a tribute to his wife, Lucinda Gane, who died of cancer in 2005. Twenty-five years ago, the Scottish \npoet Douglas Dunn won the same prize with his collection, Elegies. Back then the prize was called the Whitbread \nBook of the Year (beer gave way to coffee in 2006). \n\nDunn s collection had the same inspiration as Reid s: the death of his wife. A poem could be written about these \npoets remembering their loved ones in verse.\n\nColeridge famously described poetry as  the best words in the best possible order . When it works, it can give us \nlines that stay with us, just as little Madeleine s face does. \n\nOften, we don t know that a line or phrase is from a poem. Dee Brown called his classic history of the North \nAmerican Indian Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee. But how many know that the title is from the poem American \nNames by Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t? The line is so famous it was wittily adapted by the science-fiction writer Brian \nAldiss. He called his memoirs Bury My Heart at W H Smith s.\n\nWhat is the function of a parent? Are we here to guard and protect our children? Some of us excel at that. Or are \nwe here to guide them through a set of life experiences that will set them up as confident, independent adults? If the \nlatter, are we failing? It wouldn t be difficult in this risk-averse society. \n\nYesterday I read about a mother and child walking group in Yorkshire   a simple but excellent enterprise that \nintroduced children to the countryside. It was organised by health visitors and offered companionship, exercise, the \nopportunity to learn about plants and birds, and to enjoy the natural landscape. \n\nIt was, of course, crushed. The local Community Service decided there were  too many uncontrollable risks during \nwinter months . There will have been iced-over puddles to slip on, snow to sink into and snowballs to dodge. \n\nI took a walk in the Pentland Hills one Sunday when our snow was at its peak. It looked like Switzerland. The slopes \nwere freckled with families and parties of young people. They were skiing, snow- boarding, sledging and just sliding \nwithout asking anyone s permission. Did I pity the children? (Some must have gone home with bumps and bruises.) \nDid I look and think: what reckless parents? Of course I didn t.\n\n\n\nThe children I pitied as I drove back to town were those trapped indoors in front of a television or computer all day. \nNot for them the thrill of hurtling downhill at speed with the wind in their face, the sight of sun glinting off virgin snow, \nthe exhaustion at the end of a day out of doors and the corresponding pleasure of returning to a warm house for \ntea.\n\nThere is a new book which is climbing the best-seller list in the US and which is just about to go global. Initially it \nwas spurned by publishers as too dangerous to print but was snapped up by parents through  print on demand  on \nthe internet. It has an unlikely title: Fifty Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do).\n\nTop among them are: own a pocket knife, play with fire,  throw a spear and drive a car.  The authors want parents \nto encourage their children to learn through experience.\n\nTo the average baby boomer, that s nothing new but what about today s children? How many of them lead a life \ncircumscribed by home, car television and computer? For how many are outings restricted to trips to school, the \nshops or an afternoon at the cinema? \n\nHow many rely on electronic games and Wii for adventure and exploration? Isn t that where the real danger lies?\n\nTo my mind, children are at risk when their relaxation is circumscribed by a television in the sitting room and a \ncomputer in the bedroom. Their diet is high in sugar and their physical activity happens at school. Their knowledge \nand understanding of the world is all third-hand. No matter how much cash their parents spend on them, I say they \nare being neglected.\n\nGever Tulley and Julie Speigler, co-authors of the book, are recommending activities that instruct and empower a \nchild. \n\nIf they climb a tree and fall, they ll climb it better the next time. If they light a fire and watch how much faster paper \nburns than sticks, they ll understand its purpose and its dangers in a way that no amount of telling will achieve. \n\nSit them on your knee to let  them steer a car around a field or empty car park   and they will  feel its weight and its \npower. Give them a tool kit and allow them to hammer and saw old bits of wood. Instead of throwing out the old \nwashing machine, help them take  it to bits and work out how the insides function.\n\nThe book comes with a disclaimer. The authors accept no liability for injury. Yet I bet there s scarcely an idea in it \nthat Baden-Powell didn t include in his Scouting handbook. (Well, I doubt he suggested that they lick a nine-volt \nbattery or glue their finger and thumb together.)\n\nBut Baden-Powell understood that the best way to rear a happy child is to supervise them while they learn by \nexperience. He empowered them. He challenged them to use their initiative and rewarded them with badges for \ntheir achievements.\n\nI can remember seeing the  wreck of a nephew returning from his first camping trip. He had pitched a tent on a \ndamp patch, failed to sleep, cooked sausages  that were raw in the middle and burned on the outside, explored the \nwoods and returned home black and blue, exhausted, starving and utterly exhilarated. \n\nI m describing a childhood that used to be common currency. Country-dwellers climbed rocks, dug pits and made \ndens. Before traffic pushed people indoors, town-dwellers skipped and played ball and hopscotch in the streets and \nlearned how to jump off a moving bus before it reached the stop   or jump on as it was pulling away.\n\nThat was before the authorities got it into their communal head that life should be risk free. You only have to look at \nHaiti and wonder what good it does the people that every plastic bag on the island probably carries a warning that it \ncould suffocate.\n\nWe live on the crust of a small molten planet spinning through space   and we think we can make life safe? It s a \njoke.\n\n\n\nMothers develop an instinct to protect when they are pregnant.  It s very strong in some of us    me included. I was \nfar too over-protective a parent, to my great regret. Yet, looking back, even my kids had a tool kit, a pen knife, a \nbow and arrows, picnics with fires and bicycles. \n\nParental fear needs to be  channelled into action. Children shouldn t be kept from the experience of danger but \nmentored through it. \n\nIt s something mankind has known and practised since we lived in caves. It s something we have unlearned and \nour new ignorance is being encouraged by nonsensical and self-protective laws and guidelines.\n\nHealth and safety has nothing to do with either health or safety. It has to do with money; with protecting the service \nprovider or licensing authority from injury claims.\n\nWell, there s more to life than money. And more to a decent childhood than a computer screen. I ll add a suggestion \nto Tulley s list. I suggest children should make a collection of Health and Safety booklets and (with parental \nsupervision) torch them on a bonfire.\n\nWe should have a bonfire of daft health and safety rules\n\nLight a fire and watch how much faster paper burns than sticks\n\nA PRIMARY school teacher tells us she was talking to her class about how her young son had just had his first \nhaircut, and that she had kept a curl as a keepsake.\n\nThe class looked bemused so she explained about keeping things because you felt sentimental  about them.\n\n I know what you mean, Miss,  said one of her class.  When my cat died, I kept his paw. \n\nTHE government has announced plans to try to halve the number of smokers in England by 2020.\n\n Surely the easiest way,  said one golf club philosopher,  is to give them more cigarettes? \n\nREADER Dougie McNicol was surprised to hear a BBC Radio Scotland sports reporter state that Celtic manager \nTony Mowbray  must be concerned about the timing of the brown stuff coming out .\n\nHe thought that a very rude suggestion until he realised it was merely a comment on the stories claiming that player \nScott Brown was to be sold. \n\n ALL that hurt and humiliation,  said the chap in the pub the other night.  Footballer Wayne Bridge [pictured] should \nget a medal for putting up with the revelations about John Terry and his former girlfriend.\n\n After all,  he added,  he s not going to get one playing for Manchester City. \n\nTHE death of legendary newspaper editor Max McAuslane reminds former colleague Ken Thomson of when the \nMirror Group bought over the Daily Record, and Mirror editorial director Hugh Cudlipp was introduced to Max, who \nwas then the Record s news editor.\n\n Some people say that I m a bit  of a bastard,  said Hugh, attempting to lighten the moment.

He was \nfirst appointed captain in May 2007 after the World Cup and led Pakistan in three Tests and 36 ODIs, before \nhanding over the reins to Younus Khan in early 2009. Malik will be the third captain on this tour, after Mohammad \nYousuf and  Afridi.\n\nMeanwhile, chief selector Iqbal Qasim has also announced his resignation.\n\nHe has stepped down in the aftermath of defeat in the fifth one-day match at the WACA yesterday.\n\nEVENTSCOTLAND, the government-sponsored agency, has given a long-term commitment to support golf in \nScotland well beyond the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, writes Jim Black.\n\nMindful of what has happened in Ireland since the 2006 match was staged at the K Club and the subsequent \nwithdrawal of government funding, Robbie Clyde, EventScotland s project co-ordinator for the 2014 Ryder Cup, is \nadamant that the same will not be the case in Scotland.\n\nThere has been no Challenge Tour or Senior Tour event in Ireland since the Ryder Cup and only the late \nintervention of the sponsors 3 saved last year s Irish Open from being removed from the European Tour schedule.\n\nClyde, speaking following the announcement that Macdonald Hotels  Spey Valley Course will host the Scottish \nHydro Challenge for the next two years at least in conjunction with the sponsor s \u00a31m three-year deal, also stressed \nthe importance of the organisation s commitment to the development of young Scottish talent.\n\nHe said:  The Scottish Hydro Challenge completes our portfolio across every level of the game, with the Open back \nat St Andrews, the Seniors at Carnoustie and the return of the Scottish Ladies Open. Our commitment is long-term. \nWhen we sat down with Ryder Cup Europe we suggested that we commit to investment in golf tournaments beyond \n2014 specifically to avoid what has happened in the past when funding dried up. \n\nThe agency is contributing \u00a3150,000 to the Challenge Tour event, which is being brought forward several weeks to \nJune.\n\nLast year s tournament, won by the Scot Jamie McLeary, was staged at Aviemore at the end of July and clashed \nwith the Scottish Amateur Championship. The June 10-13 date this year ensures there will be no fresh conflict of \ninterest. \n\n\n\nThe organisers also hope to persuade several prominent Scots from the European Tour to compete for the \u00a328,000 \ntop prize after former Open champion Paul Lawrie s presence last year raised the profile of the tournament.\n\nMichael Sim, the Aberdeen-born Australian, cemented his place in the world s top 50 with his joint second place \nfinish in the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego that took him up 16 places yesterday to world No.34.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who earned his PGA Tour card via the Nationwide Tour last year, finished a shot behind winner \nBen Crane of the US, who jumped 53 places to No.56.\n\nScotland s Martin Laird closed with a four-under-par 68 for joint 27th place but fell three places to world No.87. He \nwill need a finish like Sim s at this week s Northern Trust Open at the Riviera Club in Los Angeles to meet his target \nof making the top 64 who will start the WGC-Accenture World Matchplay Championship in Tucson in just over a \nfortnight.\n\nRichie Ramsay, however, moved up four places to world No.124 after his joint 32nd in the Qatar Masters and will \nhead to the Dubai Desert Classic this week in a mood of growing confidence. Marc Warren was top Scot in joint \n20th place and entered the world s top 300 at No.279.\n\nLee Westwood just missed out on reaching his highest-ever world ranking. He would have moved above the \nAmerican Steve Stricker into third place had he finished runner-up to Robert Karlsson in Doha, but he bogeyed the \n16th and missed birdie putts on the last two greens. Westwood, last year s European Tour No.1, who slipped to \njoint-third, stays as world No.4, while 2008 money list winner Karlsson climbs from 31st to 17th.\n\nThe Spaniard Alvaro Quiros was second and, by moving to No.32, has virtually assured himself of a return to \nAugusta for the Masters in April. The top 50 earn invitations the week before.\n\nEngland s Ross McGowan and Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano, meanwhile, are in position to profit from the \nexpected absence of top two Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson from Tucson. Mickelson is taking the week off, while \nthere is no indication that Woods will end his indefinite break from golf for an event backed by one of the sponsors \nwho have dropped him.\n\nThe tournament is for the game s leading 64 available players and, with one week to go in qualifying, McGowan is \nNo.65 and Fernandez-Castano No.66.\n\nathletics\n\nCross Country\n\n* East Borders Winter League Rd 4, Berwick\n\nMen 1 N Ford (Vegan Runners) 27.42, 2 G Wilkie 27.48, 3 C O Brien 28.02 (both Corstorphine) .

For the first three and a half overs things \nwere going exactly to plan and we were scoring freely. But then it just went wrong and we  simply lost our way.\n\n Our total was nowhere close to what we needed on a decent wicket and we know there are areas where we must \nimprove. \n\nThe Saltires, who needed a sudden-death  super over  to beat minnows Uganda on Sunday, started brightly with \nFraser Watts and Ryans Watson  punishing the home attack.\n\nWatts hit two huge sixes in his 16 while Watson plundered three boundaries as they raced to 28-0 in three overs.\n\nHowever, Watson departed immediately after for 13 before the Saltires lost Watts, Jan Stander and Kyle Coetzer \nwith the total on 47.\n\nWickets continued to tumble at an alarming rate and it was left to Majid Haq, batting at No.9, to top-score with 21 as \nScotland staggered into three figures.\n\nThe issue was virtually settled when David Obuya smashed two fours and two sixes as Gordon Goudie s first over \nwent for 20 runs. Obuya went on to finish unbeaten on 60 from 48 balls while Steve Tikolo made 46no.\n\nThe Saltires will be back in the nets this morning in a bid to find the winning formula ahead of their return matches \nagainst Uganda tomorrow and Kenya on Thursday.\n\nSteindl, whose side have a final warm-up game in Dubai next week, added:  We will not over-react to what has \nbeen a bad day. The guys know they have what it takes to be successful in this format of the game and we will \nremain positive. \n\nMeanwhile two of Scotland s qualifying group rivals clashed in Colombo yesterday with Ireland carving out a five-\nwicket win over Afghanistan.\n\nbowls\n\nScottish interest going into the second round of the Welsh International Open at Swansea remains at three after \nWBT Tour Card winner Jamie Hanlan lost to the No.3 seed Mark Royal, writes Anne Dunwoodie.

The latest move in the long-running debate over assisted suicide is the call by \nSir Terry Pratchett, the best-selling fantasy author, for tribunals to decide whether individuals should be given \nassistance to die within the law.\n\nThe idea is to overcome the main objections to legalising assisted suicide: that someone who is permanently  \ndisabled or has an incurable or terminal illness may feel pressured to end their life because they feel they are a \nburden or that relatives or others who stand to gain financially exert undue influence.\n\n\n\nLike the MSP Margo MacDonald who introduced End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill in the Scottish Parliament \nlast month, Sir Terry suffers from an incurable condition. In his case it is the early-onset Alzheimer s disease. Both \ndeserve credit for facing the prospect of losing physical or mental capacity before death and initiating serious \ndebate on a topic on which public opinion appears to be changing. \n\nMs MacDonald s Bill and Sir Terry s proposal both envisage an objective assessment of the mental and physical \nstate of the patient as a safeguard. That would be necessary but there are practical difficulties. The majority of \ndoctors are opposed to assisted suicide and euthanasia; that would make it difficult to find sufficient numbers of \npsychiatrists and physicians to adjudicate and does not resolve the question of who administers the fatal dose if the \nperson who is ill cannot do so. \n\nThe most recent opinion poll showing a majority in favour of legalising assisted suicide for the terminally ill follows \ntwo high profile court cases which came to opposite verdicts. Both involved mothers who deliberately administered \nfatal drug doses to their adult children with severe long-term conditions. The difference was the clearly stated desire \nof the patient. There is little doubt that both acted from the deepest compassion and, therefore, won considerable \npublic opinion that prosecution was unnecessary and conviction unjust. The law should  be clarified but the \ndifference between suicide and murder must remain clear. \n\nDr Angus Macdonald (Letters, January 30) makes a number of valid points regarding the recently published Nuffield \nReport, in particular the inappropriateness of measuring the success or otherwise of healthcare delivery using a \nnumber-crunching approach.\n\nThe World Health Organisation s European office has published extensive research in relation to healthcare \norganisation and delivery in Europe. In terms of healthcare planning, it is acknowledged that a comparative analysis \nis difficult for a variety of reasons and that  the loci for healthcare decision-making often reflect administrative \nboundaries that were created for very different reasons . WHO specifically cites the devolved system in the UK in \nthis respect.\n\nCountries with large populations such as France and Germany tend to have a corporate approach where \ninvestment in healthcare facilities is often driven by the need to maximise the financial return on investment, \nirrespective of the appropriateness of care. The overprovision of expensive machines such as MRI scanners \ncreates a need for greater use   and thereby increased patient activity   to justify the investment. While improved \npatient outcomes in some areas may occur, it is not automatic. More worryingly, basic needs are often not met as a \nconsequence of such an investment strategy.\n\nFor example, unplanned cervical screening for women in Germany tends to be opportunistic, with no planned call  \nand recall system. The net result is that German women undergo up to 50 cervical smears during their lifetime, \ncompared  with only seven in Finland. \n\nUsing the Nuffield analysis, the German system would represent a greater efficiency in the use of staff and \nequipment, and covering a greater number of the population perceived as being at risk. Yet the death rate from \ncervical cancer in Finland is half that of Germany.\n\nTo use numbers and throughput to make comparisons between small population countries such as Finland and \nScotland, as against large population countries such as England and Germany, should, therefore, be treated with \nextreme caution.\n\nRobert Menzies,\n\n2 Burnbrae Gardens, Falkirk.\n\nON this day in 1913, New York City s Grand Central station opened. The station, situated at 42nd Street and Park \nAvenue in Midtown Manhattan, is the largest train station in the world, with 44 platforms and 67 tracks.\n\nPlatforms are on two levels, both below ground, with 41 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower. \n\n\n\nWhen the Long Island Rail Road s new station, beneath the existing levels opens, Grand Central will offer a total of \n75 tracks and 48 platforms. The terminal covers a total area of 48 acres.\n\nGrand Central Terminal has been used in numerous film and tv productions over the years, including Men in Black, \nArmageddon, North By Northwest and romantic-comedy One Fine Day.\n\nAlthough officially called Grand  Central Terminal since opening, many people continue to refer to it as Grand \nCentral station.\n\nCorrespondents to this page are correct in denouncing the lack of investigative rigour displayed in the questioning \nof those giving evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry. I would ask them why they expect anything different.\n\nThe membership and remit of this inquiry is specifically designed to allow confirmation of information that is already \nin the public domain but not  to allocate blame or to punish; it is  simply a tactic that is designed to shut the public \nup. \n\nTony Blair was never on trial at the inquiry; he was simply allowed to state the obvious, which was that his was a \npresidential-style of governance in which he made the decisions, either on his own or with a coterie of hand-picked \nyes-men. They, in turn, were too involved in protecting their own careers; thus they did not challenge him as they \nknew it was political suicide to do so.\n\nThe decision that Blair made in his exchanges with President George W Bush, whether right or wrong, is not \nsignificant. However, that he was unilaterally making the decisions is the antithesis of democratic government and \nis the crux of the matter. What the inquiry has accidentally and incontrovertibly exposed is that we don t live in a \ndemocracy. Parliament itself is conducted in an undemocratic manner and those who manipulate the system are  \nuntouchable  by the electorate. Is this really the kind of democracy we are trying to force on Afghanistan? \n\nDavid J Crawford,\n\nFlat 3/3 131 Shuna Street, Ruchill, Glasgow.\n\nIn seeking to defend his decisions over Iraq, Tony Blair emphasised to the Chilcot Inquiry how the atrocity of 9/11 \ninstantaneously changed the  tolerance of risk  for the government and people of the US, even venturing to suggest \nthat sooner or later the same approach might be used upon Iran.\n\nFor a US public which had never had to bear the outrage of enemy bombing of its home territory, as Mr Blair said to \nChilcot, the  tolerance of risk  in America had changed for ever.\n\nUnlike Mr Blair, many affected by the Lockerbie atrocity have avoided the idea of retaliation by force against the \nresponsible country, pressing for the use of justice. They see that the atrocity was an act of revenge, and that to \nseek revenge for it in turn is to abandon the intellectual high ground, and to sink to the philosophy favoured by \nsome terrorists.\n\nThroughout the day of December 21, 1988, Heathrow authorities knew that there had been a break-in, yet they did \nnot know who had broken in, or what the motive might have been. At a time of known increased terrorist threat, they \ncontinued the lucrative flow of outgoing flights until the bomb exploded on Pan Am 103 that evening.\n\nWhen criticising an accepted theory, it is useful to produce a simpler and more credible alternative. \n\nSo, what if the Heathrow break-in was, indeed, the route for getting a bomb on to the Lockerbie aircraft? For a start, \nthe Iran/Syria grouping with their pressing revenge motive and their unique possession of this technology would be \ncentre stage, with Malta, Frankfurt and Megrahi irrelevant. Such a theory is unexplored: why is that? \n\nWhy did the news of the break-in lie hidden for 12 years? Who was complicit in concealing it? What was their \nmotive for doing so? We know that the Metropolitan Police (and, therefore, presumably the Thatcher government) \nknew of it. Why did they keep quiet?\n\n\n\nDoes this throw any light on why Mrs Thatcher and every Prime Minister since, including Mr Blair and Gordon \nBrown, has for 21 years refused us the inquiry to which we have an inalienable right?\n\nSo long as Mr Blair and all who have shared his office and establishment continue to rely blindly upon a solution  to \nthe worst terrorist atrocity ever to  occur in their country, which seems  fatally flawed, they put at risk more civilised \nroutes through international justice. Their way stands to bring a blight upon all our futures.\n\nIn the end history, not Chilcot, will judge them.\n\nDr Jim Swire, \n\nRowans Corner, Calf Lane,  Chipping Campden, Glos.\n\nListening to witnesses at the Chilcot Inquiry reinforces the opinion that  the Blair government s obsession with spin, \nand its distortion of the interpretation of wording and argument, were fundamental to this country committing to an \nillegal war.\n\nPrior to the Chilcot Inquiry, it had been established beyond reasonable doubt  that the crucial vote in Westminster to \nendorse military action in Iraq was obtained only by a deliberate distortion of facts and use of language within \ndossiers and debate underpinned by blatant scaremongering.\n\nHowever, what has emerged during the inquiry is surely even more devastating for our democracy. This has shown \nthat the modern-day political culture of spin even permeated the blatant evolution of the legal justification to allow \nthe UK to participate in the Iraq invasion. \n\nThe inquiry has painted a disturbing picture of Mr Blair s chosen inner circle, aided by his Washington legal \ncheerleaders, helping the then attorney  general, Lord Goldsmith, eventually to arrive at a bizarre, convenient and \nmost timely legal judgment, surely flawed in international law. \n\nUN resolution 1441 made no direct reference to the accepted key UN  euphemism of  all necessary means  that \ntranslates as a mandate for the use of force by member states. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the unequivocal legal advice from the Foreign Office, corroborated by a recent Dutch review of the \nlegality of the war, was that resolution 1441 did not constitute the right to use force and would amount a war crime \nof aggression under international law if used as the basis for invasion.\n\nLord Goldsmith even accepted this straightforward interpretation of resolution 1441 for months as preparation for \nwar was ongoing. He explained his extraordinary change of judgment on the basis that 1441 didn t actually say that \nthe UN Security Council had to make a further decision; neither did it say that force couldn t be used. \n\nCoupled to the Washington legal mentors relaying tales (unverified, of course) of the negotiating history with the \nFrench, this miraculously convinced Lord Goldsmith and provided a legal cover for the UK to join the Iraq \nadventure. \n\nThe depressing conclusion is that the adoption of spin is now so deep-rooted in our political system and institutions \nthat it enabled our country to sleepwalk into an illegal war that undermined the authority of the UN and international \nlaw. \n\nDr Glenn Thomson,\n\n87 Cartvale Road, Glasgow.\n\nYou can almost hear the collective excitement of upper and middle  management of our local authorities in \npreparation for their focus groups, task forces and studies required to address  the \u00a3270m savings that have to be \nmade  in Scotland. \n\n\n\nThere ll be some special stationery to  be printed, a new department to be  named, a chief executive to be \nappointed and some non-executive members and support staff to be found. Perhaps  there ll also a bonding trip to \nsomewhere, helped no doubt by a series of essential golf tournaments. \n\nThen they might throw in a fact-finding visit to a warm and sunny Caribbean island to see at first hand how they \nmanage their ballpoint pen procurement. \n\nNo doubt the HM gurus and senior paper-clip officers are anticipating a busy season, so time to alert the \nemployment agencies that more staff will be required to lay off teachers and lollipop ladies. Or we could get rid of \nthe former and employ more of the latter.\n\nJon Jewitt,\n\n38 New City Road, Glasgow.\n\nTHE sum spent online by UK consumers in 2009, making Birtons the biggest online spenders in Europe with nearly \none-third of all internet purchases across the continent, according to price comparison site Kelkoo.\n\nTHE number of councils that spent hundreds of pounds fixing street signs because of spelling and punctuation \nmistakes and missing information.

However, they do have to \nrecognise that all government projects involve a certain amount of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and Scotland does \nexist north of Glasgow.\n\nFor those, like myself with no railway nearer than 40 miles, and a restricted service between the capital and the \nnearest railhead after 8.30pm, the constant carping because two planned rail improvements have been cut to one \nsounds downright greedy. Do I live in the wilds where such lack of services can be expected? No, I live in the oil \narea of the north-east which makes a not inconsiderable contribution to the money available to spend. I may envy, \nbut by no means begrudge, the rail improvement retained, but come off it, Glasgow, think yourselves lucky.\n\nDot Jessiman,\n\nUpper Oldwhat Croft, Turriff.\n\nFor anyone interested in efforts to mitigate climate change, in maximising the benefits of public transport, in making \nGlasgow a better place to live, work and to visit, the letters in support of the government s decision to cancel the \nGlasgow Airport Rail Link project make depressing reading.\n\nThis project is of great merit even within the limited terms of linking Glasgow by rail to its airport (that this link does \nnot already exist is a cause for astonishment outwith Scotland). In the general picture of ensuring the Scottish rail \nsystem develops to maximise its potential to play a leading role in meeting 21st-century social, environmental and \neconomic needs, Garl is a major element when linked with the Glasgow Crossrail project. A new assessment of \nGarl has proposed a feasible and more cost-effective route that would reduce Transport Scotland s \u00a3175m to \naround \u00a3120m. It also indicates construction would be a year quicker, meaning it could be in place for the \nCommonwealth Games (an important part of Glasgow s bid).\n\nGarl has support from local authorities, MSPs, First ScotRail, Glasgow Airport, the business community and the \nwider public. The present situation is greatly damaging to the government s credibility. Surely it must take on board \nthe widespread and carefully argued objections to the decision to cancel Garl and look at the project afresh.\n\nBrian Balmain,\n\n17 Battery Place, Rothesay, Bute.\n\n\n\nThree recent developments in technology have made the tram v trolley bus debate redundant. The choice will be \nbetween hydrogen-powered or battery-powered buses. A low-pressure way of storing hydrogen has been found, \nand battery technologists have ways to increase dramatically the charge capacity and decrease the charge time of \nbatteries.\n\nThese advances will allow buses (and cars) to be powered from non-polluting, green, off-peak energy sources, not \nthe peak-time, fossil-fuelled generation required by trams and trolleys at their busiest.\n\nSo, local authorities and transport chiefs can look forward to pollution-free city centre public transport without the \ncostly, disruptive, ugly and route-restrictive infrastructure of trams or trolley buses and with the benefit of utilising \ngreen electricity.\n\nDr Alex B Gardiner,\n\n12 Hillside Drive, Bearsden, Glasgow.\n\nCouncils, faced with a budget shortfall, are  searching for economies  that will cause the least  pain. With Scottish \nlocal authorities required to save \u00a3270m and education, social work and essential infrastructure having first claim \nfor protected funding, the axe must fall on grants to arts companies, community groups and voluntary organisations. \n\nIn this situation, the arts have  traditionally been regarded as a luxury and, thus, the first candidates for cuts. In both \nGlasgow and Edinburgh,  therefore, arts bodies have been bracing themselves for a severe drop in income. More \nthan 150 bodies which share \u00a33m of funding distributed by Culture and Sport Glasgow on behalf of the city council \nhave been anticipating cuts of between 5% and 20% and the possibility that they might be unable to carry on. Chief \namong them was the renowned Citizens  Theatre, which, as the recipient of the largest grant of \u00a3450,000 a year, \nfeared it would be in line for the biggest cut and possible closure.\n\nIt now appears as if the reduction in grants will be at the bottom end of the range (possibly averaging below 5%), at \nleast for this financial year, and that the Citizens  will be able to continue. But it is likely to have to scale back some \nof its more ambitious plans.\n\nHowever, the Edinburgh International Festival, which, despite increased competition remains the world s leading \narts festival, is facing cuts of more than \u00a3200,000 over the next three years, with funding for the other festivals cut \nby 1.5% this year and 3.5% in the following two years. That will have an economic impact on Edinburgh and the \nrest of Scotland because a reduced offering will deter the number of visitors from the rest of the UK and overseas.\n\nThe Royal Scottish National Orchestra, like the other national companies funded directly by the Scottish \nGovernment, also depends on council grants and will be severely affected by the loss of nearly \u00a36000 from \nEdinburgh and the significant cuts in funding from Glasgow and Dundee which are certain to follow.\n\nCouncils are only one source of funding for arts companies. Most also depend on grants from the Scottish Arts \nCouncil (about to become  Creative Scotland) and the National Lottery, as well as a variety of trusts.  All these \nalternative sources are also suffering shortfalls. Commercial  sponsorship will also be at a premium, but banks have \nan opportunity to restore goodwill by stepping into the breach (preferably using funds freed by capping bonuses).\n\nEconomic pain is unavoidable but  it is encouraging that those charged with deciding how public funds are shared \nout are acknowledging that arts organisations are significant employers and important contributors to the social \nfabric. \n\nThe lesson from the resounding success of this year s Celtic Connections must not be missed. The big name  \nconcerts were sold out before the  18-day festival started, ticket sales kept pace with last year despite the recession \n(which saw a drop in overseas visitors) and attendances reached 100,000, not only for concerts but workshops and \ntalks. It lifted the spirits of a great cross-section of people from different musical and cultural traditions, and showed \nthat arts events can be simultaneously high quality, inclusive and commercially successful. \n\n\n\nThe local authorities  willingness to continue providing the arts with a share from the rapidly shrinking pot is to be \napplauded, but all those who believe that culture is important must play their part by visiting the galleries and \nmuseums and buying their tickets for concerts, plays and shows.\n\n1709 The real Robinson Crusoe, Alexander Selkirk, was rescued after spending five years on the uninhabited \nislands of Juan Fernandez.\n\n1972 A mob in Dublin burned down the British Embassy in protest at the  Bloody Sunday  killings in Londonderry \nthe previous weekend.\n\n1979 Sex Pistol Sid Viciousdied of a heroin overdose in New York.\n\n1986 Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev blamed Leonid Brezhnev for years of stagnation and promised radical \nreforms.\n\n1990 South African President F W de  Klerk lifted the 30-year ban on the African National Congress, the South \nAfrican Communist Party and 30 other anti-apartheid  organisations.\n\nThere was also a  cunyie house  or Mint in Dundee (Letters, January 30). During a brief period of office relocation, \ncunyie officers from Edinburgh moved to Dundee to escape the 1585 plague, before relocating to Perth. The \nScottish Mint relocated again to Dundee, for security reasons, in 1651 along with many rich refugees; indeed, the \nfirst Duchess of Buccleuch was born that year in Dundee when her dad was preparing the cunyie house for a bit of  \nquantitative easing .\n\nSadly, Cromwell s forces under General Monk laid siege to the city following the Battle of Dunbar, tricking their way \npast drunken guards during an unhappy happy hour.

The point is well made and this is why we cannot simply decide our \nlegislation by plebiscite. However, he makes an assertion that  in all but the rarest cases, modern palliative care \neliminates the suffering of terminally-ill patients . \n\nDying people have many ways in which to suffer, and (naming only a few) to pretend that we can  eliminate  all the \ndifferent kinds of pain, nausea, vertigo, itching, convulsions, breathing difficulties, anxiety, agitation and general \nmisery that may be involved is profoundly unrealistic. So there is an issue here that some people would like the \noption in our law to avoid this suffering, while other people believe in a moral law that we should do what we can to \nreduce the suffering except end life. \n\nAllan MacKenzie,\n\n42 Union Road, Inverness.\n\nIT may sound like heresy but there were people who had serious doubts about bidding to bring the Commonwealth \nGames to Scotland in 2014. Bitter memories remain of the debt-ridden 1986 Edinburgh Games and the fiasco of \nbully-boy Robert Maxwell s intervention to  save  them. Not that having the taxpayer dig deeper to fund the event is \nunusual: the 1990 Auckland Games lost twice as much as Edinburgh and, more recently, the government had to \nput up \u00a3100m to bail out the 2002 Manchester Games.\n\n\n\nThis year s Games in Delhi have been beset by controversy and, only a few weeks ago, it was reported not one of \nthe 17 venues had been completed. The final bill is expected to be 280% over budget. At least the Manchester \nGames were hugely successful and played a large part in regenerating the city, bringing in investment and creating \nthousands of jobs. \n\nThey were part of the inspiration and justification for Scotland s bid. The important word in that sentence is Scotland   \nalthough Glasgow will benefit most, the bid was made in Scotland s name and it s the Scottish taxpayer, not just \nthose who live in the city, who will help pay for it.\n\nThat s why Holyrood s Public Audit Committee did an invaluable job last week in demanding explanations for the \ncosts. It elicited information from officials which led Tory finance spokesman Derek Brownlee to comment \ndespairingly that this was  just another project out of control  and Labour s James Kelly to say it was  staggering  \nthat inflation costs had not been factored into the budget. \n\nThere were reasons during the Games bidding process for not taking inflation into account, but whether they were \nsound reasons is another question. \n\nIf junketing were a Commonwealth Games sport, federation officials would be gold medal winners, but the number \nof times the event has been nowhere near the budget estimate suggests they should take a refresher course in \nbasic arithmetic and find a formula allowing bidders accurately to reflect final costs.\n\nInept answers from the officials appearing before the Audit Committee did little to inspire confidence. Including a \ncontingency fund of \u00a380m, the budget currently stands at \u00a3454m. But an answer from Liz Hunter, the Scottish \nExecutive s director of equalities, social inclusion and sport, suggested the contingency fund would be used to mop \nup inflation.\n\nThat isn t the understanding of senior people at Glasgow City Council who believe the additional money was to pay \nfor unexpected circumstances such as building or technical problems.\n\nNo-one expected to find traces of asbestos on the site of the velodrome in the East End, for example, and that s \nwhat the contingency cash is there for. It s not just the evidence presented at Holyrood that should raise concerns \nabout what is going on with the preparations. The north-west of England, having learned from the Manchester \nGames, is working hard to cash in on the 2012 London Olympics  by offering countries training in the area the \nchance to pre-book for the 2014 Scottish Games. \n\nIt s good business practice and already Australia s swimmers, athletes from Thailand and around a dozen nations \nfrom the Oceania group of countries in the Pacific are either interested or have already signed up to the deal.\n\nAre these initiatives being matched in Scotland? Holyrood committees are often populated by too many inarticulate \nMSPs unable to formulate questions. However, the Public Audit Committee   and not for the first time under its \nconvener, Hugh Henry   has delivered a wake-up call, on this occasion, to everyone involved in the organisation of \nGlasgow 2014.\n\nA key part of the bid, the airport rail link, has probably gone for good and austerity will be the economic watchword \nbetween now and the Games. There is no scope for a spiralling budget. Mr Henry s committee has identified \nserious weaknesses and he will revisit the subject. If it s not too heretical, some other Holyrood committees might \nwant to do the same.\n\nIf junketing were  a Games sport,  federation officials would win gold\n\nSir Norman Fowler, politician, 72; David Jason, pictured, actor, 70; Graham Nash, singer, 68; Andrew Davis, \nconductor, 66; Libby Purves, broadcaster, 60; Ken Bruce, broadcaster, 59; Christie Brinkley, model, 56; Stephen \nMcGann, actor, 47.\n\nAHEAD of what would have been Bob Marley s 65th birthday on February 6, his legacy was in evidence at the \nGrammys when, 28 years after his death, three of his sons were nominated for prizes, and two of them won.\n\n\n\nStephen Marley s Mind Control (Acoustic Version) won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album.

In the face of pedantic and \npusillanimous questioning, the consummate actor-politician took over. Blair emerged unrepentant and, in his own \nmind, irreproachable. We know it was a Prime Minister who did it and ran away to be an international business \nconsultant, a highly-paid public speaker and owner of \u00a315m worth of town houses and country mansion.\n\nI am prepared to enter a plea of mitigation on Blair s behalf. He did it for patriotic reasons. Not because he didn t \nhave the cojones to say no to George W Bush. Not because he had been talking to God and God said:  Yea verily \ngo and bomb the children of Iraq. \n\nThe patriotic reason was the British government wanted to get a share of Iraq s oil. It was a Blair petroleum \nmoment.\n\nHe was in the footsteps of British Prime Ministers who routinely invaded nations for no reason other  than to steal \ntheir natural resources.\n\nBlair may also have wanted to prove by joining in as junior partner in the potentially lucrative invasion of Iraq that \nNew Labour really is the party of big business. \n\nBritish companies did get a piece of the Iraqi oil action after years of being frozen out.\n\nSo Blair gets away with some more damage to his already threadbare credibility.\n\nGordon Brown, whose crime was to stand by and do nothing, may not be so fortunate when he faces the inquiry a \ncouple of months before he seeks endorsement in the General Election.\n\n\n\nMSPs should finally sign off their report today into the release of the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing.

I \ndon t really think it has sunk in yet what we have achieved. \n\nDalziel and his Action Express Racing co-drivers Terry Borcheller, Joao Barbosa and Mike Rockenfeller blunted the \nthreat of the Ganassi cars. Dario Franchitti s Riley was forced to retire after 16 hours, but the Ganassi No.1 car \nfinished one minute behind after a bruising battle.\n\nDalziel, who will now compete in the remainder of the Grand AM series with Starworks Motorsport, added:  The \nGanassi cars are the benchmark and for 16 hours we raced with them on the same lap. Ultimately, we won the race \nthrough our own pace and not anyone else s misfortune. \n\nJUST when it seemed the snow and frost may have been a thing of the past, it has returned, especially at \nNewcastle, where a meetintg is scheduled tomorrow.\n\n An inspection has been called for 2pm today after snow, and plenty of it, engulfed the course.\n\nIt started to fall on Friday evening and after temperatures dipped below freezing on successive nights, it has still not \nshifted.\n\nTemperatures are due to rise, but another frost is forecast. James Armstrong, clerk of the course, said yesterday:  \nWe had three to four inches of snow on Friday into Saturday.\n\n It has not shifted for two days, and although we have had strong sun, it was never above 1\u00baC or 2\u00baC. We are \nforecast 3\u00baC. We should know by 2pm tomorrow, but the worry is Tuesday night into Wednesday, we are forecast \nmore frost. \n\nExeter will also check their racing surface today ahead of tomorrow s planned fixture.\n\nElsewhere, officials at Folkestone are optimistic about their chances of racing today, despite calling a precautionary \ninspection at 7.30am.\n\nClerk of the course Andrew Waitt said:  We had a frost last night, but the temperature is forecast to go up so, \nhopefully, we ll be fine. \n\nIT is a far cry from winning the Cheltenham Foxhunter Chase at the Festival to a little novices hurdle at Taunton on \na Tuesday afternoon, but this is the scenario concerning Cappa Bleu.\n\n\n\nIt was a case of smiles all around at National Hunt racing s premier track that day in March, but matters have gone \nrather off course since.\n\nIn fact, this afternoon in Somerset Cappa Bleu starts out on the recovery trail in the Deane Veterinary Centre \nNovices  Hurdle. The eight-year-old started the season with hopes of reaching the top under rules having looked a \nbit special in the amateur ranks.\n\nHowever, having finished only third on his first start at Aintree, he suffered a crashing fall when well fancied for the \nHennessy.  He had a fair old slap in the Hennessy and basically we just wanted to start again, really,  said trainer \nEwan Williams.\n\n It didn t do him any favours having a bad fall like that. Obviously, he was thrown in at the deep end, but I think that, \nunless I go back to the start with him, I m not going to give him the best possible chance.\n\n He needs his confidence back and hopefully a nice clear round will help him enjoy the job again. It s a good thing \nhe can run in races likes this. He won the Foxhunter after only a handful of point-to-points, he then ran in a novice \nchase over the wrong trip, on the wrong track and ran in the Hennessy where his inexperience came to light.\n\n So at least we can run him in novice hurdles because I wouldn t have fancied running him against the big boys in \nhandicaps. We ll use the rest of this season to build up his confidence. He s in the Blue Square Gold Cup [at \nHaydock on February 20] and he ll be entered in some of the handicaps at Cheltenham, but I d just like a couple of \nruns over hurdles so we can start again.\n\n He s just one of those that is paying for being successful last year. Hopefully he can be Grand National horse. He s \nhigh class but professional racing has been thrust on him. \n\nElsewhere, Alan King expects to be double-handed in next month s World Hurdle with Karabak and Katchit being \naimed at the race.\n\nFormer champion hurdler Katchit returned to form at the weekend, finishing third behind Tidal Bay in the Cleeve \nHurdle. However, Karabak was a late defector on Friday morning with King not quite happy with a scope as his \nstring continues to recover from their early-season ailments.\n\n I still have a few who are not quite right and as I was not 100% happy with Karabak s final scope, we opted out of \nCheltenham,  said King.  I did not want to take any chances.\n\n My original intention, anyway, after his run against Big Buck s in the Long Walk was to go straight to the Festival, \nso it is not a problem.\n\n Katchit might not have the speed of old, but the enthusiasm is certainly still there and he never stopped battling up \nthe hill. I was absolutely delighted with that run, and the World Hurdle will be his next race. \n\nTime For Rupert is 20-1 for the World Hurdle having booked his place when second in the Cleeve.  Rupert ran a \nfaultless race to split an Arkle winner and a Champion Hurdler in his trial,  said trainer Paul Webber.  He travelled \nthe best he has ever done through this race, a sure sign that he is developing and improving still. \n\nWolverhampton\n\nVALENCIA. Ricardo Tormo circuit, 15.26pm local time. The Mercedes W01 rolls out of the team s garage sparking \na frenzy among photographers, camera crews and journalists.\n\nAfter more than three years in retirement, Michael Schumacher, the seven-times world champion, was back. And \nthis was only a test.\n\nWith just 94 minutes of the day-long session remaining, Schumacher, in the unusual guise of Mercedes   Silver \nArrow  after 14 seasons of  Ferrari red, took to the track.\n\n\n\nAfter team-mate Nico Rosberg completed most of the initial set-up work on the opening day of the first test, the 41-\nyear old certainly belied his age, completing 40 laps of the four kilometre track in three separate stints, noticeably \neclipsing Rosberg in the second of those.\n\nFor the record, Schumacher finished third quickest of the eight drivers on show yesterday, with his best lap one \nminute 12.947seconds, just 0.373sec behind former Ferrari team-mate Felipe Massa who was making his own \nreturn to the sport.\n\nIn fact, it proved to be a day for the comeback kings as Pedro de la Rosa, now with Sauber after years as a tester \nfor McLaren and whose last race was also Brazil  06 along with Schumacher, split Massa and the legendary \nGerman.\n\nAll eyes, though, were on Schumacher, who surprised himself at how he felt upon climbing back into the cockpit of \nan F1 car.\n\n In a way it s like 1991, honestly,  said Schumacher.  When I came into F1 I was shocked in the first lap, then I was \nextremely excited in the second and further laps.\n\n Today I feel like a little boy that has his toy in his hands and just enjoys himself. \n\nGiven the 14 seasons he spent at Ferrari, including 11 as a driver during which time he won five of his titles, \nunderstandably there was a pang of emotion when he saw close friend Massa in his car.\n\n It was a strange sensation seeing my old car on the track and me not sitting in it,  added Schumacher.  But it s \ngood to see my brother [Ralph] on track, in the car, and I look forward to seeing my friends down at Ferrari some \ntime this week. \n\nAssessing his own car, one that is an evolution of last season s Brawn GP that won both the constructors  and \ndrivers  titles, the wily veteran was  giving little away.\n\n I think we have done a very good job,  said Schumacher.  The guys have done a superb job. We made a few \ncontrol checks and the car ran reliably. We did about 80 laps, if I am correct, and for the first day that is a superb \njob. \n\nFor Massa his return was also special, not least as he definitively proved there are no lingering after-effects \nfollowing his crash in qualifying for last year s Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\nMassa required life-saving surgery and a metal plate inside into his skull, the scar from which is clearly visible \nabove his left eye.  I m now 100% ready to return to racing,  said Massa.  I was zero afraid, and Hungary did not \ncome into my mind at all. \n\nLawyer: attacker to be moved from clinic  Eds: APNewsNow.  ROME (AP) - A lawyer for the man who attacked \nItalian Premier Silvio Berlusconi in December says a judge has agreed to the defendant's transfer from a Milan \npsychiatric hospital to a treatment community.  Gian Marco Rubino told The Associated Press on Monday that \ndoctors treating Massimo Tartaglia will decide when his client should move to the community under house arrest - \nprobably in the next few days.  Tartaglia was arrested and jailed after he hurled a souvenir statuette at the premier \nat the end of a pro-Berlusconi rally on Dec. 13 in Milan. Berlusconi suffered a broken nose and other facial injuries.  \nThe 42-year-old Tartaglia has a history of psychological problems. Rubino said the judge ordered the name of the \ntreatment center not to be disclosed.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has sent his budget plans to Congress, forecasting the Government spending a record \n$1.66 trillion more than it takes in through taxes.\n\nThe president yesterday blamed the huge deficit on the decisions of his predecessor George W Bush, previous \nCongresses and his administration s steps to prevent an economic collapse.\n\n\n\nObama said that in normal circumstances he would have worked to pay down the yearly deficit immediately, but \ncostly steps were needed to help an economy in freefall.\n\n We won t be able to bring down this deficit overnight, given that the recovery is still taking hold,  he said in a \ntelevised statement from the White House.\n\n We will continue, for example, to do what it takes to create jobs. That is reflected in my budget. It is essential. \n\nHe asked lawmakers to follow his lead on reducing waste and to avoid  grandstanding .\n\nThe budget proposal reflects pressure on Obama ahead of the November congressional elections to cut \nunprecedented growth in the US debt.\n\nObama and the Democrats are trying to regain their political footing after the surprising loss of a Massachusetts \nSenate seat long held by the late Senator Edward M Kennedy. That vote cost them their supermajority and appears \nto have indefinitely stalled efforts to pass healthcare reform legislation.\n\nIn the meantime, Obama pledged in his State of the Union address last week to make job creation his top priority.\n\nAfter a protracted battle on healthcare dominated his first year in office and led to a string of Democratic election \ndefeats, the administration hopes its new budget will convince Americans that the president is focused on fixing the \neconomy.\n\nThe $3.83 trillion budget includes a huge tranche to lower double-digit unemployment   about $100bn in tax \nincentives to hire workers and improve the nation s infrastructure and energy sector. The spending jump will be \npartially offset by higher taxes on wealthy Americans   families earning more than $250,000 yearly   through plans \nto let tax cuts expire.\n\nAs written, the spending plan surpasses last year s then-record $1.41 trillion gap. \n\nIt reflects a continuing flood of Government spending designed to ease the worst economic downturn since the \n1930s Great Depression.\n\nRepublicans complained about Obama s proposed tax increases and said the huge projected deficits showed he \nhad failed to get government spending under control. \n\nHowever, administration officials argued that Obama inherited a deficit already topping $1 trillion when he took \noffice.\n\nSenator Judd Gregg, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, warned the country was sinking into a  \nquagmire  of debt and said Obama s stimulus plan had failed to create jobs.  These circumstances call for a bold, \ngame-changing budget that will turn things around,  he said.  Instead, the president has sent us more of the same. \n\nObama wants $192bn in war spending for the next year-and-a-half, a hefty sum aimed at escalating the war in \nAfghanistan despite its waning popularity.\n\nThe request reflects his recent decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan to blunt a growing insurgency \nthere. \n\nThe $192bn request includes $33bn to pay for the troop buildup this year, and the remaining $159bn would pay for \noverseas military operations in the government s 2011 budget year, which begins on October 1.\n\nAFGHANISTAN: A bomb killed a US soldier in Kandahar yesterday, Nato has said.\n\nThe American death toll has risen ahead of an  additional 37,000 US and Nato forces being sent to the country as \npart of  President Barack Obama s war strategy.\n\n\n\nAt least 29 US troops died in January, more than double the 14 deaths recorded in the same month last year, \nmaking it the deadliest month since November, when 30 died.\n\nNato and Afghan forces also killed seven militants on Sunday, the Afghan army said. \n\nJERUSALEM: The Israeli military said it has reprimanded two high-ranking officers for approving the firing of \nartillery shells toward a UN compound during the Gaza Strip war last year.\n\nIsrael announced the punishment in a document submitted to the United Nations last Friday in response to a UN \nreport that has accused Israel s military of committing war crimes. Israel is trying to stave off the report's central \nthreat of launching war crimes proceedings if it does not carry out an independent investigation into the military s \nconduct during the fighting.\n\nThe artillery attack, which took place while more than 700 Palestinian civilians were taking refuge, set ablaze a \nwarehouse that services more than one million Gazans and destroyed food and other aid. UN chief Ban Ki-moon \nwas visiting the region at the time, and three people were wounded, UN officials said.\n\nIsrael has said militants fired on its troops from the compound   a charge the UN disputes.   AP\n\nPRESIDENT Barack Obama has axed Nasa s $100 billion plans to return astronauts to the moon.\n\nThe move came on the seventh anniversary of the space shuttle tragedy that triggered the return to the moon plan.\n\nThe White House said the programme was too much like the 1960s Apollo mission and needed large budget \nincreases just to get astronauts on the moon by 2030.\n\nIn the budget proposal released yesterday, the White House instead promised a new approach but gave no details. \nObama also proposed $6 billion over five years to encourage firms to build private spaceships that Nasa could rent.\n\nPresident George W. Bush proposed the moon mission after the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster. Nasa has \nalready spent  $9.1 billion on the programme.\n\nThe space agency s budget would grow to $19bn in 2011 under the plans, with an emphasis on science.\n\nIt  adds $6bn to NASA s budget over five years and draws upon American ingenuity to enable us to embark on an \nambitious 21st century programme of space exploration,  the proposal reads.\n\n We are launching a bold new effort that invests in ingenuity for developing more capable and innovative \ntechnologies for future space exploration,  it says.\n\nThe budget also proposes a  re-vamp of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where staff have feared cutbacks, \nas part of making Nasa more efficient.\n\n A major focus of this effort will be to create the 21st century launch facilities and infrastructure needed... \ntransforming the facility to more effectively support future Nasa, commercial, and government launches,  it says. \n\nRUSSIA: Attackers have fired grenades at the headquarters of the interior ministry of Ingushetia, which runs the \nregion's police, killing a policeman.\n\nA ministry spokeswoman said at least two other people were wounded in the attack in Nazran, the region's principal \ncity.\n\nRecent increasing violence in Ingushetia has been linked to an Islamist insurgency rocking Russia's Caucasus \nregion. \n\nTHE Dalai Lama s envoys have been told that Beijing will not hold a debate over Tibet s sovereignty, a senior \nChinese official has said.\n\n\n\nIt indicates the first of such talks on the region in 15 months did not produce any breakthroughs.\n\nDu Qinglin, head of a government department in charge of the talks, told the Tibetan spiritual leader s emissaries \nthat China s national interest was inviolable, and  there can be no room for discussion, no room for compromise  on \nterritorial issues, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n\nAt the last talks in 2008, the Dalai Lama s envoys proposed a way for Tibetans to achieve more autonomy under \nthe Chinese constitution   a key demand of the minority community.\n\nBut China apparently rejected the plan, saying it would not allow Tibet the kind of latitude granted to Hong Kong \nand Macau.\n\nChinese officials insisted that they would only address the return of the Dalai Lama, who fled to exile in 1959. AP\n\nOBAMA BUDGET-SPACE UPDATE 1 UPDATE 1-Obama budget would cut NASA moon plan  * Companies to take \nover space taxi flights  * NASA to focus on future technologies for Mars, beyond  (Recasts and updates throughout \nwith actual budget figures)  By Irene Klotz  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Feb 1 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's \nproposed budget gives NASA a $6 billion 5-year boost but aborts early attempts to return to the moon and turns \nover space transportation to commercial companies.  The space agency's budget would grow to $19 billion in 2011 \nunder the proposed budget released on Monday, with an emphasis on science and less spent on space exploration.  \nIt \"adds $6 billion to NASA's budget over five years and draws upon American ingenuity to enable us to embark on \nan ambitious 21st Century program of human space exploration,\" the budget proposal reads.  But the plan ends the \nConstellation program \"which was planning to use an approach similar to the Apollo program to return astronauts \nback to the Moon 50 years after that program's triumphs.\"  The budget notes that an independent panel found the \nmoon program was years behind schedule.  \"Instead, we are launching a bold new effort that invests in American \ningenuity for developing more capable and innovative technologies for future space exploration,\" it reads.  The new \nbudget, which is subject to change by Congress, also extends operations at the International Space Station past its \nplanned retirement date of 2016, suggesting such potential additions as inflatable space habitats.  Obama's \nproposal hands over more space operations to the commercial sector, saying it will create thousands of new jobs \nand hold costs down.  NASA already has spent $9 billion on Constellation and likely would owe millions more to \ncancel existing contracts. Prime contractors on the Ares rocket program include ATK Launch Systems, Pratt & \nWhitney Rocketdyne and Boeing Co.  Lockheed Martin is the lead contractor on the Orion capsule.  NASA already \nhas contracts with Space Exploration Technologies and Orbital Sciences Corp to deliver cargo to the station. \nSpaceX and other firms also are developing spaceships that can carry passengers to orbit and back.  The budget \nalso proposes a re-vamp of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where staff have feared major cutbacks, as part \nof making NASA more efficient.  \"A major focus of this effort will be to create the 21st century launch facilities and \ninfrastructure needed at Kennedy Space Center, transforming the facility to more effectively support future NASA, \ncommercial, and other government launches,\" the budget reads.  Florida Senator Bill Nelson has promised to fight \nefforts to cut back NASA' Florida operations.

AP\n\nObama seeks $192B for wars  Eds: Will be led from Gates, Mullen budget announcement at Pentagon at 1 p.m. \nEST.  With BC-US-Budget  By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - President \nBarack Obama wants $192 billion in war spending for the next year-and-a-half, a hefty sum aimed at escalating the \nwar in Afghanistan despite its waning popularity.  The request reflects Obama's recent decision to send 30,000 \nmore troops to Afghanistan to blunt a growing insurgency there. Despite doubts among many Americans, including \nthose in his own political party, Obama sees the decision as critical to bringing the war to a conclusion.  His plan \ncalls for troops to start leaving Afghanistan in July 2011.  \"The United States must prevent the Taliban from turning \nAfghanistan back into a safe haven from which international terrorists can strike at us or our allies,\" Obama said in \nhis budget.  The government has already shelled out a combined $1 trillion since 2001 for the wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.  Obama's $192 billion war budget rivals the $245 billion request made in 2007 by President George W. \nBush, after announcing that more than 20,000 combat troops would be sent to Baghdad.  Congress was expected \nto endorse the budget plan even though several anti-war Democrats oppose the troop buildup and others are \nlooking for ways to lessen the war's burden on the nation's deficit. Some lawmakers have proposed a special \"war \ntax\" to cover the costs, while Republicans have suggested taking money from Obama's $787 billion stimulus \npackage.  The $192 billion request includes $33 billion to pay for the troop buildup this year. The remaining $159 \nbillion would pay for overseas military operations in the government's 2011 budget year, which begins Oct. 1.  \nSome of the 2011 money was expected to go toward Pakistan, including $2 billion to reimburse Islamabad for \noperations along its Afghan border.\n\nTHIS drama of family and formulae become a Broadway sensation at  the beginning of the century, and was \nprematurely hailed as a new American classic. However, it was only David Auburn s second play, and in parts of \nthe script this really shows. \n\nEarly on, one character tells another:  When your dad was younger than both of us, he made major contributions to \nthree fields: game theory, algebraic geometry ...  with all the naturalism of a megaphone address to the audience.\n\nTheatre about brain-boggling fields need not be alienating, as director Ian Grieve demonstrated  a few years ago \nwith Humble Boy, a brilliant comedy about metaphysics. His production of Auburn s play, however, gets off to a \nshaky start and never really bursts into life, and much of the blame for this lies with one of Kenny Miller s costumes. \n\nWhen we re introduced to Catherine (Neve McIntosh) on her 25th birthday, she s curled up in a chair with a \nmagazine, wearing a crisp white shirt, little pants and trendy woollen socks. She looks like she s starring in a Marks \n& Spencer Christmas advert; actually, she s depressed.\n\nAfter an awkward first scene, the plot follows an entirely predictable path. While the cast do their best to bring two-\ndimensional characters  to life (and Helen Logan gives an enjoyable turn as Catherine s  brash sister Claire), what s \nmissing  is a sense of why we should care about anything that happens. The proof of the title remains a mystery, \nthe story s most dramatic events  are in the past (but not captured  by any of the flashbacks) and despite all the \nreferences to  madness, ultimately all that seems  to be at stake is a semi-decent job  at a university.\n\nHH\n\n\n\nPaul Carrack, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, tonight 7.30pm\n\nCeltic Connections may be done for this year, but here s a  chap with connections of his own. Carrack would still be \nremembered if he d only written the classic How Long?  for pub-rock band Ace, a hit on both sides of the Atlantic  \n35 years ago. Since then, however, he has played with Roxy Music, Squeeze (singing Tempted at producer  Elvis \nCostello s behest), Nick Lowe and John Hiatt. Oh, and Mike + The Mechanics.\n\nThere aren t many areas where the word manipulate enjoys a positive spin   or draws in queues of people willing to \nhave their perceptions of reality tickled and tweaked. \n\nSimon Hart, artistic director of Manipulate, the Visual Theatre  Festival that returns to Edinburgh s Traverse next \nweek, says the growing popularity of the work that Manipulate champions is a sign of our times.\n\n We re so ready now to distrust the spoken word   that s very noticeable in the way we respond to our politicians,  \nsays Hart. \n\nThis shift in trust and engagement has, according to Hart, given us a chance to catch up on our European \ncounterparts   this third Manipulate season features live performances from Portugal, Germany and Spain, but also \nincludes Snapshots, short experimental forays into various forms of visual theatre by six  Scottish-based artists who \nare new  to making work for older and adult audiences.\n\n I ve lost count of how often  puppetry has been re-discovered, hailed as a great new thing ... and a year later, it s \noff the radar again,  says Hart.  We ve seen Robert Lepage use it in his work. Lately there s been  War Horse in \nLondon s West End. Animation? It s everywhere. Not just the Wallace and Gromit films but in a number of \nadvertisements on television and in cinemas. The strange thing is, these are all too often seen as exceptions, \nwhereas they are just the tip of what s already out there. We could fill our festival over and over with quality work \nthat has been made for adult audiences. Work that looks at dark, intense issues that you couldn t do on stage in \nany physical, pictorial way. \n\nLast year at Manipulate, full houses bought into the notion that wee strips of foam rubber could spring into life as a \ncunningly athletic alphabet or that an old-fashioned brass tap could become the gnarly old skinflint in a brilliant \nstaging of Moliere s The Miser. This year we are invited to explore the rooms that Circolando (Portugal) conjure up \non stage, but which they suggest are also living inside our heads: memories. \n\nTraverse 2 will house 1945, a sound sculpture that melds images and  echoes of the past to question our ideas of \nhistory and time. There s a whiff of the medieval Dance of Death in Salto.Lamento, a kaleidoscope  of nightmares \nput together using  puppetry and movement, by German company Figurentheater Tubingen. \n\nIt s a rich feast and going by last year s turn out it s a welcome addition to an adventurous Traverse programme \nenvisaged by artistic director Dominic Hill.\n\nHill s own enthusiasm for the kind of work fielded by Manipulate saw the festival move with him from  Dundee Rep, \nwhere it was first staged in 2008. Hart still hankers for the programme to have offshoots all across Scotland.  A \nsurvey showed 65% of our audience were first time attenders at the Traverse. I d like to think that was a kind of \nthank you to Dominic for his support,  says Hart.\n\nThe third Manipulate Visual Theatre Festival is at the Traverse, Edinburgh, from February 2-6.\n\n HE left Depp to walk the plank, showed Denzel the door and made Clooney look like an also-ran. For Clint \nEastwood, being named America s favourite movie star recently might not have been an achievement on a par with \nwinning four Oscars, but it showed again how unforgettable the man with no name is to generations of moviegoers. \nAnd at 79 years old, as his new movie Invictus shows, he s not done yet. \n\nThe true tale of how Nelson  Mandela used sport to help bring a divided South Africa closer needed a big director to \ndo it justice, and few in today s Hollywood can match Eastwood for stature. As he enters the ballroom at Claridge s \n\n\n\nin  London ahead of the film s UK  premiere earlier this week, he looks like a movie star, walks like a movie star and \ncharms like one too. \n\n Am I talking too loud for you, kid?  said Eastwood in jest as a technician arrived on stage midway through the \nsession to reposition the microphone. Everyone, most of all the young sound man, laughed. Dirty Harry had \ngrowled again, making everyone s day. \n\nEastwood first played the bearer of a .44 Magnum in 1971, the same year he made his directorial debut with the \nthriller Play Misty for Me. He s continued to play both sides of the camera since, racking up 55 years as an actor \nand 39 as a director. \n\n I sort of planned on not working at this time of life,  he concedes, but the urge to make movies has never gone \naway. If anything, it s becoming stronger. Eastwood s career has had its lows   starring opposite an orangutan, for \none   but since Unforgiven in 1992 he s been largely confounding Norma Desmond s law. The older he gets, the \nbigger and better the pictures become. \n\n I enjoy work more than I ever have, or just as much, and I m at an age when I can take on more  challenges \nbecause I know more. I ve been lucky enough to work in a profession I ve really liked, so I figure I ll continue until \nsomebody hits me over the head and says  get out . \n\nHis last stint as a leading man was playing neighbour-from-hell Walt Kowalski in 2008 s Gran Torino. At the time he \nsaid it would probably be his last appearance in front of camera. Today, however, he s in a  never say never  mood.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby, his Oscar-winner with Hillary Swank, was meant to be his swansong. He thought it would be \ngood to quit acting while he was at the top, and not be  like a prize-fighter who fights one too many fights . But then \nGran Torino came along, complete with a part for a man his age, so he thought why not?  I m still saying that.  \n\nIt will always depend on the part, he says.  You just never say never. When I started directing I thought that after a \nfew years I d get tired of looking at myself on the screen and would say,  Let s not do that any more . But then every \nonce in a while something pops up. I m not saying it won t happen again, but the odds are getting less. \n\nEastwood and the odds have had a few run-ins before. Born in San Francisco on May 31, 1930, into a blue-collar \nfamily, he has described his heritage as  English and Scots and maybe a little Irish . He was 25 before he left \nmilitary service and minor jobs and made it to the foothills of Hollywood as a bit player. His first credited part was \nlab technician in Revenge of the Creature. \n\nIt was a era when contract players had similar life spans to pit canaries. Eastwood was determined to use his time \non the studio well. Once finished for the day on his own film, he would visit other sets to watch how directors \nworked. \n\nHe was still  of a mind to learn when he came back to the same lot (by then under a different studio) as a leading \nman after making his name on television (Rawhide) and Sergio Leone s westerns. It s a process that s never \nstopped.  Every picture you learn something about people and yourself, about what s going on in the world. \n\nFor Invictus he immersed himself in rugby and South African politics, meeting Mandela along the way.  He s an \nextremely charismatic man. He has that million-dollar smile when he walks in a room, everybody wants to smile with \nhim.  \n\nMorgan Freeman, who plays Mandela in the film, arranged the meeting. Freeman had become friends with Mandela \nover the course of trying to bring to the screen his autobiography, A Long Walk to Freedom. When A Long Walk \nproved too colossal to condense, Morgan turned to John Carlin s book about the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Playing \nthe Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation. \n\nWhen the option of Eastwood directing came up, Morgan, an executive producer on the film, had everything he \nneeded to go ahead. The two had worked together on Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, with Freeman admiring \n\n\n\nEastwood s no-nonsense directing style.  He s quick; if he s got it in one take, he s moving on. I appreciate his \nquietude, which represents strength and control.  \n\nEastwood has attracted many similar comments over the years. He knows what he wants, goes the refrain, and he \ngets it, often in one or two takes.  If you start doing 30 or 40 takes usually you re lost, you don t know what you re \nlooking for,  he says.  I like to think I know what I m looking for, whether right or wrong.  \n\nMatt Damon, who plays captain of the Springboks, Francois Pienaar, in Invictus, is another fan of the Eastwood \ndirectorial style. He must be   he s currently filming another picture, Hereafter, with him. Eastwood, he says, is a \ndirector  who  cuts on camera . There s no shooting lots of footage and editing it later.  You know that you are in \nable hands. \n\nAsked to name his favourite film, Eastwood hesitates.  Once a film is done it s up to someone else to make a \njudgement on it.  Unforgiven is mentioned, along with Letters from Iwo Jima, the companion piece to the equally \noutstanding Second World War drama Flags of our Fathers. \n\nHe might be 80 this May, but at heart he s still that same youngster, wandering around a studio lot, looking for \nsomething new to learn. Watch and learn, Johnny, Denzel and George, watch and learn. \n\nInvictus opens nationwide this Friday.\n\n FOR a game like golf that prides itself in high morality and integrity, the worst insult you can level at a fellow player \nis to call him a cheat, and you could almost sense Phil Mickelson, the world No.2, bristling when Scott McCarron \nfired the allegation in his direction at last week s Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in California.\n\nYou only have to remember back to last year s Open Championship at Turnberry to understand how inflammatory \nthe c-word can be. That, of course, was how Sandy Lyle referred to his fellow Scot Colin Montgomerie s favourable \nreplacing of his ball after a rain delay in Indonesia all of five years previously.\n\nLyle s remarks, in bitterness at being constantly overlooked as Europe s Ryder Cup captain   the honour went \ninstead to Montgomerie   led to four days of public bickering that completely overshadowed the run-up to the \ntournament.\n\nSo what had Mickelson done to arouse the ire of a player little known on this side of the Atlantic but who has \nstanding because he sits on the PGA Tour s 16-man Player Advisory Council?\n\nMickelson had a 20-year-old Ping Eye 2 wedge in his bag, that s what. While it breached the new rules for top \nprofessionals that limit the volume of grooves and the severity of their edges on irons, this particular club fell \nthrough an obscure loophole in the law because of an agreement back in the early 1990s between the \nmanufacturers and the PGA Tour.  It s cheating, and I m appalled Phil has put it in play,  McCarron reportedly told \nthe San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nFor the benefit of those who have not been following this grooves saga, the new rule was introduced in an attempt \nto lessen the amount of spin on the ball and hence control that players had coming out of the rough. In turn, this is \nhoped to put a greater premium on driving accuracy, a skill that tour statistics showed conclusively had become \nclose to redundant.\n\nEyes will be peeled this season to see if it works, and one sign will be driving distance figures. If these fall then it \nwill indicate that players are willing to sacrifice distance in return for the greater control they will have from the \nfairway. And that s what the authorities want to see.\n\nFor mere mortals at club level, incidentally, there is no need to worry. You have until 2024 at the earliest to continue \nto use irons made before this year, but for the tour professionals it is here and now, and Mickelson is not the only \none to use these antiques which are causing a flurry of trade on eBay.\n\n\n\nJohn Daly and Hunter Mahan are among those who are also using the Ping Eye 2 wedges, the loophole for which is \nclosed outside of the United States and Mexico.\n\nFor McCarron to call Mickelson a cheat, and by implication all others using them, is clearly below the belt and he \nmight have been better directing his criticism at the authorities who allowed this situation to develop.\n\nAs Mickelson   who is arguably the greatest short-game magician in the world and doesn t need such dubious \nassistance   pointed out: the club is legal, pure and simple. Besides, he indicated he was using  it in protest at what \nhe perceives as a shambolic way the PGA Tour  are policing the new rule because he had submitted ostensibly \nlegal irons for approval and they had been rejected while these  dastardly Ping Eye 2s were patently illegal and yet \napproved.  As a player, when you ask the PGA Tour or the USGA or whatever, all that matters is if they re \napproved,  he said.\n\nTim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, is due to meet players today in Los Angeles prior to this week s \nNorthern Trust Open at the Riviera club, and it promises to be a lively meeting.\n\nMickelson, meanwhile, has handed the matter over to his lawyers in the belief that he has been publicly slandered \nby McCarron, thereby setting the scenario for the incident to grow arms and legs.\n\nA public spat is the last thing the PGA Tour needs in the wake of the indefinite leave taken by world No.1 Tiger \nWoods following allegations of cheating on his wife. That, incidentally, is a matter not covered in any way or form by \nthe Rules of Golf.\n\nDisciplinary action could follow against McCarron, who is certainly making a name for himself this season, and not \nfor his golf, which has led to three PGA Tour victories over the years but nothing better in the major championships \nthan a 10th-place finish. It makes him a good player, but well short of legendary status. Yet he is fast gaining the \nreputation of being the tour s biggest motormouth.\n\nHe criticised rising star Anthony Kim just over a week ago for being enticed by a six-figure appearance fee to play in \nthe Abu Dhabi Championship instead of supporting the Bob Hope Classic in his California homeland. Few others \nsee anything other than the freedom of a top player, within limits, to go where he likes.\n\nIf McCarron is reacting to what he views as behaviour that goes against the spirit of the game, he might like to \nexamine his own use of the belly putter. It, as all golfers know, is a club that is anchored against the stomach to \nguard against the hideous effects of the yips and is viewed by purists as short of golf as it should be honourably \nplayed.\n\nA public spat is the last thing the PGA Tour needs in the wake of the leave taken by Tiger Woods\n\nWarriors are not guilty of ignoring their supporters\n\nIN the article  Anger after Glasgow Warriors snub loyal supporters , Kevin Ferrie asks that Glasgow Warriors \nplayers  change their attitude , so I must highlight the attitude these players currently have.\n\nThe Glasgow Warriors players are currently in the midst of their best season by sitting atop the Magners League. \nThis alone is a major achievement for a Scottish club. At the same time, the players fulfil 1200 community visits \neach year, have attended supporters events arranged by the club and regularly mix with fans in both bars at Firhill \nas well as away games.\n\nIndeed, Herald Sport (Jan 29) published an article on Street Rugby that included a quote from Warriors prop, Jon \nWelsh, in which he encourages children to take part in the initiative.\n\nWith regards to the game at Biarritz, I witnessed many Warriors players taking time after the game to speak to \nsupporters, sign autographs and have their pictures taken.\n\n\n\nSo to see in Herald Sport two articles alleging that the Warriors completely cold-shouldered their fans was \nextremely disappointing.\n\nKenny Baillie, chief executive, Glasgow Warriors\n\nSwift exit was result of a disappointing  display\n\nI support the articles (Herald Sport, Jan 28) condemning the lack of acknowlegement of the travelling supporters by \nthe Glasgow Warriors players, and I believe we will not see this sort of behaviour again after such public \ndisapproval.\n\nHowever, given the 30-point swing in Biarritz s favour in the second half, I believe the swift exit to the dressing room \nshows their disappointment at their performance and the need to analyse what went wrong.\n\nAs I look forward to heading to Murrayfield for Sunday s match against France, I hope that, in the immediate \naftermath of the Heineken Cup tie, the Glasgow players were looking for ways to prevent similar domination by the \nFrench pack two weeks on. \n\nE Martin, Glasgow\n\nA REVIEW of one of the later Miles Davis albums described him as being  surrounded by funk clatter . Listening to \nthis, it was very clear what that meant.\n\nThe Peatbog Faeries are based in Skye. They are, probably, a band rooted in the traditional music of their \nhomeland. It is a little difficult to tell. Despite several of them sporting kilts and their two young fiddlers being \nstripped to the waist and daubed with mystic runes, they tried their best to sound like Earth, Wind and Fire. They \nfailed, of course. Nobody sounds like EWF and certainly not this lot. Almost all of it passed in a mid-paced funk \nplod. Not one of the tunes was  distinguishable from another and each followed the same, boringly predictable, \nformat. They set up what passed for a groove and  then had Peter Morrison play  the same solo, either on pipes or \nwhistles, in exactly the same way,  in exactly the same place. By the end of the show, his weedly-diddling was \nbeginning to have the same effect on these ears as chalk on a blackboard.\n\nThe highlight of the night (and we had two drum solos to contend with) was a blistering duet by the two painted \nfiddlers.

Adrian Crowley, an acquisition from the Fence Collective, played \nhis first tune on the dot of 7.30pm and the nouveau-folk dance pulse of The Phantom Band faded away bang on \nmidnight. There were seven bands and the slick changeovers were  covered by screenings of (often charmingly \nhand-knitted) videos  for the music of bands from the label s illustrious past. With tickets at \u00a315, that was five-and-\nhalf-pence a minute.\n\nCrowley was charming and has a voice of great warmth and depth, and Zoey Van Goey confirmed  their position as \none of Glasgow s most fascinating bands, but the anticipation for the live debut of  The Unwinding Hours was  \npalpable. A shuffling of the deck by former Aereogramme men Craig B and Iain Cook, there is even greater  \ncontrast in their new and unfamiliar combinations of instruments between moments of delicacy and kidney-juggling \nbass volume. The Phantom Band later added visual enhancements to another  version of the same range in their \nvery fine closing set.\n\nAlun Woodward fielded a 10-strong band with brass, strings and box in his Lord Cut Glass guise, playing songs full \nof musical and lyrical wit, and his former cohort in The Delgados, Emma Pollock, must surely increase her profile \nwhen  her second solo disc, The Law of  Large Numbers, comes out at the  beginning of March if the material \npreviewed here is any guide. In between them, Arab Strap s Aidan Moffat and his Falkirk neighbour Bill Wells \nunveiled their new  collaboration, a partnership of cocktail jazz soundscapes and very droll lyrical escapes that also  \nwhetted the appetite.\n\nSponsored by Scottish Power.\n\nCHEMIKAL UNDERGROUND 02 ABC, Glasgow\n\nKeith Bruce\n\nHHHHH\n\nMy Child Won t Speak\n\nBBC1, 11.35pm\n\nYOUNG girls chatter like china teacups on a rickety train.

But there is \nsomething puzzling about each of them. They all have selective mutism: a condition which means they can speak \nbut, most of the time, don t. Why? This documentary hopes to shed some light. \n\nIn Northamptonshire, most people who know her have never heard eight-year-old Red talk. Instead, she \ncommunicates using a whiteboard, markers and a cloth. Her grandfather, John, has never heard her speak a word, \nand it s breaking his heart.\n\nIn Dover, 10-year-old Megan goes cheerleading every Thursday, but she never cheers. The only  place she talks \nfreely is at home: at school she never utters a word.

A year ago she was still answering questions with a whiteboard, but now she is \nstarting to open her mouth and speak.

He was also a man with an irrepressible humour and a well-honed west \nof Scotland sense of the ridiculous whose opening  greeting to both friends and colleagues was often:  Have you \nheard the one about   \n\nBorn in the south side of Glasgow in 1949, Dave, as he was known to all, was  the fourth generation of his family to \nbe involved in the printing trade in Scotland. \n\nThe firm of David J Clark was founded by his great-grandfather and, for many years, was based in Cadogan Street \nin the centre of Glasgow. He joined the business from school and, after studying at the London College of Printing, \nhelped his father and uncle expand it into a company highly regarded by customers throughout Scotland for the \nquality of its printing.\n\nAs technology advanced, he noted that modern printing was not best done over three floors and, in 1988, he took \nthe business to new premises in Elliot Street where he installed the latest Heidelberg full-colour printing machines. \nTogether with other state-of-the-art facilities, these high-speed printers enabled Mr Clark to produce the very best in \nthe way of company reports, prospectuses and similar high-quality documents.\n\nDespite growing success,  extended family pressures eventually resulted in the business being sold, with Mr Clark \njoining the new owners for a few years. He then left printing to become a specialist business adviser, helping small \ncompanies in the east end of Glasgow. \n\nOne particular firm soon appreciated his knowledge and experience and, in 1998, he returned to printing when he \nbecame chairman of 21 Colour Limited, then a small specialist quality printer. \n\nUnder his guidance, 21 Colour steadily developed into a highly successful multi-faceted print business that now \nemploys more than 50 staff. \n\nHe continued his involvement with the print industry and with many other formal and informal business interests \nuntil a few weeks before his death.\n\nWhen Mr Clark was 12, his family moved to Largs. Here his father, also David, renewed his enthusiasm for sailing \nand, with his brother and sister, the young Dave Clark was soon introduced to the waters of the Clyde and west \ncoast. \n\nAs well as the family cruising holidays, he developed a keen interest in yacht racing. Joining Largs Sailing Club as a \ncadet and later Fairlie Yacht Club, he quickly established a reputation as a formidable helm. Over some two \ndecades in his series of Eauvation yachts, he won many prizes in the various regattas and points series, including \nsuccess at Cork Week, West Highland Week and the Scottish Series in Loch Fyne. \n\nMr Clark s interest in sailing also resulted in him and friends initiating the development of the very successful \nmarina at Largs.\n\nWhile sailing was Mr Clark s passion, he involved himself in many other sporting activities, including cycling, skiing \nand hill-walking. In 2001, with three companions, he completed a 1001-mile cycle run from Land s End to John O \nGroats, raising a substantial sum for charity. Until a few months ago, a cycling day from Largs back to Largs via \nArdrossan, Arran, Kintyre, Cowal, Bute and Wemyss Bay was a  regular outing.\n\n\n\nAlthough at times appearing  to be highly irreverent in his humour, Mr Clark was also a man with deeply held \nChristian views. \n\nAfter joining Fairlie Parish Church, he became an elder and until September last year was the session clerk. \n\nHis love of music   he was an accomplished guitar player and drummer   caused him to initiate a praise band within \nthe church. This brought much joy to the young people who played in the group and also to most, but maybe not all, \nof the more elderly members of the congregation.\n\nHis faith, together with his inimitable sense of humour, carried  him through the good times and bad, and particularly \nwith the pain of the very radical treatment he agreed to try in an attempt to stem his cancer. \n\nNot for a moment did he let the knowledge of how the disease would progress dilute his zeal for life or curtail his \nmany activities.\n\nDave Clark married his school sweetheart Liz in 1972 and he is survived by her and his son David and daughter \nAmy.\n\n25 YEARS AGO \n\nSCOTTISH Conservatives are expected to censure the government today when they vote in Perth on the \ncontroversial payment of  cold climate allowances .

It is currently funded jointly by Aberlour, Strathclyde \nPolice, local Housing Associations and a number of other agencies. \n\nAberlour s Chief executive, Addie Stevenson, said of the Big Lottery Fund grant:  This is a very generous sum and \none which will allow us not only to continue with the vital work we currently do with young people in the south west \n\n\n\nof Glasgow, but also to expand it to other areas of the city where it is much-needed and to  develop supportive \npartnerships  between like-minded organisations  and groups. \n\nShe said Youthpoint aimed to realise the wasted potential within some city  communities.  We carry out street-\nbased youth work, offering alternative activities for young men and women at risk of  involvement in anti-social \nbehaviour, crime or perhaps even gangs, and who might be facing exclusion from school or their community,  she \nadded. \n\nOne young person who attends Youthpoint said her experience had given her more confidence.\n\n  Helen  said:  The project has made me see that I could have gone down a different path, such as going out \ndrinking and getting into bother. The support and guidance from the project has made me a better and more caring \nperson. \n\nThe BIG Lottery Fund Scotland Chair Alison Magee said:  The project is a good example of taking something that \nworks, and using the knowledge gained, to  make a real difference through best practice. \n\n By going out on the streets and  encouraging young people to move away from anti-social behaviour and street \ncrime, we give them a chance to make positive choices as they move towards adult life. \n\nTHE author Terry Pratchett last night called for  euthanasia tribunals  to enable people with life-limiting illnesses to \nget help to end their own lives. \n\nHis call comes after Margo MacDonald s  End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill  was launched at the Scottish \nGovernment. Both may be welcomed by some as an attempt to clarify the issue around assisted suicide. But for \nmany in the disabled people s independent living movement, including those in the  Not Yet Dead  campaign, such \nproposed legislation smacks of discrimination. Both Mr Pratchett and Mrs MacDonald see  disability  as being a \nterrible tragedy bestowed upon the individual, whereas the independent living movement sees  disability  as a social \nphenomenon resulting in discrimination and reduced quality of life.\n\nMrs MacDonald s bill is designed to decriminalise the act of assisting someone to die, if the person has either been \ndiagnosed as terminally ill and finds life intolerable, or is permanently physically incapacitated to such an extent that \nthe person is unable to live independently and finds life intolerable. He or she must have requested such assistance \ntwice.\n\nHowever, it leaves open the meaning of the words  intolerable  and  independent , which may well lead in the future \nto legal, and moral, confusions. In the Bill, what constitutes life being intolerable is left to the individual perception of \nthe person seeking assistance, subject to psychiatric assessment. \n\nWhat constitutes independent living is the ability to live without the need for any assistance; for the Bill expressly \nstates that no matter how intolerable you may find life to be, so long as you do not need assistance to live you \ncannot be assisted to die.\n\nTo those in the independent living movement, independent living means  ... disabled people of all ages having the \nsame freedom, choice, dignity and control as other citizens. It does not mean living by yourself or fending for \nyourself. It means rights to practical assistance and support to participate in society and live an ordinary life .  \n\nTo hear Margo MacDonald use the absence of  choice ,  control ,  freedom  and  dignity    essential elements for \nindependent life and living   to advocate for death and dying makes the blood of many disabled people run cold. \n\nThese elements are now enshrined as  rights  under the UN Convention of Rights of Disabled People; it is the \nabsence of such rights which makes life intolerable, not their physical incapacity.  \n\nIt is quite wrong of people to think that being denied such rights to live, should give disabled people the right to be \nassisted to die.\n\n\n\nAt a time when politicians are cutting vital assistance to disabled people, because they give greater value and \npriority to other areas of public expenditure, disabled people s tolerance of a consequential poorer quality of life will \nbe gravely tested.  \n\nIf this bill becomes law, it won t be their impairments which will cause them intolerable pain and discomfort, but a \nsociety which has turned its back on them; and points to the exit door.\n\nJim Elder-Woodward is a disability rights activist and retired social work manager.\n\nTribunals call, Page 4\n\nCAMPAIGNERS have called for the resignation of a leading councillor after Edinburgh City Council was forced into \na humiliating climbdown over attempts to contract-out care.\n\nPlans by the city council to tender care and support services for nearly 800 vulnerable people in the city will be \neffectively dropped on Thursday when a report to the council finance committee will confirm that the scheme cannot \ncontinue. \n\nThe services affected include support for people with physical or learning disabilities, mental health problems, or \nhearing loss. As a result of the original process, all but 51 of 777 service users in the city were facing an upheaval \nin their care arrangements. The council said the procedure would save the city \u00a32.4m. But their actions provoked a \nstorm of protest, with protesters, many in wheelchairs or affected by other disabilities, protesting loudly outside a \nseries of meetings and lobbying councillors and MSPs.\n\nThis week s report follows an independent investigation by accountancy and consulting firm Deloitte, which \ncriticised the council s handling of the affair, warning that its execution had not been sufficiently meticulous or \nthorough. Deloitte also queried the way rankings of bids received for the services had been changed during the \ntendering process.\n\nThe campaigners  strategy of encouraging people to apply for money to pay for their own services has also been \nvindicated. Under direct payment rules, service users in the city were entitled to request funds to decide for \nthemselves who should provide their care. \n\nSo many applied that the council refused to process new requests for direct payments, before being forced to back \ndown over that issue too.Now Deloitte, and the council, have confirmed that with 80% of those affected having \nchosen direct payments, the contracts the council wished to award have become unviable.\n\nIan Hood, Coordinator of the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, claimed the Deloitte report showed council \nofficials had interfered with the bidding process to ensure that cheaper services were given preference. He said \nsources within the council had told campaigners that good quality voluntary organisation services had been \ndeliberately downgraded in favour of cheaper services.\n\nMr Hood added:  Five hundred people have applied for Direct Payment to buy their own service rather than trust the \ncouncil s tender process. Edinburgh Council now needs to learn that it cannot treat people with disabilities in the \nsame way they treat paper clips or potholes. It must review the process that it has used to ensure that this never \nhappens again. And we hope that other councils also learn that putting vulnerable people up for sale is not \nacceptable. \n\nHe also said Councillor Paul Edie should resign over the issue.  In October he accused politicians who managed to \nstall this process of  student politics . Now it is clear that without their action the care and support tenders would \nhave been awarded now. Even as late as December 1st, Mr Edie was claiming the tender award process was  \nrobust .  \n\n It is now clear that he did not exercise sufficient scrutiny of the departments he was in charge of and took the \nwords of council officials implicated in the process without sufficient checking. Up until this point we were prepared \nto give him the benefit of the doubt, we now believe his position is untenable. \n\n\n\nLesley Clemenson, the parent of David, one of those affected by the tender said,  This process has had a \ndevastating effect on individuals.  My son has had a terrible time. I hold Paul Edie responsible and heads should roll \nfor this mess. \n\nCouncil Leader Jenny Dawe said:  Councillor Edie has my full support and backing. Our focus is now on ensuring \nthose vulnerable people in the city continue to receive the care and support they need and that future procurement \nprocesses are robust. A review of the Care and Support Service procurement process is being carried out by the \nChief Executive to see what lessons can be learned.  \n\nHowever the victory for campaigners is not an absolute one. The council is now planning to award direct payments \nto those who have applied, but only at the rate which the lowest bidder in the tender process said they could deliver \nservices for - \u00a315.04 an hour. This means those who receive direct payments may have to move providers anyway, \nif they cannot get the services they currently receive for that rate. \n\nIan Hood said no confidence could be placed in any bids received during the tendering process, and said prices \nachieved under the disputed system were therefore flawed.  We intend to support individuals to challenge through \nthe courts any attempt to reduce their Direct Payments without taking into account their individual needs,  he added.\n\nAn Edinburgh City Council spokesman said:  Because of shortcomings identified in the tendering exercise and the \nhigh level of applications for Direct Payment it is no longer feasible to award the contracts as originally planned.\n\n The Chief Executive s report identifies the need to ensure service continuity and also to demonstrate Best Value by \nmaintaining service standards and securing the budgeted financial savings. It is, therefore, proposed to apply a \nceiling on Direct Payments of up to \u00a315.04 and to negotiate reductions in the rates charged by existing providers \nwhich exceed this amount. \n\nTom Aitchison, the Council s Chief Executive, said:   Officials will prepare a full Commissioning Strategy for these \nimportant services for consideration by the Council in the summer and we will ensure that the shortcomings in the \nprevious procurement exercise are fully addressed before any new commissioning process begins.\n\n By that time the majority of Direct Payment applications will have been processed and we also expect that the \nScottish Government will have issued guidance on the procurement of these services. \n\nEncouraging economic reports lifted stocks yesterday and bolstered hopes that the recovery is in better shape than \nmany had believed.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 118 points after falling in the final two days of last week. Energy stocks led \nthe market higher following a strong earnings report from Exxon Mobil.\n\nGains in manufacturing and personal incomes helped shore up the market s sentiment after three straight losing \nweeks that left stocks with a loss for January. Investors were already becoming more optimistic thanks to news on \nFriday that the economy grew at the fastest pace in six years in the final three months of 2009.\n\n The market exhaled today,  said Mike Shea, managing partner at Direct Access Partners LLC in New York.  This \nhas been a very skittish market for the last three to four weeks. \n\nThe strongest piece of economic news came from the Institute for Supply Management, which said its index of US \nmanufacturing activity grew for a sixth straight month in January to the strongest level since August 2004. \n\nThe Dow rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.1%.\n\nBritain s top share index closed 1.1% higher yesterday, helped by upbeat US manufacturing data, with banks and \ncommodity stocks topping the list  of gainers.\n\nThe FTSE-100 closed up 58.89 points at 5247.41, having dipped to 5163.57 earlier in the session. The index \nended 0.8% higher on Friday.\n\n\n\nExperts said the rise also had technical causes.\n\n We re reaching a point where this correction (from the January high) has given up almost as much as the last \nmajor correction in the FTSE which was June/July last year,  said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital \nSpreads.\n\n (It would) seem like not a bad time for bulls to come back into the market, particularly since the overall upward \ntrend remains. \n\nBanks added the most points to the index, extending Friday s bounce back, with HSBC, Standard Chartered, \nBarclays, and Lloyds Banking Group putting on 1.4% to 4.3%.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland jumped 7.9%.\n\n RBS is making very strong efforts to try and sell some of its assets. If they get lucky with Sempra and some of their \nproperty portfolio, that would show a very strong initiative to strengthen the balance sheet,  said David Buik, partner \nat BGC Partners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Sempra Energy may carve up commodities venture RBS Sempra, sources said, as pressure \non US banks to limit proprietary trading forces JPMorgan to rethink.\n\nJPMorgan is still in talks to buy RBS Sempra s global oil business and all assets outside North America, while \nSempra Energy is in talks to buy out all of the North American power and gas business, the sources said. Sempra \nowns 49% of RBS Sempra and RBS owns the rest.\n\nUK shares were lifted by data showing the manufacturing sector in the US grew in January and at a faster rate than \nexpected, The Institute for Supply Management said. It followed strong data from Australia, China and the euro \nzone.\n\nLife insurers joined in the rally by financials. Legal & General, Aviva, Standard Life and Prudential rose 1.5% to \n3.8%. Commodity issues rebounded after earlier falls, thanks to a recovery in metals and crude.\n\nAmong the miners, Vedanta Resources, Kazakhmys, Fresnillo and Lonmin added 4.2 to 5.2%. Oil majors Royal \nDutch Shell, BP and BG Group climbed 0.2% to 1.3%.\n\nUtilities were in demand after reports that midcap Northumbrian Water could receive a \u00a31.7 billion takeover offer \nfrom the Ontario Teachers  Pension Plan, which holds 27%.\n\nIn a trading update, Northumbrian said it expected group revenue for 2009/10 to be in line with the previous \nfinancial year.\n\nIts shares topped the FTSE 250 leader board, up 11.8%, while Severn Trent and United Utilities gained 4% and \n2.8%, respectively.\n\nSIGMA Capital, the AIM-listed Scottish investor in technology, property and green energy, yesterday said it was \nplanning a maiden dividend for shareholders on the back of an anticipated boost to profits.\n\nEdinburgh-based Sigma said in its latest trading update yesterday that it expected pre-tax profits to come in at more \nthan \u00a3900,000    driven largely by a gain on spin-out Frontier, its university intellectual property commercialisation \nsubsidiary   compared with a \u00a3500,000 loss the year before.\n\nHowever, Sigma also said in its pre-close update for the year to the end of December that revenues from services \nwere expected to fall to \u00a32.4m, compared with \u00a34.7m last time.\n\nSigma last year reversed into a PLUS-quoted investment company and re-listed it as Frontier IP Group in May, a \ndeal which saw it realise a gain of \u00a33.6m.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the company also said that  a  conservative approach  to the value of its investment in SI Limited \nPartnership No.7   a \u00a339.8m development of leisure and office development in the heart of Aberdeen   will result in \na charge of \u00a32.7m, and that the investment had now been  written down to nil .\n\nSigma also said that its venture capital fund management activities were trading profitably.\n\nIts property investment subsidiary showed a small loss at an operating level before one-off charges.\n\nby the Bank of England in setting monetary policy and the most up-to-date indicator of activity, may be painting a \nstronger picture than official GDP data. \n\nCIPS  seasonally-adjusted purchasing managers  index for manufacturing, a composite measure of activity in the \nsector calculated using data on new orders, production, employment, supplier performance and stocks  of \npurchases, rose from 54.6 in December to 56.7  in January. \n\nThe January figure was not only well above the level of 50 which separates expansion from contraction but also the \nhighest manufacturing PMI reading since October 1994   thus signalling the fastest monthly pace of expansion by \nthe sector for more than  15 years.\n\nThe manufacturing output sub-index in the PMI survey rose to a 43-month high in January.\n\nDavid Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said:  This is very positive \nnews and a great way to start the year.\n\n Although the manufacturing sector represents a smaller proportion of total UK GDP than 10 or 20 years ago, it is \nstill a very important part of the economy.\n\n  It is therefore encouraging to see such strong growth and it suggests we are coming out of recession much \nquicker than previously feared.\n\n One of the most encouraging aspects of this month s PMI is the turnaround on the jobs front. For the first time in 21 \nmonths there has been an increase in employment, albeit only a slight one. Employment is usually a lagging \nindicator so it suggests that firms are becoming much more confident about the future.   \n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said:  January data point to a robust start to 2010 for the \nUK manufacturing sector. \n\n The headline PMI hit a 15-year high as growth of new orders and production accelerated and employment rose for \nthe first time since April 2008. \n\n The main driver of growth was a surge in new export orders, as improving global market conditions and the \nongoing weakness of sterling led to the sharpest rise in foreign demand recorded in at least 14 years. \n\n The survey therefore raises hopes that the sluggish recovery from recession signalled by GDP data in the final \nquarter of last year will have gained momentum as we move  into 2010.  \n\nThe pound rose from a session low of $1.5905 to around $1.5940 in the immediate wake of the strong \nmanufacturing PMI survey.\n\nContinued from Back Page\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs visited the first day of the United Auctions pre-sale show of pedigree bulls at \nStirling to present prizes to the Aberdeen Angus winners.\n\nThe overall championship in the Aberdeen Angus bull show went to the April 2008-born intermediate champion \nBlelack Lord Hildalgo, from Neil and Graeme Massie, of Dinnet, Aberdeen.\n\n\n\nOverall reserve went to May 2008-born junior champion, Tonley Alonso, from Neil Wattie, of Alford, also Aberdeen.\n\nWhilst there were a number of useful bulls on display, as always there was a tail end that breeders should have left \nat home, or would have benefited from the early use of burdizzos. That was particularly true of the Beef Shorthorns, \na minority breed where there is only limited demand for the very best. \n\nDespite that, minister Richard Lochhead was full of praise for the breeders and the overall quality of stock on \ndisplay.\n\nSome breeders were disappointed that Scottish Government officials weren t present to bid for bulls as the decision \non the future of the bull hire scheme, due in early January, had still to be made. \n\nMr Lochhead deftly passed the buck and explained that the report was being considered by his colleague, \nEnvironment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, and her decision would be revealed shortly.\n\nPutting aside that minor setback, Mr Lochhead was more upbeat about the prospect of a Scottish eradication \nscheme for Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD), although he wouldn t be drawn on timescales or whether compensation \nwould be paid for persistently infected animals that had to be culled.\n\nHe confirmed that Scotland s chief vet is in discussion with industry to see how to support the eradication of BVD \nand added:  Scotland is leaps and bounds ahead in promoting animal health and BVD is now high up the agenda .\n\nAt ANM s second sale of Single Farm Payment Entitlements on Friday, 840.37  units were sold with the average \nmultiplier of  2.1 mirroring the previous sale, whilst the top multiplier was 2.4. This is based on the standard Euro \nconversion rate of 0.9093. In all, 24 lots were sold with the highest value of 623.14 euros and the lowest 4.63 euros.\n\nJohn Gregor, ANM general manager commented:  Over 2500 units forward were of low euro value which seemed \nto lack demand. Higher value lots were more sought after. \n\nAt St Boswell s yesterday, 67 prime heifers sold to 198p/kg and averaged 168.1p (-1.2p on the week). Assuming \nScottish beef type cattle kill at 58%, that average price equates to 289.8p dead weight.\n\n To convert the prime beef live weight prices quoted, divide them by 0.58. Some 78 prime bullocks sold to 186p and \naveraged 165p  (-3.4p). Five young bulls sold to 159p and averaged 153.2p.\n\nSome 104 beef type OTM sold to 137p and averaged 96.2p. 2319 prime hoggs sold to 237.8p/kg and  \u00a3122/head \nand averaged 202.3p (-4.1p). The 1057 cast ewes sold to \u00a3145 and averaged \u00a375.76.\n\nWallets Marts held their fortnightly sale at Castle Douglas yesterday when 245 store cattle were sold. Bullocks sold \nto 214.1p/kg for Simmentals and averaged 174.43p, whilst heifers sold to 188.2p and averaged 164.52p. A larger \nshow of 75 OTM averaged 91.1p/kg. \n\nAnother good show of 412 store hoggs met recent high rates and sold to \u00a378 for Suffolks.\n\nPRESIDENT Barack Obama, stung by widespread opposition to his flagship health-care reform plan and the recent \nloss of a Senate seat in the Democratic fiefdom of Massachusetts, has made job creation a key theme of the \nbudget he sent to Congress yesterday.\n\nObama s $3.8 trillion spending plan for the 2011 budget year that begins on October 1 tries to navigate between the \nopposing goals of pulling the United States   the world s biggest economy   out of the worst slump since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s and dealing with a budget deficit that soared to a record $1.42 trillion last year.\n\nConcern about runaway deficits has given the opposition Republicans campaign fodder for congressional elections \nlater this year and has emboldened their efforts to block Obama programmes, including health-care reform. \nAmerica has no state-run system like the NHS in Britain and millions of people cannot afford the high-cost coverage \nof private insurance.\n\n\n\nObama s proposed budget predicts the national deficit will peak at a record-busting  $1.56 trillion   equal to 10.6% \nof the economy measured by gross domestic product   in the current fiscal year, then dip in 2011 to $1.27 trillion, or \n8.3% of GDP, and to $828bn in 2012.\n\nDubbed an old-style liberal tax-and-spender by his conservative Republican opponents, Obama is under pressure \nto persuade investors and big creditors like China, which holds billions of dollars in US Treasury bonds, that he has \na credible plan to control the country s deficit and debt over time.\n\nHowever, analysts on this side of the Atlantic were generally downbeat about the plan.\n\nMarc Ostwald, a senior strategist at Monument Securities in London, said:  When the deficit is that size and you \nwant to cut it meaningfully, you have to do more. It is still tinkering around the edges. \n\n One has to look at more meaningful things in terms of what will actually reduce the deficit, (which is) the revenue \npicture.\n\n This is really something that is going to have an impact on equities, rather than the dollar or Treasuries.  \n\nPeter Dixon of Commerzbank added:  Probably the spending cuts are not really sufficient to generate the kind of \nsavings required to get the US fiscal balance back in order anytime soon. It looks like we are going to have a \nsituation where the budget deficit, and consequently the amount of debt, is an issue. \n\nTo boost jobs, Obama is setting aside $100bn in 2010 in tax credits aimed at small businesses as well as \ninvestments in clean energy and infrastructure, before starting to tighten the country s fiscal belt the following year.\n\nThe unemployment rate in the United States is running at 10%, near a 26-year high, and is above 17% if the \nnumber of Americans who have given up looking for work is included. US growth jumped by 5.7% at an annual \npace in the fourth quarter, but this has yet to translate into greater hiring.\n\nThat $100bn price tag is below a $174bn bill passed by the House of Representatives   the junior chamber   in \nDecember but higher than an $83bn proposal that surfaced last week in the Senate.\n\nOn the anti-recession front, congressional sources said Obama s new budget will propose extending the popular \nMaking Work Pay middle-class tax breaks of $400 per individual and $800 per couple throughout 2011. They were \ndue to expire after this year.\n\nThe spending blueprint will also propose $250 payments to Social Security recipients to bolster their finances. The \nPresident will also seek a $25bn increase in payments to help recession-battered states.\n\nThe new budget will set off months of debate in the Democrat-controlled Congress, especially in an election year in \nwhich Republicans are hoping to use attacks against government overspending to gain seats.\n\nObama has argued that he inherited a deficit of more than $1 trillion from the Bush administration and was forced to \nincrease spending to stabilise the financial system after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in \n2008 and to fight the recession.\n\nWhite House officials said they were ready to make some tough choices to get the deficit under control. \nCommunications director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the White House website that the budget would propose to \nterminate or cut back more than 120 programmes, including the NASA space agency s project to return to the \nmoon, saving about $20bn in the fiscal year.\n\nThe military, veterans, homeland security and big benefit programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, health \ncare for the elderly, would not feel the pinch.\n\nCuts would not fall equally on all domestic agencies, with some seeing budget cuts to free up spending for \nprogrammes  that the administration wants to expand such as education and civilian research efforts.\n\n\n\nTo meet his promise of getting the deficit down to 3% by 2015, Obama will rely on an 18-member debt commission, \nmade up of Democrats and Republicans, to recommend steps to take. Polls show many Americans are worried by \nthe parlous condition of their country s finances and Obama s emphasis on fiscal restraint could appeal to politically \nindependent voters, who moved away from Democrats in the Massachusetts race.\n\nThe budget also includes higher taxes on the wealthy and a plan to levy a fee on the biggest US banks to raise an \nestimated $90bn to recover losses from the government s $700bn bail-out fund. This has outraged Wall Street but \nis popular with working class Americans.\n\nPETROFAC, the oil and gas giant that is a big employer in Aberdeen, is reported to be considering hiving off its \ninvestments in North Sea fields into a business that could be floated on the stock market or sold.\n\nThe Financial Times said that a demerger of a unit that has stakes in the West Don and Don Southwest fields off \nShetland was one of a number of options that managers at Petrofac are considering.\n\nPetrofac combines an exploration and production business with a services operation that works for other firms in oil \nand gas provinces like the North Sea. The company believes owning the two operations creates valuable synergies.\n\nBy separating the E&P business, Petrofac could raise some money and clarify its structure.\n\nThe company said:  Petrofac has a strategy of creating value in assets held by its Energy Developments unit by \nleveraging the capabilities of the group s services businesses.\n\n Options with regard to individual assets are kept under regular review and if an opportunity arises to crystallise \nvalue on attractive terms for our shareholders, an announcement would be made at that time,  Petrofac said.\n\nTHREE out of four owners of small businesses have used credit cards or personal savings to fund their business \nover the last 12 months, according to a survey which reinforces demands for banks to increase lending to minnows.\n\nResearch for the Federation of Small Businesses shows that business owners have been using up their resources \nin a way that could mean they can not exploit any upturn in the economy or leaves them vulnerable to a continued \ndownturn.\n\nIn a survey of 1000 businesses across Scotland,  the FSB found that 38% used their own savings to fund activity. \n\nA further 14% had dipped into the reserves of family members.\n\nMore than one in five, 22%, had used personal credit cards.\n\nThe findings indicate that firms are resorting to costly credit card borrowing and using savings at least partly \nbecause they find it hard  to get affordable credit  from banks.\n\nA third said a key factor in improving their economic prospects would be the banks lending more and lending more \nfairly.\n\nThe FSB said the results showed that the banking marketplace isn t functioning effectively for the small business \ncommunity.   \n\nHoward Archer, UK economist at Global Insight, said data on borrowing by businesses in December published by \nthe Bank of England yesterday showed that lending levels remained  worryingly low .\n\nThe FSB warned that there could be dire consequences if the situation did not improve.\n\n Many businesses have used up their cash reserves,  said Scottish Policy Convener, Andy Willox.  The cupboard \nmarked  emergency  is bare and, if the issue of bank lending is not resolved urgently, businesses will not have the \nworking capital to take advantage of the recovery. \n\n\n\nThe federation renewed calls for the appointment of a financial intermediary who could help firms in Scotland \naccess bank funding and highlight problems to the Government. \n\nMany small firms have also faced delays in getting payments from customers.\n\nSome 30% were paid slowly by government agencies and quangos or by private sector customers. \n\nAround one in four said they had been paid late  by local authorities or  the NHS. \n\nConversely, 87% had been paid by the Scottish Government within 10 days of submitting invoices.\n\nDespite widespread difficulties in accessing finance, 32% of respondents in  Scotland expect to expand over the \nnext 12 months.  \n\nAround a quarter, 27%, believe that the business climate will improve, while 24% fear that it will deteriorate.\n\nROYAL Bank of Scotland yesterday denied it had any imminent plans to sell, and then lease back, its headquarters \nat Edinburgh s Gogarburn.\n\nThe bank has previously sold property including the London headquarters of its private banks Coutts and \nDrummonds.\n\nIt was reported yesterday that the sale of the \u00a3305m Gogarburn complex was being considered as part of a \nstrategic review by chief executive Stephen Hester.\n\nA spokeswoman said:  We constantly review all of our portfolio of property to ensure it is managed as efficiently as \npossible. Sale and leasebacks have been undertaken on many of our properties in the recent years, but not for \nGogarburn, and we have no immediate plans to do so. \n\nHester has maintained that he won t be moving the company s HQ.\n\nThe bank is also facing the renegotiation of an outline \u00a32.5bn deal to sell its RBS Sempra commodity trading joint \nventure.\n\nJP Morgan is reported to only be interested in the international operation, around half the business.\n\nIt is thought that RBS s partner Sempra Energy may attempt to buy out the rest of the business.\n\nRBS s sale of much of its asset management business completed yesterday. Aberdeen paid \u00a384.7m for \u00a313.5bn of \nassets and a team of funds of hedge funds and multi-manager operatives.\n\nMeanwhile RBS yesterday said Simon Penney would head up its wholesale and investment bank in the Middle East \nand Africa to strengthen its debt capital markets and structured finance business.\n\nEUNICE Lancaster, general manager of micro-finance operation DSL Business Finance, yesterday invoked US \nPresident Barack Obama in her efforts to transform her operation s not-for-profit business support model into the  \nreal ethical alternative  for business banking.\n\nLancaster  was speaking to The Herald as Govan-based DSL, which was originally set up with cash from the Body \nShop and provides unsecured loans to small businesses to which traditional banks are unlikely to lend, announced \nthat the agency last year had received applications from small Scottish firms  for almost \u00a33m   more than double the \nvalue of applications in 2007, the year the financial crisis began.\n\n There is clearly growing demand for our kind of finance,  said Lancaster, the daughter of  a Greenock shipyard \nworker who is quietly bringing about a small-business revolution by encouraging entrepreneurship in some of \nScotland s poorest and most deprived areas, pulling people into the fabric of the wider economy.\n\n\n\n We continue to receive many more applications than we have money to lend,  she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama, during his first State of the Union address last week, has pledged to provide small businesses \nin the US with a new range of tax breaks and better access to  bank loans.\n\nThe Obama administration has already increased investment in community development finance initiatives (CDFIs), \nfrom $50m to $400m.\n\nLancaster said:  In the States, which certainly has a much greater tradition of supporting CDFIs   which is \nessentially what we are   they set up special funds to dispense wholesale capital to community development finance \ninitiatives.\n\n That is something I would like to see happen here. It would not only be beneficial to us, but to CDFIs across the \nUK.\n\n At the moment, all our funding comes from the repayment of our loans and from the bank loans we have taken out \nourselves, which limits how effective we can be. \n\nLancaster added:  It would be nice to have access to cheaper money, which we could then pass on to support more \nsmall businesses. \n\n It s interesting to note that as a response to the banking crisis in the US, the Obama administration has increased \ninvestment in CDFIs similar to DSL. \n\n Could they offer a real ethical alternative to banks for business lending?\n\n I also think that quite apart from all the disillusionment with the big banks and bonuses, better support for CDFIs \nwould provide more variety and more options for businesses seeking funding, which can only be a good thing. \n\nMeanwhile, the latest annual lending figures from DSL   which is considered an ethical lender because it has no \nshareholders, takes no profit and pays no bonuses to staff   reveal that while bank lending to businesses virtually \ncame to a standstill around the world last year, small Scottish firms were turning in increasing numbers to DSL.\n\nThe figures also reveal that DSL, which runs a \u00a31.5m loan fund for small and start-up businesses, charities and \nsocial enterprises, was significantly over-subscribed.\n\nIn 2009, the micro-finance operation received applications for a total value of around \u00a32.8m, compared with \u00a32.7m \nin 2008. However, in 2007, just before the worst of the recession began, it received only \u00a3916,000 worth of \napplications.\n\nUnder the government s Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, DSL offers loans of up to \u00a330,000 to small firms   \neven if they have no security, are not considered credit  worthy or have been turned down by the bank for a loan.\n\nSmall firms which apply for loans must appear before a Dragons  Den style approvals panel, where volunteers from \nthe world of business and finance assess the applications.\n\nLancaster added:  Small and start-up firms are continuing to have difficulty getting bank funding and are turning to \nalternative lenders like DSL. \n\n We are also finding that the type of firms approaching DSL is changing   we are seeing more established \nbusinesses and high growth start-ups. \n\n Before the banking crisis, many of these businesses wouldn t have a problem securing bank finance   but now they \nare finding that is no longer available to them and they re turning to DSL. \n\nShe added:  We like to think we operate like the old-fashioned bank manager. We get to know our clients and their \nbusiness. We look at the whole picture and not just the figures. \n\n\n\nDSL, which has helped more than 600 businesses across Scotland to create 2000 jobs with \u00a37m of investment, \nrecently expanded into Edinburgh as well as east and central Scotland. \n\nFEARS over a housing market slump have been sparked by the first fall in mortgage approvals in over a year last \nmonth.\n\nHowever, the amount of unsecured credit unexpectedly rose over December as individuals spent on credit cards in \nthe run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe Bank of England said 59,023 mortgages were approved in December, down from 60,045 in November.\n\nMortgage approvals hit a record low of 27,162 in November 2008.\n\nMortgage lending was at \u00a31.2bn in December, down from \u00a31.6bn in November.\n\nHoward Archer, chief UK economist at IHS-Global Insight, said:  The dip in mortgage approvals in December \nreinforces our suspicion that housing prices are likely to suffer a limited relapse during the coming months, and will \nbe essentially only flat over the year as a whole. \n\nHowever, unsecured consumer credit showed its first monthly rise since June 2009, increasing by \u00a352m.\n\nCredit card borrowing rose by \u00a3195m, while other loans and advances fell.\n\nArcher said the modest rise in unsecured consumer credit may be due to people cutting back their net repayments \nof loans to help pay for Christmas.\n\nFormer Lloyds Group chairman Sir Victor Blank has been appointed to advise the Government on attracting \ninvestment from overseas. Sir Victor was named yesterday as an unpaid member of a new advisory panel set up by \nPrime Minister Gordon Brown and Business Secretary Lord Mandelson last month as part of the Government s \ngrowth strategy. The businessman stepped down from the Lloyds board last year in the wake of its troubled \ntakeover of the crisis-hit HBOS bank.\n\nHis departure was thought to have been hastened by the absence of public support for him from the Government \nquango UK Financial Investments, which handles the taxpayer s stake in banks including Lloyds. Now he will \nadvise another quango, UK Trade and Investment, on how to attract billions of pounds of investment into the UK. A \nUKTI spokeswoman said:  The panel are going to help the Government take a systematic and strategic approach to \nrelationship management with the leading companies investing in the UK. \n\nAQUAMARINE Power, the Edinburgh-based marine energy company, yesterday announced the appointment of \nRichard Round as chief finance officer. Round, 51, joins Aquamarine from Novera Energy, one of the UK s leading \nrenewable energy generators, recently acquired by Infinis Energy. Round s previous roles also include finance \ndirector of AIM-listed Cambrian Mining and Anglo Asian Mining, where he continues to sit on the board as a non-\nexecutive director and chairman of the audit committee. \n\nDawson International gave long-suffering shareholders a rare boost yesterday when it reported healthy demand for \nits knitwear in both its UK and US operations in the final quarter of 2009.\n\nThe shares rose 0.5p to 2.25p as Dawson said sales and profits for continuing operations would be ahead of \nmarket expectations for the year. \n\nThe cashmere specialist, which sells Scottish-made couture knitwear through Borders-based Barrie and Chinese-\nmade garments through Dawson Forte in the US, said:  A strong final quarter from both our UK and US knitwear \nbusinesses more than offset continued weakness in our home furnishings business.  \n\nThe UK business benefited from the timing of high margin sales to couture customers which significantly improved \nmargins in the final quarter, Dawson said, though that would unwind to some extent in the current quarter.  The US \n\n\n\nknitwear business sustained sales and margins through the final quarter in spite of the fragile US economic \nenvironment. \n\nDawson Forte, formerly run by group chief executive Andy Bartmess, has regularly outperformed the rest of the \nbusiness.\n\nThe weak pound against the dollar had helped squeeze margins in home furnishings, the company said, and \nthough the second half had seen an improvement the business was likely to report a small loss.  \n\nDawson sold its Todd & Duncan spinning mill, the last in Scotland, to Chinese cashmere giant Zhongyin five \nmonths ago, in a deal worth over \u00a310m including a working capital injection for Dawson. The group said yesterday it \nhad anticipated a trading loss in the months prior to disposal.  This proved to be the case with the business also \nrequiring an additional provision of \u00a30.5m for doubtful debts.  \n\nAn unexpected bonus last year was a $1.5m repayment of a $10m debt owed by another Chinese company, King \nDeer, and dating back to the \u00a34m sale by Dawson of assets in China in 2002. The group said a payment plan had \nbeen agreed but it was retaining a provision for the remaining debt.\n\nGiovanni Ghione, who left the board 18 months ago under former chairman Mike Hartley, has returned to the board \nat the behest of majority shareholder Peter Gyllenhammar, whose Leeds Group owns 29%. Leeds installed its \nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 David Bolton to replace Hartley last May.\n\nDawson also warned its full-year results will be impacted by a deteriorating pension deficit.  \n\nThe founders of Artemis Investment Management have regained a significant stake in the business to bring one of \nthe sector s Scottish success stories back into owner management.\n\nThe Edinburgh-based group has teamed up with US fund house Affiliated Managers Group (AMG), which \nspecialises in backing boutiques, to buy  the business back from BNP Paribas/Fortis, which acquired  it by default in \nthe 2008 carve-up  of previous majority holder  ABN Amro.\n\nThe split of the equity is yet to be finalised, but Artemis s management team will have  meaningful stakes  alongside \nmajor shareholder AMG.\n\nSenior founders John Dodd and Mark Tyndall netted more than \u00a350m apiece 16 months ago as the Artemis \nmanagement team raked in \u00a3317m from selling its one-third stake to two-thirds holder Fortis, when a change of \ncontrol clause was triggered.\n\nThat deal valued the business at \u00a3964m, but the fall in sector values since then suggests management may have \nbought their stake back a little more cheaply.\n\n AMG are very sensitive to the big picture numbers,  said Artemis spokesman Ross Leckie yesterday.  Multiples in \nthe space have fallen. \n\nIt is the second UK investment for AMG after buying into the Genesis boutique.\n\nThe group says it has  \u00a3145bn of assets across 200 investment products .\n\nAMG s chief executive officer Sean Healey said:  We believe an independent Artemis will be well positioned for \nfurther growth in both the retail and institutional markets in the UK, Europe and the Middle East. \n\nTyndall commented:  By partnering with AMG, we will become part of a high-quality organisation with global scale \nand a proven partnership approach. This will provide both the management team and successive generations with \nmeaningful equity stakes that align our interests with those of our clients. At the same time, this structure will \npreserve the successful characteristics and core elements of our business. \n\n\n\nArtemis, created by four former Ivory & Sime managers in 1997, grew rapidly after ABN acquired a 58% stake in \n2003 and bolted on its unit trusts.\n\nFunds grew from very little a decade ago to \u00a35bn in 2005 and over \u00a316bn by late 2007. The past two years  market \nturmoil has seen that fall back to \u00a310bn, but Artemis has continued to attract highly-regarded managers from rivals \nsuch as the former Jupiter star William Littlewood to add to the likes of Adrian Frost and Tim Steer. Artemis \nemploys over 100 staff, evenly split between Edinburgh and London, though only its founding quartet of managers \nTyndall, Dodd, Lindsay Whitelaw and Derek Stuart are based in Edinburgh, with 14 in London.\n\nFortis acquired the stake in 2008 in the break-up of ABM but immediately put it up for sale.  The Artemis \nmanagement was said to have been trying to mount a buy-out at that time but failed to find a financial partner.\n\nBut in October 2008 Fortis was forced to buy out the management s 33% stake, after no deal was forthcoming and \nthe sale clause in the original deal with ABN was triggered.\n\nDespite netting the \u00a3317m, including pay-outs of between \u00a318m and \u00a326m to four managers and \u00a35m to non-\nexecutive Hamish Grossart, Artemis s management said it was  not the preferred solution .\n\nUK manufacturing activity stormed ahead at its fastest pace for more than  15 years in the opening month of the \nnew decade and the sector increased its workforce for the first time since April 2008, a key survey has revealed.\n\nThe survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS), which also shows export orders growing \nat their fastest pace since comparable records for overseas demand began  14 years ago, provides some much-\nneeded good news on the UK economy.\n\nFears over the UK s ability to stage a sustainable recovery from its deepest downturn since the Great Depression \ndays of the 1930s were stoked last week when data from the Office for National Statistics showed the country only \njust exited recession during the fourth quarter of last year with 0.1% growth in gross domestic product. \n\nThe City had forecast quarter-on-quarter growth of between 0.2%  and 0.9%.\n\nThere are worries that UK economic output could fall again in the current quarter, as consumers rein in spending \nafter being willing to pay out more to fund Christmas. \n\nThe return of the VAT rate from 15% to 17.5% last month and impending end of the car scrappage scheme on \nFebruary 28 have been cited as other factors which could drag activity down.\n\nYesterday s manufacturing survey from CIPS provides some room for hope that the recovery can continue in the \nopening quarter of 2010.\n\nHowever, manufacturing is a much smaller part of the economy than services nowadays.\n\nThe disappointing rate of growth in the fourth quarter of last year stemmed primarily from the dominant service \nsector, which managed expansion of only 0.1%.\n\nUK manufacturing output rose by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of last year    signalling the \nsector may have benefited from a boost to competitiveness in overseas market-places arising from the weakness of \nsterling. \n\nOn top of that, economists have been concerned that CIPS  surveys, although followed closely\n\nGANNETT, the US publisher whose UK arm owns The Herald and Evening Times, yesterday posted better-than-\nexpected fourth-quarter profits as deep cost cutting helped overcome a 14% decline in revenue on shrinking \nadvertising sales. Gannett, whose flagship publication is USA Today, said its quarterly profit came in at $133.6m, \ncompared with $4.7bn a year earlier when the company took a massive writedown of assets.\n\n\n\nGannett, like the entire newspaper publishing industry, has experienced a steep decline in print advertising sales as \nmore people get their news on the internet. The company s publishing division recorded a fall in total revenue of \n15.4%, while ad revenue fell nearly 18%. Total operating revenues fell 14.4% to $1.5bn.\n\nMARC Bolland, Marks & Spencer s new chief executive, will start in May on a near-\u00a31 million salary and a  golden \nhello  worth \u00a33.9m in shares, writes Douglas Hamilton. The former Wm Morrison chief executive has been released \nearly from his 12-month contract with the supermarket group to take on the top job at M&S on May 1. His \u00a3975,000 \nsalary is just short of current M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose s \u00a31.13m basic pay, but M&S said it would pay cash and \nshares  awards worth up to a potential \u00a36.3m.\n\nIrish airline Ryanair raised its profit forecast and said an industry slump it has exploited to expand at the expense of \nless nimble rivals was set to continue, sending its shares sharply higher. Europe s biggest low-cost airline led blue-\nchip risers after it said it was still gaining market share from leading flag carriers Air France-KLM and British \nAirways and Deutsche Lufthansa.  The environment out there is, from Ryanair s perspective, great, because it s \nawful,  chief executive Michael O Leary said. The airline revealed it had increased its net profit guidance for the full \nyear to  275 million from the lower end of a range of  200m- 300m. O Leary said profits would grow over the next 12 \nmonths.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nMAGNIFICENT SEVEN: Robbie Keane, pictured at Celtic Park last night, will wear the shirt made famous by Jimmy \nJohnstone and Henrik Larsson.
