{"title": "DMV position on driver's licenses for young illegal immigrants", "body": "\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles has clarified its policy on issuing driver licenses to young illegal \nimmigrants who may be able to obtain work permits under a new federal deportation relief program.\n\nThe agency last week said it would grant licenses but backtracked on Monday and finally in the afternoon said \nlegislation or a new regulation might be needed to grant the licenses.\n\nHere is the DMV statement:\n\n\"Following is an updated statement regarding the impact (of) the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as \nit pertains to the issue of Driver Licenses and ID Cards in California:\n\n\"As the DMV initially stated, it appears that young people who receive federal deferrals will be eligible for California \ndriver's licenses, but it remains uncertain whether clarifying legislation or regulations will be necessary. This is \nbecause under current state regulations, only certain types of federal immigration documents support the issuance \nof a California driver's license. Further state legislative or regulatory clarification may be needed if the federal \ngovernment's new deferral program results in the issuance of new or different immigration documents.\"\n\nMike Marando\n\nDeputy Director/Public Affairs\n\nCalifornia DMV\n"}
