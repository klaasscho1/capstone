{"title": "Immigration keeps up steady pace", "body": "\nImmigration has continued at a steady pace in the past two years despite the nation's weakened economy and \nefforts to tighten its borders, according to new studies of Census Bureau numbers. And those new immigrants are \nfinding jobs.\n\nThe number of employed immigrants rose by 593,000 from 2000 through the end of last year, while the number of \nU.S.-born workers declined by 1.5 million, said a new report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern \nUniversity. Immigrant men and women gained equally, and most of the new workers were recent arrivals.\n\nThe data make it clear that the United States still offers substantial appeal to people from other countries, even \nthough more than 2 million jobs have vanished in the past two years, and 8.5 million people are unemployed. \nDespite concerns that refugees and others are waiting longer to get in, some immigrants are managing to do so, \nincluding many who arrive illegally.\n\nThe Census Bureau released a report Monday showing that more than 3 million immigrants arrived in the previous \ntwo years, about the same pace as in the 1990s. That brought to 32.5 million the number of foreign-born people \nliving in U.S. households last March, a record.\n"}
