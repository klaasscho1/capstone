{"title": "Union, Expos dispute visa use", "body": "\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association says it plans to fight the Montreal Expos about visas that will \npermit players who are not U.S. citizens to play for Canadian teams in replacement games in the USA.\n\nThe Expos say the union has no case.\n\nMontreal officials dealt with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and received clearance to use foreign \nplayers on the B-1 (tourist) visa. \"I believe these guys aren't eligible for the B-1,\" says Gene Orza, the union's \nassociate general counsel. \"The B-1 is not for minor league baseball players coming in and earning a living.\"\n\nExpos President Claude Brochu says \"(Orza) is dead wrong.\"\n\nThe B-1 does permit a foreign national to visit to transact business in the USA. Brochu says the players were \ncleared as a matter of immigration reciprocity between the U.S. and Canada. \"It is not a loophole; it's the law,\" says \nBrochu.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are the other Canadian team. Their situation might be muddled because they play home \nreplacement games in Dunedin, Fla. Ontario labor laws prohibit the use of replacement workers.\n\n\"We plan to talk to the INS and (Department of) State about players being abused here,\" Orza says. \"I believe we'll \nsee the loophole will not be a loophole.\"\n\nNotes\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\n"}
