{"title": "1,250 janitors fired over immigration", "body": "\nAn immigration attorney says approximately 1,250 undocumented janitors in the Twin Cities were fired from their \njobs in October as their company checked immigration papers.\n\nThe janitors worked for ABM Industries Inc., a New-York based company that provides janitorial services, said \nJohn Keller, an attorney for the nonprofit Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota.\n\nKeller said the workers' union called his office in early June for legal advice. He says ABM had sent employees \nletters that said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was requiring workers to show documents proving they \nhad legal status to work in the U.S.\n\nKeller said the vast majority of the 1,250 fired workers were undocumented. Keller said that to his knowledge, no \none was arrested or deported.\n\nICE spokesman Tim Counts said the agency doesn't discuss ongoing enforcement activity.\n\n-- Associated Press\n"}
