{"title": "Syrian Stowaway's Bid For Asylun Is Weighed", "body": "\nThe State Department will recommend next week whether a young Syrian stowaway who leaped into the \nMississippi River and requested asylum can remain in the United States, according to the man's lawyer.\n\nThe stowaway, Mohamad Marie, 20 years old, told a hearing officer with the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nthat he wanted to remain in the United States, citing instances of religious persecution, said the lawyer, David \nKattan, one of three representing Mr. Marie.\n\nMr. Marie, speaking through an interpreter, told the hearing officer that he was a Palestinian born in Syria and was \na Sunni Moslem, Mr. Kattan said.\n\nDarrell Goff, a Border Patrol agent in Baton Rouge, said Mr. Marie ''claims he fears some kind of persecution if he \ngoes back to Syria.''\n\nMr. Marie's lawyers said their client would be held in the Orleans Parish Jail while his case was considered.\n\nMr. Marie asked for asylum Thursday after leaping handcuffed into the Mississippi River from the Liberian-\nregistered freighter Enard Hope. After Border Patrol agents picked him up, the ship's agent arranged for him to fly \nto Syria, but he made a commotion in Atlanta and airline officials refused to let him on a plane. He was then \nreturned to Louisiana, officials said.\n"}
