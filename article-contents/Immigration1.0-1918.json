{"title": "MEXICO WARNS U.S. DELEGATION ON MIGRATION", "body": "\nSecretary of State Warren Christopher led eight U.S. Cabinet members to Mexico on Monday in a show of \nconfidence in the closeness of U.S.-Mexican relations.\n\nBut the team ran immediately into Mexican resentment over recent bloody incidents involving the treatment of illegal \nimmigrants in California.\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Angel Gurria said, \"We are deeply concerned by the emergence of trends that could \njeopardize our relations and lead us down the road to confrontation and complaint.\"\n\nGurria alluded to recent incidents in California in which police chases led to the deaths of 10 migrants hidden in \nsmugglers' vans and to the televised beating of two suspected illegal migrants by sheriff's deputies. He said Mexico \nintended to protect its citizens.\n\n\"We will always ask for the identification and punishment for those that abuse their rights, as well as the appropriate \ncompensation for damages,\" the foreign minister said.\n\nThe Americans were in a far more upbeat mood. Christopher said the United States and Mexico had now \"forged \nthe closest partnership in our history.\"\n\nThe two Cabinets convened a periodic two-day meeting of what is known as the U.S.-Mexico Binational \nCommission. For 15 years, the officials have been overseeing a series of working groups discussing issues \nbetween the two nations.\n\nBut despite the high-level cast of participants, the Cabinet members plan to sign only a handful of minor \nagreements today, agreements that have been worked out by subordinates in recent weeks. The conference, as a \nresult, may be more symbolic than substantive.\n"}
