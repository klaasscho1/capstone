{"title": "COUNTY JAILS HOUSING FEWER FEDERAL PRISONERS", "body": "\nThe number of federal inmates in Wisconsin is dropping as federal immigration officials shift their focus from \nfinding illegal immigrants to investigating reports of terrorist activities.\n\nThe average number of illegal immigrants detained in Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois has dropped this year from a \nhigh of 486 in March to a low of 397 on May 27, said John Longshore, interim director of the federal Bureau of \nCitizenship and Immigration Services' Chicago district, which covers the three states.\n\nThe number now is around 420.\n\nThe detainees are typically held in local county jails at federal expense while they await trial or deportation, and \nthe drop in arrests means a subsequent drop in the amount of money for which jails are reimbursed.\n\nLongshore did not know how many immigration inmates are currently held in the five Wisconsin jails with contracts \n-- Dodge, Kenosha, Ozaukee, Walworth and Waukesha counties.\n\nIn Ozaukee County, the number of immigration detainees has dropped to about 25, compared with about 75 in \nMarch, Sheriff Maury Straub said.\n\nThat loss means the county might not meet its $1.7 million revenue projection this year for housing federal \ninmates, Straub said.\n\n\"The whole focus of investigation has shifted from immigration cases to more time-intensive terrorism \ninvestigations\" since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Longshore said.\n\nIf county jails remain less than full, officials could consider bringing back some of the nearly 2,300 Wisconsin \ninmates held in Oklahoma and North Dakota jails.\n\nBut those inmates don't pay as well as their federal counterparts.\n\nNotes\n\nSTATE CORRECTIONS\n"}
