{"title": "Time to Act on Cubans and Haitians in Camps", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nFor some months, safe haven camps have been organized at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba and in \nPanama for more than 35,000 Cubans and Haitians who have fled their countries (front page, Dec. 10). Now, the \nUnited States Government is obliged to provide a solution to the needs of these Cubans and Haitians for new \npermanent homes.\n\nThe executive committee of governments, including the United States, that oversees the work of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees concluded in 1981 that after a large-scale influx of asylum seekers has stabilized, \nstates should take action to facilitate voluntary repatriation, to promote local settlement in the receiving country or to \nprovide resettlement in third countries. This conclusion recognizes the human right of asylum seekers to a \nresolution of their situation of international homelessness.\n\nAll Haitians and Cubans in the safe havens who can establish a well-founded fear of persecution should be \nadmitted immediately to the United States as refugees. Others could be brought to the United States on \nhumanitarian grounds or urged to repatriate if appropriate.\n\nThe timeline for such action is not specified in international practice, but the March 1995 date negotiated by the \nUnited States with Panama for safe-haven facilities would provide a manageable deadline for such a solution.\n\n \n\nARTHUR C.
