{"title": "WILL SAYS ARIZONA LAW MERELY ECHOES FEDERAL IMMIGRATION STATUTES", "body": "\n\"What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is... a federal crime.\"\n\nGeorge Will on Sunday, April 25th, 2010 in a panel discussion on ABC This Week\n\n* * *\n\nThe Ruling: MOSTLY TRUE\n\nArizona just passed a new immigration law that's getting the attention of national policymakers.\n\nCritics of the bill say it may be unconstitutional and that it will prompt racial profiling.\n\nBut conservative columnist George Will said on ABC's This Week that the new law only reiterates federal crimes.\n\n\"What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime,\" he \nsaid. \"Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad \npeople. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated \ndriving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to \ndo this in a professional way.\"\n\nWe're leaving questions of constitutionality to the lawyers. Instead, we wondered whether Will is correct that the \nnew Arizona law makes a state crime out of something that's already a federal crime.\n\nOther proponents of the bill have made the same argument, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, who \nsaid that the \"legislation mirrors federal laws regarding immigration enforcement.\"\n\n\"Despite erroneous and misleading statements suggesting otherwise, the new state misdemeanor crime of willful \nfailure to complete or carry an alien registration document is adopted, verbatim, from the same offense found in \nfederal statute,\" she said on April 23, 2010, the day she signed the bill.\n\nOpponents are adamant that the bill is unconstitutional. For instance, the Mexican American Legal Defense & \nEducational Fund wrote in a letter to Brewer that the new law will \"require or permit public officials to investigate \nand determine individual's immigration status. These provisions regulate immigration and are impermissible \nintrusions on Congress' exclusive constitutional powers.\"\n\n\nThey also argue that the Arizona law would allow local enforcement authorities to arrest those suspected of being \nin violation of the law without a warrant. But without a formal agreement with federal authorities, states are \nprohibited from enforcing civil violations of immigration law, they argue.\n\nThe legal scholars we spoke with told us to take a close look at two key sections of Title 8 of the U.S. Code. Section \n1304e requires that \"every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his \npersonal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him.\" Those who \nfail to comply will be guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined $100 and can be imprisoned up to 30 days.\n\nSection 1306a says that, \"Any alien required to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted in the United States \nwho willfully fails or refuses to make such application or to be fingerprinted, and any parent or legal guardian \nrequired to apply for the registration of any alien who willfully fails or refuses to file application for the registration of \nsuch alien shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $1,000 or be \nimprisoned not more than six months, or both.\"\n\nIndeed, section 3 of the new Arizona law makes it a state crime if immigrants are in violation of either of those \ncodes.\n\nSo, when it comes to that section of the law -- arguably the \"meat\" of the new law -- \"it's very clear that in this \nrespect, George Will is right,\" said Paul Bender, a law professor at Arizona State University.\n\nGabriel Chin, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, had a similar take. In an e-mail, he wrote that Will's \nclaim is generally correct.\n\n\"However, while the underlying offenses are federal crimes, they are among the least prosecuted in the U.S. \nCode,\" he wrote. \"For the relevant offense at issue here, failure of a non-citizen to register in violation of 8 U.S.C. \n1306(a), there were 5 convictions across the U.S. in FY 2008. So to be precise, the statement would be 'What the \nArizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is . . . a federal crime that the federal \nauthorities have chosen not to enforce except in rare circumstances.'\"\n\nIn fact, proponents of the Arizona law have argued that's why new state immigration rules are needed; federal \nauthorities are not doing a consistent job of enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books.\n\nSo, in the two cases above, the bill does make what are already federal crimes state crimes.\n\nThere are other parts of the new law that also overlap with federal statute. For instance, section 5 of the Arizona \nlaw, which deals with the transportation of non-citizens is nearly identical to section 1324 of Title 8 of the U.S. \nCode.\n\nHowever, the Arizona law does break new ground. For example, section 5 also would make it illegal to pick up day \nlaborers on the street for hire, \"which has nothing to do with federal law. It's essentially a traffic law,\" Chin wrote. \nThose violating this section are guilty of a misdemeanor. And it also makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to \nsolicit work.\n\nMary Giovagnoli, Director of the Immigration Policy Center, pointed out another aspect of the bill that she finds \nparticularly troubling: Section 2 of the Arizona law would allow citizens to sue local and state authorities if they do \nnot believe the new law was being enforced effectively. State and local authorities could be fined between $1,000 \nand $5,000 a day for each day the policy remains in effect.\n\nThe bill also includes new language about how the law applies to employers and specifies the circumstances under \nwhich an officer can question and arrest someone they think is in violation of the law.\n\nBut Will was talking about crimes. He said that the the new Arizona immigration law makes what is already a \nfederal crime into a state crime. And when it comes to some of the most talked about parts of the law, having to do \nwith aliens who fail to carry proper paperwork and failing to register, Will is correct about the core of the law; \nfederal statutes already makes those two provisions a crime. But the law also includes a new prohibition barring \n\n\n\npicking up day laborers on the street for hire and soliciting for work. That's not in the federal code. As a result, we \nfind Will's claim to be Mostly True.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout this statement:\n\nPublished: Wednesday, April 28th, 2010 at 4:32 p.m.\n\nSubjects: Immigration\n\nSources:\n\nThis Week, April 25, 2010, episode\n\nThe New York Times, Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration, by Randal C.
