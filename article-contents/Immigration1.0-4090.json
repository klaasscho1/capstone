{"title": "PANEL SUGGESTS DOING AWAY WITH THE INS", "body": "\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service would be disbanded and its responsibilities farmed out under a \nproposal by an advisory panel, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Immigration Service now suffers from \"mission overload,\" according to a draft copy of a report by the U.S. \nCommission on Immigration Reform.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Justice Department - currently the parent agency of the Immigration Service - would retain \nresponsibility for controlling the border and removing illegal immigrants.\n\nThe State Department would oversee immigration services and benefits, such as applications for citizenship. The \nLabor Department would be charged with enforcing laws governing the hiring of foreign workers.\n\n \n\nCongress set up the bipartisan commission in 1990.\n\nFormer Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., a commission member, said the eight-member panel had considered \nsetting up an independent immigration agency but decided that it would be more effective to assign some of the \nImmigration Service's duties to other agencies.\n\nOfficials in President Bill Clinton's administration expect the report to be the starting point for a debate over how to \nmanage the immigration system, according to the Times.\n\nMany state and federal leaders have expressed frustration with the Immigration Service's failure to control illegal \nimmigrants and criminal aliens living in the United States.\n\nOfficials of the agency said the commission's proposals would reverse this financial investment and ignore \nimprovements that the agency has made.     \n"}
