{"title": "Cuba: Dad May Retrieve Cuban Boy", "body": "\nCuba's government will not stop the father of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from retrieving his son in Miami if he wants \nto, says Fidel Castro's point man on U.S. affairs.\n\nBut Juan Miguel Gonzalez shouldn't go unless U.S. officials agree ahead of time to let the boy return to Cuba, said \nRicardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly.\n\n''He's a free man,'' Alarcon told reporters after meeting Tuesday with the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the National \nCouncil of Churches leader who came here in hopes of helping reunite father and son.\n\n''He should do whatever he wants. And we will help him. But if I were him I would ask, for what reason: to finally \nreturn the boy, or to delay and delay'' the case even longer.\n\nA U.S. official said Tuesday that the Clinton administration had asked Cuba to let Gonzalez escort the boy back to \nthe island if U.S. officials decide the boy should return to Cuba.\n\nGonzalez has not commented publicly on the newest report from Washington, but earlier said that he did not think \nhe should have to go the United States to pick up his boy.\n\nThe U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said the request was a contingency plan and does not signal a \ndecision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to send Elian back to his homeland.\n\nElian was retrieved from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25. He had been aboard a Florida-bound \nboat that capsized, killing 10 other passengers, including his mother.\n\nA tug of war ensued, with his father demanding his return and his relatives in Florida insisting he would have a \nbetter life in the United States. U.S. officials paroled the boy to the temporary care of his great-uncle in Miami.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service set a Jan. 21 hearing on the case, but American officials have said a \ndecision could be reached beforehand.\n\nState Department spokesman James P. Rubin said a decision by the father to apply for a nonimmigrant visa would \nbe welcome. But for Gonzalez to make the trip, he also would need travel documents from the Cuban government, \nRubin noted.\n\nThe speculation both here and in the United States has been that Havana is worried that if Gonzalez goes to \nretrieve his child he may never return.\n\n\nIf he stayed, however, he could risk permanent separation from his current wife, his 4-month-old son, and his \nparents in Cuba. And after weeks of protests by hundreds of thousands of people demanding his son's return, \nGonzalez, a member of the Communist Party, has repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the Cuban government \nand people.\n\nYet another gathering in support of Elian's return was held on Tuesday, this time by Cuba's leading artists, writers, \nmusicians and other cultural figures. President Castro showed up at the gathering at the Palace of Conventions in \nHavana his first presence thus far at a pro-Elian rally.\n\nCampbell, the church council's outgoing secretary-general, met briefly with Castro on Monday. The council is the \nUnited States' largest ecumenical organization, representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations \ncomprising 52 million congregants.\n\nAfter spending most of Monday with Gonzalez and Elian's four grandparents and a great-grandmother, Campbell \nwas convinced that the boy should be with them.\n\n''The human emotion in this family is very real and very powerful,'' said Campbell, a Baptist minister. ''We believe \nthat this family has both the emotional strength and economic resources to raise this child.''\n\n U.S. immigration officials in Washington have made a decision on the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center \nof an international custody dispute, a family spokesman said today.\n\nElian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, who have been fighting to keep the boy, expected to learn the decision late this \nmorning, spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service called Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of Elian, to tell \nof the decision, Gutierrez said.\n\n U.S. immigration officials in Washington have made a decision on the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center \nof an international custody dispute, a family spokesman said today.\n\nElian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, who have been fighting to keep the boy, expected to learn the decision late this \nmorning, spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service called Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of Elian, to tell \nof the decision, Gutierrez said.\n\nAn immediate appeal is planned if the decision goes against the wishes of relatives trying to keep the boy in Miami.\n\nHe was plucked from the ocean on Thanksgiving following the drownings of his mother and stepfather in an illegal \nboat crossing from Cuba.\n\nThe boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has been trying to get him back ever since, saying his ex-wife didn't have \npermission to take the boy out of his communist homeland. He has had the backing of Cuban President Fidel \nCastro, whose government has orchestrated giant demonstrations backing the father.\n\nThe boy has been treated as a cold war-style hero by anti-Castro groups in Miami, living in the glare of television \ncameras as he toured Orlando theme parks and enrolled Tuesday in first grade.\n\n U.S. immigration officials in Washington have made a decision on the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center \nof an international custody dispute, a family spokesman said today.\n\nElian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, who have been fighting to keep the boy, expected to learn the decision late this \nmorning, spokesman Armando Gutierrez said.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service called Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of Elian, to tell \nof the decision, Gutierrez said.\n\n\n\nAn immediate appeal is planned if the decision goes against the wishes of relatives trying to keep the boy in Miami.\n\nHe was plucked from the ocean on Thanksgiving following the drownings of his mother and stepfather in an illegal \nboat crossing from Cuba.\n\nThe boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has been trying to get him back ever since, saying his ex-wife didn't have \npermission to take the boy out of his communist homeland.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., an outspoken congressional critic of the Castro regime, said the INS decision ''is \nunconscionable and flies in the face of humanitarian principles.''\n\n''The administration silenced Elian and chose to pursue its policy of rapprochement with Castro rather than to allow \nall sides to present their case in court and to afford the U.S. legal system the opportunity to rule on this issue,'' she \nsaid in a statement.\n\nJames Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, offered to ''pay the cost to bring Elian's entire \nfamily to Miami so that we can learn for sure what his father wants free of communist coercion.''\n\nBut White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton believed the INS considered the matter fairly.\n\n''He believes this was a difficult case for the INS, they acted appropriately, they gathered the facts in a very \ncomprehensive way and applied the relevant rules and regulations and law fairly,'' Lockhart said.\n\nAt the INS offices in Miami, one man was escorted away by police after a fist fight almost erupted. Protesters \ncarried signs saying ''How can you send a child back to a country that violates human rights?'' and ''No More Castro\n\n No More Desperate Crossings.''\n\nThe boy has been treated as a Cold War-style hero by anti-Castro groups in Miami, living in the glare of television \ncameras as he toured Orlando theme parks and enrolled Tuesday in first grade.\n\nThe Clinton administration asked the Cuban government this week to issue an exit visa to the father to allow him to \npersonally escort the boy back home if immigration officials decide he should return to the island.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, said Cuba's government would not stop the \nfather from going to the United States, but said he shouldn't go unless U.S. officials agree ahead of time to let the \nboy return to Cuba.\n\n''He should do whatever he wants. And we will help him. But if I were him I would ask, for what reason: to finally \nreturn the boy, or to delay and delay'' the case even longer.\n\nWhile Cuban adults who reach the U.S. mainland are routinely allowed to stay, the boy's age created diplomatic \nproblems. Many Cuban exiles insist his mother's death in a bid to live in a free country was enough to allow Elian to \nstay, regardless of the desires of his Cuban relatives.\n\n A Cuban boy whose rescue at sea launched a diplomatic tug-of-war between the United States and Fidel Castro \n''belongs with his father'' and must be returned to the Cuba, U.S. immigration officials said today.\n\nA decision announced by Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, requires 6-\nyear-old Elian Gonzalez to leave Miami and return to Cuba by Jan. 14.\n\n''Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and U.S. practice,'' Meissner \nsaid. ''This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.''\n\nShe said the INS was ready to work with Elian's family in Miami and others to secure his return to Cuba.\n\nThe boy's father, Juan Gonzalez, was not immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\nArmando Gutierrez, a spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives, said the family was shocked. ''No one is listening to \nthe mother's cry for Elian.''\n\nAsked what the boy has been saying, Gutierrez said, ''He cares for his father but he would like his father to be here \nwith him.''\n\nPeople protesting the INS decision gathered today in front of the agency's offices in Miami and the home of \nrelatives who have cared for the boy since he was rescued on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThe boy was found clinging to an inner tube at sea after his mother and nine others died when their boat sank \nduring their effort to leave Cuba for Florida.\n\nElian quickly found himself in the middle of high-level diplomatic discussions as Cuban-Americans who had fled the \ncommunist island demanded that he be allowed to remain in the United States. Cuban President Castro joined \nElian's father in demanding the boy's return and sponsored massive demonstrations on the boy's behalf.\n\nEven before the INS ruling was publicly announced, Elian's relatives in Miami said they would appeal.\n\nBut after interviews with the elder Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and lawyers in Miami, the INS found that the \nfather had the sole legal authority to speak on behalf of his son regarding his immigration status in the United \nStates.\n\nEven though the boy's parents were divorced, the INS found that Elian had a ''close and continuous relationship'' \nwith his father.\n\n''The father made it very clear that he wants Elian returned to him as soon as possible,'' Meissner said.\n\nElian was attending classes for the second day at the Lincoln-Marti School in Miami when the INS announcement \nwas made.\n\n''He is a special kid, but we have treated him like any other student at our school. He gets along with the other kids. \nHe smiles a lot,'' said the school's director, Demetrio Perez. ''It is going to affect his personality a lot if he is sent \nback. It is a mistake.
