{"title": "Bollywood Star Urges Fans To Halt Protests", "body": "\nAfter returning to his native India on Tuesday, the Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan said that  his detention by \nimmigration officials at  Newark Liberty International Airport had been blown out of proportion, but that he would \nlimit his future visits to the United States, The Associated Press reported. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Khan said, ''Of \ncourse I will visit the U.S. if I have to go for my work, but I will go less often,'' according to The A.P. He also asked \nhis fans to cease their protests. ''Let's put this behind us,'' Mr. Khan said, ''think positively and move ahead.'' The \nactor was detained on Friday for about an hour at the Newark airport after United States immigration officials said  \nhis name had come up on a routine alert list. He was promoting his film ''My Name Is Khan,'' which addresses the \nracial profiling of Muslims after Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
