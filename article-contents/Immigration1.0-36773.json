{"title": "THE NATION;A Grace Period For Illegal Aliens", "body": "\n''Now they ask me for papers,'' said Jose Antonio Menendez, an illegal alien from El Salvador who has lived and \nworked in Houston since 1981. Mr. Menendez can no longer find a job, even though, like millions of other aliens, he \ncan apply for legal status under the immigration law adopted in November. He can legally be employed while the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service decides whether he qualifies, and in any case, a provision authorizing fines \nof employers who hire illegal aliens does not go into effect until June 1.\n\nNevertheless, suits filed by immigrant rights groups in Houston, Phoenix and Sacramento say many employers are \nalready dismissing illegal aliens or, more often, refusing to hire them, choosing to run no risk of fines that range up \nto $10,000.\n\nLast week the immigration service agreed to grant ''blanket authority'' for illegal aliens to work until Sept. 1, if they \ntell their employer that they expect to qualify for legal status. The service said it did so only to avoid the \n''administrative nightmare'' of trying to issue up to five million temporary work permits while also determining which \naliens were qualified for amnesty.\n\nA spokesman for the group that filed the Sacramento suit called the agreement, which settled the suit, a victory. \n''We think this should reverse the trend of employers firing many of their workers to avoid sanctions,'' said Peter \nSchey, director of an immigrants group in Los Angeles.\n"}
