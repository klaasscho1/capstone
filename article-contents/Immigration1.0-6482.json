{"title": "IMMIGRANT PRENATAL CARE SUBSIDIZED", "body": "\nCalifornia will provide state-subsidized prenatal care for illegal immigrants under a bill signed by the governor \nThursday and announced Monday.\n\nGov. Gray Davis also signed a bill expanding Healthy Families, the state's health insurance program for poor \nchildren.\n\n\"These bills will ensure that more of our most vulnerable kids get access to health care,\" Davis said in a written \nstatement.\n\nDavis signed the prenatal-care bill days after a state appeals court rejected his fourth attempt to delay a court \nhearing in a lawsuit in which he is the defendant.\n\nThe prenatal-care program eliminates the thorniest immigration issue Davis has faced since he sidestepped a \ndecision on Proposition 187 -- a voter-approved ban on most public services for illegal immigrants -- earlier this \nyear. Davis sent the illegal-immigration measure to a federal mediator, where it remains.\n\nAlthough illegal immigrants are ineligible for most publicly funded health care, California provides prenatal care \nunder Medi-Cal for all needy women, including about 70,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nDavis' predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, sought to make pregnant illegal immigrants ineligible for such \nbenefits.\n\nState courts blocked Wilson's effort. He appealed, and when Davis took office in January, he became the defender \nof the policy.\n\nBy signing the bill funding the prenatal care, Davis could kill lawsuits on the matter, said John Affeldt, the lead \ncounsel in the one of the cases that challenged Wilson's attempt to block the assistance. A regulation cutting off the \naid remains on the state books, Affeldt said. If Davis removes the regulation, Affeldt will drop the lawsuit, and he \npredicted his counterparts in two similar lawsuits would do likewise.\n"}
