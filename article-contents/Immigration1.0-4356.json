{"title": "BORDER-CONTROL SUCCESS FOUND HARD TO GAUGE", "body": "\nDespite pouring billions of dollars into a campaign to cut illegal immigration over the last four years, the federal \ngovernment has no way of knowing whether its measures are working, a General Accounting Office report says. In \nthe first of a series of reports mandated by a 1996 immigration reform law, the GAO determined that the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service \"has made progress\" in implementing parts of its 1994 border-control \nstrategy.\n\nBut the office, which audits government programs for Congress, said it could not tell whether the agency was \nachieving its main aim of actually reducing the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S.-Mexican border. The \noverall results of the INS strategy were thus \"inconclusive,\" the GAO said. It recommended that the attorney \ngeneral, whose department includes the INS, develop a plan to comprehensively and systematically evaluate the \ncampaign.\n\nNotes\n\nWashington News in Brief\n"}
