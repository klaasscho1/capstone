Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The \namendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, February 13, 2018, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Recognition of \nthe Minority Leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. \nMr. President, as we enter the second day of the debate on immigration, everyone should be focused on finding a \nbill to protect the Dreamers and address border security that can get 60 votes. That is the ball game. The majority \nleader's desire to vote on an unrelated, partisan immigration bill--legislation that is not only silent on Dreamers but \nis silent on border security as well--is not a productive way to begin debate. Let's get to the crux of the issue. Let \nRepublicans offer whatever they want on DACA and border security, and we will do the same. The leader supports \nthe proposal by Senator Grassley, which is, essentially, the President's plan. Let's vote on that first. We will have \nseveral bipartisan bills to offer. We should vote on those too. Democrats are focused like a laser on finding a \nbipartisan bill that can pass the Senate to protect the Dreamers. Several moderate Republicans are working \ntoward that as well. The one person who seems most intent on not getting a deal is President Trump. President \nTrump's contribution to this debate has been to put forward a proposal that contains a vast curtailment of legal \nimmigration, far outside the scope of DACA and border security, and has demanded that the Democrats support it. \nInstead of making a proposal in good faith or working with Democrats on a compromise, President Trump is trying \nto force his unpopular, hard-line immigration agenda down the throats of the American people by calling it a DACA \nbill. The President's proposal, now the Grassley bill, is so extreme on legal immigration that several Republicans \nhave been critical of it, including my friends from South Carolina and Arizona. Yet President Trump somehow thinks \nthat Democrats would be to blame for not getting a deal on DACA because we didn't go blindly along with his \npartisan plan--extreme as it is and with no input from Democrats. That will not happen. Only in a Kafkaesque, 1984 \nworld could the Democrats be blamed for the current predicament on DACA. As much as the President wants to \nturn the world upside down, as much as he wants everyone to just accept what he is saying, the American people \nknow better. Everyone here knows that President Trump has stood in the way of a bipartisan solution to DACA \nfrom the very beginning. Let's take a quick look at the history. First, it was President Trump who terminated the \nDACA Program last August, not the Democrats and not the Republicans here. Unilaterally, we are in this pickle--\nworse than a pickle--in this bad situation because President Trump chose to end the DACA Program last August. \nThat stands out above anything else. Then President Trump turned his back on not one but two bipartisan \nimmigration proposals. I went so far as to put the wall--the President's signature campaign issue--on the table for \ndiscussion. That still did not drive him to a deal. Finally, now that we are working hard in the Senate to come up \nwith a bipartisan proposal, President Trump is just trying to gum up the works. According to reports, President \nTrump may threaten to veto legislation that doesn't match his hard-line demands--``my way or no way'' and with no \nDemocratic input. A statement this morning from the White House said the President would oppose even a short-\nterm bill to protect the Dreamers. So who is intent on kicking out these people who know no country but America, \nwho work in our factories and offices, who go to our schools, who serve in our military? Who is intent on kicking \nthem out? It is not the American people, as 90 percent want to support the Dreamers. It is not any Democrat and \n\n\n\nnot a good number of Republicans on that side of the aisle. It is just the President. On three separate occasions, \nPresident Trump has stood in the way of a bipartisan solution to DACA--a problem he created in the first place. Yet \nthe President is in this dream world. He thinks: Oh, I can blame the Democrats for the impasse. As I said, only in a \n1984 world where up is down and black is white could this be true. Only in a 1984 world where up is down and \nblack is white would the American public blame the Democrats for this. They know where Trump stands. They know \nit. The American people know what is going on. They know that this President not only created the problem but \nseems to be against every solution that might pass because it is not 100 percent of what he wants. If, at the end of \nthis week, we are unable to find a bill that can pass--I sincerely hope that is not the case, due to the good efforts of \nso many people on both sides of the aisle--the responsibility will fall on the President's shoulders and on those in \nthis body who went along with him. Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing and are, perhaps, very close to a \nconclusion. Nothing is ever certain given the contentious nature of this debate, but I am hopeful that Senators can \nput the President's hard-line demands to the side and come up with a deal that works for both parties. If we want to \ngo beyond border security and the DACA kids, let's do comprehensive reform. We did it once. It worked pretty well \nin the Senate, but the House blocked it. Let's go back to it. First, the issues at hand are the DACA kids and border \nsecurity. That is the only thing that can pass this Chamber--the only thing. We need to push through to the finish \nline. There are only 2 days of debate remaining this week. Everyone has to make a final effort to reach consensus. \nThat doesn't mean adding new demands or drawing lines in the sand. It means being willing to compromise and \ntake yes for an answer. If we pass something, it might not be everything that either the Democrats want or \neverything that the Republicans want, but it may get the job done for the Dreamers and the overwhelming majority \nof Americans who would like to see them stay in the country. Republican Tax Bill Mr. President, on another matter--\ntaxes--our Republican friends argued that their massive corporate tax cut was not such a huge giveaway to \ncorporate America. They predicted that corporations would spend the tax savings on benefits for workers. The \nevidence is already mounting that those predictions were wrong. Since the passage of the Republican tax bill, \ncorporations have been pouring billions of dollars into stock repurchasing programs, not into significant wage \nincreases or other meaningful investments in workers. These stock buybacks--this stock repurchasing--which \nbenefit, primarily, the people at the top have reached a significant milestone. Since the passage of the Republican \ntax bill, there have been over $100 billion in stock buybacks. As of last week, corporations had announced twice \nthe number of corporate share buybacks as during a similar period last year. Let me repeat that. The number of \ncorporate share buybacks has doubled since the Republican tax bill passed. Why is that so significant? It is that \nshare buybacks don't help the average worker. They inflate the value of a company's stock, which primarily benefits \nshareholders, not workers. It benefits corporate executives, who are compensated with corporate stock, not \nworkers, who are paid by wages and benefits. The money corporations spend on repurchasing their stock is money \nthat is not being reinvested in worker training, equipment, research, new hires, or higher salaries. According to \nanalysts at Morgan Stanley, companies that were surveyed said they will pass only 13 percent of the Trump tax cut \nsavings on to workers in comparison to 43 percent that they will spend on share buybacks. For manufacturers, it is \neven worse: 9 percent to go to workers, 47 percent to share buybacks. The Republicans made a conscious \ndecision to give corporations and the wealthiest Americans the lion's share [[Page S933]] of the tax cuts and \npromised it would trickle down to everyone else. Unfortunately, trickle-down never works, and it is not what is \nhappening now. Corporate America is doing what is best for corporate America, and working America is getting left \nbehind. It goes to show you just who President Trump and the Republicans were working for when they crafted their \ntax bill. They gave corporations and the wealthiest Americans a huge tax cut and cut out everybody else. I yield the \nfloor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is \nimmigration week in the U.S Senate, and we are preparing today's procedural moves to bring bills to the floor for \nconsideration as early as today, perhaps tomorrow at the latest. It is an unusual time when the Senate is focused \non such an issue and actual bipartisan amendments and substitutes are being offered. We are at this point at this \nmoment in time because of a decision by President Trump on September 5 of last year when he announced he was \nending the DACA Program. DACA was a program created by President Obama by Executive order, which allowed \nthose who had been brought to the United States as children, infants, and toddlers to be able to stay legally in the \nUnited States on a temporary visa renewable every 2 years. It was called DACA, and 780,000 young people \nstepped up and paid the filing fee of almost $500, went through a criminal background check and an interview and \nreceived DACA protection. They then went on with their lives, with 90 percent of them going to work or to school, \nenlisting in the military--undocumented in America, willing to hold up their hands and take an oath that they would \ndie for America. That is how much they love this country. Twenty thousand of them went to work as school teachers \n\n\n\nacross the United States of America. Perhaps they are teaching your children or grandchildren today. They are \ndoing important things in this country. But President Trump announced last September 5 that the program that \nprotects them and allows them to work will end. Then he challenged us. He said to the Senate and the House: Do \nsomething about it. Pass a law. Isn't that what you are there for? The President is right. That is our job. This week \nwe are going to try to pass a law to end this crisis, which is going to reach a head on March 5 of this year when the \nDACA Program officially ends and 1,000 young people a day lose their protection. We have less than 3 weeks. So \nwe are going to move today, I hope, or tomorrow or this week, at some point to consider some alternatives to solve \nthis problem. I am sorry to say that there is no plan in the U.S House of Representatives to even address the \nproblem--none. I don't understand it. They know that lives hang in the balance, and they know that overwhelmingly \nthe American people want to give DACA and the Dreamers a chance. The numbers come rolling in; 75, 80, 85 \npercent of Americans agree that these young people should be given a chance to earn their way to legal status and \ncitizenship. Even 60 percent of those who voted for President Trump agree with what I just said. It is a popular \npolitical issue on both sides, and it also is the right thing to do. What the President has proposed as his alternative, \nfrom my point of view, is unacceptable. Let me tell you why. Two weeks ago the White House released a one-page \nframework on immigration reform and border security. The White House claimed that this is a compromise \nbecause it includes a path to citizenship for Dreamers--some of them. That, of course, as I mentioned, is supported \nby a majority of Americans. The reality is that the Trump plan would put the administration's entire hard-line \nimmigration agenda on the backs of these young people. These young, DACA-protected people are being held as \npolitical hostages for President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda. For example, the White House wants to \ndramatically reduce legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from sponsoring their parents, siblings, and \nchildren as immigrants. We are talking about literally millions of relatives of American citizens who entered this \nsystem legally and are following our immigration laws. Some have been waiting for as long as 20 years to \nimmigrate to the United States. The conservative Cato Institute says the following about President Trump's \nproposal: In the most likely scenario, the new plan [from the Trump administration] would cut the number of legal \nimmigrants by up to 44 percent or a half million immigrants annually--the largest policy-driven immigration cut \nsince the 1920s. Compared to current law, it would exclude nearly 22 million people from the opportunity to \nimmigrate legally to the United States over the next five decades. You have to go back in history to a time when \nthere was a proposal that passed on the floor of this Chamber that cut as many legal immigrants to the United \nStates. The year was 1924. Calvin Coolidge was President of the United States. We had just seen the end of World \nWar I. There was a growing fear that because of all of the damage that was done in Europe, Europeans would \ncome to the United States. There was also a concern that the wrong people were coming to the United States, in \nthe eyes of some of the Members of Congress. The Immigration Act of 1924 passed, and it set quotas for \ncountries, and it set quotas for people. It was expressly designed to exclude certain people from around the world \nfrom entering the United States of America. It was a notorious piece of legislation. Those who were to be excluded \nfrom America included people from Italy, Eastern Europe, Japan, Asia, and Jewish people. That was the \nimmigration policy of the United States of America because of that bill in 1924. That is the last time this Chamber \nhas made such a dramatic cut in legal immigration to America. It was a source of embarrassment for decades. \nThe United States established quotas and said: We want America to look a lot different than it would look if other \nimmigrants came to this country. Thankfully, in 1965, it was changed. Thankfully, we gave up the quotas that had \nbeen criticized roundly as being insensitive to the realities of the world population and the reality of the population of \nAmerica. Now the Trump administration wants to cut legal immigration to the United States again, by 44 percent, \nthe biggest cut--as the Cato Institute tells us--since that horrible bill was passed in 1924. Let me tell you what else \nthe Trump immigration proposal would do. It would create an unaccountable slush fund of $25 billion of American \ntaxpayers' money for a border wall that, as I remember correctly, Mexico was supposed to pay for--$25 billion. I \nhave to double check, but I think that is almost the annual appropriation for the National Institutes of Health. The \nPresident wants $25 billion and wants no strings attached. He wants to be able to spend it where, when, and how \nhe wants. That is an invitation for fraud and waste. It is an invitation for money to be spent for something other than \nits purpose. It is an invitation for taxpayers to be the ultimate losers with this slush fund for President Trump's \nfamous Mexican wall. The President's proposal on immigration, in the midst of the worst refugee crisis on record in \nthe world, is now calling for fast-track deportations without due process of women and children fleeing gang and \nsexual violence. I can't tell you how many times we have had this conversation with members of the Trump \nadministration. They create a scenario. The scenario is of a 6-year-old child who is swooped up in some Central \nAmerican country. The parents give thousands of dollars, their life savings, to a smuggler who says: I will get this \n\n\n\nchild to the border of the United States. The child is then taken off by the smuggler in a car or truck or bus to the \nborder. The child then comes out of the car, is pointed toward one of our Federal employees with the Border Patrol, \nand the child walks up and hands a piece of paper to the Border Patrol agent with the name of someone in the \nUnited States. That process then unfolds, and the child ultimately, in many cases, ends up with that relative while a \ndecision is made about the status of the child. Is there exploitation in this system? You bet there is. Is there abuse \nin this system? For sure. Is there actual human trafficking taking place? Yes. [[Page S934]] Are atrocities committed \nagainst these children in the course of this journey? All true. Should we be dedicated to cleaning this up? Sign me \nup, on a bipartisan basis. Let me tell you another scenario, another story that has a different origin than turning \nover a child to a smuggler. Let me tell you about cases we know of in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala \nwhere, because of the rampant crime, gang activity, and violence that takes place, parents, desperate to save their \nchildren--some of whom have daughters who have been victims of rape by these gangs--send them to the United \nStates in the hope that they can save their lives. They show up at the border, having lived in fear of this violence in \ntheir countries, and they are accepted into the United States to determine whether that fear can be established in a \nhearing. These are two different cases--a little child being exploited by a smuggler, a young girl escaping violence \nand perhaps death because her parents have nowhere to turn to save her life. Should we treat them both the \nsame? I don't think so. Historically, we have said that when it comes to asylum seekers, who come to this country \nwith a credible fear for their own lives, the United States has given them a chance to be protected. We have said \nthat over and over again. We said it to the Cubans who were escaping Fidel Castro. We have said it to the Soviet \nJews who wanted to have freedom of religion and came to the United States, believing this was the only chance \nthey had in the world. The Trump immigration proposal does not make a clear distinction on those two cases. In \nfact, what it does is end up with fast-track deportations without due process. Accepting the Trump approach will \nliterally return many of these folks who have come to our border to harm and in some cases death. There are fast-\ntrack deportations in the Trump proposal without due process for millions who have overstayed their visas. An \nestimated 40 percent of the 11 million undocumented fit in this category. So even if they have no criminal record, \nwithout considering their legal claims to remain in the United States, they would be deported. It dramatically cuts \nimmigration from sub-Saharan African countries. We have a diversity visa program. It is far from perfect, but it is a \nprogram that was created years ago, so countries that do not have an opportunity to send people to the United \nStates for legal immigration would have a chance. Immigrants who come from these countries are limited in \nnumber. They have to go through the background checks, criminal background checks, biometric investigations--all \nof the investigations and interviews that we would expect in order to make sure we do everything humanly possible \nto cull out those who would be any danger to the United States. They face that same scrutiny, and they should. \nMany of them are rejected. They can't make the case for their lives and what they have done with them, and they \nare not given a chance to come. The President wants to eliminate the diversity visa program. For those living in \nsub-Saharan African countries, huge countries, about 12,000 to 15,000 come to the United States each year \nthrough this program. By eliminating this program, the Trump administration sadly is going to deny those \nimmigrants from Africa even a chance to apply for this opportunity. In the past, many Democrats have been willing \nto support some of the President's proposals, changes in our immigration system, eliminating the diversity visa \nlottery, but when we made that offer 5 years ago, it was part of comprehensive immigration reform with give and \ntake and compromise that tried to make sense out of senseless immigration laws. In 2013, a Democratic-led \nSenate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. The bill was a \nproduct of months of negotiations, with committee and floor debate. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives refused to even consider the bill. Now we are being asked to accept the administration's \nproposal with no conditions, no compromise, no give and take; rather, take it or leave it. Democrats have shown \nthey want to comprehensively fix our broken immigration system, but right now we have to fix our focus on the \nDACA crisis created by President Trump with his announcement of September 5. That has to be our priority. In the \nnext day or two, we expect the so-called Grassley proposal, which is the Trump immigration plan, to come to the \nfloor. I want to say for the record, Democrats support comprehensive immigration reform, but we will not stand by \nand a\n\nllow Dreamers to be held political hostage to the administration's entire immigration agenda. I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior \nassistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \n\n\n\nordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor out of great concern for America's Dreamers, whose \nfutures hinge on the ability of this body to keep its word and get something done. I want to be clear whom we are \ntalking about when we talk about Dreamers. We aren't talking about criminals. We aren't talking about terrorists. We \naren't talking about ``bad hombres.'' We are talking about kids as American as apple pie. As I often say, the only \ncountry they call home is the United States. The only flag they pledge allegiance to is that of the American flag. The \nonly national anthem they know how to sing is the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' We are talking about 800,000 young \npeople who were brought to this country as children and were able to obtain legal protection under the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. These kids put enormous faith in our government. They \ncame out of the shadows, they passed background checks, and they registered with our government--all to get a 2-\nyear renewable work permit and protection from deportation. Even the Cato Institute, which is a conservative think \ntank, says that deporting Dreamers--91 percent of whom are gainfully employed-- would hurt America's economy. \nAt the same time, we are also talking about thousands of additional Dreamers who were eligible for DACA but didn't \napply. Some couldn't afford the cost and others were still working through the lengthy application process. These \nare the Dreamers the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called lazy asses. Well, Mr. Kelly, here is what you \ndon't understand: The reason they didn't apply is not because they were lazy. In fact, in many cases, they didn't \napply because they were afraid--afraid of people like you. They were afraid that if they came out of the shadows \nand registered with the government, they would end up on a short list for deportation. What is depressing is that this \nadministration's actions have proven them right. Now DACA recipients and undocumented Dreamers alike fear they \nhave a target on their back, and that is because President Trump put an expiration date on their dreams when he \ndecided to end DACA. Now, let me be clear, DACA was never perfect, and it was never a replacement for truly \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Make no mistake, we still need comprehensive immigration reform, and I am \ncommitted as ever to that cause--a cause I have spent the better part of my congressional career trying to achieve. \nI was a member of the Gang of 8 in the Senate back in 2013 when a bipartisan supermajority in the Senate passed \nthe most historic reforms to our immigration system since the days of President Ronald Reagan, only to die in the \nHouse of Representatives without even a vote, but that debate is for another day. That debate is for what President \nTrump called phase 2. This week, we are not here to debate comprehensive immigration reform. We are not here \nto debate the numerous types of visas that exist under U.S law. We are not here to debate how mayors run their \ncities or how police officers do their jobs. We are here to protect Dreamers. We are here to address a crisis that \nPresident Trump started last September when he ended DACA. That is what this week's debate [[Page S935]] is all \nabout--it is about protecting hard-working, upstanding Dreamers across America from being deported to countries \nthey haven't stepped foot in since they were in diapers. Now, many of my colleagues have met Dreamers from their \nStates in recent years, and they know the lion's share of these kids can't even remember coming here--only \ngrowing up here. For the Dreamers who do remember arriving here, they certainly didn't arrive through any decision \nof their own. They were babies, toddlers, and very young children, and I challenge my colleagues to think of any \ndecision of consequence they made when they were babies, toddlers, and very young children. I bet you didn't \ndecide what town you lived in, where your parents worked, or what kind of status you had. When we talk about \nDreamers, we are talking about kids who have grown up American in every sense of the word. We are talking about \n22,000 New Jerseyans like Parthiv Patel, who came to New Jersey from India when he was 5 years old. He gained \nDACA status in 2012. He graduated from Drexel Law School in 2016, and he became the first Dreamer admitted to \nthe New Jersey Bar in 2018. We are also talking about students like Christopher Rios Martine, a constituent of mine \nwho came here from Colombia at the age of 2. Today he is a junior at Rutgers University with a 3.74 GPA. He is \npresident of the Management Information Systems Association, and he is interning at Colgate-Palmolive. \nChristopher said: ``I am proud to be a DACA recipient and I plan on contributing as much to this country as I \npossibly can.'' As another Dreamer from New Jersey, Sara Mora, recently wrote: Without DACA her life has \nbecome ``one big question mark''--the question of whether this Congress will act. Will we protect Dreamers who \nhave become integral to our communities, many who are teaching in our schools, who are treating our patients, \nwho are serving proudly in the military of the United States--many are wearing the uniform of the United States, \nrisking their lives on behalf of our country, and yet we talk about deporting them--and many who are starting \nfamilies of their own? That is right. Nearly one-quarter of DACA recipients are the parents of U.S -born American \nchildren. That is whom we are talking about this week. We are not talking about criminals. We are not talking about \nterrorists. We are not talking about gangbangers or drug dealers. We are talking about Dreamers. They are not \nundocumented immigrants, from my perspective; they are undocumented Americans who have proven themselves \nworthy of the American dream. Yet the administration slapped an arbitrary expiration date on their dream, creating a \n\n\n\ncrisis that Congress needs to solve. I took President Trump at his word when he said he wanted to treat Dreamers \nwith heart, just as I took Leader McConnell at his word when he said this week would be about protecting them from \ndeportation. Now, as I listen to many of my Republican colleagues on the Senate floor, I am hearing less and less \nabout Dreamers and more and more about spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall President Trump \npromised Mexico would pay for. Considering the Trump administration's own report noting that illegal border \ncrossings from Mexico have dropped to their lowest level in nearly 50 years, you have to question the wisdom of a \nmultibillion-dollar wall--a wall between the United States and a country that serves as our second largest export \nmarket in the world for American goods and services, as Mexican consumers and businesses buy American goods \nand services that support jobs created here at home. Likewise, I am hearing a whole lot about politically loaded \nterms like ``merit-based immigration'' and ``chain migration.'' These aren't terms you find in our laws. They are \npolitical catchphrases designed to incite fear and push policies that forever change how legal immigration works in \nthe United States. The more insidious, of course, is the term ``chain migration.'' I am appalled when I hear my \ncolleagues talking about chain migration, just like I am appalled that the media--even the so-called liberal media--\nhas adopted this phrase as if it is actually a legitimate term, and I can't be the only one who thinks the term ``chain \nmigration'' is downright insulting to the millions of Americans whose ancestors were actually brought to this country \nin chains. Now, I have heard a lot about family values from my Republican colleagues throughout my time in \nCongress. The Republican Party has long claimed to be the party of so-called family values. Well, ``chain \nmigration'' is a term that dehumanizes families. When we want to dehumanize something, we create an inanimate \nobject, but this chain is about a mother and a father and a son and a daughter. It is not an inanimate object, but it is \na dehumanizing term. It is a term designed to make our system of legal immigration and family reunification sound \nthreatening and illogical, but there is nothing threatening about uniting mothers and fathers, and there is nothing \nmore common sense than uniting brothers and sisters and sons and daughters. They are not linked by chains. They \nare bound by blood and held together by love. Families are the essence of American values in our society. Families \nare the glue that builds strong communities--the foundation of our country. Yet some of my Republican colleagues \nact as if the nuclear family is a concept that has an expiration date. Well, I loved my daughter since the day she was \nborn and the day she turned 21 and the day she turned 30, the same as I do my son. I didn't love them less with \neach passing year. I don't love them any less now that they have gotten married; in fact, I love them more. So \nAmericans need to know that when Republicans speak of ending chain migration, they are talking about ending the \nlegal right of U.S citizens to legally sponsor family members in our immigration system. It is not chain migration; it \nis family reunification. That is what America is all about. That is what immigration policy for the past century has \nbeen about--keeping families together, not tearing them apart. The reality is, most Americans are, in some ways, \nthe beneficiary of family reunification. Without it, our country would be a very different place. End family \nreunification, and we would never have seen the leadership of individuals like Colin Powell, a general and Secretary \nof State. That is right. His parents wouldn't have been able to come here without the big bad chain migration that \nmy colleagues in the majority decry today. End family reunification and suddenly billion-dollar American technology \ncompanies like Kingston Technology would have never existed. Before John Tu was a billion-dollar businessman, \nhe was a self- described mediocre student from China. He would have never come to America if it were not for the \nsponsorship of his U.S citizen sister. He wasn't skilled when he got here, and yet he built a groundbreaking \ncompany. So let's get real. When President Trump professes his support for merit-based immigration, he doesn't \nhave a real plan for allowing a million engineers and inventors from around the world to come to the United States. \nHe is talking about cutting legal immigration by nearly 50 percent. That is a policy with disastrous implications for \nthe future of this country when you consider basic economic facts. Any credible economist will tell you that without \nsteady immigration, America's global competitiveness will suffer, and we will fall far behind much larger countries \nlike China, Pakistan, and India. According to a Forbes magazine article, even President Donald Trump is a product \nof chain migration. That is right. Friedrich Trump, Donald Trump's grandfather, was able to come to the United \nStates from Germany, with no English-speaking ability and no merit-based skills. Why? Because his sister was \nalready in the United States and claimed him as part of family reunification. You get to be President of the United \nStates because of chain migration. If Republicans were being honest, they would call their term of ``chain \nmigration'' what it really is. They would call it family reunification, but they don't want to call it family reunification \nbecause they don't want to own up to their intention, which is to strip U.S citizens of the right to sponsor their \nbrothers and sisters, mothers [[Page S936]] and fathers, and adult children as immigrants. I ask my colleagues to \nplease give it a rest. If you want to have a debate about the merits of our immigration system, we can have that \ndebate, but that debate over comprehensive immigration reform is not the debate we should have this week. This \n\n\n\ndebate is about whether we will do right by American Dreamers, about whether we will listen to the voices of the \nAmerican people who overwhelmingly want us to solve this crisis. According to the latest polls out this week from \nQuinnipiac University, 81 percent of Americans support giving Dreamers a path to citizenship. Yet, week after week, \nmonth after month, Dreamers have languished in uncertainty. Republicans didn't let us protect them in September \nor October or November or December or January. Yet, throughout all this time wasted, I hear my colleagues in the \nmajority say such nice things about Dreamers--how talented they are, how hopeful they are, how important they \nare. I say to them today that it is getting harder and harder to take your commitment to Dreamers seriously when, at \nevery opportunity you have to do something, you do nothing. Instead, it is beginning to look like President Trump--\nthe person responsible for ending DACA--has enablers in Congress who have been intent on deporting Dreamers \nfrom day one. If that is not the case, now is the time to prove it because March 5 is just around the corner. Come \nMarch, America's Dreamers will see their dreams extinguished, replaced with deportation orders to nations they \nhave never called home. So far, there are 19,000 already out of status, and after March 5, there will be 1,000 a day. \nIf my colleagues want to have a debate about comprehensive immigration reform, we can have that debate some \nother time but not today, not this week, not until we protect Dreamers living in fear of deportation due to President \nTrump's reckless decisions--a President who once said about Dreamers that ``we're going to work something out \nthat is going to make people happy and proud.'' Well, the polls show deporting Dreamers will not make Americans \nhappy and proud. The time for talk is over. The time for kind words is over. The time for excuses is over. So, this \nweek, Congress needs to take action. It is time we let America see who stands with Dreamers and who is complicit \nin their potential deportation. These young men and women have shown incredible courage and strength in the face \nof adversity and uncertainty. They were handed a crisis, and they created a movement. They shared their stories \nand their dreams, and, in doing so, they have captured the hearts of the American people. I urge my colleagues in \nthe Senate not to break America's heart because our hearts are bigger as a country and our future is brighter when \nDreamers in this country stay right where they belong. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). \nThe Senator from North Carolina. Valentine's Day Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to talk about \nthe immigration debate we are going to have here. Before I do that, though, I want to recognize that this is \nValentine's Day. I happen to be several hundred miles away from my sweetheart, but I want to wish my wife a \nhappy Valentine's Day. I made her a little card. I am sure I probably just violated a rule, but I don't think anybody \ncan fire me. I want my wife to know I love her and wish I was with her. Now, Mr. President, I want to talk a little \nabout immigration reform. We just heard a discussion. I tell you, sometimes I think I teleport from this Chamber to \nthe Kennedy Center because there are more theatrics going on here than you can find down there on any given \nday. Let me give you one example of that. The whole indignant position that the Member from New Jersey just had \non ``chain migration'' and somehow that mean Republicans came up with this term because we wanted to make a \npoint. Demographers came up with this term decades ago. People on the other side of the aisle even have \nreferences to chain migration in bills they proposed. End the theatrics. Solve this problem. Let's talk about the \nPresident's framework. I was presiding just before I got up here. I heard the word ``hard-line'' used--the hard- line \ndemand of President Trump. I don't agree with everything President Trump has done. In fact, I said a year and a \nhalf ago--and I got criticized for it--that when you sit down and talk border patrol and talk homeland security, you are \ngoing to find out you don't need a large, monolithic wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. After the \nPresident was elected and after he got into office, he listened to homeland security and border patrol, and he came \nup with a plan that isn't a long, monolithic wall across the southern border. It is a strategic plan that actually lets us \nimprove the security of the homeland along the northern and southern borders. It is a plan that tries to confiscate \ntons of drugs that are poisoning Americans in the tens of thousands of every year. It is a plan that makes sure gang \nmembers are more likely to be incarcerated when they cross the border illegally and less likely to go into the very \ncommunities that many of the people who immigrate to this country go into. It is a plan to make those communities \nsafer. It is a plan to make sure we know the thousands of people that cross the border illegally are not carrying illicit \ndrugs in a truck or car or a wheel well, the way they do it today, because it is using technology to be able to search \nmore vehicles to make sure our homeland is safe. It is also a plan that shows more compassion than President \nObama's DACA plan. Right now, they are saying: Let's keep DACA going. Well, there are 690,000 people who are \nin DACA. Their future is uncertain because it is an Executive order. It doesn't have the force of law. It could possibly \nbe challenged by the court. The President decided on September 15 of last year, Congress do your job. You have \nbeen talking about immigration reform for two decades. We have an arguably illegal Executive order by President \nObama that President Trump kept in place for about a year, and then he said: I am going to give you all 6 months to \ndo your job and come up with something that has enduring value. The DACA proposal only provided the illegally \n\n\n\npresent persons who came to this country--through the decisions of an adult--some certainty that they wouldn't be \ndeported. It doesn't give them any certainty in terms of a path to citizenship. People said the President has a hard- \nline plan. DACA allows 690,000 people who signed up for it to be here and, hopefully, not have that decision thrown \nout by the courts or have the President rescind it. What we just heard from three or four Members on the other side \nof the aisle is that the President's hard-line plan is to have nearly three times as many people with a path to \ncitizenship, not a piece of paper that hopefully will be in place for the time you spend in the United States but \ncitizenship. So the President's hard-line plan actually legalizes about two and a half times as many people, not to \njust let them be here present, to have legal status but have a path to citizenship. That is hard-line? I am not sure the \nPresident was there when he was running for office, but he listened. He recognizes he wants to be the President \nwho gets something done, and he is willing to accept the criticism from people on my side of the aisle who may not \nsupport a path to citizenship. I do, and the President does. I find it remarkable that somebody would say a \nPresident, who has endorsed a bill to provide a path to citizenship to 1.8 million people--two and a half times more \nthan President Obama provided a temporary and passing status to--is hard-line. Border security. Why is border \nsecurity important? Is it just purely a hard-line deportation force sending people out? No. I already talked about, No. \n1, hundreds of millions of doses of heroin, fentanyl, and other illicit drugs come across our border every year. We \nsimply do not have the people, technology, and infrastructure to interdict them. Of the $25 billion, about $18 billion \nof it would be spent for border security. About 10 percent to 15 percent [[Page S937]] of that is on the northern \nborder. The remainder is on the southern border. Some of that will be spent on wall structures. When all is said and \ndone, less than half of the 2,300 miles will have a wall structure. The rest will be spent on training additional \npersonnel. If you have ever gone to a border crossing, you know the long lines they have there. This is actually \ncreating technology that has low-intensity x rays where you could drive a vehicle through. The Border Patrol folks \ncan identify human smugglers, human traffickers, and drug smugglers without ever having the person get out of the \ncar. That is what the border security plan is focused on as well. There are wall structures where they make sense. \nThey don't make sense along about half of the border. Let me tell you about the humanitarian case for this, which I \nfind remarkable no one on the other side of the aisle will bring up. I went to Texas last year. I went along the \nsouthern border. I was on the Rio Grande, on the Border Patrol boats, on horseback, and at night I took ATVs \naround. I heard a lot of stories by a lot of people, including property owners. Over the last 20 years, 10,000 people \nhave died trying to cross our border on U.S soil. We have no earthly idea how many tens of thousands of people die \njust trying to get there. So 10,000 people died over the last 20 years because we didn't know where they were. \nThey were on American soil, but we didn't know where they were. About 1,000 of them were children. If that is not a \ncase for needing to know who is crossing the border and where they are--even if they may get deported if they don't \nhave a legitimate claim to asylum but have this threat to their safety--then I don't know what else is. I don't see how \nborder security is hard-line when you look at the facts--not the theater but the facts. I think that second pillar of the \nPresident's proposal is balanced. It is less than what he originally wanted, but it makes sense, and it shows a lot of \nmovement on his part. Again, two and a half times the number of people are actually getting a path to citizenship--\nmore than the DACA Executive order proposed--and it has border security that makes sense and is no longer this \nidea of a monolithic wall. We heard somebody say there is a dramatic cut to legal immigration; that the promise we \nmade to everybody who is in line because of a family relationship is going to be broken. That is utter nonsense. \nThere is no proposal like that on the table. The fact is, there are about 3.9 million people in the backlog who, if the \nPresident's proposal is accepted, will get to this country in half the time it takes today. There are about 3.9 million \npeople waiting to come to this country because of a family relationship who we have proposed--that the President \nhas proposed--should be able to get here sooner. The diversity lottery is also something, I think, people have been \nmisled or they are trying to mislead you. I will leave it to you to decide. The diversity lottery is not ending. This \nactually comes up with a reasonable way to use those 50,000 green cards in a way that lets us draw down the \nbacklog sooner--instead of having somebody wait 17 years or 20 years to get into the country, maybe 8 or 9, but \nthen it is also with a focus on the underrepresented countries. There are many countries in Africa--about 15,000--\nthat we would like to make sure they have an opportunity every year to come to this country. They are from an \nunderrepresented country. We have already made proposals that said we are open to other proposals to make that \nbe a part of how the diversity lottery gets settled. So 50,000 will continue to come. When we say we are ending the \ndiversity lottery, we are not saying we will end the entry of 50,000 people; we are talking about modernizing it. The \nlast time we did any major immigration bill, I was 5 years old. I think it is about time to look at how the world has \nchanged and maybe open your eyes and open your hearts to a better way to do it that benefits the person trying to \ncome to this country and benefits our country as a result of their entry. I think it can be a win-win. The last thing on \n\n\n\nchain migration is, I want to go back and find everybody who voted for bills in the past, and they voted for a bill \nwith legislative language in it that referred to chain migration. I am sick of that kind of garbage on the Senate floor. \nThat is just misleading. Chain migration is just a process that has been used in the past--not only by our country but \nother countries--to kind of link people together. I am absolutely sympathetic with some of the things the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey said, but to say that this is some hateful, divisive term is not paying a whole lot of attention to your \njob. I have only been here 3 years. Many of these people who are here voted for language that had chain migration \nin it, and now they are saying it is something the hateful folks in our marketing departments created to be divisive. \nThat is just untrue. Now the last thing. When we are talking about legal immigration in this country--we immigrate \nabout 1 million to 1.1 million people a year to this country. I don't have a problem with that number. If I had \nMembers on the other side of the aisle, some of my colleagues, say, ``Thom, we want to try to maintain that same \namount of immigration over time,'' I would say that I am open to it. Some of my colleagues I have worked with on \nthis bill may not be. But the way we go about doing it needs to be modernized. How many times have I heard that \nwhen we have a foreign national here who graduates with an engineering degree or some degree in STEM, that we \nshould just staple a green card to the back of their diploma--how many times have we heard that?--because we \nneed high-end workers. We need welders. We need carpenters. We need plumbers. We need people to come to \nthis country to fill jobs, or at some point, our economic growth is going to be limited by the number of resources we \nhave for those jobs. Our unemployment is going down. The demand for the workers is there. But we have an \nimmigration system where about three-fourths of everybody who comes to this country comes purely because of a \nfamily relationship. I bet that if we dig into it, many of them actually could qualify on the basis of merit, but right now, \nit is just a random selection that doesn't really tie to our needs as a nation and for our economic growth or for our \neconomic security. I believe that if we get the immigration policy right, over the next 10 years, we will be building a \ncase to have more legal immigration here, more than the 1 million or 1.1 million, but if we don't fix this, we are not \ngoing to fix the underlying problem with our immigration system. I actually didn't plan on speaking. I just grabbed a \ncouple of these slides so that I could talk about it. But it is very important to me for us to--I don't like being a part of \nan organization that talks a lot and doesn't get anything done, and over the last 17 years, that is all these folks have \nbeen doing. They say: Reelect me. I promise you that next year, I will get immigration reform done. Next year, I \nwill file the Dream Act, and we will get it done. Well, guess what. It hasn't gotten done under a Republican \nadministration. President Bush was sympathetic to this issue. He couldn't get it done. Congress couldn't get it done. \nPresident Obama comes in and says: I am going to fix immigration. President Obama had the votes to pass \nObamaCare. There was a time in this Chamber when not a single Republican vote was necessary to pass a bill out \nof here, right? So if you don't need a single Republican vote in Congress, on the House or the Senate side, why \ndidn't you get it done? Because I don't think you have taken the time to construct something that makes sense, that \nis compassionate, that is responsible, and that will have the enduring value of law. So now is the time to get it done, \nand the only way we are going to get it done is with bipartisan cooperation. If you don't like some of the elements \nof the President's framework and you set a hammer to it, fold your hands, and say: If you will not vote on mine, I will \nnot vote on yours--look at this and tell us how we can improve it. Tell us what we need to do to get a vote. Tell us \nwhat we can do to moderate this. To call this a hardline bill is absurd. It is theatrics. It is the kind of stuff that has \nprevented us from getting things done for the last 17 years. I hope people will have an honest discussion and \ndebate. I hope people will come down here, offer all the amendments they want to, and I hope they [[Page S938]] \nwill be mature enough, if they fail, to move on to the next one because I, for one, want to provide certainty to the \nDACA population. I say to the Presiding Officer, you know better than I because you are in the Marine Reserves. \nThere are 900 people serving in the military today--that is more than a battalion, right? We have more than 900 \nDACA recipients serving in the military. I want to file this bill. I want to get this bill to the President's desk and say \nto them: Welcome to this country. Thank you for your service. I can't wait to go to your ceremony where you swear \nthe oath as an American citizen. That is what we can do this week. But I guarantee you, anybody who sits here and \nsays that the President's proposal is unfair and insincere and hardline is playing politics. It makes me wonder if \nsome of them would just as soon have this be the ``if you elect me next year, I promise I will fix this problem'' \ncampaign speech versus take this off the table, provide them certainty, and do something different for a change. \nFinally, I started by wishing my wife a happy Valentine's Day. When I get into these speeches--I worked in business \nmost of my career. I haven't been in politics very long. I get very frustrated with the lack of production and with the \nlack of results. But, Sweetie, I am not mad. I just get a little bit intense when I talk about an issue where the solution \nis within reach. I am not mad. I am frustrated with the Members of the U.S Senate who don't see the opportunity to \nseize this moment and get it done. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity. I probably went long, and I \n\n\n\napologize to anybody else who may be waiting to speak. But this is the week to get it done. This is the Congress to \nget it done. This is the President who has given us a historic opportunity. I hope we seize the day. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. \nPresident, the Senate is debating the fate of our Nation's Dreamers this week. Everywhere I go, people recognize \nthe uncontestable truth that underpins our discussion: We are all a nation of immigrants. Unless you are Native \nAmerican, you come from a line of people who come from somewhere else. More than in any other country on \nEarth, this simple fact is a defining characteristic of our national identity. Throughout our history, immigrant \ncommunities have greatly enriched our Nation; their individual stories have become the American story. Out of \nmany, we have become one. My maternal grandparents emigrated from Italy, began a business, hired a lot of \npeople, and were pillars of the community. My wife's parents emigrated from French-speaking Canada and also \nowned a business. She was born in Vermont. Yesterday, we buried my wife's uncle, an immigrant from Canada \nwho started off as an $8-a-week clerk at a shoe store. He was buried with honors at the age of 100 yesterday, and \npeople talked about the $20 million or $30 million he has given to philanthropic causes in Vermont--this $8-a-week \nimmigrant clerk at a shoe store. I think sometimes we forget who we are. In the late 1800s we passed laws \nexcluding Chinese immigrants. During World War II, we turned away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust--turned \nthem away at the shores of our country--and many went back to die in the gas chambers. We know today that these \nwere tragic mistakes, fueled by our own ill-informed, xenophobic rhetoric. Mistakes were made, but they must never \nbe repeated. Yet now, in 2018, I am concerned that we are hearing echoes of past mistakes. Anti-immigrant voices, \narmed with the same shameful fearmongering, are attempting a comeback in our country. In recent months, \nDreamers have been regularly disparaged. Some have even suggested that Dreamers pose a risk of terrorism or \nhave links to international drug trafficking. These absurd depictions would be laughable if they weren't so damaging, \nespecially to those of us who remember one of the biggest terrorist attacks on our country, in Oklahoma City by \nTimothy McVeigh, who was not an immigrant; he grew up there and was born there. Thankfully, most Americans \nknow better. Dreamers are not threats to our national security; not a single one--not a single one--has been \nsuspected of terrorist activities. Nor do Dreamers present a threat to public safety. Far from it. By definition, \nDreamers are law-abiding strivers who seek only to contribute to our country. Brought here as children, Dreamers \nare now our neighbors, our first responders, our teachers, our medical personnel. Nearly 1,000 have served in our \nArmed Forces, risking their lives to defend the only country they have ever known as home. I will never forget one \nDreamer who wrote to me last year. Dr. Juan Conde is a DACA recipient. He is a resident of Vermont. He was born \nin Mexico and brought to the United States as a young child by his mother. In 2007, tragically, his mother died of \ncancer. Showing remarkable courage and determination for a young man, Dr. Conde was motivated by this \npersonal tragedy to help cancer patients like his mother. He ultimately obtained a Ph.D in cancer research from the \nUniversity of Texas. But as accomplished as he already was, Dr. Conde was not satisfied with just studying cancer. \nHe wanted to treat the people suffering with and battling the disease. Every one of us in this Chamber knows \nsomebody who has suffered from and battled cancer, and many have died. But only after he enrolled in DACA was \nDr. Conde able to attend medical school, and he is currently doing that. He is studying oncology at the University of \nVermont's Larner College of Medicine. Dr. Conde hopes to spend his life in the United States treating cancer \npatients and researching to find a cure for the disease. This Vermonter--and I think all Americans would agree--\nbelieves that America is a better place with Dr. Conde in it. There are hundreds of thousands of Dreamers just like \nDr. Conde, all with the potential to contribute to our communities and to our country. To deny them these \nopportunities because they were brought here as children would be as senseless as it is cruel. We are better than \nthat. And this week, we have an opportunity to prove it. I am proud of those in the Senate, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, who are engaged in good-faith negotiations over proposals to protect our Dreamers and improve our \nborder security. I sincerely believe that we can find a path to 60 votes, and I hope the Republican leadership will let \nus. The Majority Leader's decision yesterday to seek to open up the debate with a vote on a poison pill amendment \nabout so-called sanctuary cities--which has nothing to do with either Dreamers or border security--was less than a \nhelpful start. These kinds of attempts to score political points stand in stark contrast to the bipartisan search done \nby leading Republicans and Democrats behind the scenes for a solution. As the most senior Member of this body, it \nis my hope that all Senators will focus on a bipartisan solution, not on just divisive distractions. I respect this \ninstitution as much as anybody. For 43 years, I have been here and I have seen--and I hope contributed to--the \ngood that can be accomplished. I have often said that at its best the Senate can and should serve as the \n\n\n\nconscience of the Nation. But it can only do so when we put aside our own self-interest, and we work across the \naisle in the spirit of compromise. I know we are capable of meeting this challenge today. We have done it before. \nFive years ago, when I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we brought together 68 Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and we voted for an immigration bill that provided protection for Dreamers, including \nan expedited pathway to citizenship. Unfortunately, the House, even though they had the votes to pass it, would not \nbring it up. Well, it is time now for the Senate to do so again and, this time, for the House to follow suit. President \nTrump claims he will treat Dreamers with great ``heart.'' If he meant what he said, he will certainly sign our \nbipartisan compromise that emerges. So let's get to work. The future of Dreamers-- and the fate of the [[Page \nS939]] American dream itself--lies in our hands. As I left that funeral yesterday in Vermont, I thought of my wife's \nuncle and her parents coming from Canada to make a better life, my grandparents coming from Italy, and my great \ngrandparents coming from Ireland, all to make such a mark on our little State of Vermont, all for the better. As a \nmember of that family, how proud I am to stand here on the floor of the U.S Senate, but I want to do more than just \nstand here. I want to vote for a bill to help more people like those who come to our country and to make our country \nbetter. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today a \ngroup led by Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee formally introduced a bill to address the DACA \nissue--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals issue--that we have heard so much about, as well as border \nsecurity. I think it is a good starting point, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation, which is called the \nSecure and Succeed Act. Perhaps the most important thing about this bill is that it actually has a good chance of \nbecoming law. That is because the President supports it. It encompasses the four pillars the President has laid out \nfor us in any solution to the DACA challenge. The Secure and Succeed Act provides legal status and a pathway to \ncitizenship for an estimated 1.8 million people who meet the specific criteria of DACA. This is a far larger number \nthan the number of individuals covered by President Obama's Executive order. The fact is, this President has not \nonly said to the 690,000 DACA recipients ``You are going to have a better, brighter future and a pathway to \nAmerican citizenship''; this President has also offered all of the young people eligible but who might not have \npreviously signed up that same opportunity. What an extraordinarily generous offer. This bill also provides for a real \nplan to strengthen border security, utilizing the three things that Border Patrol has always told me are essential: \nmore boots on the ground, better technology, and, yes, some infrastructure in hard-to-control locations, along with \nenhanced ports of entry. I know there has been some confusion about that. The President likes to talk about the \nwall. It is true that back in roughly 2006 or 2007, Congress called for something called the Secure Fence Act, which \ngot the support of then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and, of course, current Senator Chuck \nSchumer. They supported the Secure Fence Act, as did an overwhelming majority of Senators from both parties. \nWhen the President has talked about the wall, he has made pretty clear what he is really talking about is a barrier \nsimilar to what was supported on a bipartisan basis. He said that the Border Patrol is going to have to be able to \nsee through it. Indeed, as he has conceded, in many places it doesn't make any sense at all to have a physical \nbarrier. That is why technology and boots on the ground are so important. This legislation also reallocates visas \nfrom the diversity lottery system in a way that is fair and continues the existing, family-based categories until the \ncurrent backlog is cleared, which would take, probably, about 10 years. I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense \nsolution. But I know other colleagues have been working hard on their ideas, which I look forward to reviewing as \nthe debate continues. One group I haven't heard from much, though, is our Democratic colleagues, who literally \nshut down the government to force this debate to occur on their terms and at a time they chose. We are still trying \nto figure out--OK, you won, in a sense. I think the American people lost when you shut down the government, but \nyou made your point. You wanted a time certain and you wanted a fair process by which to present your ideas, and \nwe have been waiting--here it is Wednesday, with the clock ticking, still waiting--for that Democratic proposal. What \nis their plan? What is their proposal? Do they even have one? And if they do, why are they leaving the rest of us, as \nwell as the Nation, in the dark? As the majority leader said yesterday, we need to stop trying to score political points \nand start making law. The way to get this done is to take a proposal like the President's and get started; people can \noffer amendments to that. Whatever gets 60 votes in the Senate passes the Senate, and then it is up to the House \nto pass it, and then it is up to the President to decide whether to sign it. He has pretty much given us the outline of \nwhat he would find acceptable. Again, insofar as it grants a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, that is \nextraordinary in and of itself. The majority leader made a commitment to hold this debate and to hold it this week. \nHe has lived up to his promise, and now we can't let it all go to waste. As each minute and each hour clicks off the \n\n\n\nclock, it looks as if it is more and more likely to happen--that all of this will go to waste. The country is watching. The \nDACA recipients in my home State--all 124,000 of them--are watching and worrying, understandably anxious about \nwhat their status is going to be when this program ends on March 5. One of those DACA recipients is Julio Ramos, \na biology teacher who is getting his master's degree in biomedical informatics. He is from Brownsville, TX, right \nalong the U.S -Mexico border, and he is a DACA recipient. After his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, he \ndecided he wanted to be a doctor. He has even been accepted to Texas medical schools, but he wasn't sure \nwhether he would be allowed to attend. He is waiting and watching, worried about his future. Then there is Miriam \nSantamaria from Houston, TX. She graduated from high school in Houston with honors. She paid her way through \ncommunity college, and she works as a manager at a construction company and owns her own photography \nbusiness. She sounds like quite an entrepreneur to me. Miriam said: ``I am not looking for any kind of recognition or \nsympathy, [I'm just] looking to make a difference and inspire others.'' She is also looking to live in peace in the only \ncountry that she has ever known and calls home. She came to the United States when she was 4 years old. Finally, \nthere is a man whom I will just call by the first name of Daniel. He, too, lives in Texas. He graduated from the \nUniversity of North Texas with a degree in advertising and contributes productively to society. Daniel came from \nMexico at the age of 2, and he said: ``All the choices I make, I made as an American, because that's what I am.'' \nWe need to listen to these stories as we consider this legislation and as people are perhaps tempted into the \npolitical grandstanding and gamesmanship that, unfortunately, sometimes overwhelms our best intentions. These \nare real human lives hanging in the balance. They are important, and they teach us about the real people behind \nthe policy. But their stories are not the only ones we need to listen to. We need to listen to the stories of the men \nand women who have been waiting patiently for years to come here in a legal way through visas and green cards, \nwaiting patiently to join their families here in the United States, doing it the old-fashioned, legal way. They have had \nto wait, some for years, some for decades. We should listen to the stories of the border communities, which I am \nproud to represent in Texas, from men and women, many of whom are of Hispanic origin, who have suffered \nproperty damage from illegal immigration. Illegal immigration is a pretty ugly business when you consider that it is \nin the hands of drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations. Recently, one of the military leaders who is \nresponsible for Southern Command, which is Central America south, said that these transnational criminal \norganizations or cartels are ``commodity agnostic.'' That is the phrase he used. He said that they don't care whether \nit is people, drugs, or other contraband. What they are in it for is the money, and they are willing to do [[Page S940]] \nanything for the money. Unfortunately, victims of human trafficking know exactly what I am talking about. Despite \nthese hardships, businesses in many of the communities, like those along the border, are thriving. But we need to \ndo everything we can to make sure that continues to be the case. Sympathy for DACA recipients is right and good \nbecause, in America, we do not punish children for the mistakes of their parents, and we are not going to punish \nthese young people who are now adults and have become part of our communities. But Americans who live along \nthe border in my State realize that illegal immigration has caused real, tangible harm in terms of public safety, \nproperty damage, and their way of life. When I talk to people like Manny Padilla, the Border Patrol's sector chief for \nthe Rio Grande Valley, it is hard not to realize just how much is required and how many more resources we need to \nmaintain situational awareness and operational control along the border. I will say this: The Federal Government \nhas failed over the years to live up to its responsibility to maintain the security of our border, so taxpayers in my \nState have to step up and fill the gap left by the failure of leadership of the Federal Government. But we have an \nopportunity to fix that in this legislation, following the parameters the President has laid out for us. That is why, \nduring this week's debate, ensuring additional resources for border security is an essential piece of the puzzle. That \nincludes areas other than between our ports of entry. Mexico is one of our largest trading partners. We have \nlegitimate trade and commerce that flows back and forth across the border with Mexico and supports 5 million \nAmerican jobs. Unfortunately, the cartels have figured out how to exploit that as well. So, because of antiquated \ninfrastructure and technology at our ports of entry, many of them are vulnerable through the importation of poison--\nliterally, drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and the like--that has taken the lives of so many Americans. \nWe need to do more and better when it comes to maintaining those ports of entry--upgrading the infrastructure, \nimproving the technology--so we can interdict more of that. Again, the border is as varied as anyplace in the world, \nwith areas that are flat and open, areas that have mountains and rolling hills, rivers, obviously. Technology, as we \nhave come to see, has transformed our way of life, and technology can increasingly be the answer to supplement \nthe boots on the ground and the infrastructure that the Border Patrol thinks are necessary. There is a big difference \nbetween detecting illegal immigration in rural areas and urban ones. In urban areas, the Border Patrol tells us that \nyou might have just a few seconds before someone can cross the border and enter into the United States. In large, \n\n\n\nopen areas, there is more of a lag time, so perhaps a fence or some infrastructure is not as important; technology \nmight be more important, along with the Border Patrol agents themselves. My basic point is that border security is \ncomplex. For those who think it is as easy as one, two, three, I encourage you to do as some of my colleagues \nhave done; that is, travel to the border--we will host you--to see firsthand why it is crucial that we strengthen our \npersonnel, technology, and infrastructure. That has to be one of our priorities, and I am grateful to the President for \nmaking this one of his requirements as well. We have an opportunity to address not only the anxiety and plight of \nDACA recipients but also to make our country safer and more secure; to reform our legal immigration system in a \nway that will help us accelerate the reunification of families out of the backlog of people waiting patiently and legally \noutside of the country to come into the country through legal immigration; and to address the President's concern \nabout the roll of the dice in the diversity lottery that makes little sense, given our need for people with job-based \nskills, graduate degrees, and other merit-based criteria that would make them valuable to the United States, in \naddition to winning the lottery. I hope we will take advantage of this opportunity this week. Time is wasting. It is \nWednesday, and we don't have any time to waste at all. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to \ncall the roll. Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise to \ntalk about the topic of the week. Although some of us have been working on this for some time, many of us in this \nbody have actually been addressing this for over the last 20 years or so. I am new to this body, as I have only been \nhere a few years, but, last year I got involved in this. We are dealing with the immigration issue today, not just the \nDACA issue. Our current immigration system is outdated, threatens our national security, and does not meet the \nneeds of our economy. The issue before the Senate this week is not just about DACA, which is but one \nmanifestation of our broken immigration policies. Rather, President Trump, while offering a generous solution for \nDACA recipients, has proposed a broader solution to our legal immigration system that will ensure that we are not \nback here in just a few short years to deal with this same problem again. Over the past 11 years, Congress has \nfailed to fix our broken immigration system three times, primarily because it has attempted to solve the entire \nsituation, the comprehensive problem, which would be the legal situation, the temporary work visa problems, and \nthen the illegal situation. The Secure and Succeed Act only deals with our legal immigration policy. From the \nonset of these negotiations, President Trump has been consistent with what he has wanted as part of any \nimmigration deal that deals with the legal immigration system. Months ago, he gave us a clean framework. He \nsaid that any plan that didn't fit that framework would never become law. The Secure and Succeed Act, which we \nare dealing with this week, is the only plan that actually fits that framework. It is the only plan the President has \nsaid he will sign into law. The framework that has been laid out by President Trump has four parts. First, it provides \na solution for the DACA situation and ends the program. It does so in a compassionate, responsible way that every \nSenator on the other side of the aisle should support and has supported at various times. President Trump went \nout of his way to reach across the aisle to the Democrats when he expanded the population that was being \ndiscussed in the DACA situation, and he actually talked about providing long-term certainty for this population \ngroup. Second, this bill secures our borders with additional border security and a wall where required. It puts $25 \nbillion in a trust fund toward border security and a wall system. This money would be spent over the next few years \nto provide better national security for our country's borders. It ends policies like catch and release, which encourage \nmore illegal immigration. It makes critical changes to the immigration court system to clear out backlogs, expedite \ncourt hearings, and give law enforcement the resources it needs to do its job properly. Third, this bill fixes the flaws \nin the current immigration system that spurred this DACA problem in the first place and incentivized illegal \nimmigration. It protects the immediate family of the primary worker. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe \nimmigration should include the primary workers, their spouses, and their immediate children, which is exactly what \nthis bill does. In addition, two-thirds of Americans actually believe that the solution here for illegal immigration \nincludes the DACA fix, an end to chain migration, border security, and an end to the diversity lottery--two-thirds. \nThat is from a Harvard poll that was put out several weeks ago, and there are others that actually corroborate that. \nThis bill also expedites the backlog, which is something that was not even discussed before we brought this bill \nforward. This bill ensures that the primary family of immediate citizens-- [[Page S941]] some of them are recent \ngreen card recipients and new citizens who are trying to get their families in--will be reunited. But there is a backlog. \nWe have that in this bill and have ensured that the backlog will be taken care of and that these families will be \nreunited, which is what most Americans want. Fourth, the Secure and Succeed Act ends the archaic visa lottery \nprogram. This failed program is dangerous, filled with fraud, and has proven to be an avenue for terrorists to enter \n\n\n\nour country. We simply must fix these national security flaws and close the loopholes in our current immigration \nsystem that incentivize illegal immigration. If we don't deal with these problems that got us here in the first place, \nwe will be right back here in just a few short years. This is the President's objective. If we are going to deal with it, \nlet's deal with it once and for all on the immigration side and then move on to the temporary work visas and solve \nthat as well. I don't think anybody in this body wants to be back here in a few short years. Many on the other side \nand on our side have been trying to find a common solution to this for decades. I believe we have an historic \nopportunity right now to do something that people in this body have wanted to do for a long time, and that is to solve \nour legal immigration system in a very compassionate, fair way that will benefit every American. That is why we \nhave to deal with these issues in a responsible and fair way. Politicians have talked about this for far too long. I \nhave discovered, now having been in this body, that it is easy for some to just kick this down the road. It is a great \npandering opportunity for one side or the other to blame this on them. Unfortunately, the American people deserve \nbetter than that. We have a clean opportunity here to do what most people in America want us to do. Other than \npolitics, there is no reason for the Secure and Succeed Act not to have widespread, bipartisan support this week in \nthis body. Each part of the Secure and Succeed Act has been supported by many Democrats at various times over \nthe last 30 years. As a matter of fact, in 1994, Barbara Jordan presented the result of her bipartisan immigration \ncommission report to then-President Bill Clinton. The recommendations at that time were to change our \nimmigration system from our current country caps and chain migration system to more of a skills-based system \nlike those seen in Canada and Australia. They knew then the flaws that were included in our immigration law that \nwas written in 1965 that actually incentivized illegal immigration. Unfortunately, it seems that because these ideas \nare now being put forward by President Donald Trump, the Democrats, all of a sudden, disagree with these \nprinciples. President Trump has crafted a deal that is tough but more than generous. Nobody asked him to expand \nthe number or to even talk about certainty in the long term. He has brought that forward because he wants this \ndone. He wants this solved. He wants this ended right now. The Secure and Succeed Act follows the framework \nthat President Trump has crafted. Compromises have been made on both sides of this issue. It deals with the \nDACA issue, secures the border, and fixes critical flaws in our immigration system that incentivize illegal \nimmigration today. This is to ensure that we are not back here in a few short years to deal with the problem again \nof a new wave of young people who may be brought here illegally. Again, the President has said repeatedly that the \nSecure and Succeed Act is the only bill that he will sign into law. Leadership in the U.S House of Representatives \nhas also been clear that the only plan it will bring up for a vote in its body is one that will be signed into law. The \nSecure and Succeed Act is that plan. We don't have many opportunities in this body for common thought and \ncommon positions, but we have one here. I have seen what most people in this body have said about these issues, \nand it impresses me that there is commonality of thought. At the root, this body wants to solve the DACA issue, but \nit also wants to solve the problems that caused this issue in the first place. This President called for a \ncompassionate compromise when he met with Democrats and Republicans several weeks ago at the White House, \nand we all agreed it was time to do that for the American people. Yet the American people want to be assured that \nthe borders will be secure. They want to be assured that the policies that are embedded in our immigration system \nwill not create another wave of illegal immigrants. They also want this archaic diversity lottery to end, which has \nnever worked as was originally intended and is nothing but a loophole for terrorists today. I think there is too much \ntalk about this bill cutting immigration. That is not the intent here. The intent is long term. We have a bill in here \ncalled the RAISE Act that would actually move us to a merit-based system like those in Canada and Australia. That \nis not included in the Secure and Succeed Act. What is included here is a first step toward a long-term solution not \nonly on our legal immigration side, but it sets us up to then deal with the temporary work visas and, ultimately, with \nthe illegal population. I believe, as I know the Presiding Officer does, that it is time for those in this body to put our \nself-interests and our partisan interests aside, as we say so many times, and to do what the American people want \nus to do, for which we now have hard evidence. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. \nMr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating Chloe Kim on Winning a Gold Medal at \nthe Winter Olympics Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by congratulating Chloe Kim, a first-generation \nAmerican who won an Olympic Gold Medal for the United States in the women's halfpipe snowboarding event this \nweek. Her father, Jong Jin Kim emigrated from South Korea to the United States in 1982, became a dishwasher at \na fast-food restaurant, studied engineering at El Camino College after working those low-skilled jobs, and then \nbecame an engineer. He left his engineering job to support his daughter's snowboarding ambitions so he could \n\n\n\ndrive her 5\\1/2\\ hours to the mountain for training. Congratulations to Chloe and to her entire family. You make the \nUnited States proud. Madam President, the whole debate we are now undertaking over immigration and the \nDreamers has become somewhat personal for me because it has reminded me, in a very strong way, that I and my \nbrother are first-generation Americans. We are the sons of an immigrant who came to this country at the age of 17 \nwithout a nickel in his pocket, a young man who was a high school dropout, who did not know one word of English, \nand who had no particular trade. A few years ago, my brother and I and our families went to the small town where \nhe came from, and it just stunned me, the kind of courage he showed and millions of other people show leaving \ntheir homeland to come to a very different world, in many cases, without money, without knowledge of the \nlanguage. My father immigrated to this country because the town where he lived in Poland was incredibly poor. \nThere was no economic opportunity for him. People there struggled to put food on the table for their families. \nHunger was a real issue in that area. My father came to this country to avoid the violence and bloodshed of World \nWar I, which came to his part of the world in a ferocious manner, and he came to this country to escape the \nreligious bigotry that existed then because he was Jewish. My father lived in this country until his death in 1962. He \nnever made a lot of money. He was a paint salesman. My father was not a political person, but it turned out that \nwithout talking much about it, he was the proudest American you ever saw, and he was so proud of this country \nbecause he was deeply grateful that the United States had welcomed him in and allowed him opportunities that \nwould have been absolutely unthinkable from where he came. The truth is, immigration is not just my story. It is \nnot just the story of one [[Page S942]] young man coming from Poland who managed to see two of his kids go to \ncollege and one of his sons become a U.S Senator. It is not just my family's story. It is the story of my wife's family \nwho came from Ireland, and it is the story of tens of millions of American families who came from every single part \nof this world. In September of 2017, President Trump precipitated the current crisis we are dealing with by revoking \nPresident Obama's DACA Executive order. If President Trump believed that Executive order was unconstitutional \nand it needed legislation, he could have come to Congress for a legislative solution without holding 800,000 young \npeople hostage by revoking their DACA status. President Trump chose not to do that. He chose to provoke the \ncrisis we are experiencing today. That is a crisis we have to deal with in the Senate, and we have to deal with it \nnow. Let us be very clear about the nature of this crisis because some people say: Well, it is really not imminent. It \nis not something we have to worry about now. Those people are wrong. As a result of Trump's decision, 122 people \nevery day are now losing their legal status, and within a couple of years, hundreds of thousands of these young \npeople will have lost their legal protection and be subject to deportation. The situation we are in right now, as a \nresult of Trump's action, means, if we do not immediately protect the legal status of some 800,000 Dreamers--\nyoung people who were brought to this country at the age of 1 or 3 or 6--young people who have known no other \nhome but the United States of America--let us be clear that if we do not act and act soon, these hundreds of \nthousands of young people could be subject to deportation. That means they could be arrested outside their home, \nwhere they have lived for virtually their entire life, and suddenly be placed in a jail. They could be pulled out of a \nclassroom where they are teaching, and there are some 20,000 DACA recipients who are now teaching in schools \nall over this country. If we do not act and act now, there could be agents going into those schools, pulling those \nteachers right out and arresting them and subjecting them to deportation. Insane as it may sound, I suppose the \n900 DACA recipients who now serve in the U.S military today could find themselves in the position of being arrested \nand deported from the country they are putting their lives on the line to defend. Some people say: Well, that is far-\nfetched. Well, I am not so sure. It could happen. How insane is that? That is where we are today, and that is what \ncould happen if we do not do the right thing and this week pass legislation in the Senate to protect the Dreamers. \nWe have a moral responsibility to stand up for the Dreamers and their families and to prevent what will be an \nindelible moral stain on our country if we fail to act. I do not want to see what the history books will be saying about \nthis Congress if we allow 800,000 young people to be subjected to deportation, to live in incredible fear and anxiety. \nHere is the very good news for the Dreamers. It is actually news that a couple of years ago, I would not have \nbelieved to be possible. The overwhelming majority of American people--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--\nabsolutely agree we must provide legal protection for the Dreamers and that we should provide them with a path \ntoward citizenship. That is not Bernie Sanders talking, that is what the American people are saying in poll after poll. \nJust recently, a January 20 CBS News poll found that nearly 9 out of 10 Americans, 87 percent, favor allowing \nyoung immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children to remain in the United States--87 percent in \nIowa, in Vermont, and in every State in this country. There is strong support for legal status for the Dreamers and a \npath toward citizenship. On January 11, a Quinnipiac poll found that 86 percent of American voters, including 76 \npercent of Republicans, say they want the Dreamers to remain in this country. On February 5, in a Monmouth poll, \n\n\n\nwhen asked about Dreamers' status, nearly three out of four Americans support allowing these young people to \nautomatically become U.S citizens as long as they don't have a criminal record. In other words, the votes that are \ngoing to be cast hopefully today, maybe tomorrow, are not profiles in courage. They are not Members of the Senate \ncoming up and saying: Against all the odds, I believe I am going to vote for what is right. This is what the \noverwhelming majority of the American people want. Maybe, just maybe, it might be appropriate to do what the \nAmerican people want rather than what a handful of xenophobic extremists want. Maybe we should listen to the \nAmerican people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--who understand it would be a morally atrocious \nthing to allow these young people to be deported. When I think, from a political perspective, about 80, 85, 90 \npercent of the American people supporting anything in a nation which is as divided as we are today, this is really \nextraordinary. You can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree on what their favorite ice cream is, but we \nhave 80 percent of the American people who are saying, do not turn your back on these young people who have \nlived in this country for virtually their entire lives. We have to act and act soon in the Senate, and there is good \nlegislation that would allow us to do that. In the House, the good news is, there is now bipartisan legislation, \nsponsored by Congressman Hurd and Congressman Aguilar, which will provide protection for Dreamers and a path \ntoward citizenship. My understanding is, bipartisan legislation now has majority support. I urge, in the strongest \nterms possible, that Speaker Ryan allow democracy to prevail in the House, allow the vote to take place. If you \nhave a majority of Members of the House, in a bipartisan way, who support legislation, allow that legislation to \ncome to the floor. Let the Members vote their will, and if that occurs, I think the Dreamers legislation will prevail. \nMadam President, we all understand that there is a need for serious debate and legislation regarding \ncomprehensive immigration reform. This is a difficult issue, an issue where there are differences of opinion. There \nare a whole lot of aspects to it. How do we provide a path toward citizenship for the 11 million people in this country \nwho are currently undocumented but who are working hard, who are raising their kids, who are obeying the law? \nWhat should the overall immigration policy of our country be? How many people should be allowed to enter this \ncountry every year? Where should they come from? All of this is very, very important and needs to be seriously \ndebated, but that debate and that legislation is not going to be taking place in a 2-day period. It is going to need \nsome serious time, some hearings, some committee work before the Congress is prepared to vote on \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and it will not and cannot happen today, tomorrow, or this week. Our focus \nnow, as a result of Trump's decision in September, must be on protecting the Dreamers and their families and on \nthe issue of border security. There will be important legislation coming to the floor of the Senate today or maybe \ntomorrow, and I would hope that we could do the right thing, do the moral thing, and do something that history will \nlook back on as very positive legislation. Let's go forward. Let's pass the Dreamers bill. Let's deal with border \nsecurity, and then, in the near future, let us deal with comprehensive immigration reform. I yield the floor. (The \nActing President pro tempore assumed the Chair.) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from \nOregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, our Constitution begins with three very simple and very powerful words: \n``We the People.'' It is the mission statement for our Nation, for our Constitution. It is a vision in which decisions are \nmade of, by, and for the people, not for the privileged and not for the powerful. Who wrote those words? Well, it \nhappened to be a group of White, wealthy landowners--the powerful and the privileged. They didn't choose to build \na nation that would make laws for their benefit but laws that would be designed for the entire populous to thrive. \nThey were descended from immigrants. In our country, unless you are 100 percent Native American, unless you \nhave just arrived as a new immigrant, you are descended from immigrants yourself. It is part of the fabric [[Page \nS943]] of our Nation. It is what makes us a combination of powerful talents and abilities from around the world. \nGeorge Washington himself once said: ``America is open to receive not only the Opulent and respected Stranger, \nbut the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions.'' On another occasion, he wrote to a friend: ``I had \nalways hoped that this land might become a safe and agreeable asylum to the virtuous and persecuted part of \nmankind, to whatever nation they might belong.'' True to Washington's wishes and to his vision, that is the land we \nhave been. It has been that land of opportunity, that land that welcomes others to our shores and gives them the \nchance to pursue the vision of opportunity, to help participate in the making of our great Nation, and to do so, each \ngeneration brings together a variety of languages and cultures and backgrounds. That is America. That is why, a \ncentury after our Nation's founding, the French gave to the United States the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty \nhas stood as a beacon of hope, welcoming those from other lands. Inscribed in the pedestal of that statue are these \nwords: Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your \nteeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door! Those are the \nwelcoming words for hundreds of thousands arriving here in the United States. As I speak at this moment, 800,000 \n\n\n\nyoung men and women right here in America are yearning to breathe free as full participants in the Nation that they \nhave grown up in. These are our Dreamers--Dreamers like this group of Oregonians who visited my office in \nDecember, who came to this country as very young children, who went to elementary school here, who went to high \nschool here, who are our neighbors, our community members, who have gone on to college, who have taken jobs, \nand who are contributing in every possible way to our community, studying in their schools, practicing and working \nin our industry. They are now young adults who are striving to support their families, building to strengthen this \neconomy, and building a future for themselves. They are paramedics saving lives. If you stand on a street corner in \nOregon and look around, there is a pretty good chance you will see a Dreamer. You may not know it because they \nare full members of our community, and you will see them contributing. But they have overcome a lot of obstacles, \nwhich creates a grit of character. It also helps to build the future of our Nation, just as it did for those of our \nforefathers and foremothers who arrived 1 or 2 or 3 or 10 generations ago. We provided a program, the DACA \nProgram, which struck a deal that said: If you give us all of your information, we will make sure that you are legally \nprotected. President Trump has broken that promise. He has broken that deal, that commitment made by our \nexecutive branch to these Dreamers. So it puts them in a terrible spot of uncertainty and stress and limbo. Now it is \ntime to set that right. It could be set right by the President in a moment. Several of the courts have weighed in and \nsaid that the President has acted unconstitutionally in attacking our young immigrants, our Dreamers. But let's not \nwait for the courts to remedy this. Let's take care of it ourselves in this Chamber, the Senate Chamber. After \nmonths and months of inaction, after broken promises by President Trump, let's finally protect these men and \nwomen who do so much to embody the American spirit. As we move forward in this debate, we must look again to \nwhat our Founding Fathers intended for the Nation they created and ensure that the ``golden door'' that the poet \nEmma Lazarus wrote about in her poem remains an open door, open to all those who dream to become an \nAmerican and to contribute to this Nation. We must remain, in President Washington's words, ``open to receive not \nonly the Opulent and Respected, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations.'' Yet, looking at the plan that \nPresident Trump has put forward and similar plans offered in this Chamber, there is a real interest in slamming the \ndoor shut by those who have already arrived as immigrants, who have fled persecution, who have pursued \nfreedom, who have pursued opportunity, and who have escaped from famine to come in and slam the door on \neveryone else. It is not very American to do that, and it is not a strength to undermine the future success of our \neconomy by draining away the extraordinary talents of our Dreamer community. President Johnson made the point. \nHe said: ``The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources--because it was nourished by so many \ncultures and traditions and peoples.'' President Ronald Reagan made the point. He said: ``More than any other \ncountry, our strength comes from our own immigrant heritage and our capacity to welcome those from other lands.'' \nThe founding President of our country, a respected Democratic President of our country, and a respected \nRepublican President of our country have said the same thing: The strength of our country is in the contributions \nthat have been made by our immigrants. The Founding Fathers wrote those words, that mission statement, that this \nwould be a nation of, by, and for the people, not one to make laws by and for the powerful and the privileged. That \nis the vision we need to continue to hold on to--to understand that the strength of this Nation comes from weaving \ntogether the many cultural threads of the people of the United States of America. Let's get this Dream Act to this \nfloor. There is a bipartisan understanding around restoring legal status. There is a bipartisan foundation for border \nsecurity. Let's not give in to those far-right Breitbart voices that are so out of sync with the traditions, the strength, \nthe culture, and the vision of our Nation. Let's restore the legal status for our Dreamers, enhance our border \nsecurity, and do the work that this Chamber should have done long ago. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \nThe Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come and talk today. This is a week where \nwe had all anticipated a return to the Senate, where ideas are widely debated. I was standing by the majority leader \nlast week when he was talking about this, and he said that we will let a thousand flowers bloom. It didn't sound like \nsomething Senator McConnell would normally use as a reference, but he did, and I am thinking, well, that would be \na good thing, to see a thousand different ideas widely debated on the Senate floor. So far this week, there has not \nbeen any debate because we can't seem to agree on who votes on what first. I think that is a particular level of \ndysfunction that we should all be concerned about. For the Senate to do its work, we have to be willing to vote and \nwe have to be willing to take some hard votes. My sense of politics today is, whether you have taken the vote or \nnot, someone is going to accuse you of taking that vote. So you might as well not worry about the vote you take; \njust worry about the work we get done and whatever votes are necessary to be taken to get that done. On this topic, \nit does seem to me that we have two issues here that should be solved, two issues on which there is broad \nagreement. I have said for a long time that there are really three questions in the immigration debate that need to \n\n\n\nbe answered: No. 1, how do we secure the border; No. 2, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country; \nand No. 3, what do we do with people who came and stayed illegally? As we think about securing the border, by the \nway, half the people who are in the country illegally came legally and just stayed. So it is not all a border issue, but \nit clearly is partly and significantly a border issue. One of the things that people expect a government to be able to \ndo is to secure its own borders. Often, when we hear a story of a country somewhere in the world in which the \ngovernment has disintegrated and is no longer in control of the country, one of the first things that are mentioned by \npeople talking about that dysfunctional government is that they don't control their own borders. It truly is a legitimate \nexpectation of a functioning government that you control your own borders. It is also a legitimate expectation of \ngovernment that you look at [[Page S944]] your economy and you look at what workforce needs you have that \naren't being met and figure out the best way to meet those workforce needs. In this debate, because we haven't \ncontrolled our borders and because we haven't kept track of people who legally crossed our borders and as a \nresult, we have some number of people--usually the estimate is about 11 million people in the country--who are not \nhere legally, what do we do with those people? My view has always been that if the government met its primary \nresponsibility, which is an immigration system that works, the American people would be very forward-leaning \nabout those other two issues, because nobody really argues that if we don't have people here to do the work that \nneeds to be done, whether it is highly skilled or not highly skilled, we ought to be thinking about what we need to do \nto get people here who can do that work. Also, what do we need to do to keep people here who came here to get \ntraining to do highly skilled jobs and graduated from colleges and universities or other skill-enhancing things that \nhappened while they were here. If they want to stay, my view is that if they didn't do anything that got them in \ntrouble while they were here, we should almost always want them to stay. If we don't have that skill set in our \neconomy, why wouldn't we come up with ways to reach out and get it? Those who are not here legally, generally, I \nthink if people thought the problem was solved, if they thought that the government had truly met its responsibility to \noperationally control the borders and that the government had met its responsibility to keep track of who comes in \nlegally and know if they have left or not--I mean, there is no retail store in America that doesn't have a better sense \nof its inventory than we do of whether people who have legally come into the country and checked in with a \nCustoms officer--we don't know if they have left. We couldn't tell you in weeks, perhaps, whether somebody is still \nhere, even if they did everything exactly the way they were supposed to do it. This debate is largely driven by the \nmost sympathetic of all of those groups: that group of people who came here and were brought here by someone \nelse who entered the country illegally--often by their own parents--but have grown up in America. My first response, \nand I think the response of most Americans when they think about that, is that kids who grew up here, kids who \nwent to school here, kids who haven't gotten in bad trouble while they were here, kids who have no real memory or \nconnection with the country they were brought from--of course we want them to stay; of course we want them to be \npart of our economy. Because they are an even younger society than we would be without them, why wouldn't we \nwant that to happen? In some respects, we have two separate issues here. People who were raised here, who \nhave done everything that anybody else would do to acclimate as an American in all ways, who went to school \nhere, who did everything else here--70 or 80 percent of the American people, and I occasionally see a number even \nhigher than that, believe they should be allowed to stay. More and more, as people think about that, they also \nbelieve that after they have been here, like any other immigrant who came to the country legally, they would \neventually be able to take the test and go through the process to become a citizen. That is a widely accepted \npremise that this debate should be built on. Another widely accepted premise that this debate should be built on is \nthat 70 percent or so of the American people--and it would be a higher percentage if people really knew the facts--\nbelieve the government has not met its responsibility to secure our own borders. Let's assume that number is 70. \nWe have two 70 percent issues. We would assume that a working Congress could take two 70 percent issues and \ncome up with a solution that makes its way to the President's desk and solves both of these problems. We are not \ngoing to solve these problems by saying: OK, we are going to solve the problem for people who are already here, \nbut we are not going to do anything to make it harder for others to be brought here illegally by someone who has \ncontrol of them. We are not going to solve that? Of course that is not going to work. I don't think whether you signed \nup for DACA should be a determiner, and apparently the President agrees. If you are here and in the category of \nthose who were brought here and grew up here, whether you signed up as a DACA kid, you could still be part of \nthat overall discussion of how to stay, and you still get to stay if we can come up with a solution for you to do that. \nBut we are not going to solve that problem and say: We will have a study of the other problem to see what is wrong. \nIf by now we largely don't know what is wrong with the other problem, we are never going to figure out what is \nwrong with the other problem. In 1986, long before the Presiding Officer or I came to Congress and maybe long \n\n\n\nbefore some of us graduated from high school, we were going to solve this problem. Everybody who was here \nillegally could stay if they wanted to, and the borders would be made secure. Here we are, over three decades later, \nstill debating the same thing. We need to solve both of these problems. If we can solve other problems while we are \ndoing it, that is fine, too, but we need to come up with a solution. There are a number of ideas out there as to how \nthe Senate should move forward. On the DACA issue, it is important to remember that President Trump said: I am \ngoing to give the Congress 6 more months to solve this problem--until March 5. It is also important to know that the \ncourts have allowed people to continue to sign up, so really the deadline is somewhere beyond March 5. But the \nPresident said: I am going to give Congress 6 more months. President Obama didn't do anything about this for \nyears--not because he didn't want to, I believe, but because he said he didn't have the ability to. President Obama \nrepeatedly said: The President cannot solve this problem; Congress has to solve the problem. In spite of 6 or 7 \nyears of saying that he couldn't solve this problem on his own, he ultimately decided to try to do it with an Executive \norder. The truth is, that Executive order was never going to do the job. I think President Obama knew that. When \nPresident Trump did his own order, he probably also knew he didn't have the ability to do that any more than \nPresident Obama had to do what he did. But both of these Presidents in their own way have tried to drive the \nCongress toward making a decision that comes up with a plan that works--a plan that works for kids who were \nbrought here with no choice in the matter and a plan for seeing to it that kids can't still be easily brought here with \nno choice. We need to let young people come here because we need them here as part of our workforce, as part of \nour country. Legal immigration is what made America great. The rule of law is also what makes our country what it \nis. We can't continue to let immigration be an area where we have decided there are laws that we will not enforce. \nThe challenge for the Congress right now is to come up with a solution so that this problem is not going to continue \nto be the same problem it is today, but as far as the problem today, we are going to solve it. We are going to solve it \nin a way that lets kids who grew up here become part of the solution. I continue to be committed to strengthening \nour borders. I continue to be committed to stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Frankly, I continue to be \ncommitted to the idea of legal immigration as part of continually reinforcing and re-enthusing who we are. But I am \nalso committed to finding a permanent solution for young people in that category who were brought here, grew up \nhere, haven't gotten in trouble while here, and have every reason to want to be part of the American dream and part \nof the American people whom they have been part of up until now. I hope we can find common ground on a bill that \ndoes that. I hope we can pass a bill from the Senate that the House will also pass. If Senators think they have \ndone their job by passing a bill that can't possibly pass the House, that is just kicking the can down the road. We \nneed to find a solution that really resolves this problem, and we solve this problem by putting a bill on the \nPresident's desk. To do that, we are going to [[Page S945]] have to vote. We can't do that by just having a quorum \ncall or a vacancy here on the Senate floor. We have to be willing to vote. There are some things that I will \nenthusiastically vote for and some things I will reluctantly not be able to vote for. But that doesn't mean that I should \nsay: If I can't be for whatever is brought to the Senate floor, then I don't want to vote on it or debate it. We can't \ncontinue to tune in to a vacant screen of the Senate floor. This is the week that we have all committed to having a \nreal debate about solving as many problems as we can that relate to kids who were brought here and grew up here \nand solving that problem so other kids in these numbers are not likely to face that problem in the future. As I yield, I \nhope the floor is filled over the next couple of days with a vigorous debate about the best way to solve the problem \nbefore us in a way that the people we work for will feel good about it and the people who are most impacted by our \ndecision will feel equally the concern, the warmth, and the desire of our country to have a vibrant economy that has \npeople who want to be part of it, able to be part of it, and particularly people who grew up in the United States of \nAmerica to be part of it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Wyoming. Tax \nReform Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it seems as though just about every day we get more good news about the \ntax relief law that Republicans passed. This week, the news is getting even better for a lot of people all across the \ncountry. By the end of this month, 90 percent of workers across the country will see more money in their take-home \npaychecks. It doesn't matter where they are. They can be in Meeteetse, WY, and they will see an increase in their \npaychecks this week. That is because this Thursday, February 15, is the deadline for employers to start using the \nnew IRS tax withholding tables. The IRS tells employers how much money to withhold from people's paychecks so \nthat their taxes work out pretty close at the end of the year. That is the way it is set up. Well, the IRS looked at the \nnew tax law and saw that people are going to be paying lower taxes at the end of the year, so they put out the new \ntax tables. They told businesses to adjust how much money to withhold from a person's paycheck and to do it by \nFebruary 15, tomorrow. For 90 percent of Americans, this tax amount is going to be lower, which means their \npaychecks are going to be larger. A tax cut is the same as a raise. That is what we are seeing all across the \n\n\n\ncountry--people getting a raise in their pay. Some people have already gotten a paycheck with the new, higher \nwages. Others are going to get it very soon. The website Yahoo Finance crunched the numbers. They found that a \ntypical worker making $60,000 a year will get an extra $112 in their paychecks every month because of the tax law. \nThat is over $1,300 for the year. To me, that is very good news for American workers. I was at home in Wyoming \nthis past weekend, traveling around the State, and I am hearing about it in all the different communities I go to. \nPeople are saying: This has been better for me and my family personally. On top of this, a lot of workers are getting \nspecial bonuses and raises because of the tax law. So not only are they getting more money because of the fact \nthat the tax rates have been lowered, additionally, they are getting more money because they have gotten a raise or \na bonus. It seems there are about 4 million hard-working Americans who are getting bonuses of hundreds or even \nthousands of dollars as a result of the new tax reform law. They are also getting extra money in their retirement \nplans. They are getting higher starting wages. We are seeing many places increasing the starting wages, some up \nto $15 an hour. More than 300 companies have said they are increasing all of these kinds of compensations as a \ndirect result of the tax law. In my home State of Wyoming, people across the State are getting bonuses--bonuses. \nThese are people who work at Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Starbucks, Wells Fargo, and other businesses that \nhave familiar names to people across the country. They are also people who are working in smaller businesses, like \nthe Jonah Bank in Wyoming. It has branches in Casper and in Cheyenne. It is not a nationally known bank, but it is \nvery important in our State and in our communities. Every employee of this bank is getting a $1,000 bonus. The \nbank is also increasing its giving in the communities in which it has branches. Workers benefit, and the community \nbenefits. That is what happens when we change the tax law so Washington gets less and taxpayers get to keep \nmore. That is why I voted for this tax law--to give the kind of tax relief that made these bonuses and these pay \nraises possible. It is good for Wyoming, and it is good for people all across the country. It is interesting--it is even \ngood for people in States whose Senators voted against the tax law. Ninety percent of people across the country \nare seeing the benefits no matter which State they are from. There is a business in Grand Rapids, MI, called the \nMill Steel Company. They said last week that they are giving an extra $1,000 to their workers because of the tax \nlaw that every Republican voted for and every Democrat voted against. Now, 400 people at that company are \ngetting a bonus. Michigan has two Democratic Senators. They both voted against the tax relief law. It still led to \n$1,000 bonuses for these 400 workers. What do the Senators have to say about it now? Are they proud that they \nvoted against the tax law? Are they glad they said no to these sorts of raises that made it possible for people in their \nhome States to get the bonuses? We know what Nancy Pelosi thinks. She went out and first she talked about how \nthe tax law was Armageddon, and then she said it was the end of the world. Most recently, she said all the benefits \npeople are getting under the tax law, in her words, are just ``crumbs.'' ``Crumbs,'' she said. For her, it may be \ndifferent, but for a lot of Americans, a $1,000 bonus--certainly for the people in my home State of Wyoming--is \nmuch more than crumbs. An extra $1,300--I talked about the worker earlier--in that paycheck is much more than \ncrumbs. For a person with a starting wage of $15 an hour, that is more than crumbs. It is bad enough Democrats \ntried to keep people from getting the extra money--Democrats voted against it because they didn't want people to \nget the extra money, it seems to me. It is hard to believe they would continue this way and take pride in voting \nagainst it, but they did. Now it seems like Democrats want to insult people by saying what they are seeing and what \ntheir benefits are, are resulting in crumbs. It is completely unfair, and I think it is disrespectful to the American \npeople. These are just some of the cash benefits workers are getting from the tax law. Republicans predicted, \nduring the debate over this law, there would be other benefits as well. We said businesses would pay less in taxes, \nand some of them would be able to additionally cut prices for consumers--let people buy things more cheaply. \nAmericans are starting to see this prediction come true as well. One of the first places they are seeing it is in their \nutility bills. Gas, electric, and water utilities are cutting their rates because their taxes are going down under the \nlaw. In Vermont, the State's only natural gas utility company is cutting rates by more than 5 percent because of the \ntax law. Both of the Senators from Vermont voted against the law, but it is the law Republicans passed that caused \nthese rates to go down. In fact, people living in at least 23 States and the District of Columbia are going to be \npaying lower utility bills because of the tax relief law. Another 26 States are looking into cutting rates. Rates are \ngoing down in California, Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut--States where every Democratic \nSenator voted against the tax law. What do these Democratic Senators have to say now? Are they proud of the \nfact they voted against the tax cuts that made it possible for people to have lower utility bills in their States? When \npeople's monthly bills get cut, it is like a pay hike--more money in their own pockets. They have more money to \neither save or to spend on other things or to invest. [[Page S946]] The owner of a gym in Cincinnati, OH, spoke with \nhis local television station about what tax relief means for him. He said: When people have that extra money to \n\n\n\nspend, they spend it. Some save it. They go out to eat. They buy gym memberships. And they enjoy themselves. \nPeople have that extra money to spend now, today, because of the tax law Republicans passed. They have the \nextra money despite every Democrat in this body voting against tax relief. Every one of them said no. They all voted \nno. Democrats who voted no to tax relief for American families essentially voted yes to keep the extra money in \nWashington so they can decide how to spend it. I have much more faith in people at home in Wyoming deciding \nhow to spend their money than any faith I have in Washington, DC. For so many Americans, every dollar helps, and \nthey are not crumbs. Democrats may not know the difference, but the American families do. People in every State \nof this country know the difference. The American people understand what Republicans did with this tax law. They \nare seeing more money in their paychecks, more take-home pay, more money to decide what to spend and what to \ninvest and what to save. They know Republicans promised to cut people's taxes. People know Republicans \ndelivered on the promise. They know the benefits they have gotten already, and they are confident the economy will \ncontinue to grow stronger day by day. People across the country also know the fact that every Democrat voted \nagainst this law, voted against giving them a tax break, voted against allowing them to keep more of their hard-\nearned money. The American people know who took their side, who voted for the American public versus who said \nno. Hard-working Americans asked us to do a job for them. Republicans are doing the job; Democrats in \nWashington certainly are not. Republicans are going to keep doing that job for the American people--a job we have \npromised and a job which we have delivered. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, \nit is so ordered. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, it is time for the Senate to do its job as a separate branch of \ngovernment. This week, we can come together on a bipartisan basis to resolve the crisis Donald Trump created \nwhen he canceled DACA. We can provide hundreds of thousands of young people in our country their shot at \npursuing the American dream without fear of deportation. Right now, these young people who were brought to this \ncountry as children are terrified they will be separated from their families and the lives they have built here, in the \nonly country they know and love. I have met and spoken with so many Dreamers in the Halls of Congress these \npast months. Their focus, determination, and commitment in this fight continues to be extraordinary and inspiring. \nEach Dreamer has a different story to tell, but they all share a profoundly simple aspiration--to live, work, and study \nin the only country they have ever called home. When you sit and listen to their stories, it is not difficult to \nunderstand why between 80 and 90 percent of Americans support protecting these Dreamers--people like Karen, \nMaleni, and Beatrice, who can attend the University of Hawaii because of DACA; people like Victor, from Houston, \nwho aspires to become a counselor for LGBTQ youth like him; and people like Getsi, from Oregon, who works three \njobs so she can pursue her dream of becoming a nurse practitioner to care for our seniors. These inspiring young \npeople don't need to hear any more promises. They need Members of Congress to put their votes where their \nmouths have been and do the right thing. Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support passing a clean Dream \nAct--legislation that already has bipartisan support--but it is critical that we get to the 60 votes we need to pass a \nbill. I am open to discussing different provisions, including some funding for border security to help us get there. We \ncan and should have a debate on comprehensive immigration reform but only after we pass legislation this week \nto protect the Dreamers. We cannot and should not use this debate to provide cover for efforts to dismantle the \nfamily-based immigration system or to make massive cuts to legal immigration. The President and a number of \ncolleagues have made it clear they would like to eliminate family-based immigration in favor of a system that is \ndesigned only to recruit immigrants with advanced degrees and specialized skills. It is important for the United \nStates to recruit highly skilled immigrants, and we have a number of immigration programs that are designed \nspecifically for this purpose, but when you restrict immigration only to people with highly specialized skills or \nadvanced degrees, you lose out on a lot of human potential that has historically contributed so much to our country. \nWe don't have to look far back into history to prove why this statement is true. Over the past week, the Olympics \nhas captured the excitement and imagination of people across the country--in fact, the world. Many of the people \nwe have been cheering for are either the children of immigrants or are immigrants themselves. Over the weekend, \nwe saw Mirai Nagasu, whose parents emigrated from Japan, become the first American woman to land a triple axel \nin the Olympics during her appearance in the team figure skating competition. Yesterday, we saw Maame Biney, \nwho immigrated to the United States from Ghana, take to the ice to compete in the short track speed skating. Two \nnights ago, I watched Chloe Kim throw down a near perfect score in the women's snowboard halfpipe to win the \nOlympic Gold Medal. After completing her history-making run, the cameras panned to her father Jong Jin Kim, who \nproudly waved his ``Go Chloe'' sign in the audience. Jong arrived in California in 1982 with $800 in his pocket. He \n\n\n\nworked for years at minimum wage jobs to save for college. While studying at El Camino College, he worked as a \nheavy machinery operator at night. Jong encouraged Chloe to begin snowboarding when she was 4. They would \njump off the lifts together, but because he didn't know how to snowboard, they would tumble to the ground. Jong \nbought Chloe her first snowboard on eBay for $25. When Chloe was 8, Jong quit his job as an engineer to support \nher snowboarding career. He would often wake up at 2 a.m in the morning to drive Chloe over 300 miles to her \npractices. After watching his daughter win the Olympic Gold, Jong said in Korean, ``When I came to the United \nStates, this was my American hope. Now, this is my American dream.'' In reflecting on her father's sacrifice, Chloe \nsaid, ``My dad has definitely sacrificed a lot for me, and I don't know if I could do it if I was in his shoes, leaving your \nlife behind and chasing your dream because your kid is passionate about this sport. I think today I did it for my \nfamily, and I am so grateful to them.'' Chloe's story of winning the Olympic Gold is extraordinary, but her father's \nstory speaks to a deep and abiding foundation of America and to my personal experience as an immigrant. My \nmom also came to this country--poor and without skills to escape an abusive marriage--to give her three children, of \nwhich I am one, a chance at a better life. Like Jong and Chloe, one generation after my mom came to this country, I \nam standing on the floor of the U.S Senate, fighting for humane immigration policies. These stories speak to the \nbroader immigrant experience in our country. We work hard and embrace the opportunities this country provides, \nand we often see the result of this hard work within a single generation. I would ask my colleagues: Do you think the \nUnited States would be better off if we prevented immigrants like Jong and me from coming to this country? \nTargeting immigrants for discriminatory and harsh treatment is denying our country's history. With the exception of \nour original peoples, everyone came to our country from somewhere else. We are fighting to preserve [[Page \nS947]] the spirit of our country--that shining city on a hill. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. \nMs. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, like my colleagues \nfrom whom we are hearing today, I also rise to talk about the importance of protecting the Dreamers, not just in the \nState of Nevada but across this country. I want to talk specifically about a term that I constantly hear during this \ndebate on how we need to protect Dreamers and at the same time address this issue of ``chain migration.'' I call on \nmy colleagues and President Trump to really stop using that term and to abandon the offensive and misleading \nterm of ``chain migration'' because it paints a picture that does not reflect reality. Immigrants cannot sponsor their \nentire families to come here. Our system of family-based immigration allows American citizens and green card \nholders to petition for some of their immediate family members to join them in the United States. There are \nnumerous steps families must take to legally immigrate to the United States. It is a long and arduous process that \nleaves husbands, wives, parents, brothers, and sisters waiting for decades. This system is so broken and slow that \nmany people die before they ever have the chance to be reunited with their loved ones again. So this image of \nimmigrants coming in endless chains across our borders couldn't be further from the truth. For instance, the U.S \nCitizenship and Immigration Services is currently processing visa applications for the siblings of U.S citizens from \n1994. That is 24 years ago. This backlog is painful for many American families, like Fely. Fely is an immigrant from \nthe Philippines who arrived in the United States with her husband and her youngest son back in 1989. Her father \nwas a veteran who served in World War II, earned his citizenship, and petitioned to have Fely join him in the U.S In \nthe almost three decades since then, Fely has worked tirelessly to reunite with her other children. Now at 80 years \nold, she is still waiting and hoping that three of her children will make it through the backlog to join her at home. Her \nstory shows us that sponsoring even your closest family members is a lengthy and difficult process. Tragically, \nFely's struggle is not uncommon. Thousands of Filipino veterans all across this country are in the same situation. \nAs a daughter and granddaughter of veterans, I know firsthand that when someone answers the call of duty, family \nmembers make sacrifices too. I support Senator Hirono's Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, a bill that \nwould expedite the visa process for Filipino World War II veterans' immediate relatives. We should honor the \nsacrifices that veterans and their families make by passing this bill, not by forcing them to wait in perpetual limbo. \nOur immigration system reflects our national commitment to the strength and importance of the family unit. \nFamilies are support systems. They pull each other up when someone is in need and pull together their resources. \nStrong families build strong communities. Karl is a 20-year-old Filipino-American community organizer born and \nraised in North Las Vegas. Karl's whole family is committed to community service. While attending high school, \nKarl's brother volunteers at an organization that serves the homeless. Karl's mother teaches special education in \nNorth Las Vegas to low-income children. Karl's dad is a mechanic and a military veteran, having served this country \nin multiple branches of the armed services. None of them would be here if not for our family-based, legal \n\n\n\nimmigration system. Some of my Republican colleagues claim to be champions of strong, nuclear families and \nfamily values. Yet here we are today, considering a measure that would tear apart families like Karl's, that would \nleave parents without children, sisters without brothers, and husbands without wives. Why does the party of family \nvalues think that is acceptable? The problem is that the party of Donald Trump is not the party of family values. \nDonald Trump doesn't care about families. He wants to be able to pick and choose which families get to come in \nand which have to stay out. The White House immigration plan we are considering would cut legal immigration by \nup to 44 percent. That is half a million more immigrants who would be banned each year. This is one of the largest \nxenophobic-driven cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s. It would affect nearly 22 million people over the next \nfive decades. What is going on here? What are they so afraid of? I recently sat down with immigrant workers in the \nSenate and the Pentagon who are about to lose their protections from deportation. One of them told me that she left \nEl Salvador after seeing her husband brutally murdered in front of her and her son. She has been working for the \nFederal Government for the past two decades, serving the very men and women who are preparing to vote to send \nher back to the country she fled with her children. I also spoke with a Dreamer who works right here in the Senate \ncafeteria. She is the sole provider for her three American-citizen children, and she, too, is afraid that under Donald \nTrump's deportation policy, she is going to be ripped apart from her children and sent back to a country that she \nfled. These are the people Donald Trump wants to throw out of their homes. They are not asking for special \ntreatment or handouts or giveaways. They just want to be allowed to stay and work hard and provide for their \nfamilies. They don't want to have to go back to a place where they will have to live every day in fear for their lives \nand for their children's lives. This President will tell you that immigrants are taking jobs. That is a myth. It is a lie that \nhas been spread about every immigrant group in American history, and it has been repeatedly debunked by \neconomic research. According to the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, a typical immigrant \nfamily will pay an estimated $80,000 more in taxes than they receive in public benefits over their lifetime. Immigrant \nfamilies bring long-term economic benefits to our country by starting businesses, purchasing property, and \nsupporting the education and achievement of their children. Research shows that immigrants drive growth. They \ngenerate new patents at twice the rate of native-born Americans. In 2014, they earned $1.3 trillion and contributed \n$105 billion in State and local taxes and nearly $224 billion in Federal taxes. Immigrants are 30 percent more likely \nto start a business in the United States than nonimmigrants, and 18 percent of small business owners in the United \nStates are immigrants. They create jobs right here in the United States. Jobs are not the problem here. The \nproblem is the color of immigrants' skin. We have a President of the United States who has wondered out loud why \nwe can't have more Whites come to this country. President Trump denies being a racist. For a nonracist, he has \ndone a shockingly good job of cultivating support among White supremacists. This is not about the color of people's \nskin, but this is about family. This is about strong nuclear families and family values. I am proud of who I am, where \nI came from, and I am a descendant of immigrants. But I also learned and believe in strong values and strong family \nvalues, and we lead with those values. So our immigration system should reflect our national commitment to the \nstrength and the importance of that family unit and those family values. It makes no sense to me that we are fighting \ntoday to protect these kids and keep them in this country and then take their parents and rip them out of their \nhomes and send them back to a country that they do not want to go to, that they do not call home, and where their \nsafety is called into question. I don't understand that as a family value or as an American value. So I ask my \ncolleagues, when we are talking about the immigration system [[Page S948]] and protecting Dreamers, let's \nimplement commonsense immigration reform. Let's make sure that when we are protecting Dreamers, we are also \nprotecting their family unit and those family values. This is not about pitting parents against their kids or having kids \ndecide whether they should stay here or their parents should. No child should have to go to school concerned that \nwhen they come home, their parents may not be there. I don't know about you, but I went through the public school \nsystem in the State of Nevada, and I was always, always comforted with the thought that when I walked through \nthat door, my mother and father would be there. Any other way to treat these children and their families, to me, is \ninhumane. They are not values that we stand for as Americans, and they are not values that we lead with when we \nare talking about commonsense reforms to immigration. So I ask my colleagues: Please, as we go through this \ndebate, remember who we are talking about. There are faces, there are families, there are people behind the very \ndecisions that we make this week. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New \nMexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as the Senate takes to the floor to \ndebate a long-overdue, bipartisan solution for Dreamers--young immigrants who came to our country as children--I \nwould like to tell you a story about one Dreamer in my home State of New Mexico to illustrate what is at stake here \n\n\n\nthis week. Immigrants have long helped to write the economic, social, and cultural story of my home State of New \nMexico and, for that matter, our entire Nation. We are, after all, a nation of immigrants. Over the last centuries, our \nNation's foundation and the enduring American spirit were built by the hard work and the dreams of so many \nstriving young immigrants. When President Trump made the outrageous decision last fall to end the Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals Program--DACA--he threw hundreds of thousands of Dreamers deep into fear and \nuncertainty. Two weeks ago, I was proud to welcome Ivonne Orozco-Acosta, one of the estimated 7,000 Dreamers \nfrom New Mexico, as my guest at the State of the Union Address. Ivonne's family immigrated to the United States \nwhen she was 12 years old. She learned English through middle school and graduated from high school in \nEstancia, NM. It was during these challenging years of learning that Ivonne was encouraged by her teachers to \ngrow and to learn. Ivonne knows the power that educators hold to create positive change in students' perspective of \nthemselves. Ivonne attended the University of New Mexico, where she earned her BA in secondary education with \na concentration in Spanish. It is estimated that somewhere between 500 and 1,000 students at the University of \nNew Mexico right now are Dreamers like Ivonne. These are some of our brightest students, and they are our future \nleaders. Since she graduated from UNM 4 years ago, Ivonne has been teaching Spanish at the Public Academy for \nPerforming Arts, a charter school in Albuquerque, NM. Ivonne told me what DACA has meant for her. DACA \nallowed her to get a work permit, to follow her passion for education. It made it possible for her to buy a home and \nher first car. It has also given her an opportunity to impact the lives of her students each day and to contribute to our \nState's economy as a teacher and as a taxpayer. DACA gave Ivonne, in her words, ``a sliver of hope''--hope that \nshe will finally be able to have a permanent home and a place in the only country that she knows how to call home. \nBecause of her excellent teaching in the classroom and her incredible passion for her students, Ivonne was just \nselected as the 2018 New Mexico Teacher of the Year by the New Mexico Public Education Department. That is \nright; Ivonne has been recognized as the teacher of the year for our entire State. Ivonne's commitment to education \nand to giving back to her community is truly inspiring, and it reminds us just how much is at stake for New Mexico \nand our country in this debate. Our State already struggles to keep schools filled with teachers and has one of the \nhighest teacher turnover rates in the Nation. Dreamers across the country, like Ivonne, are stepping up to serve our \ncommunities, to teach our students. Nearly 9,000 of the Dreamers who received temporary legal status and work \npermits through the DACA Program are teachers like Ivonne. Many more are firefighters; they are police officers; \nthey are scientists; they are doctors; they are members of our military. These inspiring young people are Americans \nin every sense of the word, except for a piece of paper, and they want nothing more than to be productive members \nof their communities. But until Congress passes the Dream Act, these young people like Ivonne will continue to \nworry about whether they will be able to stay in school, keep working, contributing to our economy, or remain even \nin their homes and their neighborhoods. I have to ask: Why would we even consider threatening to deport the \nteacher of the year from my State? I simply cannot accept that as living up to all that our Nation stands for. The \nSanta Fe New Mexican covered Ivonne's visit to Washington. The New Mexican's editorial board said: ``It is no \nexaggeration to state that as the immigration debate goes, so does her future.'' They went on to call the \nimmigration debate we are engaging here in Congress as a fight ``for the soul of this country, founded and \nstrengthened by immigrants throughout our history.'' I, for one, hope that we can learn from the best and most \nchallenging parts of our Nation's history of immigration and understand that Dreamers like Ivonne are part of the \nimmigration story that has always made our Nation great. Deporting these young people who grew up in America \nand want to contribute to their Nation is not what the America that I know and love would do. Dreamers deserve \ncommonsense, compassionate, and responsible policy. Two weeks ago, while President Trump was taking cheap \nshots at immigrants during his State of the Union Address and insinuating that all immigrants and asylum seekers \npose an existential danger to our children and our families, I couldn't help but think of the impacts of his words on \nIvonne as she sat in the Gallery. There are hundreds of thousands of Dreamers like her. They are truly bright spots \nand rising stars in our communities and in our country, and the time has come for us to stop playing politics with \ntheir lives. Let's stop stirring up fear and division when we should be working to find a real path forward. This week, \nI believe we have a path forward here in the Senate in this debate, and we must pass a bipartisan immigration \nbill that includes the Dream Act in the Senate and in the House. I will do everything I can to pass a solution for \nDreamers, to create rational border security policies, and to make the investments that our border region and its \ncommunities actually need. I will stand with New Mexicans against President Trump's fear-based and un-American \nviews, frankly, on immigration and his offensive and wasteful border wall that have no place in this debate. I hope \nthat each of us in this body recognizes our moral responsibility and our obligation to live up to our Nation's ideals \nand its values. We must act with a sense of urgency to find a way forward for these Dreamers. Every day that \n\n\n\npasses without our passing the Dream Act is another day of desperation and limbo for young people like Ivonne \nwho only know America as their home. Now is the time to give these young Americans a permanent place and an \nearned path to citizenship in our Nation. I will do everything I can every step of the way to make that happen. Thank \nyou, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Connecticut. South Florida School \nShooting Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as we speak, there is a horrific scene playing [[Page S949]] out in a high \nschool in South Florida. Turn on your television right now, and you will see scenes of children running for their lives-\n-what looks to be the 19th school shooting in this country, and we have not even hit March. I am coming to the floor \nto talk about something else, but let me note once again for my colleagues that this happens nowhere else other \nthan the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school \nshooting. It only happens here, not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our \ninaction. We are responsible for the level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere \nelse. As a parent, it scares me to death that this body doesn't take seriously the safety of my children, and it seems \nas though a lot of parents in South Florida are going to be asking that same question later today. We pray for the \nfamilies and for the victims. We hope for the best. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about \nimmigration. I want to make a specific case to you today, but before I do, I want to talk a little about process. I \nheard a lot of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle say on this floor and in the Halls of Congress that \nPresident Trump has made an immigration proposal and Democrats have been asking for an immigration \nproposal, so we should just accept his first and only offer. What is the big deal? President Trump gave you \nsomething that says ``immigration'' on it. Why aren't you accepting it? It is a terrible proposal. It is bad for America. \nTo his credit, President Trump does attempt to try to deal with these Dreamer kids, but there are 3 million \npotentially eligible individuals in this country, and it only allows about 1.8 million of them to get through the process. \nBut that is really not the worst part. The worst part is that it cuts legal immigration by 40 percent. It basically \nabandons this country's commitment to family-based immigration. I wouldn't be here if we only had skills-based \nimmigration. Most Members of this body wouldn't be here if the only way that your parents or grandparents or \ngreat- grandparents could have come here is because of a Ph.D or a degree or a certificate. Most of the people in \nthis Chamber, I would imagine, are here because their parents or great-grandparents or great-great- grandparents \ncame here because they had friends or family here. Let's not reimagine the history of this country. Democrats aren't \nobligated to accept the first offer from this President if it is not good for America. Negotiation still has to be part of \nthe legislative process, and I am glad there are Members of the Republican and Democratic caucuses who have \nbeen trying to do that. We will see where that goes. The President has put this proposal on the table that \ndramatically cuts immigration into this country because he sees immigration as a core weakness of this country. \nHe views new entrants to America as an economic drain. That is why he wants to potentially kick out 3 million \nDreamer kids next month if we don't act. That is why he wants to dramatically cut down the number of people who \nare allowed to legally immigrate to America. He views immigrants as a problem that needs to be dealt with. And he \nis not alone. Many Americans agree. I, frankly, hear from them regularly in Connecticut. Frankly, one could also \nargue that there is nothing more American than being scared of immigrants. Every single new wave of immigrants \nto our shores has been met with some degree of fear and derision and prejudice. Like clockwork, every generation \nor two, American politicians denounce immigrants as a threat to the American-born worker. In the 1850s, growing \nnumbers of Catholic immigrants from Ireland--as the Murphys came--and from Germany led to an anti-immigrant \nparty arising in this country that elected more than 100 Congressmen, eight Governors, and thousands of local \npoliticians. They claimed that Catholics could never be Americans because they owed allegiance to the Pope. \nStarting in the 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants began to immigrate to the west coast, causing \na spike in anti-Chinese sentiment that eventually resulted in the passage of something called the Chinese Exclusion \nAct. Fearing those who are different from us in skin color or religion or national origin or language is an \nunmistakable facet of American history, but over and over again, we have overcome these base instincts because \nour better angels prevail but also because of this bright, straight line that connects America's liberal immigration \npolicy with our economic greatness. I want to take just a couple of minutes to make for you a compact but \nirrefutable case for the correlation between economic power and American immigrants. From 1870 to 1910, it is no \ncoincidence that America's transformation into a global economic powerhouse occurred during a period of massive \ninflux of human capital. During that time, nearly 15 percent of all Americans were foreign-born. That is a share that \nour country has never reached since then. This period of unprecedented growth forever dispelled the myth that we \nstill labor under today that the number of American jobs is fixed. Immigrants increase demand, and that increased \ndemand creates jobs. Organizations from the National Academy of Sciences to the conservative Cato Institute have \n\n\n\ndone their own studies on this question and have come to the same conclusion. Cato recently said this: Immigrants \nadd jobs, in part by raising consumer demand. So getting rid of immigrants, such as by deporting unauthorized \nworkers, would most likely destroy jobs and raise native unemployment. That makes sense, right? But if you don't \nbelieve that immigrants create growth, there is another, even simpler explanation as to why we need robust \nimmigration. At present birth rates, we don't have enough people born here to fill all the jobs that are going to be \ncreated in the next 20 years. It is estimated that, accounting for growth, America is going to need 83 million new \nworkers to enter the workforce in the next 20 years. But here is the problem. Only 51 million new workers will be \nnative-born. That leaves us 32 million short. Unless folks start churning out a lot more babies, immigration is the \nonly way to fix that deficit. Not convinced? Well, think about how the Federal budget works. Most of our budget is \nsocial insurance--working-age Americans paying into accounts that pay benefits to older, nonworking Americans. \nYou need a balance between the two in order to not go bankrupt. Many of our competitor nations around the world \nare spiraling toward this demographic cataclysm. By 2030, the median age in Japan, with strict immigration \npolicies, is going to be over 50. It is extraordinary. Do you want to know why Germany is so interested in bringing \nrefugees into their country? Because without them, their median age in 2030 will be 48. Budgets simply can't work \nwith that many retirees and that few workers. Because of America's liberal immigration policy, our average age, \nwhich today is 38, will increase in 2030 to just 39. During that time, China--another country that doesn't really allow \nimmigration-- will go from having a median age that is 2 years younger than that of the United States to 3 years \nolder. In 2010, undocumented immigrants and their employers sent $13 billion to Social Security. Without them, the \ntrust fund would be out of money today. You are not there yet? Let's talk jobs. Just ask your farmers in your State \nhow important lower skilled immigration is to keeping their farms afloat. But let's talk about high-skilled jobs. Would \nit shock you to know that 31 percent of Ph.D holders in this country are immigrants? It is amazing. And more than \none-quarter of all high-quality patents in the United States are being granted to immigrants. How about a study from \n3 years ago that Senator Cortez Masto referred to that found that immigrants are twice as likely as native-born \nAmericans to start a business. That is not good enough for you? Here is a mind blower: 43 percent of Fortune 500 \ncompanies in the United States were founded or cofounded by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant. You know \nwho they are. The founder of eBay came to the United States from France, where he was born to Iranian parents. \nGoogle's cofounder, Sergey Brin, emigrated with his family from Russia when he was 6. [[Page S950]] Elon Musk, \nwho started SpaceX, which has 4,000 employees, came from South Africa. Daniel Aaron, who cofounded Comcast, \nwas a refugee of Nazi Germany. Henry Ford was an Irish immigrant. Estee Lauder's family was Hungarian. Herman \nHollerith, one of the founders of IBM, had German parents. You don't want Ford or IBM or Google to be part of the \nAmerican story? Then keep saying immigrants are an economic drain. Margaret Thatcher once marveled of \nAmerica: ``No other nation has so successfully combined people of different races and nations within a single \nculture.'' This combination is our definition as a nation, but it is also the story of our economic greatness, of our \nsprawling leap in under two short centuries from an idea to the biggest, most dynamic economy on the face of the \nplanet. To deny that history or to misremember it would be perhaps an irreversible error. I yield the floor. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, some of what I just heard, I can \nreadily agree to. Certain things, such as that we are a nation of immigrants-- no doubt about that. We need \nimmigrants. We take roughly 800,000 to 1 million legal immigrants a year. They are welcomed. We also, though, \nare a nation of laws, and as a nation of laws, we want people to come here according to our laws and abide by the \nlaws. We are working with a group of people. If you call them DACAs, it would be about 800,000. If you refer to \nthem as Dreamers, it is maybe 1.8 million. We obviously have sympathy for them because as a baby brought here \nin diapers by a person or family who crossed our border without papers, hence entering our country illegally--we \ndon't attribute the sin and the unlawfulness of the parent to the baby. A lot of that has happened. There is a general \nagreement--maybe not everybody in my political party agrees with this, but I think 80 percent of them do--that we \nneed to deal with people who are here through no fault of their own and give them legal status. That is the \ncompassion we are showing for people who broke our laws by their parents doing it but not the kids doing it. I also \ndidn't ever think we would be here today debating this because I went through the 2013 debate on immigration. \nThe Senate passed a bill; the House of Representatives didn't take it up. I was in the minority at that time, both in \nthe caucus that was in the minority as well as in the minority that voted against that bill, because I didn't think it did \nthings the way I would do them. Everything died in the House of Representatives. Then, 2 years later, I became \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. We have jurisdiction over immigration legislation. I could have spent 3 \nmonths on immigration during 2015 or 2016 and sent a bill to the House of Representatives that probably would \nhave died, but I made up my mind early in my chairmanship that I wanted to do things that we could get passed. So \n\n\n\nover the period of the last Congress, my committee voted out 31 bills, all bipartisan, and 18 of them got to a \nDemocratic President. In 2015 and 2016, I felt, why go through that process if it is going to die in the House of \nRepresentatives? Now, a year later, after the election of a President who campaigned so much against anything \ndealing with immigration and legalization of people who are here--even young people, whom he has now come to \nthe conclusion we ought to legalize--I didn't think we would be having this debate, and somehow I think Members of \nthe Democratic Party didn't think we would be having this debate. I think they probably were shocked 2 or 3 weeks \nago when the government shut down and when the majority leader decided to make an agreement to bring up this \nissue. But here we are, debating an immigration bill that, quite frankly, I didn't think we would be debating. Here \nwe are. Then, of course, we didn't do anything Monday. We didn't do anything on this issue Tuesday. I don't know \nwhether we are going to have any votes today, but here we are debating immigration. We have a chance to do \nwhat Members of the other political party, as advocates for Dreamers and DACA kids--and we have them on this \nside but maybe not as vocal or as loyal as Democrats are on this issue. Somehow, we are now having a difficult \ntime getting the issue up and getting something passed. I offer to my 99 colleagues something the President said \nhe would sign. Maybe you don't like exactly what is in that proposal. Then get it up and amend it, and let's see what \nsort of compromise we can accomplish. But we are here because the leader said that we are going to work on this \nissue. It was something that the minority demanded. We ought to reach a conclusion on it and get something to the \nPresident of the United States. Once we knew that this issue was going to come up--and we knew that on \nSeptember 5 when the President said that he was not going to continue the illegal approach to the DACA kids that \nPresident Obama did. We have reason to believe this from court decisions on older people where they ruled that \nthe President didn't have the authority to do what he did with the DACA kids. In fact, at least a dozen times before \nhe made that decision, he was telling the entire country he didn't have the authority to do it, and then he went \nahead and did it. So this President comes in, takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of this country, \nand he decides that he can't continue what was considered illegal activity by the previous President. This is a \ncongressional decision that needs to be made, and Congress ought to make it. We were told on September 5 to do \nsomething by March 5, and here we are. I heard from the previous speaker--and maybe a lot of speakers--that this \nis the President's plan. Yes, this is something that the President said that he is going to support and will sign, but I \nwant to say to you that the work that a group of us Senators have put into this issue over a period of the last 3 \nmonths, with about 18 meetings, 4 meetings with the President of the United States to discuss the issue--most of \nwhat is in the proposal that is put before you are things that a group of Senators put together. I would say that as \nour group met, we probably had subgroups of three who had different views, and some of them felt strongly about \ntheir positions, but everyone came together in a compromise that you see here before us in my amendment. In \nsome of those meetings, we discussed these things with the President, and I want to give the President credit. In a \nJanuary 9 meeting that he had where he called together 23 of us--bipartisan and bicameral--we were able to dial \ndown all the things that we would be discussing on immigration, and we came to the conclusion that there were \nfour main points that we ought to be dealing with. You have heard of these as the four pillars, but let me repeat \nthem. No. 1 was legalization of these children who were brought here by their parents; No. 2 was border security; \nNo. 3 was chain migration; and No. 4, diversity visa. We discussed these things with the President, and I suppose \nthe President probably emphasized citizenship to a greater extent than maybe we did in our deliberations, but we \nhave something that has been put together by Members of this body who have compromised, with none of us \ngetting everything we wanted. We are fortunate enough to have the President's backing on this. So I hope that you \nsee this, not as we have heard from the other side as the President's plan--as if seven of us who introduced this \nproposal somehow just took something from the White House and put our names on it, and it is here before the U.S \nSenate--because that isn't how it worked. I want to address some of the issues that have been put before us by \npeople on the other side. I want to express--as you probably have seen me expressing already in my remarks so \nfar--my frustration with the current status of the immigration debate here in the U.S Senate. It amazes me that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle simply aren't ready to have a serious immigration debate. They have \nbeen demanding to have this debate for months. They have even shut the government down to get to this point, \nand now we are actually on this issue that they have been demanding that we debate for months during this \nCongress--some on the other side of the aisle for [[Page S951]] years--and now when it is time to put up or shut up, \nthey have come up emptyhanded. Despite having weeks to prepare, Senate Democrats are still rushing to put \nsome plan together. Let that sink in. Think about this just for a moment. The Senate Democrats recklessly shut \ndown the Federal Government over immigration, and they did it over plans that they still largely haven't drafted. \nThat should be very frustrating, not only to this Senator but to most of my colleagues, and it is exactly why the \n\n\n\nAmerican people seem to have less faith in this process in Washington, DC. Even more frustrating is that for 2 \nvaluable days, they have refused to allow the Senate to debate immigration measures. I do understand why the \nDemocrats are afraid to vote on ending sanctuary cities. Those policies of sanctuary cities are massively unpopular \nwith the American people. In other words, the American people feel that when the Constitution says that \nimmigration law is one of the 18 powers of the United States, then no local or State government should be able to \ninterfere with what the Constitution says is the supreme law of the land. I can't understand why, for 2 days, \nDemocrats have refused to allow us a debate on an issue like sanctuary cities. That amendment would help us \nkeep our communities safe from dangerous criminals, besides carrying out the intent of the Constitution that the \nFederal Government has complete authority over immigration. Who could be against an approach to send a signal \nthat sanctuary cities aren't justified when that is how to protect the American people from the criminal elements that \nsome sanctuary cities protect? Apparently, the Democrats are, since they don't seem to be for outlawing sanctuary \ncities. I guess another way to say it is that they could do more to protect hard-working Americans from the criminal \nelement that is, albeit, a small part of the immigration community we are talking about, but it still creates havoc for \npeople like the Steinle family, for example, where Kate was murdered by an alien who was a felon who had \nreturned to this country not once but five times. In other words, I have to ask my colleagues whether enforcement \nissues are legitimately a part of the immigration debate, and that is what the sanctuary city situation is all about. \nIsn't border security more than just throwing money at infrastructure? Shouldn't we be discussing how to reform our \nNation's laws so that dangerous criminal elements can't inflict harm on innocent families? I am pretty sure--I am \nactually 100 percent confident--the answer to those questions is yes. Those are important issues to the American \npeople. Those issues used to be discussed here. I have already mentioned the name of Kate Steinle, who was \nmurdered by one of these people. I could add the names of Sarah Root and Jamel Shaw. These people all had \ndreams, too, but they had their lives ended by felons who had been deported but had come back into this country. If \nmy colleagues were actually serious about debating this issue, we would be discussing border enforcement. Sadly, \nit seems as though the plans that I have seen so far from my colleagues fall short of that goal. Legalizing Dreamers-\n-yes, who is going to argue with that? A little bit of money for border security--there is a lot to argue about there. But \nnot doing something about criminal aliens who are a threat to law enforcement in this country and to the safety of \nour country--it seems to me that ought to be a part of it. So we get all the people in this room who say they want to \ndo something about border security by throwing money at it; yet they refuse to actually give our law enforcement \nthe legal tools that they need to protect Americans. Just a wall or whatever you want to call it--electric surveillance, \nmore border patrol--it is all border security, but it is more than a wall. It takes more than just those things to protect \nthe American people. I am here to tell you that it is a tragedy that some people in this body just want to legalize \nsome people for 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years and put maybe a little bit of money into border security with no \ncommitment to the future. Then all we have done is kick the can down the road. Worse still, none of my colleagues' \nproposals are being developed in a way that they can actually become law. Maybe for them, simply passing a \npartisan bill is enough. Leader Schumer said that this morning, and I was here listening to him. But that is not \nenough for this Senator. This Senator actually wants to see something passed into law that will provide real \nprotection for DACA kids. That is why I have offered an amendment that could actually pass the House of \nRepresentatives, and we know the President would sign it. Polls show that the framework a number of us \ndeveloped, along with the President's input, is overwhelmingly popular. A Harvard Harris poll showed that 65 \npercent of the voters agreed with our plan, including 64 percent of Democratic voters. So despite the hyperbole we \nhear from our colleagues, the plan that the President said he would sign is not only popular, but, again, it is the only \nplan that has any chance of becoming law. It is time for all of my colleagues to get serious about fixing DACA. It is \ntime to stop posturing, to stop showboating, and to stop simply trying to pass a bill out of the Senate that will not \nget considered in the other body and will not be signed by the President of the United States. The focus ought to be \non making actual law. If all of us here in the Senate, particularly those who are in the Democratic Caucus, focus on \nthose things, then the choice for them will be very clear. They will vote for the amendment that the seven of us have \nput before the Senate called the Grassley amendment, they will back the President, and they will provide real \nsecurity and real certainty to the DACA recipients and the American people. In fact, it is so simple for some on the \nother side who have been promising DACA certainty for years and some for a few months, but, more importantly, \nreally strongly over the last three or four months. It is an opportunity for everything you have told those kids, \nincluding that you are going to get them legal and even give them a path to citizenship that you can deliver. I yield \nthe floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak \nabout the issue that we are dealing with on the floor, and I am grateful for this opportunity. I wanted to first of all \n\n\n\nstress the critical urgency that we act to protect America's Dreamers. The United States is a proud Nation of \nimmigrants. Yet in September the administration insulted our values by announcing a decision to end the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals Program, which we know by the acronym DACA. Dreamers are young people who \nhave lived in our country since they were children. They are law-abiding residents who have learned English. They \nhave paid taxes, and they have secured jobs to support themselves and their families. Our government promised \nthem that they would be protected if they came forward, and now the administration, at least so far, has broken that \npromise. Democrats have been fighting for something on the Dream Act since the administration first announced its \ndecision on DACA more than 5 months ago. We have yet to vote on a single piece of bipartisan legislation to \nprotect Dreamers. I do, however, commend the bipartisan work of a number of my colleagues in both parties who \nhave come to the table to draft legislation that protects Dreamers and secures our border. With hundreds--soon to \nbe thousands--of Dreamers losing protection every day, it is critical that we come together to pass bipartisan \nlegislation that will provide permanent protections for these remarkable young people. Dreamers are deeply \nintegrated into communities across Pennsylvania, as well as in a lot of other States and across our country, of \ncourse. Dreamers work as nurses, caring for our families. They work as teachers, educating our children, and as \nservicemen and servicewomen in our military, working to keep us safe. Take a young Pennsylvania Dreamer whom \nI met a few months ago--way back, I guess, in September. She was [[Page S952]] studying to be a nurse. Talking \nabout her own life, she said: All I want to do is heal people. All I want to do is be a nurse. Then she became very \nupset thinking about whether or not she might have that opportunity because of what had not happened in \nWashington-- no legislation passed to protect her. Another Dreamer from Lancaster, PA--the Presiding Officer \nknows that part of our State well--is Audrey Lopez. Audrey was brought to the United States from Peru when she \nwas just 11 years old. Audrey spent most of her childhood in Pennsylvania, and her parents instilled in her the value \nof hard work and education. Like so many Dreamers, Audrey only learned that she was undocumented when she \nwas applying to college and learned that she did not have a Social Security number. Despite not having access to \nfinancial aid, Audrey worked hard, and she graduated from college. After graduation, she took a job in public \nservice working at Church World Services, assisting refugees with resettlement. This past fall, Audrey accepted a \nnearly full scholarship to American University, where she will obtain a master's degree in international development. \nAudrey is an American in every way but not on paper. She is continuing to work hard, despite not knowing if she will \nhave a future in the country she calls home. We should be supporting young, hard-working people like Audrey who \nwant to work in the service of others and our Nation. Instead, some, but not all--not all--Republicans are threatening \nher future--not only her future, but our Nation's future--by making us less safe and, frankly, damaging our economy. \nProtecting Dreamers is not only the right thing to do, but it is also good for the American economy, and it is in our \nnational security interests. DACA has enabled almost 800,000 young people to grow and thrive in America, \nincluding about 5,900 in Pennsylvania. As part of the fabric of our community, these impressive young people, like \nAudrey, provide an enormous contribution to our society, including paying an estimated $2 billion each year in State \nand local taxes. By contrast, repealing DACA would amount to a loss of $460.3 billion from the national GDP over \nthe next decade. So if you want to do it by year, it is roughly $46 billion a year for each of the 10 years. In \nPennsylvania, ending DACA would result in an annual loss of $357.1 million to the State GDP, according to the \nCenter for American Progress. Currently, about 900 Dreamers are serving in the U.S military and more than one out \nof every seven DACA-eligible immigrants has language skills that are currently in short supply in the U.S military. It \nmakes no sense to remove these Dreamers from a country they call home. I believe it is both wrong and \ndangerous. The American people overwhelmingly support allowing Dreamers to stay in the United States. It is \nabout time Congress listened to the nearly 80 percent of Americans who want to pass protections for Dreamers, \nalong with increased border security so we can prevent this situation in the future. So it is time for action. We need \na real compromise solution that will get 60 votes in the Senate and, of course, 218 votes in the House, and a \nsignature from the President of the United States. While I have advocated in the past for a clean vote on the \nbipartisan Dream Act, which is what I would prefer, compromise will be critical to ensuring we get something done \nand sent to the President's desk. In 2013, I and many others--67 other Senators--voted for a bipartisan \nimmigration bill that would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. That bill also would have mandated \n24-hour surveillance of the border using advanced technology, like drones, and it would have provided a pathway to \ncitizenship for law-abiding immigrants. There are a number of bipartisan proposals to pair Dreamer protections \nwith data-driven, sensible border security that focuses on public safety. I look forward to finally voting on these \nissues, and I hope my Republican colleagues will continue to work with us to secure our border and ensure that \nDreamers like Audrey Lopez have a future they can count on. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n\n\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER \n(Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to speak about our \nimmigration debate and my amendment in particular, but first let me say we are going to find out just how serious \nour colleagues are about granting not just legal status to the Dreamers--people who came to this country or were \nbrought here illegally when they were children and couldn't and shouldn't be held accountable for that action. The \nproposal that will be available for a vote later this week will not just grant legal status but will actually grant a path to \ncitizenship. It goes well beyond the illegal Executive order President Obama issued, and it will be available to far \nmore people than those who took up President Obama's illegal Executive order. It is really going to be an \nextraordinary moment. I hope we are able to reach an agreement on this because I think this needs to get done. Mr. \nPresident, I want to first address an amendment I have offered that is now up and pending--and I think we will be \nvoting on it at some point this week--which is all about keeping our communities safer by addressing the terrible \nproblem of sanctuary cities. This is a problem that one father in particular knows all too well. On July 1 of 2015, Jim \nSteinle was walking arm in arm with his daughter Kate on a pier in San Francisco. Suddenly, a gunman sprang out \nand opened fire, hitting Kate. She pleaded, ``Help me, Dad,'' as she bled to death in her father's arms. Now, any \nmurder is appalling, but one of the things that makes this even more appalling is that the shooter should never have \nbeen on the pier that day. The fact is, he was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of seven felonies and \nhad been deported five times, but even more galling is, 3 months before the day he murdered Kate Steinle, this \nmurderer was in the custody of the San Francisco Police Department. They had him. He was in custody. They had \nhim on an old warrant for a previous crime. When the Department of Homeland Security found out that the San \nFrancisco Police Department had this guy in custody, they immediately reached out and said: Hold this guy until we \ncan get someone there to take him into custody. We know he is dangerous, we know he is here illegally, and we \nwant to get him out of this country, but the San Francisco Police couldn't provide that minimal cooperation. Instead, \nthey released this man back onto the streets from which, 3 months later, he murdered young Kate Steinle. Why \nwould the police of San Francisco do a thing like that? Why in the world would they refuse to provide this minimal \ncooperation with immigration authorities with respect to a dangerous individual? The reason is because San \nFrancisco is a sanctuary city. That means it has as its explicit legal policy a prohibition that forbids their police from \ncooperating with Federal immigration officials, even if the police want to. It extends to other law enforcement, like \nsheriffs and deputy sheriffs. This is the case even when local law enforcement authorities believe the person is \ndangerous, and the local law enforcement folks wish to cooperate with the Federal authorities because they know \nthis person is a threat to the security of their community, but local politicians override the police and decide this will \nbe a sanctuary city. Such is the case with San Francisco, and so the San Francisco Police had no choice. They \nwere required by local laws to release this man onto the streets. One of the many ironies about sanctuary cities is if \nFederal officials had called the San Francisco Police about any number of other crimes--robbery, car theft, violating \na trademark, counterfeiting--any number of other Federal crimes, then the San Francisco Police would have been \nallowed to cooperate. They would have been happy [[Page S953]] to cooperate. They would have been able to \ncooperate, but because the crime was committed by an illegal immigrant, the police's hands were tied. The police \nwere forced to release Kate Steinle's killer. It is just unbelievable to me that we have communities across the \ncountry that wish to provide this special privilege--this special protection--for even dangerous criminals because \nthey are here illegally. It is unbelievable, but that is the case. Sadly, the Steinles are not alone. They are not the \nonly family who has been affected this way because, of course, San Francisco is not our Nation's only sanctuary \ncity. Philadelphia--the fifth largest city in America, the largest city in my home State--has an extreme sanctuary city \npolicy, and it has had appalling consequences already. Maybe the most heartbreaking of these is the case of \nRamon Aguirre- Ochoa. Ochoa was a Honduran national in the United States illegally. He was deported in 2009, \nbut he illegally reentered the United States, which is itself a felony. He found his way to Philadelphia, and in 2015 \nthe Philadelphia Police arrested him on charges of aggravated assault and various other crimes. When the \nbackground check went through, the Department of Homeland Security saw that the Philadelphia Police had this \nguy. They knew who this guy was. They knew he was here illegally, they knew he had been deported, and they \nbelieved him to be the dangerous criminal that he was. So they asked the Philadelphia Police: Could you hold this \nguy for 24, 48 hours, until we can get an agent there to take him into custody and begin deportation proceedings? \nWe know he is a bad guy. We want him out of the country. Unfortunately, Philadelphia Police had to refuse. \nInstead, they released him onto the city streets in January 2015. The Philadelphia D.A didn't feel like he had \nenough evidence to prosecute the case. He dropped the charges, and rather than cooperate with the Department of \n\n\n\nHomeland Security, they released Ochoa back onto the streets of Philadelphia. That was January of 2015. In July \nof 2016, Ochoa was arrested for raping a child under the age of 13. This brutal attack on the child was only possible \nbecause Philadelphia is a sanctuary city. It is these appalling cases--like the Steinle case or this case in \nPhiladelphia-- that make it so important that we end these sanctuary cities if it is at all possible to do so. My \namendment is a bipartisan amendment. It is identical to a bill I introduced and the Senate voted to consider in \n2016. I reintroduced it in 2017. It does two things: It tackles a legal liability for localities that wish to cooperate with \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and, with that legal liability problem solved, it imposes penalties on \ncommunities that choose nevertheless to be sanctuary cities. We don't have the authority as a Federal Government \nto dictate the policy that a local community must follow. There is a constitutional separation that gives them the \npower to do what they will, but we don't have to subsidize their behavior when it endangers all of us, and that is \nwhat my legislation goes after. So let me discuss first the legal liability issue. There are now at least two court \ndecisions that have put pressure on municipalities, localities, to be sanctuary cities. Over a dozen Pennsylvania \ncounties have done so. One is a Third Circuit decision; the second is a Federal district court in Oregon. They have \nheld that if the Department of Homeland Security makes a mistake and they make a detainer request--let's say it is \na case of wrongful identity. They ask a local police force to hold someone who, in fact, is an American citizen, \nshould be here and is here legally, and so it is therefore an erroneous detention. If that happens and the local law \nenforcement folks comply with that request, under these court decisions, the local municipality can be held liable for \nthe ensuing litigation on the part of the person who is wrongly detained. My bill addresses this problem by simply \nsaying that when a local law enforcement officer complies with an immigration detainer request from DHS that is a \nduly issued and bona fide request, then the local officer has the same authority as a DHS official. In a way, the \nofficer would be considered an agent of the Department of Homeland Security for this purpose, and the entity the \nperson would then sue in the event that a person is wrongly detained and their civil rights are violated would be the \nFederal Government. The responsibility should be on the Federal Government, since it was, after all, a request that \ninitiated with the Federal Government. My legislation does not in any way curb an individual's ability to file a suit if \ntheir civil or constitutional rights are violated, whether it is intentional or accidental. There is no curb on an \nindividual's ability to redress that if they were wrongfully detained. It simply transfers the liability from the \nmunicipality to the origination of the detainer request, which is the Department of Homeland Security. So that is the \nfirst part: solve the legal liability problem which has some municipalities across America--certainly in my State of \nPennsylvania--choosing to be sanctuary cities, even though they would rather not be. Now, having addressed that, \nif our legislation is adopted, and we have thereby solved this legal liability problem, if a community nevertheless \ndecides it is going to endanger all the rest of us by conferring this special protection on somebody just because they \ncame here illegally--despite the fact that they may well be a dangerous criminal--in that case, under my \namendment, that community will be deemed a sanctuary city, and under my amendment several types of Federal \nfunding would be withheld from it. Specifically, we would withhold from the sanctuary cities community development \nblock grants and certain grants from the Economic Development Administration. I think this is eminently reasonable. \nSanctuary cities impose costs on all of us. They raise the cost to the Federal Government of enforcing immigration \nlaw, but by far outweighing that is the cost to the American people of more crime and the unbelievable, staggering \ncost to families like Jim Steinle and his family, who lost their daughter. I think it is extremely reasonable to have as a \npolicy that if a community chooses to impose those costs on the rest of us, the Federal Government will not be \nsubsidizing it. Let me debunk some of the misinformation that is occasionally disseminated about my amendment. \nOne is that it is somehow anti- immigrant. This is not anti-immigrant at all; this is pro-immigrant. The fact is, the \nvast, overwhelming majority of immigrants in America, legal and illegal, would never commit these terrible crimes; \nthere is no question about that. It is also obviously the case that any very large number of people will include some \ncriminals among them. There are roughly 11 million people who are here illegally--11 million illegal immigrants in \nthe United States. Some of them are certainly violent criminals. It makes no sense to insulate those violent \ncriminals, however few they may be, from capture by law enforcement. It would be absurd to allege that this is \nsomehow anti- immigrant when quite likely some of their victims will be other immigrants. Immigrants want to live in \nsafe communities too. I am positive of that. They don't want dangerous criminals to be able to walk the streets just \nbecause they came here illegally. The second point I want to stress is that this amendment does not discourage or \npunish illegal immigrants for coming forward to report a crime. This is important because folks who want to keep \nsanctuary cities sometimes charge that if my legislation were passed, victims and witnesses to crimes, if they are \nhere illegally, wouldn't come forward. That is not so. My amendment in this underlying law explicitly states that a \nlocality will not be labeled a sanctuary jurisdiction for this purpose, and therefore will not lose any Federal funds, if it \n\n\n\nhas a policy stating that if a person comes forward as a victim or a witness to a crime, local law enforcement will not \nshare information with DHS. Let me be clear and explicit about this. We have an explicit carve- out in the legislation. \nIf a locality chooses to provide sanctuary status to a victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, such a community \nwould not lose any Federal funds whatsoever. We think that [[Page S954]] makes sense because we do want to \nencourage victims and witnesses of crimes to come forward. We get it. We don't want to create a worry that there \nwould be deportation consequences for them. A third point which some have alleged and which I want to be very \nclear about is that the penalties my amendment has for a community that chooses to be a sanctuary city do not \ninclude the loss of any funds whatsoever related to law enforcement or security. That is simply not the case. The list \nof categories that we include in lost funding is economic development in its nature. It is not at all law enforcement. \nAnother point that some on the other side have made is that somehow this legislation, my amendment, would \nimpose an unmanageable burden on law enforcement. One simple fact to consider is, if that is the case, then why \nhas it been endorsed by law enforcement groups? The National Association of Police Organizations has endorsed \nmy amendment. The International Union of Police Associations, a division of AFL-CIO, has endorsed my \namendment. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association has endorsed my amendment. Would these \ngroups endorse a bill that imposed an unworkable burden on their own members? I rather doubt it. I think they \nunderstand that this amendment encourages local law enforcement to share information with the Department of \nHomeland Security and in some cases to temporarily and briefly hold people in custody until the Department of \nHomeland Security can get there. This is a bipartisan amendment. In 2016, when the Senate voted on this very \nsame amendment in the form of a freestanding bill, it received a majority, and it had bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, a minority filibustered it and blocked it. But the fact is, it is a bipartisan piece of legislation with \nmajority support. I don't think it should even be controversial. I think we will have a vote on this relatively soon, in \nthe coming days. I hope it will have very broad support. This is common sense. It stands for the principle that the \nsafety of the American people matters, that the lives of Kate Steinle and other victims of violent crime matter, and \nthat all of our communities should be as safe as they can be. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from \nConnecticut. Parkland, Florida, School Shooting Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, watching the pictures today as I \ncame to the floor was deeply moving. Even though there is much that we don't know and a lot of information that we \nlack about what is happening at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, the images of emergency \nvehicles and emergency responders and of young people and children evacuating a school after another tragic \nincident of gun violence brings back memories that are searing and harrowing. Once again, we feel that churning in \nour stomach, that sense of gut-punch, and a wrenching of hearts that reminds us of how we felt the day of violence \nin Newtown. Yet another school is victimized by gun violence. We are waiting to learn more of the details, but \ncertainly our hearts and prayers go to the victims and their loved ones. Our gratitude goes to the courageous first \nresponders who are on the scene now apprehending the shooter and administering to the victims and survivors. My \nthoughts and prayers are with those students, emergency responders, parents, loved ones, and the community of \nParkland. Again, gun violence respects no boundaries. It spares no communities. It victimizes all of us, wherever it \nhappens and whenever, including the gun violence that kills people every day individually, often unpublicized and \ninvisible. My heart breaks to hear that one more school is facing this unthinkable horror, that again this harrowing \nscene plays before the people of America, literally unfolding in real-time. I know that I and all of the Members of this \nChamber share the grief and sympathy and heartbreak that community is experiencing today. Mr. President, I want \nto talk about the Connecticut Dreamers and share their stories and call for this Chamber to take narrow and \nfocused action to prevent their draconian mass deportation and protect them from that kind of very unfortunate \noutcome. The Dreamers who would be covered under legislation, which I hope will pass in the next 24 hours, came \nhere as children. They grew up as Americans. This country is the only one they know. English is the only language \nmany of them speak. They go to our schools. They serve in our military. They support our economy. They believe in \nthe American dream. All of us believe in the American dream, but so do they. They work hard and give back. \nDeporting the Dreamers would be cruel, irrational, and inhumane-- unworthy of a great country. It would break our \npromise to the Dreamers who came forward when they were told they would be given protected status and would \nbe a violation not only of the American dream but of the promise made by a great nation. Gabriela Valdiglesias \ncame to the United States in 2001 from Lima, Peru. She has lived in Connecticut for 17 years. She works for \nConnecticut Students for a Dream, advocating for her fellow Dreamers. For those workers, she has been working \non securing their right to safety, to higher education, to healthcare, and to live in a country without fear and \ndiscrimination. She shared with me some of the difficulties her family had while she was growing up. She and her \nfive siblings are supported by their parents, who work in minimum-wage jobs. She hopes that if the Dream Act \n\n\n\npasses, she will be able to take on some of the economic burden her parents now carry. She hopes she will be able \nto make enough money to support herself and her family. She is currently in her first year of college, at a \ncommunity college, where she has faced many financial challenges. Not being able to get a job at 18 years old is \nfrustrating and sometimes devastating. If the Dream Act is passed, she could finish her 2 years at community \ncollege and transfer to a 4-year institution, and she could pursue her dream of working as a lawyer or in the field of \nlaw. There are countless other stories of Connecticut Dreamers, some wanting to keep their identities confidential. \nThere is a young man in Bridgeport who was brought to Connecticut at the age of 5. He was educated in the \nBridgeport public schools. He majored in chemistry and now attends Fairfield University. He has excelled there. He \nfinished his first degree and was accepted at the University of California, Berkeley's physical chemistry program. He \nhad to live under the threat of deportation because he had no way to apply for permanent lawful status. While he \nwas continuing his studies here, he lived with the threat of deportation. There is a New Britain woman who was born \nin Mexico and brought to America when she was 6 years old. The journey was terrifying. She could barely \nunderstand what was happening. She had no idea at 6 years old that she was entering America in a way that would \naffect her for the rest of her life. It was not her choice to come here or to come here in that way, but it has affected \nher. In fact, despite her attending school and then going to college out of State at Bay Path University and earning a \ngreat many leadership positions there, she remains in the limbo of uncertainty and anguish and anxiety created by \nthe threat of deportation. She dreams about helping people, making sure that families with low incomes can have \naccess to occupational therapy. She is pursuing a master's degree in occupational therapy. Finally, there is a \nwoman I know who came here from Venezuela. She was brought here when she was 11 years old. She remembers \nher mother telling her that she was going to America to learn English. When they settled in Norwalk, CT, her mother \nalso told her that she could be successful if she were bilingual. She began to go to school right away. Life was \ndifficult at the beginning, and there was a lot to learn. By the time she was a junior in high school, she stopped \ntrying to get perfect grades because she feared colleges would not accept her, and even if they accepted her, she \ncould not be eligible for financial assistance because she was undocumented. But she persevered, and she \nattended community college. She went on to Western Connecticut State University, and she overcame obstacles \nthat for many Americans born here would be [[Page S955]] insuperable. Now facing deportation, she fears all of \nthose dreams and all of that work will be for naught. These Dreamers, in fact, have trusted America. They believed \nin America's promise to them. Coming forward, providing facts about their residence, their family, their job, and \nSocial Security number, they believed in America. It wasn't a dream. America is to be trusted. America is the land of \nopportunity. America is the greatest Nation in the history of the world. They have a dream that is American, which is \nthat they will have the opportunity to pursue their full potential as human beings to give back, to educate \nthemselves, and to better their lives. That is the American dream. In Dr. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' \nspeech, he said: When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the \nDeclaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note . . . a promise that all men-- And he might have \nadded women-- would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The time \nhas long since come for us to help the Dreamers. The time is today for us to protect them against mass draconian \ndeportation, a violation of a promise that would be unworthy of America. The promissory note of this American \ndream can be made a reality by this Chamber today and tomorrow. I understand that some of my colleagues may \nwant to change the immigration system. It is truly a broken system in need of comprehensive reform. That task is \nfor another day. Today, we must make sure that we provide these Dreamers with legal status and a path to \ncitizenship. That is our moral obligation. That is our job. Let's get it done. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the Senate is probably interested in the \nstatus of the debate on immigration. This debate started in September in hallways, committee rooms, and in our \noffices--opportunities for us to talk about these issues now for months. Several weeks ago, there was a government \nshutdown demanding that we actually have a vote on immigration right now or that we don't reopen the \ngovernment. After 3 days of government shutdown, the government was reopened, demanding that we move the \nimmigration debate earlier to make sure we would get this done earlier. Now it is Wednesday of the week that it \nwas supposed to occur, and the proposals are not out on the table. It has been a frustrating journey. I can't even \nbegin to count the number of hours I have spent in bipartisan conversations trying to circle around a simple set of \nissues. How do we resolve a small group of issues related to immigration? I thought this was resolved in some \nways. Back in early January, there was a large bipartisan meeting with the House and Senate to discuss what was \nwidely televised as the scope for immigration and the key issues we were going to address. It came down to four \nissues, and there was agreement among the leaders, among those in the room, that these are the only four issues \n\n\n\nwe are going to deal with: DACA and those DACA-eligible and how we move them toward citizenship, border \nsecurity and all the things around border security, diversity visa lottery, and family reunification. All of those have \nbeen dealt with in legislation before--in fact, for decades, in one version or another-- except for the issue of DACA. \nThat one is new. That is the only one that hasn't been done with legislation before. The others all have. The Gang \nof 8 bill in 2013 had border security and all kinds of different issues related to both construction of walls, \ntechnology, and legal loopholes. It had diversity lottery. It had chain migration in it. If you want to go back to an \nimmigration study during the Clinton administration, in 1995, there was a proposal put out by Barbara Jordan, the \nDemocratic House Member from Texas, who led that particular study during the Clinton administration dealing with \nchain migration, dealing with how we transition to merit-based immigration. This has been dealt with literally in \nhearings for decades, but what I have heard for the past several months is that there is no time to do any of those \nthings. The only time that we have is to deal with DACA. We can't even discuss anything else. Meeting after \nmeeting after meeting since early November, I have heard the same thing: There is no time. There is no time. There \nis no time. Now we are getting down to the day, and there is still a conversation about how we deal with these four \nsimple issues that we have talked about for months, that the House and Senate have debated for decades, and on \nwhich we have had an untold number of hearings for decades to try to actually land them, to get legislation ready, \nand to get this resolved. Let me just focus on a few things, because a few of us have put out a proposal that covers \nthose four areas that was a middle-ground proposal. It is certainly not everything that I would like to have in border \nsecurity, and it is certainly not everything that Democrats would like to have, but it is a middle ground between all of \nthose. It is one the White House has already announced that they will certainly sign. It has 1.8 million people \nmoving into naturalization, or citizenship. These are the individuals whose parents brought them illegally, but they \nwere children at the time. Those individuals came into the country. They have now lived here for years. They know \nno other country, on the whole. Those individuals are offered an opportunity to become citizens of the United States \n10 years from now. Why 10 years from now? That gives a time period of 10 years, which is commonly agreed that it \nwill take to be able to secure the border. In that 10-year time period, the border security could be put in place to \nmake sure we have a secure border. It is not an unreasonable thing. In that same 10-year time period, about 2 \nmillion people are going to move, actually, into citizenship. How does that affect the rest of our process? Well, let \nme tell you first how it affects it. Right now we have a 20-year backlog to be able to come into the United States \nlegally--20 years to be able to come through that process. Once we add another 2 million people in that process \nand all the family that will be connected to them, in all likelihood, that backlog moves from 20 years to 25 years. It is \nridiculous at 20 years, and it is even worse at 25. We all know that this issue of family migration and the broad \nallowance of people coming in, not based on what skills they have but based on being someone's brother-in-law, is \nnot the best way to do immigration, and we are the only country that does it like this. Seventy percent of the \npeople who come into our country legally come through a family connection--being someone's brother, being \nsomeone's sister, being a relative in some way that they are able to come into the country. Canada, just to our \nnorth, is exactly the opposite. Sixty-three percent of the people who come into Canada legally through their \nimmigration system come because they are bringing a work skill. Now, I don't want to oppose anyone coming from \nanywhere in the world. There is a uniqueness to the United States and how we handle immigration, and we allow \npeople from all over the world, from every country, to come. That should remain the same, but we should have one \nsimple requirement: They come to bring something to the Nation. I don't think that is too hard of a hill to climb. It is \nnot a matter of who you are related to. You certainly should be able to bring in your spouse and your children, but \nbrothers and sisters and other adults and such that would be in your family, maybe, should come based on their \nown merit, as well, for them to be able to come and be a part of our great culture, as well, or they are able to come \nvisit and come stay long periods of time but not necessarily come for citizenship, unless you are coming to bring \nthem. Again, that doesn't seem too difficult. The diversity lottery hasn't been the challenging issue. Quite frankly, \nthat has been an issue that was in the 2013 Gang of 8 bill, saying: Why do we have 50,000 visas for individuals \nfrom anywhere, from around the world, who can come who don't necessarily bring a skill at all? Why don't we just \nadd a skill requirement or an educational requirement? We could say that you are welcome to come from \nanywhere, but at least we should know that those who [[Page S956]] are coming from anywhere and everywhere \nbring something to the American economy. Again, that hasn't been controversial nor partisan in the past, and now, \nsuddenly, it has become that. The border security part of it has been the most confusing part of the debate for me \non this thing. Months ago, some of my Democratic colleagues over and over said: The wall will do nothing. There is \nno benefit in the wall. If you put up a 20-foot wall, there will be a 21- foot ladder. It will do absolutely nothing. Now, \nthe conversation is this: Well, we will give citizenship to DACA, and we will give you some money to build a wall, \n\n\n\nand we will call it even. That has never been the request, and everyone knows it. The request has been border \nsecurity, not just a wall. I am very aware that the President has talked about a big beautiful wall a lot. I get that. But \nit has always been about border security, not just about putting up a wall in certain places. There has never been an \nemphasis to build 2,000 miles of wall. There isn't a need for a wall in certain urban areas, but what is really needed \nis border security and everyone knows it. I don't understand why border security has suddenly become a \ncontroversial issue. What we have asked for and what we have laid out in a proposal seems to be a very middle-\nground proposal. It doesn't do interior enforcement. Quite frankly, our Democratic colleagues have said: Absolutely \nno additional interior enforcement--we are open to border security, but nothing that secures the interior of the \ncountry. So we have said: OK, that will be a future bill dealing with interior enforcement, but we do feel like border \nsecurity is very important. So they have said: OK, we will give you some money to build a wall in sections. Can I say \nwhat they are trying to exclude? Border security, when you lay it out, is also the legal loopholes. So here are just a \nfew of the things that we have laid out, which I don't think should be that controversial, that we have included in our \nlanguage and said: If we are going to do border security, let's be serious about it. For instance, we have asked for \nadditional penalties for people who do human smuggling. Right now, it is a slap on the wrist if you do human \nsmuggling into the country. So coyotes and others are able to do human smuggling into the country in transit. There \nare also people who are individuals in our country watching out for Border Patrol agents, radioing other people \nsaying: Hey, Border Patrol is here. Go a different direction. They are actually helping to divert people away. We \nthink we should increase the penalties. Our Democratic colleagues have pushed back and said no on that. It \ndoesn't seem unreasonable to increase the penalties for human smuggling and the same for drug smuggling. To \nincrease the penalties for those who are spying out and redirecting people who are doing drug smuggling doesn't \nseem too hard to be able to accomplish. We would like to allow an individual State and their National Guard to be \nable to participate with Border Patrol. Now the National Guard is not law enforcement. What does the National \nGuard bring, though? They bring helicopters that have infrared technology. They are able to fly over sections of the \nborder to be able to see the area below and to help direct Border Patrol to it. To participate with the National Guard \nand allow them to bring some of those resources those States already have shouldn't be that difficult. That is just a \npart of border security, but our Democratic colleagues are pushing back on that. We would like to do an initiative to \nbe able to work with Mexico and provide Mexico some additional funding and support and consultation on their \nborder between Guatemala and Mexico, the southern border of Mexico--what is literally kind of our first border. It is \ntheir southern border. We have been pushed back, though, to say that is not border security. It is slowing down \npeople illegally trafficking through Central America into Mexico. We think that is part of it. How about this one? All \nalong the Rio Grande in Texas, there is Carrizo cane that are there--this large cane that grows in the river in that \narea. In that area, you are able to hide people, drugs--whatever it may be--in this tall cane because you just \ndisappear in it. It is on both sides of the border. We think we should do an eradication of that cane so that you can \nactually see through it. It hasn't been controversial in the past, but suddenly it is controversial: No, we don't want to \neradicate the cane. That cane is only there because it is hiding people and contraband. We think we should be able \nto do that. We think we should be able to add an electromagnetic spectrum at our border ports of entry so you can \nlook through a vehicle, looking for chemical parts of the spectrum and to be able to see if we can eradicate drugs \nthat are being trafficked into our country. I don't think that should be that controversial. There is getting secure \ncommunications so that our individuals and the Border Patrol can talk to each other and can interact with other law \nenforcement to make sure no one from a transnational criminal organization is listening in. We should have license \nplate readers at the port of entry to be able to help track that and speed it up. Doing biometrics at the entry and exit \nis something that has been required since the 9/11 Commission. So we can accelerate that process that as people \ncome in and out of our country we know when they come in legally, but we also know when they depart legally. \nThere is dealing with what is sometimes called catch and release. Individuals who come into the country and cross \nillegally into the country are held in detention for a short period of time until they get due process, and every \nindividual gets due process. This is not trying to remove due process from anyone. But as they cross into the \ncountry illegally, we are able to pick them up, detain them, and make sure they have due process. Some of them \nmake claims for asylum or make claims of credible fear or other things. Instead of doing a hearing on that, we \nactually give them a piece of paper that is called a notice to appear and release them into the country and say: We \nwill see you in about 2 years for your hearing date--instead of actually doing the hearing right then. Nothing has \nchanged. No facts have changed. No information has changed. Nothing has changed during that time of delay. We \njust release them because we don't have enough judges or enough courts or enough attorneys or enough \nadvocates to be able to accomplish that. So they are released for years in the country. You may be surprised to \n\n\n\nknow that most of the individuals never show up for that hearing. They are just released into the country. There is \nalso a statement saying: Well, what about unaccompanied minors? Again, you might be interested to know that \nthree-fourths of the unaccompanied minors who cross into the country are actually 14 years old or up. These are \nnot 6-year-olds who are crossing in and 5- year-olds who are crossing in. Most of them are older teenagers. Two- \nthirds of the people who are coming in as unaccompanied minors are actually teenage boys, and most of them \ncome in to be able to work. So the question is this: How do we handle that? I think we do fair detention. I think we \ngo through the due process and make a decision right then. Again, you will be interested to know that for individuals \nwho actually do show up for their court hearing, which is a small group, about 30 percent of those who go to the \ncourt hearing do get asylum once they finally get to the court hearing. But we are not getting to the court hearing for \nmost of those individuals. That shouldn't be that controversial. We should be able to handle how we go through that \nprocess in an equitable and fair way. I would like us to be able to deal with the cost, quite frankly, of detention. We \nhave asked for a simple part of this process on border security, to honor the taxpayer, to say that we will not spend \nmore than $500 a night on housing individuals whom we have in detention. Now, I think most Americans--certainly \nmost Oklahomans--would like to stay in a hotel that costs $500 a night. Putting a cap on how much we spend on \nthat per person per night, I think, is a reasonable thing to be able to put into it, but we have had pushback. [[Page \nS957]] We have asked for emergency immigration judges. Right now there are almost 700,000 people in a \nbacklog in our immigration courts--almost 700,000. We don't think it is unreasonable to ask for emergency judges \nto come in to help us with the backlog. We are not talking about untrained judges. We are talking about judges who \nare in the Federal system who are knowledgeable of these issues and to do a surge of judges to help us get caught \nup. We should be able to do all of these things. None of these issues should be controversial. This is what it means \nwhen you start talking about real border security, not just adding a wall in some places, not just adding a couple of \nadditional agents but actually putting the things around them that they need to actually be able to enforce the law. I \nthink people lose track of the fact that ICE folks and Customs and Border Patrol are not enemies of our State. They \nare American law enforcement. They work for our country to keep us safe and to enforce the laws of our Nation. I \nam appalled at the way they are spoken of on this floor and treated in conversations. They are American law \nenforcement enforcing American laws. If there is a problem with what they are enforcing, this body should vote on it \nand fix the law, not beat up on the people who are enforcing the law and doing what we have asked them to do as a \nCongress. I hope in the days ahead we can actually get this passed. I hope we can actually move toward \ncitizenship for 1.8 million people, which the President has asked for, and I think it is a reasonable thing to be able to \ndo for those individuals who came into our country as children. But I also hope that this time we don't say that we \nare going to do citizenship and not do border security. I hope we don't just throw some money and pretend we are \ndoing it. I hope we, as a body, can have a serious conversation and say: Let's actually do border security and help \nus as a nation to establish a secure border. I hope we actually deal with some of the biggest issues on \nimmigration and can walk through this debate in a reasonable way without the emotion and heat, but thinking this \nthrough because this affects the future of our country for a very long time. With that, I yield the floor. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to \ntalk about an issue that has occupied this floor, this body, this Congress for some time now: the challenge of how to \nfix our broken immigration system. As many of us have debated and talked and tried to find common ground and a \nbipartisan path forward, I wanted to speak about why I have optimism that we can find a bipartisan solution to this \nchallenge. I know I am not alone in my optimism about this. One of my very dearest friends in the Senate, someone \nI respect and admire deeply, someone who knows more about sacrifice and patriotism than anyone I have ever \nmet, believes the same thing. This friend of mine is not just any Senator. It is Mr. John McCain, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, who also happens to be an American hero and someone who has literally fought for this country and \nits values throughout his entire life. He is someone whom our mutual friend, former Vice President Joe Biden, calls \na ``man of . . . deep conviction, and unmatched character.'' John McCain is exactly the person the Senate and this \ncountry needs in times like this, when the way forward is unclear, when our disagreements seem too wide, when \nour instincts are to argue rather than listen. This Chamber and this country need someone who is able to show us a \nway forward and lead us out of our stubborn, sometimes too partisan fights--someone like Senator McCain. As this \ndebate has progressed in recent days, I have been reminded of something I heard Senator McCain say late last \nyear when he accepted the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. When speaking \nabout our country and when speaking about the opportunity he has had here, he said: What a privilege it is to serve \nthis big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country. With all \nour flaws, all our mistakes, with all the frailties of human nature as much on display as our virtues, with all the \n\n\n\nrancor and anger of our politics, we are blessed. We are living in the land of the free, the land where anything is \npossible. The land of the immigrants' dream, the land with the storied past forgotten in the rush to an imagined \nfuture. What a country, indeed. Beautiful, brave, and magnificent, as John said, but also challenged by occasional \nfrailty, rancor, and anger that we have seen too much of in this sustained debate over immigration. The point \nSenator McCain made that night in Philadelphia--and the point he has made every day serving our Nation for more \nthan six decades--is that working through our disagreements, our divisions is worth it, not just as Senators but as \ncitizens. The whole point is, we may be boisterous and intemperate, which John has certainly also been accused of \nbeing a time or two, but we don't stop striving for our ideals, believing in our future, and respecting one another. \nThat is often difficult--especially here in politics--but it is the challenge that comes with the blessings of living and \nserving this great country. So I was honored when Senator McCain reached out to me a week ago to say: Let's \nwork together to introduce in the Senate legislation that could help solve our most pressing immigration issues and \nkeep our country moving forward. The bipartisan bill we have introduced--the McCain-Coons bill--in the Senate \ndoesn't solve every immigration issue we face, and it doesn't try to. What our bill does is focus on two issues right \nin front of us that I believe we can address and resolve. It is an attempt to break through what have been messy \nand divisive political debates and to address, through a compromise, legitimate, substantive issues in front of us. \nOur bill would do two things: secure our border and finally give Dreamers the pathway to citizenship they have long \nawaited for, and they deserve. First, to address border security, our bill would ensure we gain operational control of \nthe border by 2020 with new technology, new resources for Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and new \ninfrastructure. It would reduce the existing immigration case backlogs by funding new judges and new attorneys, \nwhile also addressing one of the root causes of migration into our country from Central America. Our legislation \nwould give certainty to 1.8 million Dreamers brought here as children through no fault of their own, who are \nAmerican in every way but the paperwork. Dreamers who continue to play by the rules by going to school, serving \nin the military, or being consistently employed can become lawful, permanent residents and, at least 5 years later, \nU.S citizens. Senator McCain and I aren't the only ones who think this bipartisan solution makes sense. In fact, \nthe reason we filed it here was because of the strength of its development in the other Chamber, the people's \nHouse, the House of Representatives. This bill was crafted by Republican Congressman Will Hurd of El Paso, TX, \nwhose district has more than 800 miles of the U.S -Mexico border--more than any district in our country with a U.S -\nMexico border--and his partner, Democratic Congressman Pete Aguilar, who is from Southern California. The two \nof them put this bill together after a lot of consultation and meetings with their colleagues in the House. Today, it \nenjoys 27 Republican cosponsors and 27 Democratic cosponsors. I often hear we shouldn't take up and consider \nanything that can't pass the House, but a bill that has 54 bipartisan cosponsors in the House is certainly on the \nright track. Now, I am clear-eyed about the fact that this McCain-Coons bill is not perfect, and I understand some of \nmy colleagues may want to make changes to it. Some of my Republican friends I have met with and heard from and \ntalked to in recent days have suggested it needs more investments in border security to win their support, and that \nis fine because our bill is more than just a set of policies. It is a way to provide a framework for us to agree and not \nlet our disagreements prevent us from moving forward. So my message is simple about this bill: We may not be \nable to fix our entire immigration system this week--in fact, I am certain we can't--but we can, over the next few \ndays, perhaps [[Page S958]] even over the next few hours, take important, even historic steps forward. We can lay \nthe groundwork for securing our border with new investments, new technology, and new manpower. We can help \nDreamers succeed in American schools, serve in our American military, and enrich American communities without \nliving in constant fear of imminent deportation. These are tough issues, but the solution can be fairly simple. I think \nour legislation offers a real solution for right now. There have been developments in recent days. I have been proud \nto participate in a large bipartisan effort by the Common Sense Coalition, and as it has, as a group, tried to \nhammer out a bipartisan deal, I have been honored to have started this discussion, this debate, with Senator \nMcCain by filing our bill that we brought over from the House. It is a bipartisan bill that I believe is the most \nbipartisan bill currently before this Chamber on this issue. If we can make more progress, if we can attract more \nbipartisan support through some amendments or revisions, I welcome that. I believe this week, this day, this \nopening on our Senate floor is not only a challenge but an incredible opportunity to do the right thing. We don't have \nto agree on everything. We just have to agree on some things, and we can find a way forward together. It is an \nenormous honor to have the opportunity to partner with Senator McCain in this legislative effort. While he is not \nwith us today, I know he is with us in spirit and watching our deliberations, and he is someone who has shown not \njust courage on the battlefield but courage in American politics--a determined willingness to compromise and to \nwork tirelessly to advance the interests of the American people. I can only hope my colleagues, when we get a \n\n\n\nchance to vote on this bill--which I hope we will later today--will join me in supporting it in recognition of his lifetime \nof service to our Nation and his commitment to bipartisanship. It is my hope that as this day and tomorrow unfolds, \nwe will have the open and fair process that has been promised, and that all of us, together, can do what we were \nsent to do: listen to each other, trust each other, work together, and find a path through compromise that can solve \nthese two most important and pressing issues in the field of immigration. Thank you. I yield the floor. (The Acting \nPresident pro tempore assumed the Chair.) Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. \nParkland, Florida, School Shooting Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, every day in America we face the devastating \nreminder of the toll of gun violence. Today, we are watching the horrific scenes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High \nSchool in Parkland, FL, where yet another school shooting has taken place. It is gut-wrenching. We know that so \nmany families have just had their worlds and lives changed forever by senseless gun violence. Ironically, this is the \n10th anniversary of a similar shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. Our prayers go out to the victims, \nto the families, to the first responders, and, of course, to the Parkland community. Honoring Commander Paul \nBauer Yesterday, Mr. President, in the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, we lost one of our finest, \nCommander Paul Bauer of the Chicago Police Department. He was shot and killed by a gunman in the Chicago \nLoop. Commander Bauer was a 31-year veteran of the CPD and the commander of the 18th police district in the \nNear North Side. He was a pillar of that community. He was well-known in his district. He had been commended by \nthe city council last year for a charity holiday party he helped to host for underprivileged kids. He was a husband to \nhis wife Erin and a father to a 13-year-old daughter named Grace. Commander Bauer was at a training session \nyesterday in the Loop, but he didn't hesitate to help out his fellow officers when they were pursuing a fleeing \nsuspect. Commander Bauer was shot several times by the suspect, and he died from his wounds. Chicago police \nsuperintendent Eddie Johnson said this was an extremely difficult day for the Chicago police family. Commander \nBauer was a hero in life. He made the ultimate sacrifice to help protect the city he served and the city he loved. His \nloss is a tragedy. Our prayers go out to the commander's friends, colleagues, his loved ones, and, of course, his \nfamily and daughter. 10th Anniversary of Northern Illinois University Shooting As I mentioned, Mr. President, today \nmarks the 10th anniversary of one of the most devastating shootings ever to occur on a college campus in America. \nOn February 14, 2008, a gunman with a history of mental instability walked into a lecture hall at Northern Illinois \nUniversity in DeKalb and opened fire. His bullets killed five students and wounded 17 more. It was a horrific mass \nmurder, and it shocked the entire Nation. The five young Illinoisans we lost that day all had bright futures ahead of \nthem: Gayle Dubowski, 20 years old, from Carol Stream, who worked as a camp counselor and was a talented \nsinger in her church choir; Catalina Garcia, of Cicero, 20 years old, a smiling, outgoing young woman who planned \nto be a teacher; Julianna Gehant, of Mendota, 32 years old, who served our country in the U.S Army and Army \nReserve and who went to NIU to study to be a teacher; Ryanne Mace, of Carpentersville, a 19-year-old, who was \nfunny and fun to be with and who aspired to work as a counselor; and Daniel Parmenter, 20 years old, from \nWestchester, a rugby player, who lost his life because he shielded his girlfriend from the shooter. It is heartbreaking \nto think what these five young people could have accomplished in the 10 years since that horrible day. We mourn \ntheir loss and, again, our hearts go out to their families. We remember and honor the wounded who still bear the \nscars of that terrible day. We renew our thanks over and over to the law enforcement officers and first responders \nwho headed toward the sound of gunfire that day and who treated the victims as they were wounded. We commend \nthe many members of the NIU community who stepped up in the days that followed, working to persevere through \nthis tragedy, with heavy hearts but unbroken spirits and moving ``forward, together forward,'' in the words of that \nNorthern Illinois University Huskie fight song. It is devastating to think that in this great country, students and \neducators could be gunned down in our schools. But it happens so often that I am afraid a numbness is setting in. \nJust in the last few months, we have had fatal shootings of students at Aztec High School in Aztec, NM; Wake \nForest University in North Carolina; Marshall County High School in Benton, KY; and then, today, in Florida. Other \ntragedies have been narrowly averted because of well-trained staff. At Mattoon High School in Illinois, a heroic \nteacher named Angela McQueen stopped a student gunman from causing a massacre there last September. The \nthreat of shootings in our schools is ever present. According to a tally kept by the group Everytown, there have \nbeen at least 18 incidents so far this year where a gun has been fired on a school or college campus. Schools and \ncolleges are doing the best they can to prepare and protect their students. I salute the educators and administrators \nwho are working hard, but is Congress doing all that it can to keep our Nation's students safe from gun violence? \nNot even close. Of course, there is no single reform that could stop every shooting in America, but we know there \nare big gaps in our laws that make it easy for criminals, abusers, and mentally unstable people to get their hands on \n\n\n\nguns that hurt innocent people. Congress has done nothing-- nothing--in recent years to close those gaps and \nmake America safer. Congress hasn't even closed the gun show loophole that the 1999 Columbine, CO, killers \nused to buy their weapons, and we did nothing in response to the murder of 20 first graders and 6 educators at \nSandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In fact, the only vote taken by the Senate on gun laws in this \ncurrent [[Page S959]] Congress was to weaken gun law safety provisions on the books. That was a vote that \nSenate Republicans brought up last year that prevented the Social Security Administration from alerting the FBI's \ngun background check system about people with mental illness. It is likely that before this year is over, the \nRepublican majority will call up more bills to weaken gun safety laws. That is the wrong response to the epidemic \nof gun violence in America. I am not going to give up on trying to close the loopholes in our gun laws. I am going to \nkeep fighting for universal background checks, tougher straw purchasing laws, and better laws to prevent gun theft. \nI am not going to give up because of people like Patrick Korellis, who was shot in the head 10 years ago at the \ntragedy at Northern Illinois University. Luckily, Patrick survived, and since that day, he has been a leader in Illinois, \nfighting for commonsense gun reform. I have come to know and admire him for his efforts. No one should have to \ngo through what Patrick went through and so many others went through on that day in DeKalb, IL, 10 years ago. \nWe owe it to Patrick, to the other NIU victims and families and community members, and to the hundreds of \nthousands more across America who have been killed and wounded by guns this past decade to keep trying to \nreduce the toll of gun violence. Maybe we can't stop every shooting, but if we do our best to keep guns out of \ndangerous hands, we will save lives. I intend to keep doing my best to achieve that goal. I yield the floor. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 1958, as \nModified Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I modify my amendment No. 1958 with the text at the desk. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment, as modified, is as follows: In lieu of the matter \nproposed to be stricken, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \n``Immigration Security and Opportunity Act''. SEC. 2.
