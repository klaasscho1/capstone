{"title": "Immigrants Aren't Servants For the Middle Class", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn \"Takeout Turnaround\" (Soapbox, July 11), I found Marissa Piesman's assumptions about immigrants offensive \nand condescending, as she describes the \"moral fiber\" of cooking and laments her eventual decline back into \ndelivery.\n\nHer most objectionable remark is to characterize New York as a \"port of entry for thousands of immigrants each \nyear who are eager to stop off here for a while and help feed my family.\" Whether or not Ms. Piesman is \nexaggerating for effect, she sacrifices a great deal of sensitivity.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible that many immigrants in the restaurant business do enjoy their jobs, it is equally likely \nthat many do not. She cannot even begrudge immigrants their right to stay in New York. In her eyes, they are \nmerely stopping off for a while.\n\nImmigrants are a vital part of this city and this country. They are not transients and they are not servants to the \nmiddle class.\n \nPALYN HUNG\nMorningside Heights\n \n \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
