{"title": "CHESS LEGEND ARRESTED ON 1992 CHARGE IN U.S.", "body": "\nThe hunt for Bobby Fischer, the unpredictable chess legend, ended this week when he was detained in Japan, \nwhere he awaits possible deportation on charges that he attended a 1992 match in Yugoslavia in violation of a U.S. \nban.\n\nThe Japanese Immigration Bureau detained the 61-year-old Fischer on Tuesday at Narita International Airport in \nTokyo at the urging of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe arrest capped a cat-and-mouse game between U.S. authorities and Fischer, who shuttled among several \nnations, including Japan, the Philippines and Hungary, to avoid arrest. A grand jury in Washington charged him in \n1992 with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by going to Yugoslavia for the chess match \nagainst Boris Spassky. The charge, handed up in 1992, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\n\nNotes\n\nWORLD NEWS IN BRIEF\n"}
