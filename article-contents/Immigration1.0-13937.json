{"title": "If You Want It, Work for It", "body": "\n Norma Menjivar said that Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. killed her chances of going to college because he \nvetoed a bill that would have qualified illegal immigrants for in-state tuition [\"Immigrant Advocates Say Fight Isn't \nOver,\" news story, May 22]. \n\nWhat rubbish. \n\nMy sister and I graduated from high school in Severna Park. We worked, saved our money, got scholarships and \nloans, and graduated from college. My sister has a master's degree. \n\nInstead of demanding entitlements from taxpayers, why can't Ms. Menjivar get a job and work her way through \ncollege as millions of U.S. citizens have done? \n\n LINDA H.
