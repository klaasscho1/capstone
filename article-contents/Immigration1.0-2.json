{"title": "Proposed Plastic Bag Ban Will Be Bad For Portsmouth", "body": "\nApr 06, 2015( Granite Grok: http://granitegrok.com/ Delivered by Newstex)             http://granitegrok.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2012/04/paper-or-plastic-tote.jpgPortsmouth has a Blue Ribbon Committee on Sustainable \nPractices and like any good committee it must forever practice things that sustain the committee. To that end the \nbusybodies have identified the next great environmental evil. \n\nSingle-use plastic bags are bad for Portsmouth (and the world!).[1] They plan to submit a proposal to the City \nCouncil to establish an ordinance to reduce their use and eventually (we must presume) eliminate them. The \npractical term for this is a bag ban (or Plastic Bag Ban) and it is one of those moments in the life of a municipality \nwhen you should realize that your city is at risk of being controlled-or is already controlled-by a pack of \nnumbskulls.Committee Chairman Bert Cohen states in a letter to Mayor Robert Lister and the City Council that the \nproposed ordinance 'will positively affect the city's impact on the earth's natural sustainable system in several \nways.' No, actually it won't. Not one of the assumptions for banning single-use thin film bags can be substantiated \nby actual evidence. There is no substantive or supporting science. It is all rumor, assumption, and misinformation. \nAlmost every one of the claims, perhaps all of them (I may not know what all the supposed ban benefits are), have \nbeen proven to be of little or no benefit to the municipality or the environment and bad in ways we shall explore \nhere. One of the most egregious evils is that the suggested alternatives to thin film plastic bags, because you have \nto replace them with something, are all demonstrably worse for the environment than the bags the busy-bodies \nenvironmental numbskulls want to ban. Thin film plastic bags have the lowest amount of environmental impact[2]. \nFor an equivalent amount of groceries,production of paper bags requires three times as much total energy and \nrecovers only 1 percent of that energy through combustion. Paper bags also produce substantially more landfill \nwaste. For an equivalent amount of groceries, single-use plastic bags produce15.5 pounds of waste while paper \nbags produce nearly 75 pounds of waste. Paper bags also produce more greenhouse gases. Plastic bags \ngenerate 68 percent fewer greenhouse gases than composted paper bags. Plastic bags consume 71 percent less \nenergy during production than paper bags. Reusable bags may be the worst of all. Such bags need to be used \n104 times to be less polluting than plastic bags. However, such bags are used only 52 times on average. In a UK \nstudy [3]I previously phttp://granitegrok.com/blog/2012/06/l-a-plastic-bag-ban-by-the-way-reusable-bags-might-be-\nworse-for-the-environmentosted here we found that any effort to reduce environmental impact from 'bags' used to \ncarry purchases from stores should not include encouraging people to change to reusable bags.Nor are the \nsynthetic alternatives to cotton 'reusable bags' any better. And most reusable bags are made overseas while the \nplastic thin film bags are made primarily in the United States. And what about Marine life. Portsmouth's Blue \nRibbon Committee on Regurgitating Environmental Nonsense was acutely concerned for Marine life. Cohen's letter \nstates that the proposed ordinance would lessen the city's contribution 'to the serious consequences broken down \nplastics present to all marine life.' 'The ordinance would also bring heightened public awareness to other every day \npractices that adversely impact the earth's natural sustainable system,' Cohen states in the letter. There is no \nconcrete evidence that a change in land based use of thin film plastic bags would have any impact on what actually \nends up in the Ocean but the general consensus is that if they do end up in the water they do not present any sort \nof meaningful threat to marine life. (Report.pdf [4]or follow links where provided.) [T]he National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) points out that there is no scientific evidence to support even the first claim \n(that large amounts of marine debris originate on land), noting that 'We know relatively little about what is lying on \n\n\nthe ocean floor or suspended in the water column. Because of this we truly can't say what the land- and ocean-\nbased percentages are with any certainty or accuracy.' -National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nFrequently Asked Questions: All about Marine Debris, October 2009, p.2. David Santillo, a senior biologist with \nGreenpeace, told a reporter at The Times of London: 'It's very unlikely that many animals are killed by plastic bags. \nThe evidence shows just the opposite. We are not going to solve the problem of waste by focusing on plastic bags . \nWith larger mammals it's fishing gear that's the big problem. On a global basis plastic bags aren't an issue.' - Time \nUK[5] David Laist, an expert on entanglement and since 1979 an analyst for the Marine Mammal Commission told \nThe Times that: 'In reality plastic bags don't figure in entanglement  The main culprits are fishing gear, ropes, lines \nand strapping bands. Most mammals are too big to get caught up in a plastic bag.  the impact of bags on whales, \ndolphins, porpoises and seals ranges from nil for most species to very minor for perhaps a few species. For birds, \nplastic bags are not a problem either. ' Sources CA Here[6]; AU Here[7]; Time UK[8] Wildlife entanglements of any \nsort are infrequent (and far less dangerous that wind turbines are to bats and birds), so with being of little or no \nbenefit to marine life and the replacements worse for the environment, are there any advantages to banning single \nuse thin film bags? That depends on what you mean by benefit, and I think we've shown here that there are none, \nbut when you are part of the Portsmouth Blue Ribbon Committee on Sustainable Practices you might need to fall \nback on platitudes and they have. 'The ordinance would also bring heightened public awareness to other every day \npractices that adversely impact the earth's natural sustainable system,' Cohen states in the letter. The sad truth is \nthat in San Francisco, a place presumed to be top heavy with busy-body liberal environmentalists proudly spewing \nleft-wing narratives, even after years of having a plastic bag ban in place, people are leaving more than their hearts \nthere  Just two years after the San Francisco ban went into effect there were more plastic bags in the waste stream \nthan before the ban, and during the great recession, no less.            http://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/San-\nFrancisco-waste-stream-audit.jpg Yes. some might argue that without the ban the problem would be worse, but \nthen those same people have argued all the other things we've identified as incorrect and they will continue to do \nso, suggesting that their priorities are misguided at best. At worst, they are pushing the ban to appear municipally \ntrendy and hip, making this yet another environmental Potemkin Village. But on a positive note this is not like the \nother environmental Potemkin Villages that take ten other villages to prop up their green boondoggles. The bag \nban has been proven to drive commerce, jobs (and that means money) away to neighboring municipalities. The LA \nplastic Bag Ban had an immediate impact on both the sales of retailers and employment [9]with regard to \nbusinesses who had to comply versus competitors outside the area of the ban who did not. County leaders \nassumed that the ordinance would eliminate the use of plastic bags and leave consumers with two choices: 1) \nshoppers could bring a personal reusable bag or other container to carry their goods, or 2) consumers could pay for \na paper bag, with the fee acting as a penalty or deterrent to this option.   They failed to consider a third option: that \nconsumers would shop at stores unaffected by the ban   that is, stores in the incorporated areas of Los Angeles \nCounty. They did not consider the possibility that commerce would migrate, or be displaced, due to the law. \nBusinesses that had to enforce the ban saw decreases in business and employment while those outside the \naffected area saw their business and job opportunities increase. So if Portsmouth institutes a bag ban we should \nexpect similar results. Less commerce in the city resulting in fewer jobs, with more commerce and job creation \noutside the bag ban limits in neighboring towns. If Portsmouth is feeling a bit too prosperous then, by all means, \nimpose a pointless ban on local businesses that accomplishes none of its stated environmental goals (and by all \naccounts should make matters worse) because the towns around you all stand to benefit at your expense. I wonder \nif those neighboring towns will have the sense to come and 'speak in support' of the Portsmouth ordinance? \nUpdate: I forgot to mention water. Reusable bags waste a ton of water from having to be maintained until \ndiscarded, that means laundry detergents, repeated washings, more waste water treatment, and all the energy \nrequired to attend to all of the above. And if you forget or simply don't bother cleaning them there are health \nrisks[10] and all the costs and environmental impacts associated with that.  Research: There are a lot of studies and \nresearch available. Most of it has been aggregated here[11], but you can follow these links to the source reports or \nother data as needed. Here are the typical lies, myths, and distortions that are used by bag ban supporters: Plastic \ncarryout bags are 'single-use' bags, or plastic carryout bags are only used for 12 minutes on average. Facts: Retail \nstores purchase plastic carryout bags for a single purpose: to enable shoppers to carry their purchases home. But \nas with many other items, that does not make it 'single-use.' Everyone knows that these bags can be reused for \nhundreds of other purposes.[i][12] In fact, the irony of targeting grocery bags for a ban is that they are likely the \nMOST repurposed and reused product that people bring into their home! People use them for everything from trash \ncan liners to disposal of used diapers to containing wet bathing suits after a swim to storing leftover parts. Plastic \n\nhttp://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/San-Francisco-waste-stream-audit.jpg\nhttp://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/San-Francisco-waste-stream-audit.jpg\n\n\nCarryout Bags should be banned because few are Recycled. Fact: The recycling rate is less than 5% using the \nState of California statistics for the In-Store Recycling Program[ii][13]           http://stopthebagban.com/Lies%2C-\nMyths%2C-and-Distortions.php#_edn2 and about 14.1% using statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA).[iii][14] What bag ban proponents conveniently forget to tell you is that according to a life cycle study by the \nUK Environment Agency that 76% of all plastic carryout bags are reused and that 40.3% are reused as waste bin \nliners and to pick up pet litter. In addition, the study claims that reusing a plastic carryout bag as a trash bag is \nactually beneficial to the environment because it avoids the manufacture and purchase of another plastic bag. \n[iv][15] Littered plastic carryout bags are carried by storm water into storm drains, the river, and end up in ocean \nwhere they harm marine wildlife. Fact: It is widely accepted that 80% of all plastic debris, including plastic carryout \nbags, comes from land based sources and is conveyed to the ocean via storm drains and rivers.[v][16] What bag \nban proponents fail to tell you is that communities are already spending hundreds of thousands of dollars installing \nfull or partial capture devices in storm drain catch basins, inlets, and outfalls so that the vast majority of littered \nbags can be stopped. These devices will prevent all trash, including plastic bags and plastic debris, harmful to \nmarine wildlife from flowing into creeks and rivers and making its way to the ocean.[vi][17] Efforts should be made \nat stopping, capturing, and collecting ALL litter, not drastic solutions like completely banning a product because a \ntiny percentage end up in streams. Plastic bags must be banned because they are littered. Fact: Plastic bags are \npart of the litter. However, the basic premise of the argument is that EVERYONE should pay because SOME \npeople litter. This is an illogical conclusion. Most of the bag ban arguments revolve around dealing with littered \nplastic bags. It is a litter problem they are trying to solve. No efforts are made to try to determine the cause of the \nlitter (such as homeless camps, people visiting a beach, or uncovered garbage trucks), but they jump quickly to the \nconclusion that all plastic grocery bags must be banned. If banning was the solution, then we would need to ban \nvirtually everything, including tires, mattresses, plastic bottles, trash bags, and everything else anyone finds in the \ncreek. Littered plastic carryout bags blow around easily. Fact: True; however this very fact also makes plastic bags \none of the easiest pieces of litter to capture and collect. Windblown plastic carryout bags have a large surface area \nand therefore a very high probability that the bag will get caught on a tree, shrub, stick, rock, fence, or other \nobstacle before it is swept downstream. In fact, it is virtually impossible for a plastic grocery bag to make it all the \nway down a creek to the ocean. Therefore, the probability of a windblown plastic carryout bag ever flowing down a \ncreek or riverbed to the ocean is very low. Plastic carryout bags kill 100,000 marine animals and a million sea birds \nevery year. Fact: This allegation is false. The claim originated with a misinterpretation of a 1987 Canadian study \nthat concluded between 1981 and 1984 that more than 100,000 marine mammals including birds were killed by \ndiscarded fishing nets. The study did not mention plastic bags. In fact, both the United Nations and the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified 'derelict fishing gear, including monofilament line, trawl nets, and \ngill nets' as one of the greatest threats to marine life and sea birds.[vii][18] Plastic bags are a commonly littered \nitem and account for 14.6% percent of wildlife entanglements. Fact: The statement is misleading. According to the \nOcean Conservancy 2010 Report[viii][19] a total of 336 wildlife animals were found entangled in Marine Debris \nworldwide in 2010. Out of 336 only 49 or 14.6% were entangled by plastic bags including 6 amphibians, 19 birds, \n11 fish, 6 invertebrates, 6 mammals, and 1 reptile. The largest cause of entanglement was fishing line with 126 or \n37.5% and fishing nets with 82 or 24.4%. The 49 entanglements out of 336 should be kept in perspective with the \nhalf-million birds including protected species that are killed each year by 'green energy' wind turbines.[ix][20] The \nPacific Garbage Patch is twice the size of Texas and consists of floating plastic debris. Fact: False. The Pacific \nGarbage Patch is neither a patch nor a huge mass of plastic debris floating in the ocean. Angel White, an assistant \nprofessor of oceanography at Oregon State University states that the patch is about one tenth the size of Texas and \nconsists of small bits of plastic that float beneath the surface.[x][21] Furthermore, the garbage patch consists of \nsmall hard plastic pieces, and no plastic bag pieces have been found. In other words, plastic grocery bags have \nnothing to do with the garbage patch. Plastic carryout bags are made from oil. Fact: False. Domestically \nmanufactured plastic bags are made out of polyethylene. Ethylene is made from ethane which is a waste by-\nproduct from refining natural gas[xi][22] and oil[xii][23]. Ethane must be removed from the natural gas in order to \nlower the BTU value of the natural gas to an acceptable level before it is delivered to homes and businesses for \nfuel. Ethane burns too hot if allowed to remain in natural gas and if not used to make plastic (ethylene) it will have \nto be burned off, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions.[xiii][24] By converting ethane into plastic greenhouse gas \nemissions are reduced. 'Using the ethane to make plastic does not in any way reduce the amount of fuel available \nfor transportation or power generation or increase our energy imports.'[xiv][25] The Polyethylene needs to be used \nand discarded in some manner, and plastic grocery bags is actually a very excellent and useful method of using up \n\nhttp://stopthebagban.com/Lies,-Myths,-and-Distortions.php#_edn2\nhttp://stopthebagban.com/Lies,-Myths,-and-Distortions.php#_edn2\n\n\nthe polyethylene by-product. Plastic carryout bags are responsible for severe flooding in Bangladesh in 1989 and \n1998. Fact: True and False. The severe flooding that put most of the country underwater was blamed upon plastic \ncarry out bags that had blocked drains and sewers. A careful examination of the issue will show that other factors \nare responsible. In many areas of Bangladesh people live in slum like conditions. Trash is deposited in makeshift \ndumps, along the road and in drainage ditches. Drainage ditches and canals are filled with trash. Less than 50% of \nall waste in urban areas is collected and disposed of in landfills.[xv][26] Hence, plastic bags were not the cause of \nflooding but an inadequate infrastructure for trash disposal and flood control. Plastic carryout bags can plug up \nstorm drains and cause flooding. Fact: True but rare. What plastic bag ban proponents do not tell you is that storm \ndrain catch basins are maintained on a regular basis where all trash is removed from catch basins and trash \nexcluder devices and properly disposed of in the landfill. In addition, in the event of heavy rains, flood control \npersonnel are on duty to handle situations that may come up. And they ignore the major source of storm drain \nplugging: leaves! We should be banning trees instead of plastic bags to keep storm drains clear! Californians use \n20 Billion Plastic Carryout Bags per year (500 per person). Fact: No one knows how many plastic carryout bags \nare used by residents of California per year. The 20 billion number is derived from the estimated weight of plastic \ncarryout bags in California landfills by dividing the estimated weight by the weight of a single grocery bag. The \nweight is corrupted by the inclusion of dry cleaning bags which are heavier than grocery bags. Also, since the size \nand weight of plastic carryout bags from different retailers vary, the method used to calculate the number of bags \nwill result in erroneous data. Using this same method of calculating plastic bag quantities from the weight of plastic \ncarryout bags distributed and reported by stores to the State of California under AB 2949/SB 1219 results in only 9 \nbillion[xvi][27] plastic carryout bags! In addition, common sense should be applied. Is it believable that an average \nfamily of 4 uses 2000 plastic grocery bags per year (40 per week)? It is more likely about half that number. Plastic \ncarryout bags do not decompose in landfills and will last thousands of years. Fact: True, but what is not mentioned \nis that nothing much else decomposes in a landfill either. Modern landfills are tightly compacted to create a low-\noxygen environment that inhibits decomposition. Modern landfills act like vast mummifiers. [xvii][28] Because plastic \nbags do not decompose in landfills means that they do not produce greenhouse gases during the decomposition \nprocess like paper bags will. Hence, that is an environmental benefit. Plastic carryout bags take up space in \nlandfills. Fact: False. Plastic carryout bags used as trash bags or to dispose of litter take up less space than \ntraditional plastic garbage bags. Plastic carryout bags that are empty should have been recycled rather than \ndiscarded in the landfill. Also, paper bags and reusable bags take up more space and landfill volumes that the \nplastic bags they replace. And as mentioned previously, if the polyethylene is not used for plastic grocery bags it \nwill be used for something else, and still end up in landfills in some form. Plastic Grocery Bags are a significant \npart of litter and money will be saved. Fact: Not quite true. City, county, and state governments spend millions of \ndollars every year to clean up litter. What bag ban proponents don't tell you is that plastic carryout bags make up \nless than 1% of all litter and will not result in an appreciable reduction in litter and therefore litter cleanup budgets \ncannot be reduced. Every dollar spent by jurisdictions to implement a bag ban and every dollar spent by residents \nto purchase carryout bags is basically wasted, since the amount of litter is not significantly reduced. In fact, it can \nbe quickly shown that all of the cost to implement and comply with bag bans ends up costing well over $10,000 per \nplastic bag saved from the litter stream. This money could be used much more efficiently in a broad based litter \nremoval effort rather than trying to ban single items. Bag bans are good for the environment. Fact: False. Banning \nplastic carryout bags results in an increase in paper bags usage from about 5% to 30%. Paper bags weigh more, \ncost more to manufacture and transport, are seldom reused, and take up more space in landfills than plastic \ncarryout bags. Furthermore, factors such as extra trips home to pick up reusable bags, or more frequent trips to \nthe store because the consumer does not have enough bags, or the energy to wash reusable bags are never \nconsidered. People are exposed to higher bacteria levels in the home than are present in reusable bags. [xviii][29] \nFact: True, but that is not the point. The point is that bacteria and E. coli in a reusable bag transfers to a packaged \nfood item on the way home, and when the package is opened, the bacteria transfers to your hands and to the food \nitem such that when ingested could make you ill. Most people prepare food items not on the kitchen counter but on \na cutting board or plate or pan that has been washed in the dishwasher and sanitized. [xix][30],[xx][31] Reusable \nbags must be washed and sanitized on a regular basis, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Prevention \nand Control (CDC).[xxi][32] Also, when is it logical to compare sanitation concerns with the worst possible case? \nOne always wants to be as safe as possible around food items. The people are too stupid to see things our way, so \na law is required to restrict them. Fact: Millions of people freely choose to use plastic bags on a daily basis. No one \nforces anyone to use a plastic bag. Businesses are not forced to offer plastic bags. Bag ban proponents feel that \n\n\n\nthe public has not freely accepted their 'the sky is falling' arguments against plastic bags and that everyone should \ngive them up because of the bad few people who litter them, and therefore seek to curtail the rights of individuals \nand force them to comply to their lifestyle. Plastic grocery bags could disappear tomorrow if they could convince \neveryone it is needed. But they can't, so they seek to forcefully regulate the people against their will. This is the \nbasic fact of bag ban laws. San Jose saw an 89% reduction in plastic bag litter after the bag ban. Fact: \nMisrepresented. First of all, the areas surveyed were actually different between the survey years. Also, non-plastic \ngrocery bag trash also was reduced by 30% in those survey areas, which was unexplained. Furthermore, they only \nmeasured the number of bags cleaned up, NOT the number of bags that remained in the environment after \ncleanup. Thus it is not a valid measurement of impact to the environment. But in reality, OF COURSE plastic \ngrocery bags were reduced, the city banned 1 million people from getting them! The main question is the \ncost/benefit analysis. For the millions of dollars in personal costs to the people of San Jose to comply with a bag \nban, they could have hired an army of plastic grocery bag collectors whose single job was to go out and pick up \nonly plastic grocery bags every day! Bag Bans are sweeping across the state, and everyone is getting on board. \nFact: Bag bans are being implemented by city officials on their people. City council members are under pressure to \nlook as 'green' as other cities around them. Yet the people NEVER GET TO VOTE on this issue. Bag bans are \nbeing passed by city council members who 'feel' it is the 'right' thing to do, or simpley to make a statement, and they \nignore the facts or cost to their citizens. Public comments and private conversations with people show a huge \npercentage of the population (typically about 60%) oppose bag bans and hate them. This is not a popular \nmovement, only a political movement. Anyone opposing bag bans works for the plastics industry or 'big oil,' or \nhates the environment. Fact: This is completely false. There are multiple citizens groups that oppose bag bans. \nPeople in those citizen groups care about the environment, never litter, take and use only the plastic bags they \nneed, and reuse virtually all of the plastic bags they bring home. Online bulletin boards are filled with citizens \ndecrying bag bans. People oppose bag bans because they do not make sense, the cost/benefit analysis does not \nadd up, and it is an example of nanny-state government at its worst.
