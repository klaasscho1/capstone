{"title": "NATION IN BRIEF;White House resists move to disband INS", "body": "\nThe White House reportedly is preparing to reject a federal advisory commission's recommendation to abolish the \ntroubled Immigration and Naturalization Service and assign its duties to other government agencies. Instead, the \nClinton administration proposes reorganizing the agency to clarify its dual ---some say conflicting ---roles of battling \nillegal immigration and giving benefits to legal immigrants.\nToward that end, it has hired a consulting firm, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, to help work out details of the redesign, The \nNew York Times reported today.\n\nWhite House officials insist that President Clinton and his top aides have not made final decisions and that Clinton \nwill outline his plan in the fiscal 1999 budget he will propose to Congress early next month. But other government \nand congressional officials say they have been notified that a White House review has decided in principle against \nsplitting up the agency, as the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended in September.\n\nEven before the administration's plan was formally announced, Republicans on Capitol Hill who have been \nexploring the idea of disbanding the agency, expressed skepticism that a reorganization plan would solve the \nproblems.\n\n \n\nFormer Georgia nurse pleads in killing\n\nA former nurse from Marietta pleaded guilty in Birmingham to manslaughter in the death of a 32-year-old \nparaplegic. Joseph Dewey Akin was sentenced to 15 years in prison after entering the plea. He avoided a third trial \nin the 1991 death of Robert Price of Birmingham, who was in Akin's care at Cooper Green Hospital when he died. \nAkin was also suspected but never charged in at least 17 suspicious deaths at North Fulton Regional Hospital in \nRoswell. He worked there in 1990.\n"}
