{"title": "INDICT BOSS IN SCAFFOLD FALL DEATHS", "body": "\nA Long Island contractor was indicted on five counts of manslaughter yesterday in a horrific scaffold collapse in \nManhattan that killed five immigrant workers last year.\n\nPhillip Minucci, 42, was indicted along with his company, Tri-State Scaffold & Equipment Supplies Inc. of Deer \nPark, in the collapse on Park Ave.\nSouth last Oct. 24.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Minucci designed and constructed the 13-story scaffolding \"in \nviolation of building codes, engineering requirements and common sense.\"\n\nHe said Minucci does not have an engineering license and didn't bother to have the scaffolding examined by an \nengineer. City building codes require that any scaffolding taller than 75 feet must be designed by a licensed \nengineer or architect.\n\nMorgenthau said the 90,000-pound scaffolding collapsed under its own weight.  Sixteen men - many of them \nillegal immigrants - were working on it at the time. Manuel Barariso, Ivan Pillacela, Efrain Gonzalez, Donato Conde \nand Fabian Cesar Tenesaca, all of whom were from Mexico or Ecuador, were killed. They were either crushed by \nthe scaffolding or asphyxiated by the debris, Morgenthau said.\n\nMinucci pleaded not guilty before Justice Arlene Goldberg and was released after agreeing to post $150,000 bond.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhillip Minucci\n"}
