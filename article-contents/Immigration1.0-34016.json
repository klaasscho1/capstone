{"title": "New policy, new starts", "body": "\nSTARTING WEDNESDAY, young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children can apply to call off \ndeportations and get a work permit.\n\nIn New York State, an estimated 80,000 immigrants between the ages of 15 and 30 could benefit, according to an \nImmigration Policy Center analysis.\n\nThe new policy, called \"deferred action,\" appears to be well-timed to court voters; after President Obama \nannounced it this summer, a Quinnipiac poll found a boost in his support among Latino voters in Florida.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has said he plans to sue the President over the move.\n\nYoung people who are in high school, have graduated, or received a GED can apply. Honorably discharged \nveterans also are eligible.\n\nThe status - which must be renewed every two years - does not provide a path to citizenship.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nNLVL\n"}
