In November 2017, the Sevastopol City Court found him guilty of attempted \nsabotage and illegally possessing weapons. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nHuman rights activists say Russia-installed authorities in Crimea have jailed numerous Ukrainian citizens on \npolitically motivated charges since Russian military forces occupied the Ukrainian peninsula in early 2014 and, less \nthan a month later, seized the territory through a dubious referendum.\n\nWith reporting by TASS and Interfax\n\nCopyright (c) 2011.
