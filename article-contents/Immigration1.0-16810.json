{"title": "15 IMMIGRANTS WHO FLED WTC NOW SEEK VISAS", "body": "\nFIFTEEN ILLEGAL immigrants injured in the terror attacks have asked the NYPD to help them qualify for special \nvisas for crime victims, the Daily News has learned.\n\nThe U-visa grants people without legal status temporary relief - if they can prove they suffered substantial physical \nor mental harm in a crime.\n\n\"We were evacuated, we were injured,\" said Oscar, 32, a Washington Heights resident who has been taking anti-\ndepresants since fleeing the World Trade Center on 9/11. \"The certification should be given to us.\"\n\nBut a law enforcement official must certify victims' claim - and the New York Police Department maintains the issue \nis outside its jurisdiction.\n\nMayor Bloomberg's office said in a statement that it wanted to help the immigrants, but that the FBI is the agency \nauthorized to issue certification.\n\n\"We're not involved with these visas,\" said a police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Councilman Hiram Monserrate said the NYPD's hand-in-hand work with federal agencies during and after the \nattacks gives it jurisdiction.\n\n\"For the people who escaped with their lives - was there an intent to kill them, hurt them? Were they either \nphysically or mentally injured by Sept. 11? Absolutely,\" said Monserrate (D-Queens), a former cop.\n\nThe city has issued U-visa certification before - primarily to victims of domestic violence, said Shawn Saucier, a \nspokesman with the U.S. Immigration and Service Center.\n\nSince lawmakers approved U-visas in 2000, 1,800 people have applied, including many from New York City, \nSaucier said.\n\n\"Congress didn't imagine this would happen and that the visa would be used for 9/11,\" Saucier added. \"But we \nhave adjudicated three cases.\"\n\nlcasimir@nydailynews.com\n\n"}
