SAYS A 'SOVIET FRONT' WON'T GET VISAS", "body": "\nThe State Department said today that except in ''special circumstances,'' visas for ''members of Soviet-front \ngroups'' wanting to attend the United Nations disarmament sessions would not be granted by the United States. \nThe sessions start in New York on Monday.\n\nThe department defined the ''World Peace Council, its affiliates, and other Soviet-dominated and similar \norganizations'' as ''Sovietfront groups.''\n\n''Barring special circumstances we expect that visas will not be issued to members of Soviet-front groups,'' the \ndepartment said in a two-page statement released today on its visa policy toward the World Peace Council and \nassociated organizations.\nWASHINGTON, June 4 - The State Department said today that except in ''special circumstances,'' visas for \n''members of Soviet-front groups'' wanting to attend the United Nations disarmament sessions would not be \ngranted by the United States.Earlier Figure Incorrect\n\nRestricted-travel visas have been granted or are being granted to 32 members of the World Peace Council who \nreceived official invitations from the United Nations to the disarmament sessions, a department spokesman, Alan \nRomberg, said. Mr. Romberg said that an earlier figure of 50, released by the department, had been incorrect.\n\nThe restricted visas were issued in accordance with an agreement between the United States and the United \nNations that says that persons who have official invitations from the U.N. for U.N. business will be permitted to \nenter the United States, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.\n\nThe restricted visas, which limit travel to within 25 miles of Columbus Circle, are known as C-2 visas. They are \nissued for a maximum of 29 days, the Immigration spokesman, Duke Austin, said.\n\nIn New York, Judge Pierre M. Leval of Federal District Court refused to order the Justice Department to process by \nMonday night the visa applications of 347 antinuclear-war activists, many from Japan, who want to attend the \nUnited Nations disarmament conference.\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union had complained of delays in visa processing, but the judge said that many of \nthe applications had been ''submitted at the last minute'' and that there was no indication the Government was \nacting ''in bad faith.''\n\n \n\nSpeakers' Platform Sought\n\n\nMeantime, organizers of a June 12 antinuclear march and rally in New York asked the Police Department for \npermission to set up a speakers' platform at 47th Street and First Avenue, the starting point for the march. Police \nofficials were considering the request.\n\nMr. Romberg said that visa applications from 380 Japanese who did not have official invitations were under review \nby the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Forty-eight other visa applications from non-Japanese who did not \nhave official invitations were also under review, he said.\n\nMr. Romberg said he did not know whether all the applications under review were from the World Peace Council.  \nThe policy statement on visas for the monthlong Second Special Session on Disarmament said in part: ''We do not \nhave a policy of denying visas to advocates of nuclear disarmament.  ''As for Soviet-front groups, we are carefully \nreviewing visa applications from members of the World Peace Council, its affiliates, and other Soviet-dominated \nand similar organizations who are seeking to exploit activities related'' to the United Nations disarmament sessions \n''just as they have sought to exploit peace movements elsewhere.''\n\n \n\n'Longstanding Affiliation'\n\nThe statement continued: ''Cases will be reviewed individually to determine special circumstances. The World \nPeace Council and its affiliates have longstanding direct political and financial affiliation with the Communist Party \nof the Soviet Union.\n\n''The Council's activities, policy line and financing indicated that it is an instrument of Soviet policy. Their actions led \nto their expulsions from other Western democracies in earlier years.\n\n''Further details of the Council activities are outlined in the April 1982 Department of State publication entitled \n'World Peace Council: Instrument of Soviet Policy.'\n\n''The World Peace Council and its affiliates are thus among the types of organizations defined in section 212 (a) \n(28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which render ineligible for a visa anyone who is a member of or affiliated \nwith such an organization.''\n\nMr. Romberg said that the visa reviews were being conducted under the process set up by the McGovern \nAmendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act. The amendment requires the State Department to seek waivers \nfrom the Immigration and Naturalization Service for those who would be barred from entry because of affiliation with \nCommunist groups.\n"}
