Two weeks before a \nsweeping new immigration policy is set to take effect, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a 25-page \nset of corrections to the final version of the 'public charge' rule, including fixes to substantive errors that ProPublica \nwrote about in August[4]. Immigrant advocates said the extent of the corrections to the rule, which will make it \nharder for low-income migrants to enter the U.S., underscores their contention that the Trump administration \naggressively pushed major policy changes without taking sufficient time to ensure clarity and precision. In all, the \nagency fixed 65 items in the regulation, correcting 36 distinct errors, ProPublica found. \n\nMost changes are typographical but some are important modifications to the complex policy, which consumed 217 \npages of three-column text in the Federal Register when the final version appeared in August. (A draft version was \npublished in October 2018.) The final rule garnered over 266,000 public comments, the vast majority opposed to \nthe changes. After the final rule was published, ProPublica found[5] substantive, sloppy mistakes[6] that suggested \nimmigrants married to U.S. citizens would be treated more harshly than immigrants married to noncitizens.

That specific \nprovision pertained to how the new rule applies to military families. The final rule stated that active-duty service \nmembers who are immigrant noncitizens would be allowed to use benefits without having it weigh against them as a \n'public charge' in the future, as would their family members. But immigrants who are the spouses or children of \nactive-duty service members who are U.S. citizens were not included in the exception, meaning their use of benefits \nwhile their spouses were on active duty could jeopardize their future in the U.S. Throughout the regulation and its \nsupporting documents, there were contradictions on this issue. Now, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \nhas clarified that it correctly described the regulation elsewhere, but that it 'inadvertently' left the spouses and \nchildren of U.S.-citizen service members out of the regulatory text. The corrections released Tuesday also fix a \nsubstantive error that would have made some temporary visa holders ineligible for waivers to the public charge test. \nCorrections to final regulations are common. In addition to the 'public charge' corrections, the government issued \ncorrections Tuesday to other publicly released documents from both the Commerce Department and the Treasury. \nBut regulatory experts said the extent of the corrections made to the public charge rule are unusual, even for a \ncomplicated policy change. 'This is more than what would seem typical,' said Bridget C.E. Dooling, a professor at \nGeorge Washington University who previously worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the \nfederal office that manages the regulatory process. She noted that Medicare payment rules can run to thousands of \npages in the Federal Register, yet they usually garner just a few pages of corrections. Sean Moulton, a senior policy \nanalyst at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said the list of corrections was 'surprisingly long' and \nraises questions of whether 'they messed up and skipped some editorial or revision review before publishing.' In a \n\n\nstatement to ProPublica, USCIS spokesman Matthew Bourke said that the final rule 'underwent several layers of \nreview and coordination,' and that 'a significant majority of corrections were simple typographical errors.' The public \ncharge rule, which immigration and public health experts believe has already had a chilling effect on the use of \npublic benefits by immigrant families, even those not directly affected by the rule, has been a major Trump \nadministration priority as it seeks to limit legal immigration to the U.S. White House senior policy adviser Stephen \nMiller pushed[9] USCIS last year to finish the rule quickly, emails[10] revealed by Politico show. 'It's pretty rare to \nsee just such an overwhelming volume of errors made in a final rule, and that tells you something about the integrity \nand assiduousness of the rule-making process,' said Doug Rand, a founder of Boundless Immigration, a company \nthat helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship. The nature of the errors reinforces that idea. In addition to \nthe error affecting military families, the other substantive error fixed by USCIS on Tuesday would have created a \ndouble standard for temporary ('nonimmigrant') visa holders. In the rule published in August, individuals who were \napplying to extend their current visa, and people trying to change from one temporary visa to another, would both \nhave to demonstrate they hadn't used benefits above a certain threshold. The regulation on extensions of existing \nvisas said that the benefits test wouldn't apply to people for whom the public-charge requirement had been waived. \nThe regulation on changes between different types, however, didn't include that phrase \u2014 meaning that some \ntemporary migrants would be eligible for waivers and others would not. 'DHS never intended to treat extensions of \nstay and changes of status differently in this regard,' the corrections document says. The rule has now been \ncorrected so that waivers will be available for both types of visa holders. A few of the minor errors \u2014 typos \u2014 in the \nrule could have caused problems or confusion. At one point, because of a typo, the rule published in August \nprevented immigrants from getting bonds back if they'd used too many public benefits in a '364month period' \u2014 as \nopposed to a 36-month period.

We Found Substantive, Sloppy Mistakes.[11] Trump's new immigration policy \napplies more harshly to families of U.S. citizens in the military than to families of noncitizens in the military. Experts \nthink it's an error that suggests officials are pushing policies even they don't fully understand.  Others simply \nsuggest carelessness. At one point, the text of the published final rule still refers to the 'proposed rule' \u2014 indicating \nthat text was copied from the draft published in 2018 and never updated. On several occasions, forms are referred \nto without the word 'form' in front of them; on one occasion, a form is called an 'I-Form 539' instead of a 'Form I-\n539.' And many of the tables in the rule had to be renumbered, once officials realized that Table 7 had been \nmislabeled as 'Table 2' \u2014 throwing off the numbering of subsequent tables as well. Bourke, the USCIS spokesman, \nattributed the typos and need for clarifications to the length of the document and the hundreds of thousands of \npublic comments the regulation garnered. American states, cities, counties and nonprofit organizations quickly filed \nfederal lawsuits challenging the final public charge rule after it was released. An Aug. 26 motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in one of the suits, filed by the states of California, Maine, Pennsylvania and Oregon, and the District of \nColumbia, noted[12] the contradictions on the military families issue, calling it an 'unwarranted discrepancy.' On \nWednesday, a federal judge is set to hear arguments on the motion. 'The corrections will not affect the scheduled \nimplementation or how USCIS will apply the final rule,' Bourke said. 'The agency is on track to begin implementing \nthe public charge inadmissibility rule later this month.' Rand, who worked on immigration issues as a White House \nofficial in the Obama administration, noted that USCIS has yet to issue the final version of the lengthy new form for \nimmigrants to document their financial situation and benefits history. The form will be required for applications \nsubmitted on, or after, Oct. 15. Traditionally, the agency provides approximately two months' notice for even minor \nchanges to USCIS forms. In this case, however, they will have at most two weeks. 'All relevant forms will be posted \non USCIS website by implementation date,' Bourke said.
