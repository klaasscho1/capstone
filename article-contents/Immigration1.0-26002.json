{"title": "Missouri: Group Membership Prompts a Resignation", "body": "\nA member of the Kansas City Parks Board resigned after her membership in an anti-illegal-immigration group led \ntwo organizations, the National Council of La Raza and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to hold their \nannual conventions elsewhere. The board appointee, Frances Semler, 74, a member of the  Minuteman Civil \nDefense Corps,  said she resigned because her involvement with the group had become too contentious and \nbecause she did not feel that Mayor Mark Funkhouser supported her. Ms. Semler defended her involvement with \nthe group, which advocates vigilante patrolling of the Mexican border and reports illegal immigrants. ''I'm a decent, \nnice person that happens to belong to the Minutemen and thinks our borders should be protected and our laws \nupheld,'' she said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
