{"title": "Washington: EXECUTIVE SESSION", "body": "\n Washington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following house proceeding:\n\n  \n\n  EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to resume consideration of the nomination of Elisabeth Prince DeVos to be Secretary of \nEducation, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Elisabeth Prince \nDeVos, of Michigan, to be Secretary of Education. \n\nRecognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. The Cabinet \nMr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise this morning to speak directly to my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nNow is the time to put country before party. I understand the pull of party loyalty. I understand deference to a new \nPresident. But from what we have seen in the first 2 weeks of this administration, party loyalty is demanding too \nmuch of my Republican colleagues on several issues. On the matter of the Cabinet, on the matter of the President's \nExecutive order on immigration, and on the matter of dealing with Russia, we need Republicans to set aside \npartisan considerations in favor of doing what is best for the country; otherwise, our institutions of government, our \nConstitution, and our core American ideals may be eroded. My friends on the other side of the aisle are going along \nwith the President and treating many of these things as if they are normal, but America knows they are not. We \nneed Republicans to start recognizing it, saying it, and stepping up to the plate to do something about it. I \nunderstand my Republican colleagues will go along with the President 90 percent of the time, but there are certain \nissues that are too important that demand putting country above party. Now is the time to put country above party. \nFirst, on the Cabinet, our norms of good government and above all ethics are being tested by a Cabinet unlike any \nother I have seen in my time in public office. There are so many billionaires with so many conflicts of interest and so \nlittle expertise in the issues they would oversee. Take the nomination we are now considering: Betsy DeVos for \nEducation Secretary. In my mind she is the least qualified nominee in a historically unqualified Cabinet. On conflicts \nof interest, she ranks among the worst. In her ethics agreement, which was delivered to the committee after the first \nhearing, it was revealed that she keeps interests in three family-owned trusts that have holdings in companies that \ncould be affected by matters related to the Department of Education. Independent ethics watchdogs have criticized \nher ethics agreement for failing to deal with these conflicts of interest. On philosophy of education, her views are \nextreme. She seems to constantly demean the main purpose of her job--public education. Nine out of 10 American \nkids attend public schools. Her views on public education are a major concern, particularly for Senators from rural \nareas. There is not a lot of choice of schools outside major metropolitan areas. If you don't have a good public \n\n\nschool in your neighborhood or in your community, you have nothing. Any Senator from a rural State should be \nworried about her commitment to public education. [[Page S686]] We in New York have the third largest rural \npopulation in America. I am worried for those schools where, if the school is no good, you don't have much choice; \nyou don't have any choice. Above all, and on basic competence, Mrs. DeVos has failed to make the grade. She \ndidn't seem to know about the Federal education law that guarantees education to students with disabilities. She \ncould not unequivocally say that guns shouldn't be in the schools, and she didn't seem to know about a long \nsimmering debate in education policy about measuring growth versus proficiency. Frankly, Mrs. DeVos's answers at \nthe hearings were embarrassing, not only for her but for my Republican colleagues on the committee who rushed \nher nomination through with 5 minutes of questions, only one round, and at 5 p.m. Cabinet Secretaries can't be \nexpected to know everything, but this is different. The nominee for Secretary of Education doesn't know some of the \nmost basic facts about education policy. She has failed to show proficiency, and there is no longer any time for \ngrowth. The American people are speaking in one loud voice against this nominee. I have had many people come \nup to me in New York and say: I voted for Donald Trump, but I am making calls about this nominee. Americans \nacross the country in red and blue States have been flooding our offices with phone calls and emails, asking the \nSenate to vote no on Betsy DeVos. Local newspaper editorial boards, many of whom have endorsed Trump, are \nsaying the same thing. My friends, the Senators from Maine and Alaska, were profiles in courage last week when \nthey announced their opposition to her nomination, but, unfortunately, so far they are the exception. We need just \none more vote, and we can get a Secretary of Education who is a lot better than the one who was nominated. I ask \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle to follow the courageous example of the Senators from Maine and \nAlaska. We have an obligation as Senators--not as Republicans and not as Democrats, but as Senators--to \nevaluate these nominees and their fitness for office because these nominees are going to wield immense power \nover the lives of Americans for the next 4 years. I ask my Republican colleagues to look into their conscience and \ncast their votes tomorrow, not based on party loyalty but based on whether or not Mrs. DeVos is qualified to be our \nNation's leader on education policy. If one doesn't measure up, the Senate has a responsibility to reject the \nnomination. I realize it rarely occurs, but this should be an exception because she is so uniquely unqualified, \nwhether it comes to competence, whether it comes to philosophy against the public schools, or whether it comes to \nconflicts of interest, which still exist in far too many instances with Mrs. DeVos. Travel Ban Madam President, \nsecond, the President's Executive order on immigration and refugees is so poorly constructed, so haphazardly \nimplemented, so constitutionally dubious, so wrong in terms of what America is all about, and so contrary to our \nbasic values as Americans that my Republican friends should feel a duty to country to help us rescind it. Several \nMembers on the other side--I think it is over a dozen--have expressed concerns about it. Several spoke out strongly \nand unequivocally about imposing any type of ban during the campaign, but now that we have such a ban, they are \nunfortunately silent. It is time for that silence to end and for Republicans to step up to the plate and start backing up \ntheir words with actions. On Friday, the order was temporarily blocked by a Federal judge, Judge Robart. On \nSaturday, the President questioned his court credibility via tweet and then asked the country to blame any potential \nattacks on the country on the judge and the courts. He is not a ``so- called'' judge as the President tweeted but \nrather a Senate-confirmed Bush appointee. That is not how we do things here in America. There is a separation of \npowers for a reason. An independent judiciary is absolutely necessary to ensure Presidents and Congresses do not \nbreak the law or impinge on the Constitution, but this President has shown a certain callousness when it comes to \njudges who rule against his whim--Judge Curiel during the campaign and Judge Robart now. Instead of attacking \nthe judge, the President should be working with Congress to tighten up security where it is actually needed. The \nPresident has said that if there are attacks, the judge will be to blame. I will remind him that not one attack on U.S. \nsoil has been perpetrated by a refugee from one of the seven countries in the Executive order. This order doesn't \nmake us any safer; if anything, the Executive order increases the risk of lone wolf attacks, our greatest threat. That \nis what happened in San Bernardino, it is what happened in Orlando, and no authority less than Senator John \nMcCain has said exactly that--that it will increase the likelihood of attacks by lone wolves, those disaffected people \nwho are egged on by the evil ISIS. So I make this offer to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Join Democrats \nin rescinding the Executive order, and we will work with you in a bipartisan way in good faith to actually make our \ncountry safer. Close up that visa waiver program where people from countries-- just because they are generally \nfriendly to us--are not checked. We know places such as France and Belgium have homegrown terrorists lured by \nISIS. They can get on a plane and come here far more easily than a refugee from those seven countries. Let's \ntighten that up. Instead, the President gives us this Executive order. Lord knows how he came to it. Every expert on \nterrorism will say there are a lot more important and better things that we need to do. So let me repeat: The stakes \n\n\n\nare too high for party loyalty to stand in the way of doing what is right to protect this country. We ought to scrap the \norder and start over. The order not only does not protect us from terrorism but makes it worse. It stands in the face \nof what America is all about. Our country has welcomed immigrants, and the beautiful lady with the torch in the \nharbor of the city in which I live has beckoned us for generations. Russia Finally, Madam President, I ask my \nRepublican colleagues to put country over party when it comes to Russia. This administration has shown a \ndisquieting reluctance to criticize Russia when it flouts international norms and laws. The administration seems \nhesitant to enforce new sanctions and has even hinted at relaxing existing sanctions at what has always been our \nmost formidable enemy along with ISIS: Russia and Putin. Unbelievably, just yesterday the President insinuated \nthat the Russian and American Governments were somehow morally equivalent. When asked about Putin's \nauthoritarian regime, President Trump responded: ``There are a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?'' \nCan you imagine if a Democrat had said that? Every one of these seats would be filled with people decrying that \nkind of moral equivalence. Russia, a dictatorship where Putin kills his enemies, imprisons the press, and causes \ntrouble anywhere he can in the world is morally equivalent to this great land? Come on. Where are you? You know \nif the Democrats had said that you would be howling at the moon, and rightfully so. But here, I don't hear much. \nVladimir Putin has little or no respect for the diversity of his people, for freedom of religion and expression, for a free \npress, for free and fair elections in Russia--and America, it seems--and he has demonstrated on more than one \noccasion that he will go to any length to silence political dissidents, including murdering them. I would ask President \nTrump: Does that sound like America? Maybe in President Trump's mind it does, but it sure doesn't to most of \nAmerica--just about every American. It is not the America that this body represents. As I said, my Republican \ncolleagues ought to be aghast. I don't think anyone from the other side would associate himself or herself with \nthose comments. I am encouraged that the Republican leader and other Senate Republicans have criticized the \nPresident for those dangerous remarks, but what worries me most is the policy. Russia is a persistent and strategic \nthreat to this Nation. Will this administration cozy up to Putin and his oligarchs and relax sanctions? Will they look \nthe [[Page S687]] other way when Russia supports separatists in Ukraine, commits human rights violations \nalongside Iran, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime? Putin is the kind of person who, if you give him an inch, he takes \n10 miles. We all have come across people like that. President Trump's rhetoric is ceding more of the battlespace to \nour enemies each day. So what we must do in this body is ensure that current sanctions stay in place and are \nrobustly enforced. We also need to increase sanctions on Russia for its interference with our election. We ask our \ncolleagues to step up to the plate, do what they know is right, and join us in making sure that the President cannot \nunilaterally reduce sanctions and that we strengthen sanctions for what he has tried to do in our election. The \nstakes are too high to let loyalty to this President--any President--stop this body from doing the right thing for the \nAmerican people. On the Cabinet and particularly Mrs. DeVos, on the Executive order, the lack of respect for an \nindependent judiciary, and on Russia, I ask my Republican colleagues once again to consider principle over party \nand their duty to country before deference to the President. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, over the last few weeks, people \nacross the country have continued to make their voices heard in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos--\nmoms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers, students young and old, and cities, towns, urban, suburban, and \nrural communities. People are standing up and they will not be silenced. Thousands upon thousands have joined \nprotests in their communities. Hundreds of thousands have emailed or called their Senators, jamming our phone \nlines, swamping the voicemail system, and shattering records. Millions have engaged on social media, sharing \ninformation with their friends, signing petitions, and pressuring their elected officials. It has made a difference. Every \nsingle Democrat will be standing with their constituents and opposing Betsy DeVos. Just last week, two \nRepublicans announced their opposition as well. I can tell you I know for a fact there are other Republicans who are \nfeeling the heat and could come around. This nomination is dead even right now, on the razor's edge. Fifty \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans will vote to reject Betsy DeVos. We need just one more Republican to join \nus, to stand on the side of students, parents, and public education in America and say no to Betsy DeVos. I come \nto the floor to kick off the final day of debate on this nomination. On Friday, I spoke at length, making my case for \nwhy the Senate should oppose Betsy DeVos. Democrats will hold the floor for the next 24 hours, until the final vote, \nto do everything we can to persuade just one more Republican to join us. I strongly encourage people across the \ncountry to join us. Double down on your advocacy, keep making your voices heard for these last 24 hours. Over the \npast 3 weeks, I have heard a number of Republicans wonder why Democrats and so many parents and teachers \nacross the country were so focused on this nomination in this moment. President Trump has done so much in these \nfirst few weeks, and so many of his people he has nominated to run critical agencies have not been people I can \n\n\n\nsupport, but what is it about Betsy DeVos that has inspired so much grassroots energy and opposition across this \ncountry? I think I understand. It is very clear to me. For the vast majority of people across the country, public \neducation isn't just another issue, it is different. For those of us who owe everything we have to the strong public \neducation we received, for those who saw our children and grandchildren move through our public schools, for \nthose of us who walked into a public classroom ourselves to teach or have friends or family who have dedicated \ntheir lives to teaching, for those of us who see the role strong public schools play in our communities, especially our \nrural communities, often offering an educational and a community resource where it simply wouldn't otherwise be \noffered, we believe that a commitment to strong public schools is part of America's core, the idea that every \nstudent in every community should have the opportunities that strong public schools offer. This is a notion that is \nembedded in our values. It is who we are. It is in our blood. For those people across the country who feel that way, \nwho believe those things, the nomination of Betsy DeVos truly hits close to home. It was a slap in the face because \nshe doesn't approach this the way most of us do. She doesn't cherish public education. She doesn't value it. She is \nsomeone who has dedicated her career and her inherited fortune to privatizing public schools, to tearing down \npublic education, to defunding it in order to push more taxpayer dollars into private schools and for-profit charters. \nShe has called public education ``a dead end.'' Where she sits from a distance, she has called it ``an \nembarrassment.'' She has disparaged those who work in our public schools, saying our best and our brightest \n``steer clear.'' She has said education is ``an industry.'' An industry? Well, for someone such as she, a billionaire, \nrightwing activist who spent her career and inherited fortune buying and selling companies, she just doesn't \nunderstand an ``industry'' that isn't focused on profits and that doesn't exist in the free market. When people across \nthe country hear someone such as Betsy DeVos say these things about public education, when they hear a \nrightwing conservative billionaire more focused on her antigovernment ideology than helping our students, when \nthey see that someone who spent her career trying to destroy public schools has been nominated to lead the \nFederal Agency dedicated to public education, they start to pay some attention. In a Senate hearing, when they see \nthat person so clearly lack any of the issues, when they see her unable to explain basic concepts in education \npolicy, unwilling to make basic commitments to not privatizing or defunding our public schools, confused about the \nneed for Federal protections for students with disabilities and so committed to a rightwing agenda that she pointed \nto the need for guns in our schools to protect against ``potential grizzly bears'' in response to a question from a \nSenator representing the Newtown families, people across the country pay even more attention, and they start to \nmake their voices heard. I am not surprised that opposition to Betsy DeVos has caught fire across the country. I am \nnot surprised people are talking about it to their friends, writing letters to the Senators, and showing up to protest \nwhen they have never done anything like that before because this is about their kids, their schools, and their \ncommunities. It is about the core idea that we are a nation that invests in strong public education and one that \nstrives to guarantee the promise and opportunity it affords to every student in our country--not that public education \nis perfect, of course not. We have a lot of work to do, but that work should be directed toward strengthening public \nschools, not tearing them down. Public education is something that should be valued as an important piece of the \nfabric of this Nation and the expansion of our middle class, not scorned and ridiculed by billionaires who never had \nany use for it themselves. Friday I spent a lot of time on the floor laying out my case in detail opposing Betsy \nDeVos. I talked about the open questions that are remaining regarding her tangled finances and potential conflicts \nof interest. I ran through the strong concerns with her record, her lack of experience, and her lack of clear \nunderstanding of basic education issues. I discussed my strong belief that her vision for education in America is \ndeeply at odds with where parents, students, and families across our country want to go. I went through the \nprocess of how Republicans jammed this nominee through our committee, cutting corners and doing everything \npossible to protect her from scrutiny. I will not go through all of that again now, but I do want to make one more \npoint, one I hope will be compelling to my Republican friends who are still resisting pressure from their constituents \nand sticking with Betsy DeVos; that is, no matter what you think about Betsy DeVos's policy ideas, no matter what \nyou think of her qualifications to run this agency, no matter [[Page S688]] what you think about her personal \nunderstanding of the issues or her financial entanglements, one thing is very clear; if she is confirmed, she would \nenter this job as the most controversial and embattled Secretary in the history of this Department. She would start \nthis job with no credibility inside the agency she is supposed to lead, with no influence in Congress, as the punch \nline in late-night comedy shows, and without the confidence of the American people. A vote for Betsy DeVos is a \nvote for a Secretary of Education who is likely to succeed only in further dividing us on education issues and who \nmay try to take steps to try to implement her anti-student agenda but would do so with people across the country. \nSo many of us in the Senate are on guard and ready to fight back. I urge my Republican friends--and we just need \n\n\n\none more--let's cut this off right now. Let's ask President Trump to send us someone who is qualified, who \nunderstands the issues, and who truly cares about public education. Together, let's stand with our constituents and \nsay no to Betsy DeVos. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from \nMaryland. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, I wish to start by thanking Senator Murray and the Members of the \nHELP Committee for the work they have done to cast light on the record and the lack of record of Mrs. Betsy \nDeVos, President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Education. As the Senator from Washington has told us, the \nmore the American people learn about the record of Betsy DeVos, the more concerned they become. The American \npeople are making their voices heard in every Senate office. The switchboard has been essentially shut down, and I \ncan tell you that I have received over 14,000 calls from Maryland on this nominee alone. People are calling because \nthe more they look at the record, the more they realize this nominee's lack of commitment to the essential mission \nof the Department of Education. That mission is to provide every child in America with access to a quality public \neducation. This concern about the nominee is shared across political parties. As Senator Susan Collins of Maine \nsaid on this floor, Mrs. DeVos's concentration on vouchers ``raises the question about whether she fully appreciates \nthat the Secretary Of Education's primary focus must be on helping States and communities, parents, teachers, \nschool board members, and administrators strengthen our public schools.'' Regardless of ZIP Code, our mission \nmust be to provide every child with access to a high-quality neighborhood public school. It is absolutely true that in \ntoo many places around in country we are failing to meet the goal, but the response to a troubled school should not \nbe to walk away from it in favor of sketchy voucher schemes. Instead we must work together to provide the \nnecessary resources and interventions to help those schools and those students achieve success. Over the last 2 \nyears, I have spent a lot of time traveling over the great State of Maryland. I visited schools, talked to college \nstudents, and heard from parents. No matter where I went, in every part of our State, everybody wanted the same \nthing: a good school, affordable college, either community college or 4-year colleges, and a fair shot at reaching \ntheir dreams. The U.S. Department of Education is supposed to help them get that opportunity. Let me take a \nmoment to talk about what the Department of Education means to some neighborhoods in my State of Maryland. \nNot long ago, I visited a pair of community schools in Baltimore City, the Historic Samuel Coleridge-Taylor \nElementary School in Upton/Druid Heights in West Baltimore and the Benjamin Franklin High School in Brooklyn, \nSouth Baltimore. Upton/Druid Heights is a historic African- American community in Baltimore. Supreme Court \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, jazz great Cab Calloway, and civil rights pioneer Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson all walked its \nstreets, but today it is a community in distress. Most of its children live in poverty; 95 percent of the students at \nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary are on free or reduced lunch. Despite its challenges, it has a strong faith-\nbased institution and community groups. Mrs. DeVos's approach to schools such as Samuel Coleridge-Taylor has \nbeen to give up on them, to abandon them, and to divert resources to voucher programs. Fortunately, the \nDepartment of Education did not abandon this school. In 2012, it designated Upton/Druid Heights as a Promise \nNeighborhood. The Department provided resources to support comprehensive services for families. These include \nB'more for Healthy Babies, which has dramatically reduced infant mortality rates in the city; Parent University, to \nhelp educate parents of young children; and financial literacy and education, to help with filling out income tax forms \nand to help families manage their budgets. In 2012, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor became a community school. It has a \ncommunity school coordinator, a position that can be filled using funds under title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers of children from low-\nincome families. The community school coordinator works with parents, students, educators, and community \nresidents to learn the needs of the neighborhood and form partnerships to meet them. The University of Maryland \nSchool of Social Work, which is located just down the road, joined them to provide trauma training so that teachers \ncould recognize and respond to trauma among the children and go on home visits to work with families. They \nreceived a grant to build a first- ever playground on campus--something that most schools take for granted. Local \nchurches provided safe spaces for kids. The Weinberg Foundation donated a beautiful library. There is a jobs \ncenter, where parents can look for employment, and a food bank, to send kids home with something to eat over the \nweekend. The school was transformed into a place where kids want to be, receiving the mayor's award for the \ngreatest drop in students at risk for chronic absenteeism. It has been a success story. In a little different part of \ntown, Ben Franklin High School exists, and it is isolated geographically in the Brooklyn neighborhood. It is on a \npeninsula at the southern part of the city. Brooklyn is a historic waterfront neighborhood with strong ties to \nmanufacturing. The Brooklyn community built ships for the United States in World War II. Many families in Brooklyn \nhave been there for generations. As manufacturing left and Bethlehem Steel closed--Bethlehem Steel provided \nabout 12,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs--times got tougher for those working families. In the year 2011, \n\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the bottom 5 percent of schools in the State of Maryland--again, one of those \nschools that this nominee would have walked away from in favor of vouchers. Again, the good news is the \nDepartment of Education did not walk away. It provided extra funding to help turn things around. Using the \ncommunity schools model, they assessed and responded to the needs of the students. Interns from the University \nof Maryland School of Social Work provided mental health services. The United Way offers a workforce \ndevelopment program and an onsite early childhood development center that helps teen parents graduate, knowing \ntheir children have quality care. A family stability program helps families avoid homelessness. CSX is working with \nthe school to build a football field. Students worked together with their neighbors to take ownership of their \ncommunities and protest the placement of an incinerator near them. Some figured that this low-income \nneighborhood was a good target to put an incinerator, but the community fought back and won. They have put \nthousands of hours into community service, including the Chesapeake Bay cleanup. The school's office of student \nservice learning helps connect students to internships and job-training programs. In Brooklyn, the crime rate and \nthe teen pregnancy rates have dropped, and attendance at Ben Franklin is up. When I asked the students what \nthey liked about the school, they said: ``We feel like someone cares now,'' and ``everyone is positive.'' At both of \nthese schools, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ben Franklin, the [[Page S689]] principals told me that the community \nschools model allowed them to form partnerships to meet the needs of their students' lives so that they could focus \non delivering a high-quality education. Because the students' needs are being met more comprehensively, the \nstudents can focus on learning, and because we have a team outside of the teachers who are helping provide \nsome services to these kids, the teachers can focus on teaching. It is important for us to understand that every child \nwho walks through the doors of a school has a unique family circumstance and their own individual needs. The \ncommunity school approach emphasizes the fact that no school is an island onto itself. Every school is part of a \nneighborhood, and we need to understand the special circumstances of the children and families in those \nneighborhoods. It is not just for urban schools like Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ben Franklin. Community schools \nhave shown success in rural areas of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Montana, and all across the country. This idea \nthat every child should receive a good public education is as old as our Republic itself. Our Nation's Founders knew \nthe contribution of education to the success of our democracy. They knew that an educated population would be a \nstrong safeguard against tyranny. In a letter in 1786, Thomas Jefferson wrote: I think by far the most important bill \nin our whole code is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can be devised \nfor the preservation of freedom and happiness. As early as 1779, Jefferson was putting forward legislation to create \na public school system that would give children a fair start. Jefferson later wrote to John Adams: It was a bill for the \nmore general diffusion of learning. This proposed to divide every county into wards of five or six miles square, like \nyour townships; to establish in each ward a free school for reading, writing and common arithmetic; to provide for \nthe annual selection of the best subjects from these schools, who might receive, at the public expense, a higher \ndegree of public education at a district school. He went on to say: Worth and genius would thus have been sought \nout from every condition of life, and completely prepared by education for defeating the competition and birth for \npublic trusts. Though America did not start the public education system at that moment in time, those ideas and that \nphilosophy of education as the great equalizer and tool to develop the talents of Americans, regardless of the \ncircumstances of their birth, were the foundation of the public school system that we have today. President Trump \ngave remarkably little attention to education during his campaign. He pretty much ignored the public school \neducation system in favor of his $20 billion voucher scheme that would drain huge amounts of resources from \nneighborhood schools like the two in Baltimore that I just discussed. With the President offering only vague \npromises and pricey schemes, it is even more important that we have an Education Secretary with a steady hand \nand a deep understanding of the critical mission of the Department. It is clear that Mrs. Betsy DeVos is not the right \nperson for the job. Mrs. DeVos advocates a concept of industrialized, privatized, and for-profit schools. This thinking \nis too small and too cramped for our kids. Our goal should not be vouchers for children to try to shop for a school \nwith no accountability for quality. Our goal should be a neighborhood school for every child that meets their needs. \nWe cannot abandon the families who cannot afford to make up the difference between the value of the voucher and \nthe tuition at the private school. What do we say to them? We cannot abandon the students who cannot get \naccepted into private schools because many of these private schools say yes to some and no to others. What do \nwe say to those who have the doors closed on them? We cannot abandon the schools that a voucher program \nwould drain the resources from, and $20 billion is a huge amount of the resources that we currently provide for \nschools like the two I mentioned in Baltimore City and schools in neighborhoods throughout the country. So instead \nof a risky voucher program, we need to make our schools better by giving them the flexibility to meet student needs \n\n\n\nand the support to make sure that our children are all ready to learn. In her hearing and in the responses to the \nquestions for the record, Mrs. DeVos displayed an astonishing ignorance about the agency that she intends to run \nand, indeed, about the role of public schools in our country. All of us who have been part of this debate know that \none of the most fundamental discussions in K-12 policy has been over accountability and how best to measure \nstudent knowledge and school performance. There has been an intense discussion over whether to measure \nschool and student performance by student proficiency or by student improvement and student growth. Mrs. \nDeVos seemed totally confused about this discussion that is going to the heart of many of the debates here in \nCongress. Perhaps we should not be so surprised that she has such little understanding of the public education \nsystem, as she has spent much of her career attempting to dismantle it in favor of private, charter, and for-profit \nschools. She has been referred to as the ``four-star general of the voucher movement.'' She has forcefully worked \nto expand vouchers, including spending millions on a failed ballot initiative to bring vouchers to the State of \nMichigan. When that didn't work, she created the Great Lakes Education Project to fund nonprofits and donate to \nState legislators who would advance vouchers and charters. With respect to the millions of dollars she and her \nfamily have spent trying to influence lawmakers, she stated: ``We expect a return on our investment.'' She received \na return in Michigan, where she played a role in a 1993 law that created incentives for charters to come to \nMichigan. The for- profit industry, in particular, responded, and they operate nearly 80 percent of the charters in the \nState of Michigan. In 2011, she pushed successfully for a law that allowed even low-performing charters to expand \nand repealed the requirement that the State publish annual reports on charter performance. I think we all believe \nthat transparency is important, and it is shocking that there would be an effort to put the facts under the rug. After \nyears of criticism, modest accountability measures were introduced in 2015, although Mrs. DeVos opposed and \nsuccessfully stripped a provision from the bill that would have established a commission to explore ways to improve \nDetroit public schools. Seventy percent of Detroit charter schools ranked in the bottom quarter of Michigan schools. \nThe nonprofit Education Trust calls their poor performance a ``civil rights issue.'' In a report just last June, the New \nYork Times called the situation in Detroit ``a public education fiasco that is perhaps unparalleled in the United \nStates.'' It would be a big mistake to impose that fiasco on the rest of the country. Mrs. DeVos has also advocated \nfor online charter schools, and she was formerly an investor in the largest for-profit online school operator, K-12, \nInc. In her response to questions about this model, she cited questionable statistics for the accomplishments of \nseveral virtual academies. Those statistics were disproved in an article in Education Week which compared them to \nthe publicly reported figures used for State accountability. For example, Ms. DeVos wrote that Utah Virtual \nAcademy has a 92- percent graduation rate. In fact, the most recently publicly reported figure is 42 percent. The \nlast thing we need is a Secretary of Education coming up with alternative facts. While I believe that nonprofit public \ncharter schools are important incubators for innovation, they have to play by the same rules as the rest of our \nschools. But Mrs. DeVos has rejected that equal playing field. In an exchange with Senator Kaine from Virginia \nwhere he repeatedly asked her whether or not the charter schools would have the same standards applied to them \nas public schools that received Federal funding, she refused to agree. It is pretty extraordinary when we have a \nnominee saying that she supports a taxpayer-funded blank check for some schools. Our Secretary of Education \nmust be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars and ensure that funds [[Page S690]] are delivering quality and \nresults for students. Another area where Mrs. DeVos raises serious concerns is that of enforcement of equal rights, \nespecially the rights of children with disabilities. All of us know the Department of Education has the very important \njob of enforcing civil rights laws and making sure we have equal access to education throughout the Nation. \nCongress prohibited discrimination in education on the basis of race, color, and national origin in title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibited sex discrimination. Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. But all of us know that as late of the \nmid-1970s, public schools still accommodated only one of five children with disabilities, and many States had laws \nthat explicitly excluded children with certain disabilities. When Congress addressed this with the passage of the \nIDEA legislation, it was a big breakthrough for our country and for our children. The IDEA was very straightforward \nand very simple: Every child deserves a ``free appropriate public education'' in the ``least restrictive environment.'' \nThe law requires schools to design an ``individualized education program'' for each child with a disability. IDEA has \nbeen a lifesaver for children with disabilities and their families. It has empowered them to get the quality education \nthey could not earlier receive, and the law gives them tools with which they can fight to ensure that schools address \ntheir needs. This is why it was so alarming at the hearing to hear Mrs. DeVos say that the application of IDEA and \nthe rights behind IDEA really was a State function--the same States that historically discriminated against these \nvery children. That is not what the IDEA legislation is all about. It is a national standard to make sure we do not \n\n\n\nhave discrimination based on disability. Yet, Mrs. DeVos in exchange concluded with: ``I think that's an issue that's \nbest left to the States.'' So whether it is her position with respect to vouchers and poaching resources that otherwise \nwould go to improve our public schools or lack of support for the very idea behind IDEA, we have a nominee who \nthe overwhelming majority of the American people recognize is the wrong choice to be the custodian of the \nDepartment that is responsible at the Federal level for providing support and educational opportunities to our \nchildren. In closing, with respect to the issue of guns in schools--and Senator Murray, the ranking member, has \naddressed this as well--it was pretty shocking to hear Mrs. DeVos trivialize the issue of gun violence in schools \nwhen she was asked about this by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, quipping that guns might be \nnecessary to kill grizzly bears. We have had lots of debates in this Chamber, and obviously there are strong \nfeelings. But I think we would all agree that the safety of our kids and our schools is not something that should be \ntrivialized. In conclusion, let us heed the words of the editorial board of the Detroit Free Press. They have witnessed \nfirsthand the experiments that Mrs. DeVos has made about education and have written in an editorial: ``Make no \nmistake: A vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as U.S. Secretary of Education is a vote to end public education in this \ncountry as we know it.'' In a speech in 2015, Betsy DeVos said bluntly: ``Government really sucks.'' I suggest that \nshe should not be leading the agency entrusted at the Federal level with the education of our children, which, as our \nFounder said, is really the root of equal opportunity and the opportunity for every child to achieve their dreams. I join \nwith the distinguished Senator from Washington State in urging my colleagues to vote no on Betsy DeVos for \nSecretary of Education. We can do better. We can do a lot better for our kids. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The \nSenator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, constituents from every State who care about our public \nschools and our students in public schools have broken records calling us, their Senators, in opposition to Betsy \nDeVos as Education Secretary. In the past few weeks, I have heard from thousands of Hawaii residents concerned \nabout voting for an Education Secretary who clearly does not believe in our Nation's public schools. I wish to share \ntwo of their messages today. One constituent wrote to me: Dear Senator Hirono, As a proud Hawaii educator for 30 \nplus years, I'm deeply troubled by the possible appointment of Betsy DeVos to the position of US Secretary of \nEducation. Although I would personally never consider applying for a job I am not qualified to serve in, it's baffling to \nme that our new Commander in Chief thinks someone who has NO experience as a teacher or administrator could \nbe remotely prepared to lead our nation in this role. I don't have to explain to you what a selfless calling being a \nteacher is, nor do I believe our Hawaii delegation takes educating Hawaii's keiki lightly, so I implore you to work with \nother leaders in DC to make sure we have a suitable nominee for this essential position. Mahalo, Sandy from \nHonolulu Sandy and teachers like her devote more time and effort than is mandated to ensure that our public \nschool students have a solid foundation in education and for life. Teaching is a calling, and I have met with many \nteachers who are totally committed to doing the very best they can for their students, and they want nothing less \nfrom the next Secretary of Education. They deserve a better qualified, better experienced, better prepared, and \nmore committed Secretary of Education than Betsy DeVos. Next, I wish to share a message from Lorelei, a middle \nschool principal on Oahu. Her letter begins: Dear Senator Hirono, As a strong supporter of public education, I ask \nthat you oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. Educators and \nstudents deserve a secretary who can commit to supporting every student in all public schools, and a leader that \nwill work tirelessly to promote a public education system that provides each child with the optimum conditions for \nteaching and learning. Betsy DeVos' past work in education and her performance at the recent confirmation hearing \ndemonstrated neither a depth of experience nor knowledge base in education policy and on critical issues facing \nthe community. She ends her letter by saying: As a principal, I have spoken with teachers, parents, students, and \ncommunity members across the political spectrum and there is widespread agreement that Betsy DeVos is not the \nright person for the job. As Lorelei said, it shouldn't be asking too much to have an Education Secretary who will \nstand up for public schools and the millions of our children who attend our public schools. That person is certainly \nnot Betsy DeVos. In his opening remarks at Betsy DeVos's confirmation hearing, the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee said that Mrs. DeVos was in the ``mainstream'' for supporting vouchers to send students to private \nschools, instead of investing in our public schools. This is not mainstream thinking. Being told otherwise is again \ndealing in ``alternative facts.'' The chairman went on to repeat a so-called argument that Betsy DeVos and other \nschool choice advocates make--that vouchers are simply Pell grants for primary and secondary education. Now, \nthis is a real head scratcher, and I say: What? Here we go again down the rabbit hole, where up is down and down \nis up. Pell grants and vouchers are fundamentally different. Pell grants help offset the ever-rising cost of a voluntary \ncollege education. All colleges charge students tuition, and Pell grants provide opportunity to low-income students \nto be able to go to college. In contrast, every American child has a right to a free primary and secondary public \n\n\n\neducation. Vouchers actually take resources away from public schools and make it that much harder to provide a \ngood education for all of our students. Vouchers take money away from public schools; Pell grants don't. When a \nstudent uses a Pell grant at a private college or university, it has no impact on the funding a State college or \nuniversity receives. But when a student uses a voucher to attend a private school, it takes away money from local \npublic schools. How is taking money away from local public schools mainstream thinking? The Secretary of [[Page \nS691]] Education should be focused on improving our public schools, not taking money away from them. \nFurthermore, saying that Pell grants are similar to vouchers reveals a fundamental lack of understanding of the Pell \ngrant program. Among her many duties as Secretary, Betsy DeVos would be in charge of managing $30 billion per \nyear of Pell grants, which help more than 8 million students afford a college education in this country. During the \n2014-2015 school year, more than 21,000 students in Hawaii were able to finance their college education with \nnearly $81 million in Pell grants. Last Congress, I led legislation to protect and strengthen the Pell grant program. \nBut under Republican majorities, Pell grants are under the constant threat of irresponsible cuts and dismantlement, \neven though college today is more expensive than ever. Can we really trust Betsy DeVos to fight to protect Pell \ngrants? Somebody who equates Pell grants with vouchers is not someone who understands her responsibilities \nunder the Pell Grant Program. So can we really trust Betsy DeVos to support the Pell Grant Program? I don't think \nso. I have spoken out against Betsy DeVos's nomination a number of times, but some questions need repeating. \nWhat are we telling our students if we have an Education Secretary who is not committed to improving the public \neducation system so that our students can succeed in school and in life? Nine out of every 10 students in the \nUnited States attend public school. What are we saying to them? Is it the best we can do to give them an Education \nSecretary who does not believe in the public schools they attend? Who doesn't believe that their education is worth \nfighting for? If this is the message you want to send to our students and their families, then vote for Betsy DeVos. \nOn behalf of the nearly 200,000 public school students in Hawaii and their teachers and other educators in Hawaii, \nmy answer is a strong, strong no. I urge my colleagues to question Betsy DeVos's commitment to our public \nschools and to the millions of students who go to public schools and vote against her nomination. I yield the floor. \nMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will \ncall the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so \nordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be \nSecretary of Education. I know we will have had some time later today and even tonight, but I wanted to review \nsome of the concerns I have about her nomination in the allotted time that I will have--I guess about 15 minutes. \nThe first concern I have is a broad concern that I think is shared by a number of Senators on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. The ranking member, Senator Murray, is here with us on the floor, and I am \ngrateful for her leadership on this nomination debate, as well as many other issues. I guess the broad concern I \nhave is Betsy DeVos's commitment to public education. I come from a State where we have had a tradition of public \neducation since about the 1830s. I am fairly certain--I will stand corrected--but Pennsylvania might have been the \nfirst State to have public education as far back as the 1830s. It is part of the bedrock of the foundation of our State. \nStill, today, 92 percent of Pennsylvania students attend a traditional public school. We have charter schools. We \nhave roughly 175 or so, but all of those charter schools in Pennsylvania have to be, by statute, public nonprofit \nentities. Public charter schools are what we have in Pennsylvania. We don't have for-profit private sector charter \nschools. It is not allowed by law. There are some limited circumstances when one entity could affiliate with a for-\nprofit entity, but we have nothing like what Mrs. DeVos has supported in Michigan and across the country. For a \nSenator from Pennsylvania to be questioning a nominee for Secretary of Education about for-profit charter schools \nis unusual because we don't have that entity in Pennsylvania. My concern is substantial--and I will develop this \nlater--about her commitment to public education. In fact, in my meeting with Mrs. DeVos, because of my concerns, I \nsaid something very simple, but I said it for a reason, to remind her about her obligation if she were to be confirmed. \nI said: You will not be the Secretary of private education; you are going to be the Secretary of Education, and for \nmost of the country, that means traditional public schools, and I hope you understand that. That is a broad concern \nthat I have, and I will talk more about it. My line of questioning the day of our hearing--I should say the evening of \nour hearing--focused on campus sexual assault; and that, of course, is an area of urgent concern for a lot of people \nhere, a lot of members of the United States. It is also of greater concern now because of her nomination. What do I \nmean by that? Let me walk through how I got to my questions with her. We know the Department of Justice tells us \nthat college women are twice as likely to be sexually assaulted than robbed in the time they are in college. This is a \nnumber that comes from the Centers for Disease Control. We also know that one in five college students \n\n\n\nexperience attempted or completed sexual assault while they are in college. This is a direct threat to young women \nall across the country, and I think we have only begun as a country--as a nation, I should say--to begin to take steps \nto combat sexual assault, to insist that colleges and universities do more to insist that everyone in the education \nfield, every person on a college campus assumes some level of responsibility. One of the reasons we can start \ndown that path and begin to be certain that we are at least beginning to wrestle with this problem and give young \nwomen on our campuses more protection is because of recent legislation. We are not done. We have a lot more to \ndo, but I will highlight one bill that I led the fight on--the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, known as \nCampus SaVE. That became law in 2013, when we were reauthorizing--a fancy Washington word for doing it again \nor improving the law--the Violence Against Women Act. I was glad we were able to take a substantial step to tackle \nthis horrific problem of sexual assault on campus. That legislation was followed by regulations. If I could summarize \nthem, that law and the regulations that followed made sure that colleges and universities have clear guidelines, that \nvictims know what their rights are, that victims know where to turn in the event of an assault, that we do a lot more \non prevention, that bystanders can no longer be inactive, that they have to be trained and prepared to help, and \nthat the entire college campus is focused on preventing sexual assault and then making sure, in the aftermath of an \nassault, it is dealt with appropriately. This legislation has helped campus communities respond to not only sexual \nassault but domestic assault, dating violence, as well as stalking. It does give students and employees the \nopportunity to do more than has been done on college campuses. When I was questioning Mrs. DeVos, I asked her \nif she would commit to upholding title IX, the nondiscrimination statute that includes important protections against \nsexual assault. I asked her very specifically about the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which had \nissued guidance in 2011 that advises institutions of higher education to use the so-called preponderance of the \nevidence standard for campus conduct proceedings. Some may be familiar with that standard. It is a standard that \nwe have used in our jurisprudence for civil cases across the country. You don't have to prove, nor should a victim of \nsexual assault on campus have to prove by the higher standard; say clear and convincing is a higher standard or \nbeyond a reasonable doubt is a criminal standard. What the Department of Education said to the university \ncampuses across the country is, the standard you should use is preponderance of the evidence. They based that \ndetermination after consulting with experts and advocates [[Page S692]] across the country. That is the state of law \ncurrently, the guidance from the Department of Education about that evidentiary standard, my legislation Campus \nSaVE, and that is where we are now. I simply asked Mrs. DeVos whether or not she would commit to enforcing \ncurrent law and abiding by the 2011 Department of Education guidance. Her response was that it would be \npremature--I am using her word ``premature''--to make that kind of commitment. I was stunned by that answer. Why \nwould it be premature to say you are going to enforce current law? Why would it be premature to say that you can't \nmake a commitment to insisting upon an evidentiary standard that is in place right now? That made no sense to me, \nand I don't think it made any sense to people across the country who have been working on this problem and trying \nto get the attention of the Senate and the House and any administration for years, if not for decades. We finally \narrived at a place where we are at long last dealing with sexual assault in a very aggressive and appropriate and \nfair manner. Now we have a nominee who says she is not sure whether she can commit to that. That gave me great \npause and is one of the reasons I don't support her nomination. I have several reasons. I know I am running low on \ntime, but I will wrap up this portion in a moment. Another area of concern is the answers to questions she gave with \nregard to specific questions about students with disabilities. This was a set of questions asked by a number of \nSenators, but I will try to summarize it this way. She seemed to have a lack of knowledge, an apparent and I think \nobvious lack of knowledge, about basic Federal law, a law that was passed decades ago, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. She didn't seem to know that was a Federal statute. She seemed to assert that \nsomehow States could decide whether to enforce the policy that undergirded that Federal law. That, of course, is \nnot the case. It is Federal law, and we have to make sure individuals--in this case, students with disabilities--get \nthe rights they are accorded by virtue of that law. Her lack of knowledge in this area was of concern, but maybe \neven greater concern was a lack of--or seeming lack of, in my judgment--determination to once again enforce this \nlaw, to make sure that on her watch the law that would protect students with disabilities would be enforced to the \nfull extent of the law and nothing less. She didn't seem to be willing to commit to that or didn't seem to have the kind \nof commitment I would expect from a Secretary of Education. What we would all expect, Democrats and \nRepublicans, I would hope, is a Secretary of Education who is a champion for public schools, is a champion for \nthose children in public schools, will fight battles and urge States to make the investments in public education, \nwould urge the Congress to make investments in public education, in early learning, and all of the concerns we \nhave about lack of funding in public education. I would hope both parties would want a Secretary of Education who \n\n\n\nis a champion for students with disabilities, who would be a champion for those who are victims of sexual assault \non our college campuses. Unfortunately, because of a series of questions posed both at the hearing and in written \nquestions that were submitted for the record--to which Mrs. DeVos gave written answers--I see that basic \ncommitment lacking. For that and many reasons which we will develop a little later tonight, I will be voting no on her \nconfirmation vote. I appreciate this opportunity to share some of my thoughts and hope to be back later this \nevening. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk \nwill call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so \nordered. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos for \nSecretary of Education. My mom was a public schoolteacher, and she taught second grade until she was 70 years \nold. She loved teaching. Her favorite unit was actually the Monarch Butterfly Unit, where she would dress up as the \nmonarch butterfly, and she would teach the kids about metamorphosis. The costume she wore, she would also \nwear to the supermarket afterward. She was dressed as this big monarch butterfly, with little antennae on her head \nand a sign that said: ``To Mexico or bust'' because that is where the monarch would fly on its way from Canada \nthrough Minnesota and down. It was the night before my mom's funeral at the visitation where I met a family who \ncame up to me, and the mom was sobbing. I didn't know what was going on. I had never met them. They had their \nolder son with them who had pretty severe disabilities. She said: You know, your mom had my kid here in school \nwhen he was in second grade. Now he was grown up. She said: He always loved that Monarch Butterfly Unit. After \nhe graduated, your mom would continue to go to the grocery store, and that was why she would go to the store \nevery year. He had gotten a job bagging groceries. She would stand in the line in her monarch butterfly outfit for \nyears and give him a big hug when she got to the end of the line. That was my mom. She loved her kids and she \nwas a devoted teacher. I went to public school through elementary to high school. My daughter went to public \nschool. I learned that basic right we have in this country; that every child should have the right to an education. That \nled me to the conclusion--after reviewing the record of the hearing and talking to my colleagues on the committee--\nthat this nominee and I do not share the same value when it comes to that public education. I note that two of my \nRepublican colleagues, Senators Collins and Murkowski, have come to the same conclusion. One of the most \ntroubling examples of Mrs. DeVos's views came when she was questioned by two of my colleagues. I note Senator \nMurray is here. We thank her for her leadership on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Two of \nmy colleagues, Senators Maggie Hassan and Tim Kaine, asked the nominee about whether schools should meet \nthe standards outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or, as it is known, IDEA. Mrs. DeVos said \nshe would leave the decision of whether to offer equal educational opportunities to the States. This is simply \nunacceptable. It is not the kind of leadership we need. This is not why we have IDEA. I think most education \nprofessionals and people who are experts in this area would know that is not the answer. I occupy the Senate seat \nthat was once held by Minnesota's own Hubert Humphrey. He was someone who was never at a loss for words. He \ndelivered a speech to the Minnesota AFL-CIO 40 years ago. One line of that speech is just as appropriate and \nmeaningful today as it was back then. He said: The moral test of government is how that government treats those \nwho are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the \nshadows of life, the needy, the sick and the disabled. I submit that Mrs. DeVos's opposition toward providing equal \neducation opportunities to students with disabilities does not meet that moral test. Her views are at odds with \ndecades of bipartisan support for IDEA. In 1975, when Congress passed the original version of IDEA, half of all \nchildren with disabilities were not receiving appropriate educational services, and 1 million children with disabilities \nwere excluded entirely from the public school system. In an impassioned floor speech, then-Senator and later Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale of Minnesota talked about the need for IDEA. Before the 1975 law, disabled children \nwere placed in segregated schools and classes with little emphasis on an education, training, or development. \nMany parents also gave up on the poor services offered by the public schools. As a result, disabled students \nremained at home. To tackle this problem, Republicans and Democrats came together to pass legislation ensuring \nthat students with disabilities would have equal access to public education, just like all other kids. The law \nguaranteed and continues to guarantee today--the Federal law--that students [[Page S693]] with disabilities get a \nfree and appropriate public education. It is not a State-by-State requirement. It is a Federal requirement. In 1975, \nboth Minnesota Senators played a significant leadership role in enacting this groundbreaking civil rights legislation. \nSenator Humphrey called IDEA one of the most significant pieces of legislation and a major commitment in this \nNation's commitment to its children. Then-Senator Mondale argued that this landmark legislation holds a promise of \nnew opportunity for 7 million children in this country. When Congress first enacted this law in 1975, this was not a \n\n\n\npartisan issue. The law passed both Houses with overwhelming majorities. The Senate voted in favor of the \nlandmark legislation by a margin of 87 to 7; the House, by a vote of 404 to 7. Bipartisan support for IDEA grew \nstronger over time. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush signed into law a bill that reauthorized the Disabilities Act. \nThat bill was introduced by former Democratic Senator Tom Harkin and former Minnesota Republican Senator \nDave Durenberger. The reauthorization was so uncontroversial that it passed by a voice vote in both the House and \nthe Senate. Members from both parties supported IDEA when it was reauthorized again in 2003. Every single \nmember of the Minnesota delegation, all 10--Democrats and Republicans alike--supported IDEA's reauthorization \nthat year. For four decades, IDEA has garnered support from both sides of the aisle because we all understand the \nneed to support the most vulnerable among us. Every Member of Congress knows a family member or a person \nwho has been affected by disability. For a lot of lawmakers, this is personal. When my daughter was born, she \ncouldn't swallow for nearly 2 years. She had a feeding tube, and the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her. It \nended up being a temporary problem and not a permanent disability, but those 2 years I still look back at as a gift. \nThey were a gift that brought our family closer together, but they were a gift because they made me understand \nwhat parents of kids with disabilities face every single day. This wasn't just a temporary thing for the parents I met. \nThis was something they face every single day. Since the passage of IDEA, our Nation has moved to fulfill the \npromise of providing a high-quality education to kids with disabilities. Today, more than 4.7 million children with \ndisabilities rely on IDEA to protect their access to high-quality education. Over the last 40 years, the Democratic \nand Republican Members who have come before me have all fought to preserve those critical rights and \nopportunities. These are American values. But they are especially near and dear to our State, where we have this \nlong and proud tradition of working to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the same basic resources \nand opportunities as everyone else. This is not just the original work by Senators Humphrey and Mondale, carried \non, of course, by Senator Durenberger and others, but it happened in our State as well. To cite a few examples, it \nwas the Minnesota Ramp Project that introduced a new American model for building statewide standardized \nwheelchair ramps. Minnesota was the State that sent Paul Wellstone to the Senate, where he fought long and hard \nfor mental health parity. My State is also home to some of the most innovative centers for the disabled in the \ncountry, including PACER, the Courage Center, and ARC. When it comes to educating children with disabilities, \nMinnesota has also been one of the Nation's leaders. In 1957, our State became one of the first States in the \nNation to pass a law requiring that special education services be provided to children and youth with disabilities. In \nour State, from birth to adulthood, kids with disabilities have access to the quality of life they deserve. Through \nIDEA, our State is able to receive Federal funding for early intervention services that help diagnose disabilities or \ndevelopmental delays among infants and toddlers. Minnesota also provides each child with a disability and their \nfamily a personalized K-12 education plan and the support needed to transition from high school to postsecondary \neducation. These civil rights protections and funding under IDEA have also been an area of bipartisan cooperation \namong members of the Minnesota delegation. We would like to see even more funding. We don't see us move \nbackwards. At least one Minnesota Republican has cosponsored every version of IDEA and its reauthorization over \nthe last 40 years. We have never had a Secretary of Education who has put these commonsense bipartisan \nbenefits at risk. Today, over 124,000 Minnesota children rely on the protections in IDEA. I have heard from families \nin my State, and so many of them tell me how that Federal law has made a real difference in their lives. A mom \nfrom Watertown, MN, told me all about her son who was born with Down syndrome. She is so thankful for the \nFederal law because this protection ensures that he can have everyday experiences like other kids. It allows her \nson to be fully integrated with the rest of the students in his high school. As a result, he has developed many \nfriendships and a strong social network. When she asks her son whether he likes school, he always says a \nresounding ``yes.'' A mother of two autistic kids who are deafblind, reached out to me from Farmington, MN. She \ntells me that she depends on IDEA because the law gives her an opportunity to participate in designing \nindividualized education programs for her children. These programs allow her to tailor the best possible educational \nplans. A woman from Lakeville, MN, told me that when her son was born with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities in the late 1980s, and she was so worried about what his future would look like. But because of IDEA, he \nreceived specialized services at school while still being included in activities with the rest of his peers. Today, she \ntells me that he is a successful young adult who happily lives, learns, and works in his community. During my time \nin the Senate, I have worked to share those Minnesota values that you hear resonating in those letters across the \ncountry. That is why I helped lead the push in Congress to successfully pass bipartisan legislation with Senators \nBurr and Casey called the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, or ABLE Act, a law that will help people with \ndisabilities and their families better plan for their futures. It is a law that President Obama signed. We have made \n\n\n\nprogress in removing barriers and empowering people with disabilities. Of course, we know that the ABLE Act alone \nis not enough. We still need to ensure that the Federal Government lives up to its promise to support education for \nthose with disabilities by enforcing and protecting the IDEA and fully funding special education. Providing equal \neducational opportunities for children with disabilities is an issue that cuts across partisan lines. It is an issue of \ndecency and an issue of dignity, and I believe it is an issue that we must all stand behind as Americans. I cannot \nsupport a nominee that would jeopardize the education of millions of disabled children across our country or \nsomeone that is not fully informed at her own hearing about such an important law. We have continuously \nmaintained and strengthened educational laws for children with disabilities because every child deserves a chance \nto succeed. I think about my mom and all those years of teaching--teaching 30 second graders at age 70. I think \nabout that boy, who is now a man, who in the second grade had her as a teacher. He had severe disabilities, but \nshe did everything to make his learning experience as good as all the other kids that were in that class. I think of \nhow he loved that butterfly unit and felt the passion that my mom brought to teaching it. In her own free time, she \nwould go visit him at his job at that checkout line in the grocery store in her butterfly outfit. That was integrating kids \nwith disabilities into our school systems. That is what special teachers and special education experts who see all \nchildren as special are all about. Thank you. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing Mrs. DeVos's nomination. \nI yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the \ndistinguished senior Senator from [[Page S694]] Minnesota for her comments. She speaks from experience and \nknowledge, as has the senior Senator from Washington State, on this issue. In my years here, I have seen \nthousands of confirmation votes, literally at all levels, up to and including Cabinet members and Supreme Court \njustices. I have voted for a large majority of a President's nominations--both Republican and Democratic Presidents. \nSome may not have been those I would have chosen, but I felt that, at least, the President should be given the \nprerogative, if the person is qualified. Now, ideology is one thing, and qualification is another. Out of those \nthousands of confirmation votes, I have a hard time remembering any that were like this one. This one had a \nwhirlwind confirmation hearing and committee vote. It was almost as though they were afraid to have the nominee \nactually have to appear and answer questions. And now the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of Betsy \nDeVos to lead the Department of Education. I will be very blunt. On the very little time that she was allowed to be \nshown to the public, she showed--and I certainly believe this--that she does not have the qualifications to uphold the \nDepartment of Education's primary goal--that of ensuring that all students--all students, not just the wealthy, but \nall students--have access to a quality, public education that allows them to succeed. I am both a father and a \ngrandfather, and I am proud of it. I watched my children go to school. And now I see my grandchildren going to \nschool. I understand well the impact of education on our children. When students have access to strong public \neducation from the very beginning, they are more apt to succeed in the long run. Our Nation's public schools--as is \nthe case in my home State of Vermont--hold the promise of student success through strong State accountability \nmeasures and legal protections regardless of one's race, income, or learning ability. They offer nutritious meals for \nunderserved students, many of whom receive their only meals of the day at school. Any teacher will tell you that if \nyou have a hungry child, you have a child who cannot learn. If a child is fed, you have a child who can learn. Public \neducation means strong teachers and school leaders, technology in the classroom, an assessment to test not just \nhow well a student can memorize material for an exam on a particular day of the year, but how much they have \ngrown over the course of many months. Many of the schools have counselors and nurses. They operate under a \nmodern infrastructure to support those with disabilities and children in foster care. But public education also means \nthat both the States and the Federal Government are held accountable for everyone having access to the same \nexcellent resources. In fact, just over 1 year ago, this body agreed to these protections. We passed the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act here in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 12--an amazing, overwhelming, bipartisan vote. It was \nthe firm agreement among the majority of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--that all students deserve \naccess to critical public school resources in order to succeed. We made a promise that we would do better by our \nstudents; that public schools would be the premier standard for outstanding education for all. Unfortunately, the \nnominee before us--in the very little time that she was allowed to testify and be questioned in the confirmation \nhearing--showed that she does not share these same goals. Instead, she has referred to public schools as a ``dead \nend.'' Well, if you are a billionaire, you have a choice to go wherever you want to school. Maybe these people in a \npublic school are not good enough for you? Well, then, go buy a school if you want. Most people don't have that \noption. Most people are hard working. My wife and I were when our kids were in school. Our children are today. \nWhat does Betsy DeVos advocate for? She advocates for the privatization of education. She has funneled millions \nof dollars into organizations and initiatives to promote private school vouchers and school choice. These efforts \n\n\n\nhave diverted public funds toward private schools, schools that are not held to any antidiscrimination or \naccountability standards. These schools can discriminate all they want. At her confirmation hearing--in the very little \ntime that she did speak--she did not understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This is a landmark \nlaw. It is a Federal law that public schools in all 50 States must follow. Lastly, Mrs. DeVos and her family have \ncontributed to anti-LGBT causes and anti-women's health efforts, which are in direct conflict to the one who is \nsupposed to lead the Department of Education. How can a nominee disagree with the mission of the Department of \nEducation and be fit to oversee that agency and promote the civil rights of schools and college campuses? She also \nappears to oppose efforts to expand college access, in an era when college is so important. Again, in the little bit of \ntime she was allowed to testify before the Senate HELP Committee in January, Mrs. DeVos, when asked, would not \nagree to work with States to offer free community college to eligible students, instead saying that ``nothing in life is \ntruly free.'' This is an easy thing to say if you are a billionaire. She also admitted to knowing little about the Pell \nGrant Program and Federal student loans, as neither she nor her children have ever had to use such resources. \nAs most of us know our children will have to use them, this is simply out of touch with the real life expectations of \nmillions of students and families who rely on these funds to make college attainable. It is what I hear from hard-\nworking families in Vermont. Parents tell me that their child is going to be the first one in their family to go to college, \nand the only reason they can do it is because they can get Pell grants or Federal student loans. Mrs. Devos's \nanswer is: What are those? College tuition rates have climbed more than 300 percent in the last decade. It is \nunacceptable to deny students Federal financial resources. To say, well, if you are rich, you can have them, but \notherwise, tough. As it is, students are increasingly saddled by insurmountable student loan debt. Many forgo \nstarting a family, or buying a house or a car. Many of these students have also fallen prey to for-profit institutions, \nmany of which continue to offer the false promise of gainful employment upon graduation. In reality, many of these \ninstitutions offer nontransferable credits or unaccredited degrees, and are increasingly shuttering their doors, \nleaving students with egregious debt and nowhere to turn to finish their degrees. The Department of Education has \nan extremely important role to ensure that all students--of every race, income level, or whether that student has \ndisabilities or not--have access to the critical tools provided by public schools and by student financial aid \nprograms. Thousands--thousands--of Vermont- ers have called or written to me worried that Mrs. DeVos does not \nagree with these principles. When I say thousands, to put that in context, we are the second smallest State in the \nUnion. Thousands have contacted me. I share these concerns of my fellow Vermonters. They know my children \nwent to public school. They want to be able to send their children to public school too. They want the best \neducation. I am telling these Vermonters I will not support this confirmation. It is dangerous and shortsighted to \nconfirm someone who has so much to learn about our Nation's public schools and the challenges they face. \nUniversal free public schools were a revolutionary American invention. It has helped make America the great Nation \nit is today. So in the United States, we should strengthen public schools, not snub them. Mrs. DeVos is the wrong \nchoice for our children but also for our Nation's future. Our public schools need strong leadership, not someone who \nhas made it her life's work to undermine their success. So I oppose this nomination. I hope my fellow Senators will \ntoo. Travel Ban Mr. President, while I have the floor, I will just take another minute or two to mention something \nelse, as I have mentioned Vermont. On February 1 of this year, Vermont welcomed 31 new U.S. citizens from 14 \ncountries through a naturalization ceremony in Rutland, VT. Later that night, more than 1,000 people from our \n[[Page S695]] small city in Vermont gathered on our statehouse lawn--just a few feet from where I was born and \nraised--in support of refugees and immigrants. We Vermonters understand what community means. It is a helping \nhand in a time of need. It is a kind word in a moment of distress. It is a welcoming embrace to calm a fear. We may \nbe small, but in Vermont there is no limit to our compassion. As with each of our 50 great American States, \nimmigration is a rich part of Vermont's past. For decades, we have opened our communities to immigrants and \nrefugees. They have all become part of the fabric of our State. They have enriched us with their diverse cultures. \nSince the President signed his disgraceful Executive order that stymied our immigrant resettlement program and \nsent a shameful message to Muslims that they are not welcome in our country, I have heard from hundreds of \nVermonters. Compassionate Vermont- ers, pleading that we continue our Refugee Resettlement Program and \nwelcome refugees of all religions, concerned Vermonters, anxious about the threats to our Constitution's protected \nfreedoms and rights, nervous Vermonters wondering what next steps this administration will take in the name of \nsecurity, but are just rooted in politically charged scare tactics. Vermonters have already proven that we will not \nback down. Marching in Montpelier and in Washington on January 21, Vermonters' voices were heard. In candlelit \nvigils across the State, their empathy has been seen. At the naturalization ceremony on February 1, Vermont's \nwelcoming spirit could be felt. A man I admire greatly, Federal District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford, gave stirring \n\n\n\nremarks at that naturalization ceremony, and the impact of those remarks are summarized by this one line, which \nhe directed particularly to our new Muslim citizens: ``You are equal in the eyes of the law.'' Judge Crawford's \nmessage was simple: You are welcome. You are equal. You are protected. My fellow Vermonters inspire me every \nday. We should all take note from their example of what it means to be patriotic Americans. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that Judge Crawford's remarks from the February 1, 2017, naturalization ceremony in Rutland, VT, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. I look at Judge Crawford. Frankly, I have no idea what either \nhe or the other Federal district judge's politics are. I just know they uphold the law. We are fortunate in this country \nto have a Federal court system made up of men and women of integrity, competence, and independence. I was \nshocked this weekend when the President of the United States tried to demean the Federal judiciary, tried to \ndowngrade an individual Federal judge because he disagreed with him. And it was almost within hours that he \npraised President Putin and tried to excuse the assassinations--the assassinations--carried out in Russia against \njournalists or those who disagreed with Putin--by saying: Well, that is no different than our country. Well, Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to be a citizen of the United States of America, and we are different than Russia. You may \nhave some ``friendship'' with Vladimir Putin, but let me tell you right now, show some more respect to our country \nand to our Constitution. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: \nRemarks of Judge Geoffrey Crawford at 2/1/17 U.S. Naturalization Ceremony, Rutland, VT Welcome--all of you--to \nyour naturalization ceremony. You will all leave here as American citizens. We are very happy to include you \namong us. Let me take a moment to talk about a few things. First, although our theme today is one of welcome and \nnew beginnings, we should all start by considering both the difficulties of the journeys you have made and the \nrichness of the backgrounds which you bring. First the journey. The Latin poet Catullus said it best: ``Multas per \ngentes et multa per aequora vectus'' In English, ``Carried through many nations and over many seas'' Your \njourneys have not been easy. Some of you have left family--all of you have left friends and the comfort of familiar \nsurroundings for this new place. Some of you are refugees from lands which are broken by war. Today we honor \nthe commitment of our nation to welcoming and caring for refugees. Some of you experienced hunger, illness and \nhardship. All of you come in search of a better life. But it would not be right to forget the value of the lives and \ncommunities from which you come. As we welcome you, we honor your heritage--your parents, your culture, and \nthe lands of your birth. You bring variety and energy and new ideas to us. You know a lot that we do not know. You \nhave had experiences that we want to hear about. We are lucky that you have chosen to make your lives here. We \nneed each of you because of what you will contribute to us-- your work, your ideas, your sense of humor, your food, \nyour children. Let me speak directly about our new citizens who are Muslims. What I have to say is simple: you are \nequal in the eyes of the law. You are just as welcome here as citizens as anyone else. Your faith and your right to \nworship are honored and protected by our laws. We recognize that the Muslim faith is ancient and learned and that \nit has contributed greatly over more than a thousand years to our shared civilization. Muslim citizens and residents \nhave served America for more than two centuries in military service, in scientific research, in literature and the arts, \nin the professions, in commerce, in labor--in all the ways that we all contribute to the daily life of our nation. As \nMuslims, you have the same right as any other citizen. These include protection from discrimination on the basis of \nyour relations and your national origin and protection of your right to worship freely. These protections are not \nempty promises. They form part of our constitutional law. These protections are enforced every day by our courts. \nBut let me turn towards a happier subject. This is a day of celebration. Today we welcome you as our brothers and \nsisters, common citizens of the county we all love and which you have chosen as your own. What can you expect in \nthe years ahead as American citizens? Two things stand out: opportunity and individual freedom. These are the \nvalues which have brought people like your family and mine to America for more than two centuries. Let's talk about \nboth. Opportunity means the chance to work, to go to school, to find a way to support yourself which has meaning \nfor you, to have money for your family, to rent or buy a home, to educate your children and some day to retire with \ndignity. Because our economy is strong, there is room for you to find a place which suits you. It is never easy, and \nthere are many disappointments along the way, but it is possible and millions have succeeded before you. This is a \nvery open society for workers. One job leads to another. Your first job is not going to be your last. You are already \nin a select group--people who have chosen to come here and have the drive and enthusiasm to join us as citizens. \nThe same energy which carried you through the naturalization process will help you in your search for a good job. \nNow, let's talk about freedom. Freedom means the chance to speak, assemble in groups, worship, and engage in \npolitics without fear of interference from the government. If I can make one respectful suggestion, it is that you use \nthis freedom by getting involved in a cause or a committee or a campaign. Maybe something local--like asking for a \nsidewalk where one is needed--maybe national--like volunteering on a political campaign. In case you haven't \n\n\n\nnoticed, we are in the middle of a presidential race this year. There is a candidate for every possible political belief. I \nurge you to take part in any way that suits your own convictions and interests. Freedom is strongest when it is used, \nnot when it sits dusty on the shelf, and we welcome your involvement in public life together. People who are born in \nthe United States sometimes take it for granted. Like people anywhere. Or they concentrate on our faults and the \nunfair things about our society. New Americans such as you bring optimism. You would not have come if you did \nnot see the chance for a better life for your family. One thing is certain--after the work to obtain citizenship, no one \nhere is going to take it for granted. I ask that in the years ahead, you hold on to the hope and great expectation we \nall share with you on this day. Thank you so much for coming to join us today as American citizens. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Schumer. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The \nSenator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to call on my colleagues to reject the \nnomination of Betsy DeVos as the next Secretary of Education. It is difficult to imagine a worse choice to head the \nDepartment of Education. Betsy DeVos doesn't believe in public schools. Her only knowledge of student loans \nseems to come from her own financial investments connected to debt collectors who hound people struggling with \nstudent loans. Despite being a billionaire, she wants the chance to keep making money off [[Page S696]] shady \ninvestments while she runs the Department of Education. We need someone in charge of the Nation's education \npolicy who knows what they are doing and who will put America's young people first, and that is not Betsy DeVos. \nLet's start with her record. Betsy DeVos has used her vast fortune to undermine Michigan's public schools. She is \nsure she knows what is best for everyone else's children, even though she has no actual experience with public \nschools. In Michigan, the K-12 policy she has bankrolled has drained valuable taxpayer dollars out of the public \nschools and shunted that money into private schools, sketchy online schools, and for-profit charter schools. Even \nworse, DeVos believes these schools should get the money with virtually no accountability for what these schools \ndo with taxpayer dollars. The results have been a disaster for Michigan kids. Let's be perfectly clear. This is not a \ndebate about school choice. It is not a debate about charter schools. There are people on all sides of this debate \nwho are genuinely pouring their hearts into improving educational outcomes for children. Massachusetts charter \nschools are among the very best in the country, and they understand the difference. Before her nomination hearing, \nI received an extraordinary letter from the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association. The letter outlines \ntheir opposition to Betsy DeVos's nomination, citing her destructive record of promoting for-profit charter schools \nwithout strong oversight for how those schools serve students and families. People who work hard to build good \ncharter schools with high accountability are offended by the DeVos nomination. This abysmal record is troubling \nbecause the Secretary of Education is responsible for safeguarding the investments that the Federal Government \nmakes in public schools and for holding States accountable for delivering a good education for all their students, \nespecially those who need the help the most. The Secretary is also responsible for enforcing critical civil rights laws, \nlike the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, but Betsy \nDeVos's confirmation hearing demonstrated to the entire world she is embarrassingly unprepared to enforce these \nlaws. Her apparent unfamiliarity with these critical civil rights laws has terrified families who have children with \nspecial needs, terrified families in Massachusetts and all across the country. These parents are afraid we could \nhave an Education Secretary who doesn't even have a basic understanding of the Federal laws that guarantee their \nkids a chance to receive a public school education. We still have a long way to go to make sure all kids in this \ncountry have a shot at a decent education, particularly children living in poverty, children of color, children with \ndisabilities, and children who are immigrants or refugees. That is why the Federal Government got involved in \neducation in the first place, to make certain that all of our children, not just some of them but that all of our children \nget a chance at a first-rate education. Public education dollars should come with some basic accountability for how \nthat money is spent and some basic expectations about what we get in return for these investments, not just doled \nout to some for- profit school that doesn't even meet basic standards in educating our children. This is also true in \nhigher education, where the financial stakes are huge for America's college students. The Department of \nEducation is in charge of making sure that the $150 billion that American taxpayers invest in students each year \nthrough grants and loans gets into the right hands and that students get an education that will help them pay back \ntheir loans. The student aid program is not well understood, but it is vitally important to get it right because $1 \ntrillion of student loan debt currently out there will impact the future of an entire generation. Betsy DeVos has no \nexperience in higher education. During her confirmation hearing, I gave her the opportunity to show that she is at \nleast serious about standing up for students. I asked her basic, straightforward questions about her commitment to \nprotecting students and taxpayers from fraud by these shady for-profit colleges. Her response was shocking. She \nrefused to commit to use the Department's many tools and resources to keep students from getting cheated when \n\n\n\nfraudulent colleges break the law. In her responses to my written questions, she even refused to commit to doing \nwhat the law requires by canceling the loans of students who have been cheated by lawbreaking colleges. An \nEducation Secretary who is unwilling to cut off Federal aid to colleges that break the law and cheat students would \nbe a disaster for both students and taxpayers. Betsy DeVos's refusal to guarantee debt relief for defrauded \nstudents could leave thousands of Americans saddled with student loan debt that by law they are not required to \npay. Betsy DeVos also refused to rule out privatizing the Direct Loan Program. Think about this. As if our students \ndon't have enough problems already, DeVos is ready to let Wall Street banks get their claws into our students and \nstart charging extra profits on top of the already high cost of student loans. If Betsy DeVos won't commit to \nstrengthening the Federal student loan program and running it for students, then she is absolutely unfit to be in \ncharge of it. I am also deeply concerned about the conflicts of interest and potential government corruption if Betsy \nDeVos is allowed to take the reins of the Department of Education. Betsy DeVos is a multibillionaire, and that is \nfine, but for her, that is apparently not enough. She already makes money off of several businesses that could profit \nfrom decisions she makes as Secretary of Education--several businesses, at least, that we know about. She said \nshe will get rid of the ones we know about, but she wants to keep her family trusts and whatever investments two of \nthem hold a secret--a secret from Congress and a secret from U.S. taxpayers. She says she doesn't have to follow \nrules that everyone else follows and tell the Senate what her investments are or what they will be in those secret \ntrusts. I want you to think about that for just a minute. She already has billions of dollars, but she won't give up her \nsecret trust and her chance to make investments that could create conflicts of interest while she is running the \nDepartment of Education? Who exactly does Betsy DeVos want to help out--the young people of America or her \nown bank account? You know, I really don't get this. I disagree with her education policy, but the one thing we \nought to be able to agree on is that no one, especially not some billionaire, ought to keep investments that go up or \ndown in value depending on the decisions she makes while she has a job working for the U.S. Government. \nBecause of that concern, I wrote a letter with several of my Democratic colleagues to raise concerns about her \npotential conflicts that aren't clearly resolved by her public ethics agreement. We asked her some simple questions \nabout the lack of financial transparency and the shady investments she plans to keep while she has a government \njob. What did we get back? Nothing. Zero. Bupkes. She thought our basic questions about ethics weren't even \nworth an answer. That stinks. This whole process stinks. At every step along the way, the Republicans have made \nit clear that no matter her inexperience, no matter her radical views, no matter her potential conflicts of interest, no \nmatter her secrecy, no matter her blowing off basic anti-corruption practices, they will ram this nomination down the \nthroats of the American people sideways. Here are just a few egregious examples. First, committee Democrats \nwere allotted 5 minutes--5 minutes total-- during her hearing to question Betsy DeVos on her troubling record. \nRepublicans suddenly invented a new rule that we couldn't ask additional questions. This is an important job. I \nasked President Obama's Secretary of Education multiple rounds of questions, and he had led a public education \nsystem in the past, but I guess when a Republican nominee and megadonor is in line to run education policy, we \nare supposed to fall in line and keep quiet. Second, breaking with standard practice and what we did for President \nObama's Education nominees, we were [[Page S697]] forced to hold Betsy DeVos's hearing before the ethics \nreview of her billions was completed. The complicated ethics review raised a ton of additional questions, but we got \nabsolutely no chance to question her about it. Third, Betsy DeVos is the first nominee ever to go through the HELP \nCommittee who has flat-out refused to fully disclose her financial holdings. She will be the first nominee in recent \nhistory to hold secret trusts. She was supposed to complete a form that requires nominees to list in detail all of their \nassets, investments, and gifts so that the committee has a full understanding of the nominees' potential conflicts of \ninterest. No, she wants to keep many of her holdings in a family trust a secret, so she just won't tell. Fourth, \nRepublicans ignored and overrode the rules of the Senate in order to barely squeeze the DeVos nomination out of \ncommittee as quickly as possible. And now, with at least 50 Senators--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents-\n-publicly opposed to this nomination, the Republican leadership has rigged the vote so that Senator Sessions can \ndrag her across the finish line just before he is confirmed as Attorney General. Why is Senator Sessions even \nvoting on this nomination? It is a massive conflict of interest. As the AG, Sessions will be responsible for enforcing \nthe law against DeVos if her cesspool of unresolved financial conflicts results in illegal behavior, but apparently the \nRepublicans just don't care. Let's face it: The Republican leadership wants DeVos, and they are willing to ignore her \nhostility to public schools, willing to ignore her indifference to laws that protect special needs kids, willing to ignore \nthe giant ethical cloud that hangs over her--ignore it all so that billionaire and Republican campaign contributor \nBetsy DeVos can be Secretary of Education. The American people can see what is happening here. I commend my \nRepublican colleagues, Senators Collins and Murkowski, for standing up for what is right and saying they will vote \n\n\n\nagainst Betsy DeVos's nomination on the floor. I know how difficult it can be to stand up for what is right even under \noverwhelming pressure from your own team to just keep your head down and go with the flow. They have been \nlistening to the teachers and parents in their States, and I deeply respect their principled opposition to this \nnomination. I have also heard from thousands of teachers, parents, and education leaders in Massachusetts raising \ndeep concern about Betsy DeVos's nomination. I hear their concern, and I share their concern. You know, this isn't \njust politics, this is deeply personal. It is personal for me. My first job out of college was as a teacher. I taught little \nones, children with special needs, in a public elementary school. I have never lost my appreciation for the \nimportance of strong public education because I have seen how public education opened a million doors for me, \nand I know it opens doors for young people in Massachusetts and all across this country. I believe that \nstrengthening America's public schools is critical for securing a better future for our children and for our \ngrandchildren. I also understand the vital role the Secretary of Education plays in making sure every young person \nhas real opportunities and a fighting chance to succeed. We are one vote away from making sure this job is not \nentrusted to Betsy DeVos. One vote. We need just one more Republican to stand up for the children of America, to \nstand up for public education, to stand up for college students, to stand up for basic decency and honesty in \ngovernment. With just one more Republican, we can say this Senate puts kids ahead of partisan politics. With just \none more Republican, we can say this Senate still cares about public officials who put the public ahead of their own \ninterests. Just one more Republican, that is all we need. Just one. I assumed that the rush to complete this \nnomination has something to do with the fact that Republicans' phones have been ringing off the hook from citizens \nwho are outraged by the idea of this nomination. Before these Republicans decide whether to help Donald Trump \nreward a wealthy donor by putting someone in charge of the Department of Education who doesn't really believe in \npublic education, I want them to hear from the people of Massachusetts, the people who on their own have \ncontacted me about this nomination. I have received countless letters and calls from constituents in Massachusetts, \nincluding a batch of letters from a new local grassroots organization--Essex County #6 Indivisible--that is very \nconcerned that Betsy DeVos is a danger to our schools. So I just want to share a few of those letters with my \ncolleagues right now. I heard from Matt Harden, who is a teacher from Plymouth, and he wrote this: I have been a \nteacher for fifteen years and a parent for seven. I feel incredibly proud of the schools in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, and view my position as a music educator not simply as a job but a vocation. The recent \nreferendum in the Commonwealth regarding the expansion of cap on Charter Schools was soundly defeated by the \nelectorate. I have grave concerns about Ms. DeVos and her ties to corporate interests in education. Schools are not \nbusinesses, and students are not products on an assembly line. This line of thinking is a clear and present danger \nto our students, and reflects a lack of familiarity with the public education system. In this matter, my concerns are \nnot limited to the borders of our own state but the equitable access to education across our nation. Ms. DeVos is \nnot the right person to be an intellectual and educational leader for our nation--we need real change and ideas, not \nprivatization and politicization of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens. I also heard from Alexandra Loos, a \nspecial education teacher from Cambridge. She had this to say: I am a special education teacher who works with \nchildren with developmental disabilities, and I urge you to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as \nSecretary of Education. I have grave concerns about the qualifications of Ms. DeVos due to her lack of experience \nin the public education system as well as her record of support for charter and private schools that are not obligated \nto follow Federal education standards or guidelines. Most urgently, as a professional who specializes in evaluating \nand treating children with autism, Down syndrome, learning disabilities, ADHD, and other developmental and \nbehavioral disorders, I am extremely concerned about Ms. DeVos's apparent lack of understanding of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal law that guarantees ``a free and appropriate public \neducation'' to children with disabilities. During her confirmation hearing this week, Ms. DeVos appeared to be \nunfamiliar with IDEA . . . stating that she felt that enforcement of this federal law should be left up to the states. This \nis unacceptable and clearly indicates that Ms. DeVos is unqualified to serve as Secretary of Education. With \napproximately 13% of public school children in special education, it is essential that an Education Secretary be \nknowledgeable and supportive of the federal laws that guide special education services. Please vote ``no'' on Ms. \nDeVos's confirmation. Yes, Alexandra. Yes. My office also heard from Diana Fullerton, a school adjustment \ncounselor from Salem. Diana said she had never written to a politician before, but she felt strongly enough about \nBetsy DeVos to write: I am a school adjustment counselor in an elementary school in Gloucester. I have never \ngotten involved much in politics until this election. I went to the Boston Women's March on Saturday and this is my \nfirst time writing to a politician. I am extremely concerned about Trump's nomination for Secretary of Education, \nBetsy DeVos. In my work I support students who are very vulnerable: on IEPS, in high-poverty environments, \n\n\n\nidentifying as gay or transgender, and coming from backgrounds where English is a second language. I believe that \nMs. DeVos' extreme and uneducated positions on the needs of students in public schools could harm my children. \nPlease vote against her nomination as Secretary of Education. Thanks, Diana. I will. I heard from another teacher \nfrom Newton, who said: I am opposed to Betsey DeVos as the next Secretary of Education. I have spent my entire \nlife as a teacher--first in public and private schools for 14 years teaching French, then as a member of the faculty of \nLesley University for 26 years, and now as a teacher in a Life Long Learning program at Brandeis. I cannot imagine \nhaving a Secretary of Education who has never had any direct educational experience. I am also very worried about \nher views of public education and her appalling record on civil rights. Strong education is the foundation of our \ndemocracy. Please do what you can to maintain and improve our current system. Thank you. Yet another teacher \ncontacted our office, this one from Abington. She wrote: I believe in my community's public schools. In fact, I've \nworked in them as a [[Page S698]] teacher for over 15 years. The nomination of Betsy DeVos has me seriously \nconsidering a change of employment. Betsy DeVos believes in school privatization and vouchers. She has worked \nto undermine efforts to regulate Michigan charters, even when they clearly fail, and yet she has never worked in a \nschool. The marketplace solution of DeVos will destroy our democratically governed community schools. Her \nhostility toward public schools disqualifies her. I am asking you to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos. We \nalso heard from parents all across the State, including Leslie Boloian, a mother from Andover. Leslie said: I am a \nmother of an 8 year old who is dyslexic. She is smart and very capable of learning what other kids can learn; \nhowever, she needs specialized education. Through the public school system, she is learning to read and continues \nto reach new milestones daily. I fear that Betsy DeVos could put my daughter's education at risk. I urge you to \noppose Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos, who is best known for her anti-public education campaigns! \nThe chance for the success of a child should not depend on winning a charter lottery, being accepted by a private \nschool, or living in the right ZIP code. It is our duty to ensure all students have access to a great public school in \ntheir community and the opportunity to succeed. Betsy DeVos has consistently worked against these values, and \nher efforts over the years have done more to undermine public education than support all students. Betsy DeVos \nhas no experience in public schools, either as a student, educator, administrator, or even as a parent. She has \nlobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers to fund private schools at taxpayers' expense. These privatization \nschemes do nothing to help our students most in need, and they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps. \nWe need a Secretary of Education who will champion innovative strategies that we know help to improve success \nfor all students, including creating more opportunities and equity for all. Betsy DeVos is not that person, and I urge \nyou to vote against her for Secretary of Education. Thank you, Leslie. Kate Brigham, a mother from Somerville, also \nwrote. She said. My name is Kate Brigham, and I am a constituent of yours from Somerville. . . . I'm writing to urge \nyou to vote against Betsy DeVos' confirmation as Secretary of Education. The future of our kids here in Somerville \nand across the country are depending on you to see the difference between education progress and privatization. \nThe majority of America's school children attend public schools. We cannot leave their futures and the future of our \ncountry in the hands of a woman whose ideas to privatize school funding have already left the state of Michigan and \nits children in shambles. Her personal financial conflicts of interest are staggering. The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act--which DeVos did not know was a federal law--guarantees rights to both students with disabilities \nand to their parents. So this isn't just about civil rights; it's also crucial to families. We cannot afford a Secretary of \nEducation who's ``confused'' on what the law is. My own 2-year-old daughter benefits from MA's wonderful Early \nIntervention program and will need special education services when she turns 3 in September. IDEA and the ADA \nwere both signed into law by Republican Presidents. Disability rights are not and cannot become a partisan issue. \nThank you for ensuring that public education for ALL will be protected. Somerville, and Massachusetts, needs it. \nAnd we won't succeed with Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Thank you, Kate. Thanks for writing. Samantha \nLambert, a mother of four from Everett, also contacted us with her concerns. Samantha wrote: I am a voter from MA \nwho has struggled with the change coming as a result of this election. . . . It is difficult to focus when there is a new \noutrage at every turn. No one frightens me more than Betsy DeVos. Why? The impacts of her ignorance and \ndisdain for public education will remain with us for a generation. I have 4 children, all educated in the Everett Public \nSchool System, one of whom benefits from Special Education. We have one opportunity to get it right with our \nchildren. I was asked by a conservative friend who was curious why this appointment brought such a backlash, and \nthe answer was simple for me. Our job is to protect our children, the nation's children. Those unable to influence \ntheir future with a vote. There is no mandate for the destruction of our most treasured institution, the foundation of \nour democracy. My son deserves a free and fair education, as do his siblings. As do their peers. The children in our \nschool district are in the lower socioeconomic rung. Many rely on public transportation and neighborhood public \n\n\n\nschools. That takes the choice out of school choice, doesn't it? It favors students on economic lines, furthering the \ndivide and putting an undue burden on the schools left behind who will struggle to serve the students that need this \ngift of education most. The public hearing demonstrated that Mrs. DeVos is wholly unqualified for this appointment. \nHer answers or lack of answers, specifically regarding IDEA and school choice, were frightening. As a parent, I was \nliterally shaking. My nine-year-old son was listening to a portion and heard Senator Hassan mention dyslexia in her \nquestion. He cheered and asked if we were going to make sure all kids get special help to read. I couldn't answer \nhim because in her answer, Mrs. DeVos seemed not to know that IDEA is a Federal law protecting these beautiful \nminds. Protecting them from being a line item that can be wiped away, their future successes and achievements \ngoing right along with it. I ask you, please oppose Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary, for the good of ALL our \nnation's children. Thank you, Samantha. Thanks for writing. We also heard from Laura Fukushima, a mother and \nformer teacher from Dedham. She wrote to say: Before having my own children, I taught in public schools for five \nyears--three in Boston and two in Tennessee (Sumner Country)--and I'm writing to ask you to vote against \nconfirming Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. It's evident that Ms. DeVos is passionate about education-- \njudging from the enormous amounts of money she has poured into shaping policy--and I have no reason to doubt \nher intentions are good. But that doesn't qualify her for this job. Here are my concerns: 1) Aside from having no \nexperience in public schools, either as a parent or a student, she has no experience in any kind of school as an \neducator. 2) At her confirmation hearing, she demonstrated a lack of basic understanding of many pertinent issues \nand concepts--an intimate knowledge of which is required to shape good educational policy. 3) Despite lacking both \nthe prerequisite knowledge and experience within the field of education, she actively used her wealth to sway \nlegislators in Michigan away from their initial support of bipartisan measures, based on a broad coalition of informed \nparticipants, to regulate and improve charter schools. (For the record, I do support charter schools, but \nunderstanding that there is a vast disparity in their quality, I see the need for rigorous oversight.) Her efforts, I \nbelieve, have been more detrimental than beneficial to the children of Detroit. 4) Her suggestion that enforcing IDEA \nshould be left to the states is very troubling. Such policy would leave our most vulnerable students very far behind. \nWhile I agree with Ms. DeVos that our educational system would benefit from some additional choice for parents, I \nthink she's wildly mistaken if she believes a completely free market will fix our schools. We need a Secretary of \nEducation who believes in proper oversight and can help create effective measures of assessment and \naccountability to improve education for all our children. That's what the Department of Education is for. To run it \nsuccessfully, we need a Secretary, unlike DeVos, who is well trained in the field. Thank you, Laura. A mother from \nClinton also wrote about how she would be personally affected by Betsy DeVos, saying: I have an 8-year-old \ndaughter with Autism Spectrum Disorder who receives services through our public elementary school. I believe that \nevery individual deserves an equal education. IDEA must be upheld! My daughter is doing very well with her studies \nbecause of the supports she receives. She is a very smart girl but needs and deserves accommodations. I am \nthankful there are laws to protect her. Betsy DeVos thinks that states should decide how to fund education for \nindividuals with disabilities. I believe it should remain federally mandated. I wouldn't be able to afford a private \neducation for my daughter in a special school. I know there are many more parents like me. I also opposed \nexpanding Charter schools in our state. I believe publicly funded schools should be publicly run and overseen. I \nrequest you reject Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary. Thank you. Another parent wrote to say: I am writing to \nexpress my strong opposition to the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. She has demonstrated \nNO commitment to public education throughout her life, and her support of charter schools in Detroit has been a \ndemonstrated failure. The framing of for-profit charter schools as providing ``choice'' for parents is a false framing--it \nprovides the illusion of a poorly regulated and poorly supervised choice for some parents while limiting the \nresources and choices left to the other parents and leading to a downward spiral in the quality of public education. \nTransferring public funding of education to for- profit charter schools, creaming off the children of the most \nmotivated parents, and leaving the more difficult, lower income, and children with special education challenges is a \nprescription for failure of public schools and will result in herding lower-income students into dysfunctional schools, \nsetting them up for a lifetime of underemployment. I am not a teacher, nor a member of a teacher's union. I am a \nmother, and I was [[Page S699]] proud to send my son to the Brookline Public Schools for his entire K-12 \neducation. I want other children to have a chance for a quality education, not to be the fodder for a private, for-profit \ncharter school with no commitment to the public good. Quality public education is the foundation of a free society \nand the key to sustaining a vibrant economy in the future. Please oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos. A \nwoman from Canton also wrote in. She said: As a parent of public school children, I urge you to reject the \nnomination of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. A free and appropriate education is the cornerstone of our \n\n\n\ndemocracy, but Ms. DeVos has shown no interest in preserving public education. In fact, she has worked tirelessly \nto divert public funds into private pockets by way of deregulating and expanding charter schools and to offer \nvouchers which can be used at private and religious schools. This is a clear violation of our principle of separating \nchurch and State. Ms. DeVos's strategies have had disastrous consequences in Michigan. Eighty percent of \ncharter schools there operate for profit. When schools look first to satisfy investors, they rely on teaching to \nstandardized tests, not on educating children. Here in Massachusetts, we overwhelmingly rejected the idea, one \nfunded by billionaires, and resisted by parents and public school teachers. Please join us in opposing a ``lead \neducator'' who has never gone to a public school nor sent her children to one. Please consider that the nation's \nfuture depends on educating every child, and that to do so, we need to restore and strengthen our public school \nsystem, not dismantle it in favor of profiting off the backs of our youth. Thank you. It is no surprise that we also \nheard from many constituents struggling with student loans. One of those was Liam Weir, a college student from \nBrighton, who had this to say: As a college student and a resident of the State of Massachusetts, I am writing you \nto express my deep concern over the potential appointment of Betsy DeVos to the position of Secretary of \nEducation. Ms. DeVos is extraordinarily unqualified to lead such a department. The fact that the President has \nchosen such a person, with no experience in education administration in any capacity at any level, is an insult to the \nmillions of teachers, students, and school administrators across the country. Ms. DeVos's policies will undermine \nalready struggling public school systems by allocating taxpayer funds to advance a cynical and deeply troubling \nagenda against established science. I myself am a recipient of Federal college grants and loans, and I am growing \nincreasingly concerned about Ms. DeVos's competency in managing the looming student debt crisis. Now more \nthan ever is a time for the Education Department to be run by capable and caring individuals, not willfully ignorant \nones. A young mother from Winthrop also reached out to us. She had this to say: I urge you to vote No on the \nconfirmation of Betsy DeVos, a singularly unqualified individual . . . among a veritable sea of unqualified individuals \nthis administration has chosen to lead our country. My husband and I have no personal stake in public education \nover the next 4 years. Our daughter is only 7 months old. But I am the child of two public schoolteachers in RI, my \nfriends are teachers, my friends' children are in school, my nephews, cousins, etc. I believe in public schools and I \nbelieve that Betsy DeVos is not the right direction for our public education system. She is dangerous, and her lack \nof knowledge is appalling. Also, and I thank you so much for asking about this at her hearing--student loans are not \na business, they are a crisis in this country. My husband has a six figure debt, with interest rates at 7.5 percent. He \nhad to take a job . . . rather than pursue his dreams of working in criminal justice because he needed a job that \ncould pay his $1,000 a month student loan bill. Our saving grace is that I have a good job, and my student loan \ndebt is nearly paid off--because I was loaned a reasonable amount at a reasonable 2 percent interest rate. We are \na case study in how the program should work vs. predatory lending. That is so true. Thanks for writing. Liz \nBosworth, a mother of two from North Dartmouth, had this to say: While I am fully aware that you do not support the \nnominations for many of President Trump's nominees, I am currently most concerned about Ms. DeVos. I watched \nparts of her hearing and I remain concerned that there was a denial for a second hearing. I hope this leads to \ncontinued questions and a final opposition of her as Secretary of Education. Your lines of questioning served to \nhighlight her lack of qualifying experience but still, in light of this last six month's politics, I believe anything is \npossible. As the mother of two small children and a daughter-in-law, niece, cousin, friend, and wife of public school \nteachers, I find her to be quite alarming and somewhat scary as the potential leader of that office. We are strong \nproponents of public education and of teaching our children to value their time in school and to achieve high levels \nof success. With that comes some anxiety around their aspirations to higher learning. As a master's level social \nworker, I will be paying off my loans until I start to pay for my son's higher education. I do not want the debt for my \nchildren that I have. At this rate, I am saving far much less money per month for their college funds while paying off \nmy own. I want my children to go higher than myself, but I want them to do so with a level of confidence in their \nfinances that I was not afforded. Ms. DeVos, highlighted by you in her confirmation hearing, has not been involved \nwith student loans on any level and does not have the experience to become entrusted with my current debt or the \ndebt of my children. Finally, I would like to highlight my abject fear of the treatment of those students with learning \ndisabilities, particularly severe and profound disorders, if she is confirmed. While I see many walks of life in my field, \nmy mother was a proud special education teacher in New Bedford for 33 years. She was proud to be able to teach \nlife skills like budgeting, simple cooking and social skills to her students who may not ever be college ready. We \nworry about those kids and what will become of them if Ms. DeVos is confirmed. My husband is currently employed \nin a collaborative that works with mentally ill children who need a different kind of educational process but can still \nachieve the same goals. I am not sure they would ever qualify for a voucher to attend some Charter school. We are \n\n\n\ncommitted to families and community maintenance of all students with the right care at the right time. I am not sure \nthat Ms. DeVos is committed in the same way. Please vote to oppose Ms. DeVos. Thank you, Liz. Thanks for \nwriting. I heard from another student in Boston who told me the following: I am writing to you today as a public \nschool teacher and a Ph.D. Candidate in Urban Education, Leadership and Policy Studies. I believe in public \nschools. Betsy DeVos believes in school privatization and vouchers. She has worked to undermine efforts to \nregulate Michigan charters, even when they clearly failed. The ``marketplace'' solution of DeVos will destroy our \ndemocratically governed community schools. She has no professional experience in the education field. She does \nnot truly understand the nuances of public education nor does she want to understand. I managed to earn \nscholarships that took care of most of my schooling, but I still have about $80,000 in student loans. (Not bad for 2 \nexpensive private institution degrees!) I am a first generation college student and my single mother could not afford \nto help me pay for my schooling. Betsy DeVos just doesn't have experience in K-12 public schools, but she has no \nexperience in running the student loan department. The Federal student loan program is far from perfect. We \nneed someone running it who is knowledgeable in the process, believes in making college more affordable, and \nunderstands what it feels like to not be sure how you will pay for college. She has no qualifications of any kind in \nthis area. I am asking you to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos. Please consider this request and the \nthousands of other people across the country who vehemently disagree with Ms. DeVos's candidacy. Thank you. \nSarah Rothery, a mother of two from Northborough, told me about her two sons, saying: I am writing to ask that you \noppose the confirmation of Ms. DeVos for the cabinet position for which she was nominated under President \nTrump. I have put 2 sons through college thanks to Stafford loans and personal savings and I think she has no idea \nwhat is involved in middle class families financing college educations today. One of my sons is now an 8th grade \nhistory teacher in a public charter school, Abbot Kelly Foster, in Worcester, and worries that Ms. DeVos has no real \nunderstanding of urban education as well. Thank you, Sarah. Thanks for writing. I have also heard from Alicia \nBettano, a former student from Merrimac who bravely shared with me her own experiences. This is from Alicia: I \nsuffer from a Non Verbal Learning Disorder. Up until I was 13 years old I was not diagnosed with anything. I went to \naides, speech therapists, everyone. I had trouble in the maths and in sciences. I was thought of as stupid. I was \nyelled at by aides. When I was 13 and diagnosed, my teachers didn't understand. They thought sitting me closer to \nthe white board would allow me to understand better, despite the fact that it was their teaching methods that \nconfused me. I was told I would not go to college or graduate. My parents had to hire an advocate to work for me to \nget my teachers and school to understand my disability. It took me some time to figure out what I wanted and \nneeded, but in May I graduated college. Betsy DeVos would be a horror for those with disabilities; not just learning \nones, but mental ones. I was lucky I had parents and one teacher backing me. What about the ones that don't? \nPutting Betsy DeVos into office will hurt our children in America--that's not making America great. Alicia, thank you \nfor writing. I really appreciate it. Congratulations on your graduation. [[Page S700]] A man from Brookline also wrote \nin, saying this: As someone passionate about education, especially the education of students in Massachusetts, \nand as a graduate of a public elementary school, middle school, high school and college; as a young professional \nburdened by education debt; as the husband of an early childhood educator working in a struggling Boston \nneighborhood; as a member of a family filled with men and women dedicated to careers in public education, I \nstrongly urge you to oppose Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos. My vote for or against candidates in \nfuture elections will be informed by whether the candidate publicly opposed this Secretary of Education nominee. \nBetsy DeVos has consistently worked against public education and she is incredibly unqualified for this position. At \nbest, she should be an undersecretary focused on public-private partnerships. If you must work with the incoming \nadministration, suggest her nomination for that role, but you must oppose her cabinet-level appointment. DeVos has \nno experience in public schools, either as a student, educator, administrator or even as a parent. She has lobbied \nfor, and been employed by, initiatives that have undermined public education in America. We need a Secretary of \nEducation who will champion innovative strategies that we know help to improve success for all students, including \ncreating more opportunities and equity for all. I urge you to vote against Ms. DeVos for Secretary of Education. \nWhat does Betsy DeVos have to say to Matt and Diana or to the thousands of other teachers who have more \nexperience in public education than she does? What does she have to say to Leslie and Samantha, whose children \nhave benefited from the programs she wants to cut? What does she have to say to Sarah, who relied on Stafford \nloans to put her sons through college? It is not just individuals who are worried about Betsy DeVos. We have heard \nfrom groups across the State as well. The Massachusetts Charter Public School Association wrote me, saying this: \nDear Senator Warren, As the Association representing the 70 Massachusetts commonwealth charter public \nschools, we are writing to express our concerns over the nomination of Elisabeth DeVos as U.S. Secretary of \n\n\n\nEducation. We do not express these reservations lightly, but we believe it is important to raise certain issues that \nshould be addressed by the nominee. Both President-elect Trump and Ms. DeVos are strong supporters of public \ncharter schools, and we are hopeful they will continue the bipartisan efforts of the Clinton, Bush and Obama \nAdministrations to promote the continued expansion of high quality charters while pursuing reforms that will \nstrengthen traditional public schools. But we are concerned about media reports of Ms. DeVos' support for school \nvouchers and her critical role in creating a charter system in her home state of Michigan that has been widely \ncriticized for lax oversight and poor academic performance, and appears to be dominated by for-profit interests. As \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts and a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n& Pensions (HELP), which will hold hearings on the nomination, you will be in a position to ensure the nominee \ncommits to holding the national charter school movement to the highest levels of accountability and oversight that \nare the hallmark of the Massachusetts charter system. By all independent accounts, Massachusetts has the best \ncharter school system in the country. We are providing high quality public school choices for parents across our \nstate. Our urban schools are serving the highest need children in Massachusetts, and are producing results that \nhave researchers double-checking their math. These gains held across all demographic groups, including African \nAmerican, Latino, and children living in poverty. The cornerstone of the Massachusetts charter public school \nsystem is accountability. The process of obtaining and keeping a charter is deliberately difficult. The state Board of \nElementary and Secondary Education is the sole authorizer and historically has approved only one out of every five \napplications. Once approved, each charter school must submit to annual financial audits by independent auditors \nand annual performance reviews by the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Every five \nyears, each charter must be renewed after a process as rigorous as the initial application process. For-profit charter \nschools are prohibited by Massachusetts law. Our schools have also created partnerships with many \nMassachusetts public school districts to foster collaboration and best practices sharing, and have forged an historic \nCompact between Boston charter public schools and the Boston Public Schools that has become a national model. \nBipartisan support has been key to the development and success of the Massachusetts system. Created in 1993 by \na Democratic Legislature and a Republican Governor, public charter schools have continued to receive support \nfrom all Governors, Republican and Democratic alike, and Democratic legislative leaders. If the new President and \nhis nominee intend to advance the cause of school choice across the country, they should look to Massachusetts \nfor their path forward. The history of charter schools in Michigan offers a more cautionary tale. The same \nresearchers from Stanford that declared Massachusetts charter public schools an unqualified success, had mixed \nreviews for Michigan's charters. According to media reports, last year Ms. DeVos actively campaigned against \nbipartisan legislation that would have provided more oversight for Michigan's charters. If these reports are true, we \nare deeply concerned that efforts to grow school choice without a rigorous accountability system will reduce the \nquality of charter schools across the country. We hope you agree that quality, not quantity, should be the guiding \nprinciple of charter expansion. Without high levels of accountability, this model fails. We ask that you use the \nhearing to probe the incoming Administration's intentions regarding education policy in general and school choice \nand quality specifically. We'd be happy to provide you with more information on the Massachusetts model and \nwould welcome a meeting with your staff to brief them on our concerns. Sincerely, Massachusetts Charter Public \nSchool Association Board of Directors. The people of Massachusetts cannot afford Betsy DeVos. This is why I will \nvote no on her nomination and why I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. President, I yield the floor. \nRecognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. Nomination of \nNeil Gorsuch and the Cabinet Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, President Trump's outstanding Supreme Court \nnominee Neil Gorsuch has earned high praise from all across the political spectrum. Some of it has come from \nunlikely corners, whether Democratic Senators, left-leaning publications, President Obama's own legal mentor, \neven his former top Supreme Court lawyer. We have heard from those Gorsuch has taught. We have heard from \nmany who have worked alongside him. In fact, just a few days ago we received a letter from several of his former \nlaw colleagues. So let me share some of that with you now. The letter began: We are Democrats, Independents, \nand Republicans. Many of us have served in government, some during Republican and some during Democratic \nadministrations; some of us have served in both. We have clerked for Supreme Court justices and appellate and \ndistrict court judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents. We represent a broad spectrum of views \non politics, judicial philosophy, and many other subjects as well. But we all agree on one thing: Our former \ncolleague, Neil M. Gorsuch . . . is superbly qualified for confirmation. He is a man of character, decency, and \naccomplishment, [one who represented all of his clients] without regard to ideology [and one] who merits this \nappointment. Clearly, it is not going to be easy to paint Judge Gorsuch as anything but extremely qualified and \n\n\n\nexceptionally fair, but that hasn't stopped some on the left from trying. They started musing about blocking any \nnominee before the President had even nominated anyone. It is a good reminder that much of the opposition we \nare seeing from far left groups and Democratic Senators isn't so much about Judge Gorsuch as it is about their \ndissatisfaction with the outcome of the election. As a Washington Post headline recently declared, ``Democrats' \ngoal with court nomination: Make it a referendum on Trump.'' ``[P]rominent Senate Democrats,'' the article read, are \n``giving the nominee's 10-plus years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit almost secondary \nconsideration.'' It seems they believe their best, and perhaps only, bet to bring down this highly qualified judge is by \n``inject[ing] Trump into the process.'' The very next day, the New York Times ran an article about Democrats' \napparent hope that this Supreme Court fight will be ``More About Trump Than Gorsuch.'' In other words, our \nDemocratic colleagues are finding it hard to oppose Judge Gorsuch on the merits, so they are trying to divert \nattention and invent new hurdles for him to surmount. That is the playbook. Sure enough, we see them running the \nplay. Consider the assistant Democratic leader's speech the other day. It was supposedly about Judge Gorsuch. He \nsure had a lot to say about President Trump, about things President Trump has done, about things President [[Page \nS701]] Trump might do, about refighting old battles but precious little about the qualifications of the actual nominee \nbefore us, and precious little about the increasing number of accolades he has been receiving, especially from well-\nknown folks on the political left. I mentioned several a moment ago. Now we can add another to the list: Alan \nDershowitz, the famous constitutional scholar and longtime Harvard law professor. Dershowitz described Gorsuch \nas ``highly credentialed and hard to oppose'' and dismissed the idea that he would be caricatured as some sort of \n``extreme right-wing [ideologue].'' ``[T]hat doesn't seem to fit what I know about him,'' Dershowitz said, adding that \nGorsuch will ``be hard to oppose on the merits.'' Indeed, he will. That is precisely why our Democratic colleagues \nare making the debate on his nomination about other things and other people. That is also why they are arguing \nthat there are special hurdles for Judge Gorsuch to clear--hurdles they are forced to admit were not there for the \nfirst- term nominees of Democratic Presidents. When even a leftwinger like Rachel Maddow can't help but admit \nthat Judge Gorsuch is ``a relatively mainstream choice,'' when even Maddow characterizes a Democratic attempt to \nfilibuster his nomination as ``radical,'' it is hard to argue otherwise. That will not stop many on the far left from \ntrying. I invite Democrats, who spent many months insisting ``we need nine,'' to now follow through on that advice \nby giving this superbly qualified nominee fair consideration and an up-or-down vote. It is time to finally accept the \nresults of the election and move on so we can all move our country forward. That would also apply to other \nnominations before the Senate. Just before the election, the Democratic leader said he believed the Senate has a \n``moral obligation, even beyond the economy and politics, to avoid gridlock.'' Put simply, he said: ``We have to get \nthings done.'' Yet just a few months later, Democratic obstruction has reached such extreme levels that the smallest \nnumber of Cabinet officials have been confirmed in modern history at this point in a Presidency. It is a historic break \nin tradition, a departure from how newly elected Presidents of both parties have been treated in decades past. In \nfact, by this same point into their terms, other recent Presidents from both sides of the aisle had more than twice as \nmany Cabinet officials confirmed as President Trump does now. President Obama had 12 Cabinet officials \nconfirmed at this point in his term, President George W. Bush had all 14 Cabinet nominees confirmed at this point, \nPresident Clinton had 13, and President Trump has a mere 4. It seems this gridlock and opposition has far less to \ndo with the nominees actually before us than the man who nominated them, just like we are seeing with President \nTrump's outstanding Supreme Court pick. The Democratic leader and his colleagues are under a great deal of \npressure from those on the left who simply cannot--cannot--accept the results of a democratic election. They are \ncalling for Democrats to delay and punt and blockade the serious work of the Senate at any cost. They would like \nnothing more than for Democrats to continue to resist and prevent this President from moving our country forward. \nUnfortunately, many of our friends across the aisle have given in to these groups' calls for obstruction, and some \nhave even gone to unprecedented lengths to delay for delay's sake. They have forced meaningless procedural \nhurdles, they have stalled confirmation votes as long as possible, they have postponed hearings, and they have \neven boycotted committee meetings altogether. Their excuses are ever- changing, and some border on the absurd. \n``We don't like the seating arrangement,'' they say. ``We can't be late to a protest,'' they argue. There was even \nsome excuse about a YouTube video. Look, enough is enough. The American people elected a new President last \nNovember. Democrats don't have to like that decision, but they do have a responsibility to our country. The \nAmerican people want us to bring the Nation together and move forward. It is far past time to put the election \nbehind us and put this President's Cabinet into place, just as previous Senates have done for previous newly \nelected Presidents of both parties. Mr. President, now I wish to say a few words about one nominee whom we will \nbe voting on tomorrow. The nominee for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a well-qualified candidate who has \n\n\n\nearned the support of 20 Governors and several education groups from across the Nation. As Education Secretary, \nshe will be our students' foremost advocate, working to improve our education system so that every child has a \nbrighter future. Importantly, she also understands that our teachers, students, parents, school boards, and local \nand State governments are best suited to make education decisions--not Washington bureaucrats. I have every \nconfidence that Mrs. DeVos will lead the Department of Education in such a way that will put our students' interests \nfirst, while also strengthening the educational opportunities available to all of America's children. I urge colleagues \nto join in confirming Betsy Devos so that she can begin the very important work before her without further delay. \nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. The Cabinet and Congressional Review Act Mr. CORNYN. \nMr. President, I sat here and listened with interest to the majority leader's comments about this strategy of \nobstruction and slow walking the President's Cabinet. I share his frustration. More than that, on behalf of the people \nwe were sent here to represent--the American people--I regret that petty politics has gotten in the way of the ability \nof our colleagues across the aisle to get over the fact that the election didn't turn out quite the way they hoped and \nto get back to work on behalf of the American people. This week we will continue to grind our way through \nconsideration of President Trump's nominees, despite the best efforts of our friends across the aisle to obstruct and \nto slow walk. Because of their insistence on taking advantage of every possible procedural delay, they have tried to \ngrind the Senate to a near halt, but we have overcome that obstruction. We came together early Friday morning \nand voted to move forward with the President's nominee for Education Secretary-- about 6:30 in the morning. It was \na little earlier than we usually convene, but I am glad we were able to get it done. I am confident that we will get \nMrs. DeVos confirmed soon. Then, thanks to former Democratic leader Harry Reid, the Democrats know they \ncannot block these nominees from taking office. Because of the so- called nuclear option, they reduced the voting \nthreshold from 60 to 51, meaning that, with 52 Republicans and, hopefully, with a little help from some of our friends \nacross the aisle, every single one of President Trump's Cabinet nominees will be confirmed. We can take that to the \nbank. All they can do, which is all they have done up to this point, is to slow the process down for no reason other \nthan the fact that they can. Again, thanks to Senator Reid, all of the President's nominees will be confirmed. This \ntype of behavior is really pretty juvenile, if you ask me, and it can't actually accomplish anything. It is a strategy in \nsearch of a goal. They don't have any particular goal in mind, because at the end of the day, the President will get \nthe Cabinet that he has nominated and deserves. After the vote tomorrow on Mrs. DeVos for Cabinet Secretary of \nEducation, we will vote to confirm Senator Sessions, our longstanding colleague, as Attorney General. In addition to \nhim and the Education Secretary, we have the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of \nTreasury, too. These, of course, are key positions in the new administration. Now, 18 days after President Trump's \ninauguration, he still doesn't have the help he needs in these critical posts. I believe this kind of mindless \nobstruction is actually irresponsible, if not downright dangerous. I know our Democratic colleagues said they \nconfirmed General Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, and later on the Director of the CIA and, yes, they finally \nconfirmed the Secretary of State. But the Attorney General is part of the national security Cabinet. They run a lot of \nthe counterterrorism efforts for the Department of Justice. [[Page S702]] This is not only irresponsible, but this is, I \nbelieve, dangerous. It should also be an embarrassment. The American people expect their Senators and Congress \nto do our jobs and fulfill the duties to those who we represent. If our Democratic colleagues don't want to support \none of the very well-qualified nominees of the President, that is fine. That is their right, but don't slow walk and slow \ndown the institution of the Senate just to score some political points or to feed some of the irrational rage that you \nsee depicted in some quarters. Dragging this out doesn't do any good. It won't change the outcome, and it ill serves \nthe American people. Let's get these nominations done so they can be sworn in and begin their service to this new \nadministration and, more importantly, to the American people. In addition to our work on nominations, last week the \nSenate started to consider a number of measures to block a host of regulations put in place by the Obama \nadministration during the last 6 months that President Obama was in office. Under President Obama, our country \nwitnessed a volcanic profusion of rules and regulations that empowered unelected bureaucrats and shut out the \nvoices of the elected representatives of the people. The result? Job creators have less freedom to operate and \ninnovate and are instead suffocated by more and more redtape and compliance costs. That translates into a slower \ngrowing economy, which means less jobs and which means the American people are the ones who get hurt, \ndirectly as a result of this profusion of redtape and regulation. According to recent reports, the 600-plus regulations \nissued by the Obama White House came with a $700 billion pricetag for our economy. Our economy is not even \ngrowing at 2 percent. I think this overregulation is largely responsible because this profusion of regulations hit \nbusinesses both big--they can absorb some matter of the costs--but also small businesses, including local \ncommunity banks that are going out of business on a daily basis because they simply can't afford to compete and to \n\n\n\npay for the countless lawyers to comply with all of the redtape and the mindless regulation from the previous \nadministration. It is not just financial services. It is health care, it is agriculture, and it is all sectors of the economy. I \nam grateful that President Trump has made it clear where he stands on all of this, and he has already issued \nguidance requiring the government to cut regulations should it want to add more: Cut two regulations for every one \nyou want to add. With President Trump in the White House, Congress can reverse many of the Obama regulations. \nThat gives the American people and our anemic economic growth some relief. Through the Congressional Review \nAct, Congress can review and ultimately block recent regulations handed down by the Federal Government. That is \nwhat we did last week, and that is what we are going to continue to do. We can roll back many of the Obama \nadministration rules that are killing jobs and stifling economic growth. At the end of last week, we repealed the rule \ncalled the stream buffer rule, which actually didn't have anything to do with streams. It was a job-killing regulation \nthat was more about stifling domestic energy production, and I am glad we did away with it. On Friday, Congress \npassed another resolution--one I was happy to cosponsor. That was aimed at chipping away the regulatory burdens \nfor our community banks and other financial services organizations brought on by Dodd-Frank. I am all for \ntransparency, but I am against laws that give advantages to foreign companies over our own. This Securities and \nExchange Commission rule would have done that by forcing American companies to disclose confidential \ninformation that their foreign competitors can keep under wraps. It should go without saying that each of us want a \nlevel playing field for our businesses, which help to create jobs and grow the economy. That is why we blocked this \nrule. Of course, this and other resolutions are the first few steps in a broader strategy to kill overbearing regulations \nso that our innovators and our entrepreneurs aren't suffocated by unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy. That is \npart of what the American people sent us here to do. Certainly, the verdict they rendered on November 8 is that \nthey did not want a continuation of the status quo under the previous administration. They wanted change. It is \nintegral to restoring our economy--the kind of change we are bringing about to restoring our economy and helping it \ngrow for everyone. I look forward to working with the White House and with our colleagues as we continue to find \nnew ways to build up the American economy. Mr. President, if I can just close on one last topic. I see some \ncolleagues here wishing to speak. Tomorrow we will vote on the nomination of Betsy Devos to the Department of \nEducation. The Federal Government, through the Department of Education, funds about 10 percent of public \neducation, because most of that comes from our States; that is, the funding and the regulation of education from \nkindergarten through the 12th grade. What this fight over this well-qualified nominee is all about is power--as so \nmany of these fights in Washington, DC, are about--and the desire to keep power over public education in all of our \nStates and all across the country right here inside the beltway. I believe President Trump chose wisely, not because \nhe chose another education bureaucrat who knows all the acronyms and knows the arcanum known to people who \nhave been brought up within that establishment. Instead, he chose an outsider, someone much like himself but \nsomeone more interested in results, rather than paying homage to and feeding the education establishment here in \nWashington, DC, and retaining the power over the important decisions that should be handed back down to the \nStates, down to teachers, parents, and students, as they choose how best to get to accomplish our universal goal \nof making sure every child has a good education. This fight isn't about the quality of education in our country. This \nfight, for those who are opposing Mrs. DeVos, is largely about whether we should retain power here in Washington, \nDC, so that Washington can continue to dictate to the States, parents, and teachers what policies they need to \napply in our K-12 education system or whether we are going to return that power back where it should be--back into \nthe hands of parents, teachers, and local school districts. That is what this fight is all about. That is why I am glad \nthat tomorrow we will confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Listen to what the American people told us \non November 8 when they said they didn't want to maintain the status quo because the status quo is not working for \nthem, it is not working for our economy, and, certainly, it is not working for our children, each of whom deserves a \ngood education. Yes, Mrs. DeVos will shake things up a little bit but, more importantly, she is going to be part of this \neffort to return power to parents and teachers and to our local school districts. That is what this vote will be about \ntomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Repealing and Replacing \nObamacare Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss a number of ongoing efforts in the early days of the \n115th Congress. It is a strange time to be working on Capitol Hill, as strange as I have seen in my four decades in \nthe Senate. That is true for a number of reasons. Let me give you an example. Republicans currently control the \nSenate, the House, and the White House, and are in widespread agreement about most major policy issues. Sure, \nthere are details that need to be worked out, both on the process and the substance on things like tax reform, trade, \nand of course health care reform, but by and large Republicans all have the same ultimate goals for these key \nareas. Yet despite the overwhelming consensus that exists on most of these issues, there seems to be an \n\n\n\nobsession with advancing a narrative of a deeply divided Republican majority. According to this popular narrative, \nHouse and Senate Republicans have completely different views on tax reform, Republicans in Congress oppose \neverything President Trump wants to do on trade, and Senate Republicans are deeply at odds on [[Page S703]] \nhow to press forward on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. As chairman of the Senate committee that is right in \nthe middle of all these issues, I get asked to comment on these matters, literally, dozens of times every day. The \nquestions take many forms. Senator X says Congress should do ``blank'' with ObamaCare. What do you think? Can \nthe House's tax reform plan pass in the Senate? President Trump said ``blank'' today. Is that going to fly in your \ncommittee? These questions may seem straightforward. However, the underlying question behind all of these lines \nof inquiry is: Will you publically disagree with or criticize another Republican so we can write another story about \nRepublican divisions? Matters such as repealing and replacing ObamaCare or reforming the Tax Code are certainly \nimportant topics that are rightly under intense public scrutiny. However, given that these monumental efforts are still \nin the early stages, the fact that there are some relatively minor differences of opinion shouldn't be all that \nnoteworthy. The existence of these differences in the initial stages of the process doesn't significantly jeopardize \nthe success of these efforts. The purpose of the legislative process-- particularly the process we use in the Senate--\nis to allow differences to be aired and worked through so, at the end of the process, consensus can be reached. \nDiffering views on some issues at the beginning of the process are to be expected. Once again, they are hardly \nnoteworthy. Case in point, Republicans are united in our desire to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The vast \nmajority of us want reforms that are more patient-centered and market-driven. As far as I know, pretty much all of \nus want to return most of the authority for regulating the health care system back to the States. On some of the \nother questions, let me make clear what my position is just so there is no confusion on these points. I believe we \nshould repeal ObamaCare--including the taxes--and provide for a stable transition period. I believe the work to \nreplace ObamaCare should also begin immediately, meaning that our repeal bill should include as many \nObamaCare replacement policies as procedures allow. A more complete replacement can and should be crafted in \nthe coming months as we work through some of the more complicated issues. That has been my position since \nroughly March of 2010, when the final pieces of ObamaCare were signed into law. I have repeated it numerous \ntimes over the years. Moreover, I believe most Republicans in Congress share that same view. Do some \nRepublicans have different views regarding the proper order and procedure for this endeavor? I am sure they do. \nBut I don't know of a single Republican who does not want to get rid of ObamaCare. I certainly don't know any \nRepublicans who are fine with the status quo in our health care system. That being the case, no one should be \ntrying to parse anyone's words or split hairs in order to manufacture divisions in the Republican ranks on repealing \nand replacing ObamaCare. I have little doubt that we can work through whatever differences do exist, and, more \nimportantly, I think we will. I am not going to speculate today on the floor about what the final process or product will \nlook like, but I will say that at the end of the day, only 3 numbers matter: 218, 51 and 1. Those are the numbers of \nsupporters we need at each step to pass an ObamaCare repeal and replacement. At this point, given what we \ncurrently know, I strongly believe that the process I described earlier--a full repeal and a responsible transition, \ncoupled with a sizable downpayment on replacement, followed by a committed effort to implement additional \nreplacement policies in the coming months--provides the best path forward to achieving those thresholds. Like I \nsaid, most Republicans in Congress agree with me. We can discuss other ideas, and I am happy to engage in that \ndiscussion, but those numbers--218, 51, and 1--have to be the standard by which we judge any alternatives. And \nwhile I would love to see the final product pass with even larger numbers, and even with some Democrats onboard \nwith us, those numbers give us a clear picture as to how much consensus is necessary. Once again, I think we can \nget there, and I am continually working with colleagues in both the House and Senate to make sure we do. With \nthat, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. \nPresident, I come to the floor this afternoon to oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos, President Trump's choice to \nbe Secretary of Education. I fundamentally disagree with my colleague from Texas who said earlier that this is a \nfight about power and who maintains power, whether it is going to stay in Washington or whether it is going to be in \nour State and local communities. In New Hampshire, we believe in local control of education. It is a bedrock \nprinciple of our public education system. This fight, today, is not about power in Washington versus power in the \nStates; this is a fight about whether we are going to continue to support our public school system and our system of \npublic higher education, or are we going to take the money out, the support out, and divert it into private and \nreligious schools, and gut the public education system in this country? My parents were part of the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' and they raised me in post-World War II America. They understood that the best way for my sisters \nand me to have opportunities for the future was to make sure we had a solid education. I benefited by going to great \n\n\n\npublic schools in the State of Missouri and in the State of Pennsylvania, and I was also able to receive a quality \npublic higher education. Without the opportunity to attend public universities in Pennsylvania and later in West \nVirginia and in the State of Mississippi, I would not have been able to get a college education because my parents \nwouldn't have been able to afford to send me to a private college or university, just like they wouldn't have been \nable to afford to send me to private K-12 schools. I am grateful for the public schools I attended and proud of the \nsupport my parents and so many other parents have given to public schools across America. My children and \ngrandchildren have benefited from the great public schools in New Hampshire. As Governor, I was proud to work \nwith the Republican legislature to improve the public schools in the State of New Hampshire. We expanded public \nkindergarten in our State because at the time I became Governor, we didn't have public kindergarten for all \nstudents. We were able to open the door for an additional 25,000 kids to go to public kindergarten. We were able \nto increase funding for schools in New Hampshire during my time as Governor. I learned during those experiences \nand also as a teacher--I taught in public schools in Dover, New Hampshire and also in Mississippi--the close \nconnection between quality public education and a strong, growing economy. I taught in Mississippi in 1970. At that \ntime, there was no requirement for all young people to attend school. So if you didn't want to go to school, you didn't \nhave to. We saw the negative impact that had on economic indicators in the State of Mississippi. Since then, the \nState has adopted compulsory education for students in Mississippi. But it was a great lesson to me to see how \nimportant good schools are and how they contribute to a strong economy in this country. As Governor, when I \ntalked to businesses in the State of New Hampshire, one of the things they told me that they needed in order for \ntheir businesses to succeed was a skilled workforce, young people who had a good education, who could learn \nadvanced skills on the job. They looked to locate in communities where there was a strong system of public \neducation. I value public schools as one of our Nation's bedrock civic and democratic institutions because they \nprovide the best opportunity for kids from all walks of life to get a quality education. They pass on to each new \ngeneration, including the children of immigrants, America's shared ideals and values. Regrettably, after careful \nstudy of Mrs. DeVos's record as an activist, I have concluded that she doesn't agree with this view of our public \nschools. She has no relevant experience as a teacher or as a leader in public schools. She has never attended a \npublic school, and she has not sent any of her children to a public school. To the contrary, she has spent her entire \ncareer [[Page S704]] and countless millions of dollars of her personal fortune working not to improve public schools \nbut to privatize them, to weaken them by diverting public funds to private and religious schools. Given her past \nrecord, it makes no sense to put Mrs. DeVos in charge of the Department of Education unless the aim is to devalue, \ndefund, and perhaps eventually destroy our public schools. I think that is unacceptable. In my State of New \nHampshire, support for our public schools is bipartisan and it is passionate. In rural communities and small towns \nand our cities across the State, public schools are institutions that have strong support within our communities. \nThey are a big part of our communities' identities and shared experiences. Across centuries and generations in the \nGranite State, public schools have been at the heart of our common civic life. I think it is not surprising that my \noffice has been inundated with letters, emails, and phone calls strongly opposing the DeVos nomination. My office \nhas received more than 4,000 letters and emails from Granite Staters. That may not seem like a lot to somebody \nfrom the State of California, but from the State of New Hampshire, to have 4,000 letters and emails on a nomination \nis unheard of. And almost all of them oppose this nomination. In addition, we have received 1,405 telephone calls in \nopposition and only 3 in support. I am impressed not only by the volume of constituent messages but by the \nintensity of their opposition. Megan is a social studies teacher in New Hampshire. She writes: Mrs. DeVos clearly \nlacks even a basic understanding of Federal education policy, laws and instructional practices. She has no relevant \nexperience. There is just no way I would ever be certified to instruct students in New Hampshire if I lacked as \nmuch knowledge and experience in my field. But she gets to be the nation's chief educator? How is this good for \nkids? Roger is a retired public school teacher from the central part of my State, and he writes: Please reject DeVos \nbecause she is anti-public education in word and in practice, lacking the understanding of the public education \nsystem and having no understanding of the dreamers sitting in public schools this morning, creating their own \nAmerican dreams, learning of the promise and justice that is America. Sam from our Seacoast region writes: It is \nimportant that we maintain a strong public school system. This is not a partisan issue. Any person, regardless of \nparty, can see that Miss DeVos is unqualified to fill the position. You need to vote ``no'' to save our education \nsystem. Mike from one of our university towns writes: I am really concerned that we might have someone with so \nlittle experience in education and with seemingly anti-public education views as our next education leader. I fear \nthat a DeVos confirmation will only exacerbate the already segregated school experiences that children have in our \ncountry. I want all students to have a fair shake at a high- quality school experience, not just those who live in \n\n\n\nwealthy communities or who have parents savvy enough to advocate on their behalf. Many of the letters I have \nreceived are from parents who are outraged by Mrs. DeVos's comments on the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, which is one of the landmark civil rights laws of the 20th century. In response to a question from my \ncolleague, Senator Hassan, Mrs. DeVos made it clear that she was unaware that that law was a Federal law and \nthat it governs all our public schools in the United States. IDEA ensures that children with disabilities have the \nopportunity to receive a free appropriate public education and that they are accommodated in our schools and \nclassrooms, just like all other children. In her testimony, Mrs. DeVos said that decisions about how to treat \nstudents with disabilities should be left to the States. Can you imagine? What would happen in States that decide \nthey don't want to make sure that those students can go to school? I received this message from Marilyn, who \nlives in the western part of New Hampshire. She says: Thank you for opposing the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as \nEducation Secretary. She is a dangerous, unqualified choice. As the parent of a daughter with Down syndrome, I \nfear for the future of IDEA if DeVos is in charge. Ashley Preston, who was the Teacher of the Year in New \nHampshire in 2016, wrote this to me: If our Secretary of Education does not understand and value the importance \nof Federal laws such as IDEA, how can we expect states and local school districts to do that? These are the \nelements crucial to ensuring the best chance for our future. Mr. President, the Department of Education has \noversight not only of K-12 public schools but also higher education, including a portfolio of more than $1.2 trillion in \nFederal student loans. I have had the opportunity not only to teach in our K-12 schools but to work in public \nuniversities in New Hampshire and in private universities. Listening to Mrs. DeVos's testimony, I was appalled by \nher lack of understanding of higher education policy. She acknowledged that neither she nor her children had ever \nreceived a Federal loan or Pell grant. And this is the worst part: When asked to commit to enforcing rules that \nensure students are not cheated and end up with no degree but a mountain of student debt--in other words, the \npredicament of students who went to Trump University and so many other for-profit colleges--she refused to do \nthat. She refused to say that this is something that we should support as a policy in America. I am also deeply \nconcerned by her support for charter schools that are not accountable and her reputation as ``the four-star general \nof the voucher movement.'' I believe there is a role for charter schools. I think as we try to improve our public \nsystem of higher education, we need to look at a number of models. I voted for New Hampshire's charter school \nlaw, but we should hold them accountable just as we hold our public schools accountable. We should ensure that \nthey do not drain resources from public schools. There was a report that came out in 2013 that was done by a \nworking group under the auspices of the Annenberg Institute for Social Reform. They uncovered similar challenges \nacross charter schools. They found that there was uneven academic performance; that some of them had overly \nharsh discipline practices; that funding sometimes destabilized traditional schools; that there was a lack of \ntransparency and oversight that led to conflicts of interest and, in some cases, fraud; and that many of them \npracticed policies that kept students out for various reasons. Mrs. DeVos was one of the architects of Michigan's \nfirst charter school law in 1993. It has been widely criticized for lacking accountability and safeguards for students. \nIn her confirmation hearing, Mrs. DeVos refused to agree that for-profit charter schools should be held to the same \nstandards as public schools. Just as disturbing is her support for school vouchers, which would siphon funding from \npublic schools and divert it to private and religious schools. Advocates of vouchers like to call it school choice, but, \nin practice, parents have learned that choice is not a reality. Florida, under Governor Jeb Bush, was the first State \nto enact a statewide voucher system, and nearly 93 percent of private and parochial schools in Florida--after that \nlaw--refused to accept any voucher students. In New Hampshire, we have parts of the State where, if we don't \nhave public schools, there are no other choices for our students. I don't care whether you have a voucher or not. \nYou can't drive 3 or 4 hours to get to the closest private school. So let's be clear: Vouchers and other privatization \nschemes advocated by Mrs. DeVos are not about pedagogy; they are about ideology. They are all about disdain for \nwhat many voucher advocates like to call government schools. Well, what they call government schools are our \npublic schools. They are schools that our communities have created and control locally for the education of their \nkids. What Mrs. DeVos fails to understand is that quality education has nothing do with whether a school is public or \nprivate. We have public schools in New Hampshire that can do better, and we have public schools that are world \nclass. The same can be said about our private schools in New Hampshire. But what counts in public and private \nschools alike are high-quality teachers, support from parents and communities, facilities where kids can learn and \nbe safe, rigorous academic standards, and the resources to make sure that children get the instruction they need, \nincluding individualized assistance for [[Page S705]] kids with special needs. What counts is the political and \nbudgetary commitment to create high-quality schools in every neighborhood, regardless of ZIP Code. Because \nBetsy DeVos does not understand these basic truths about education in America, because she is driven by an \n\n\n\nideological hostility to our public schools, she is the wrong person to serve as our Secretary of Education. I intend to \nvote no on the nomination of Mrs. DeVos, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting \nthis unqualified nominee. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. \nMr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. My \nreason is very simple: Mrs. DeVos lacks the experience required to oversee the Department of Education, an \nagency that serves over 50 million public school children across America. Despite spending many years giving \nhundreds of millions of dollars to back political candidates and ballot initiatives that support unproven education \npolicies, she remains shockingly unfamiliar with Federal law and even some very basic education concepts. \nEducating our children is an incredibly important job, and we need someone who is experienced, prepared, and well \nqualified to lead the Department of Education. As I have said before, Mrs. DeVos has no experience in public \neducation at any level, not as a teacher, not as an administrator, not as a student, not as a parent, not as a school \nboard member, and not even as a borrower of public loans for college. Ask any parent; our children are what we \nhold most dear. It only makes sense that the individual whom we entrust with our children's education should have \nat least some--some--experience in public education. Mrs. DeVos has absolutely no experience--I repeat, no \ntangible experience--with neighborhood public schools. In fact, her only experience in education is her work \nlobbying for the transfer of taxpayer money to private schools. She has also pushed for the rapid expansion of \ncharter schools without sufficient accountability to parents and to students, which brings me to her track record in \nmy home State of Michigan. Mrs. DeVos has pushed for school vouchers to send our public tax dollars to private \nschools. Her staunch advocacy for the use of taxpayer funding for private and charter school systems earned her \nthe nickname as the ``four-star general of the pro-voucher movement.'' The vast majority of children in Michigan \nand in the United States attend neighborhood public schools. Voucher programs rob these children of the resources \nthey need to receive high-quality education near where they live. Michigan voters soundly rejected her plan, and we \ncannot--I repeat, we cannot--put her in a position to push for voucher programs on a national scale that will weaken \nour neighborhood schools and will weaken, in particular, our rural schools. Let me be clear: I support innovative \nmodels for improving our education system but only when those models are proven to work. For example, I worked \nhard to ensure that all children have access to the skills and education that are vital to joining the modern workforce \nand competing in today's global economy. I introduced legislation that will reduce the price tag for higher learning \nby allowing students to complete college-level courses while they are still in public high school. The Making \nEducation Affordable and Accessible Act will help students save time and money as they kick-start their careers \nthrough a very personalized curriculum. Whether an early-middle college program or a dual and concurrent \nenrollment program, these models help traditional public school students save money and get ahead by earning \ncollege credits while they finish their high school education. These programs are typically run by a local school \ndistrict or an intermediate school district and are offered at little or no cost to the student. They also help students \nidentify their major or interest area sooner so that they can complete their college degree and graduate as much as \n1 year earlier. Across the State of Michigan, students are participating in more than 90 early and middle college \nprograms, programs that are proven to significantly increase high school graduation rates. Jobs for the Future \nfound that, nationally, 90 percent of early college students graduate high school versus 78 percent nationally. \nThis is just one example of the kind of innovative approach with proven results that policymakers should support to \nimprove education outcomes. Education reform must be driven by data and validated outcomes and not by political \nideology. Our primary focus must always be on increasing opportunities for the millions of students in our \nneighborhood public schools. Given Mrs. DeVos's history of supporting policies that undermine traditional public \nschools and the communities they serve, I do not think she would act in the best interests of American students. \nMichigan has been devoted to great public education for generations, a commitment that stretches back to even \nbefore the founding of our State. Some of our State's earliest pioneers, including my ancestors, settled under the \nguidance of the Northwest Ordinance, which stated that ``schools and the means of education shall forever be \nencouraged.'' Our Nation has strived to live up to this creed ever since, honoring the fundamental truth that all of \nour children have the right to an education no matter who they are, where they live, how much money their parents \nhave, or how they learn. All levels of government--State, local and Federal--share the responsibility of ensuring that \nour children have access to quality education. In addition to providing significant Federal dollars to local school \ndistricts, the Federal Government plays a critical role in preventing discrimination and creating opportunity. Federal \neducation laws play a vital roll in ensuring that all students have equal access to learning opportunities, laws like \nthe landmark 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. Before the enactment of IDEA, too many of \nour children with disabilities were denied the chance to learn from our broader communities. Likewise, our broader \n\n\n\ncommunities were denied the chance to learn from these youth and the extraordinary perspectives and \ncontributions they offer to American society. Now, thanks to IDEA, 6.5 million of our children, or 13 percent of all \npublic school students, are not condemned to a life of isolation or mere accommodation. Instead, Federal law \nensures that every child has access to the resources he or she needs to become productive and included members \nof our increasingly diverse 21st-century society. IDEA assists public schools with offering high-quality special \neducation and early intervention services for children with disabilities from birth to age 21. As a result, IDEA is \nresponsible for millions of youth with disabilities graduating from high school, enrolling in college, and finding jobs \nas valuable participants in the American economy. But IDEA will not enforce itself; it is the responsibility of the \nDepartment of Education and its leadership to monitor, evaluate, and provide technical assistance to States, \nmaking sure that our schools are offering learning opportunities that meet every student's needs. It is the \nresponsibility of the Senate to determine whether Mrs. DeVos can carry out this task and live up to the creed of \n``forever encouraging'' education. Unfortunately, Mrs. DeVos has demonstrated little comprehension of the Federal \nrole in protecting students with disabilities' equal right to an education. This became evident when she was asked \ndirectly about IDEA during her confirmation hearing, and Mrs. DeVos tried to excuse her erroneous answer by \nsaying, ``I may have confused it.'' Every student knows the importance of doing their homework, studying for their \nexams, and practicing for any class presentations in advance. Every educator knows that the answer ``I may have \nconfused it'' is not a response that leads to a passing grade. With the stakes as high as they are, it is clear that Mrs. \nDeVos did not do her homework. She did not study for her potential role. She did not practice for her interview with \nthe Senate committee and, most importantly, the [[Page S706]] American people. She has contributed millions of \ndollars to Republican politicians over the years and probably thought that was the only qualification that she \nneeded. We need to prove to the American people that she is wrong. I take my responsibility under the U.S. \nConstitution to provide advise and consent to the President very seriously, and I know my colleagues here in the \nSenate do so as well. Given Mrs. DeVos's weak performance in her interview before the American people and her \ninability to demonstrate a basic understanding of key education concepts, I do not think we can give her a passing \ngrade. As Senators, we do not operate under a model of social promotion under which we pass an unqualified \nindividual to a higher office simply because they showed up. Perhaps this is why Mrs. DeVos's nomination is \nexpected to see the most bipartisan opposition to her confirmation of all of the President's nominations to date. Mrs. \nDeVos's response regarding IDEA during her confirmation hearing was not the only response that I found alarming. \nAs the father of two college-age daughters, I am extremely concerned about ensuring that our college campuses \nprovide safe environments where students can learn and grow. I was shocked by a recent comprehensive report \ndone by one school that found that over 20 percent of female undergraduates experienced unwanted sexual \ncontact. Sadly, this problem is not confined to one school. It is a public safety and health crisis that we must \nimmediately take action to address. The Department of Education has taken important first steps to combat the \nprevalence of campus sexual assault by opening investigations in over 200 schools and publishing guidance to \nensure that universities are affording students title IX protections, the freedom from discrimination on the basis of \nsex and freedom from sexual violence. Mrs. DeVos apparently has a different reaction to the threats many young \nstudents face while pursuing their higher education. As we saw during her confirmation hearing, she said it is \n``premature'' for her to say if she will choose to uphold the Department of Education's guidance on preventing \nsexual violence. This is completely unacceptable to me as a Senator representing over 500,000 undergraduate \nstudents attending one of Michigan's outstanding colleges and universities, and this is completely unacceptable to \nme as a father. It is also unacceptable in the eyes of over 1,000 graduates of the same school in Michigan that Mrs. \nDeVos attended herself: Calvin College. Calvin College alumni from the class of 1947 to the class of 2020 sent my \noffice an extensive petition expressing their deep concern with Mrs. DeVos's nomination. In their letter, these \nalumni presented several reasons they oppose Mrs. DeVos's confirmation. Specifically, they expressed concerns \nthat she does not understand or support the many Federal policies--like IDEA and title IX--that she would be \nrequired to enforce. They wrote: ``This is especially concerning given that the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct and title IX, which ensure that all students' educational experiences are free of discrimination that impede \nlearning, are not of value to Mrs. DeVos.'' I cannot agree more with her fellow alumni. My office has received over \n8,000 calls in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos, and I am sure my colleagues have also heard from \nthousands of their own constituents all across this country. The American people are making their voices heard, \nand they are telling the Senate that Mrs. DeVos is not the right choice to lead the Department of Education. I urge \nmy colleagues to listen to their constituents who are forcefully--forcefully--rejecting Mrs. DeVos's misguided vision \nfor neighborhood public schools in America. I will be standing with the people of Michigan, and I once again call on \n\n\n\nmy colleagues to join the bipartisan opposition to Mrs. DeVos's nomination. Our children's future depends on it, and \nfor their sake, please vote no. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The \nSenator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe Betsy DeVos is going to be an excellent Secretary of \nEducation. Nomination of Jeff Sessions Mr. President, I have been fortunate enough to get to know Jeff Sessions \nover the past 20 years. Not only is he a colleague whom I admire and respect, he is also one of my very best \nfriends. I actually suffered through with him back when he had a nomination that was rejected by this body many \nyears ago. As you know, Senator Sessions has been nominated by the President to be the next Attorney General of \nthe United States. It is an incredible honor. There is no doubt in my mind that my friend will be perfect for the job. \nHe is more than qualified for this position, and I know he will keep his word when he says he plans to uphold the \nlaws we pass in Congress. Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate in 1997. That was 2 years after I was \nelected, and we have been very close friends ever since. For 20 years now, we have known each other and worked \nalongside each other on both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Those are the two major committees we have been on. He is seated just to my right in each one of the \ncommittees, and, as the Chair knows, you get to know a person pretty well when you have been sitting there for \nthese 3- or 4-hour-long meetings. So we have had that relationship with each other. Not only have we worked \ntogether, but we have also traveled and prayed together. You really get to know someone when you work, travel, \nand pray together. When working, a person's mind is revealed; when traveling, a person's character is revealed; \nand when you pray, the person's heart is revealed. I have come to know Senator Sessions as a God-fearing family \nman who puts others before himself and has a deep respect for the rule of law. Family man--every time he has a \ngrandchild, his wife and my wife talk about our competing grandchildren. He helps those in need and makes sure \nthat the legal system is protecting our citizens and holding criminals accountable. A person only needs to look at the \nlegislation and causes he has championed to know him. He played a key role in fighting for fairness and funding for \nthe rural HIV/AIDS patients when negotiating a reauthorization of the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act. His \nadvocacy brought funding to low-income, mostly African-American women who did not have easily accessible \nhealth care before. Senator Sessions has been an author and supporter of many pieces of bipartisan legislation, \nincluding protecting victims of child abuse, reducing prison sentences for those who are unfairly targeted, and \nhelping the families of our fallen military personnel. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Sessions has become a fierce advocate for keeping our country safe from terrorism, and he understands \nthe risks we face. In fact, Senator Sessions is tough on crime and is well suited to oversee Federal law enforcement \nactivities and to assist local governments in their efforts. Violent crime has recently been increasing. Furthermore--\nand I just found this out--the shooting deaths of police officers has increased by 68 percent just in the last year, \nbetween 2015 and 2016. That is pretty remarkable. These trends are unacceptable, and Senator Sessions has \npledged to reverse the course by strengthening the partnership between Federal and local law enforcement and by \ngoing after drug traffickers, aliens who violate the laws, and criminals who use guns to commit crimes. There is no \nquestion that Senator Sessions is qualified to do what he says he will and what the job asks of him. He served as a \nU.S. attorney for Alabama's Southern District, and he was also Alabama's attorney general, so he clearly knows the \njob. He doesn't have to be trained. It is because of his previous experiences that he will be able to transition from a \npartisan legislator to our Nation's top law enforcement officer with great ease. Countless groups of people have \ncome out to support the nominee: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, former U.S. \nattorneys, a former FBI Director, current [[Page S707]] State attorneys general, and many more. All of the law \nenforcement professionals are behind him, and there is a reason for it: It is because that is his record, and people \nare aware of it. So I would like to take a minute to point out that it is cruel and unfair that people have tried to paint \na picture of Senator Sessions as someone and something he is not. I think this is something that needs to be said. \nThe man the opposition has painted does not exist. You all know Jeff Sessions. You know that the awful things \nbeing said about him are completely false. In fact, back in 1981, the Ku Klux Klan ordered the tragic, extremely \nundeserved murder of a young African-American man by the name of Michael Donald. Because of Senator \nSessions's help and support, these Klan members were convicted and given either life sentences or the death \npenalty. That is Jeff Sessions. Furthermore, he later played a major role in the destruction of the Ku Klux Klan in \nAlabama when he helped bring a civil suit against them. As a result, the KKK went bankrupt, and he caused them to \nfall apart in that region. Again, those were Jeff Sessions' efforts. Before we vote on the confirmation of our friend \nand colleague, I ask that you all take a moment to seriously reflect how Senator Sessions has worked diligently with \nyou over the past two decades and how perfectly qualified he is for this position. As for me, I thank him for his \ntireless efforts in Congress, for his friendship, and for his fellowship. He will go down as one of the truly great U.S. \n\n\n\nAttorneys General in this country's history. Mr. President, there are a lot of other nominees whom I have gotten to \nknow. I had an experience of actually going to Trump Tower and getting to know some of the people who advise \nhim. As I looked around the table, I saw people who were the right kind of people in health care, the right kind of \npeople in energy, and the right kind of people in the military to give him advice in areas he might not have been \nexposed to in the past. And I just noticed that it has been very slow. I was not aware of this until a few minutes ago, \nthat apparently the Cabinet confirmations are the slowest since George Washington. This is something that is really \nwrong. You can criticize someone, but after a while, you just go ahead and you know the votes are there, and you \nmake sure that you go ahead and do it. Nomination of Neil Gorsuch Mr. President, I would say this to the Presiding \nOfficer, since he and I are both from Oklahoma, which is in the Tenth Circuit: Last week President Trump \nannounced that he was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to be a U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice. As someone who had been following the news and rumors of who the pick would be--I had been \nlooking into potential nominees for weeks--I was pleased to see Judge Gorsuch's name come up because we know \nsomething about him. After the untimely death of Justice Scalia a year ago, it was clear that the Presidential \nelection would be about the direction of the Supreme Court for the next generation or maybe even generations. \nWith the results of the election--the Republican President and Republican Congress--the American people have \nentrusted us to confirm a Supreme Court Justice who will adhere to the rule of law and will not try to read between \nthe lines when interpreting legislation or the Constitution. With the selection of Judge Gorsuch, I believe President \nTrump has picked such a Justice. The President might not know or remember, but George W. Bush nominated \nJudge Gorsuch to his current position, and the Senate confirmed him unanimously by voice vote. We went back \nand looked at the record, and no one voted against him. There is no question that Judge Gorsuch is qualified for the \nSupreme Court. He is a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford. He clerked for Judge \nSentelle of the U.S. court of appeals for the DC Circuit. He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and \nAnthony Kennedy, so he knows the job. There is no need for on-the-job training for him. He has been in private \npractice. He has been a principal deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Attorney General at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. Much like the Justice he has been nominated to replace, Judge Gorsuch has become known \nfor his writing style. One of his former law clerks said that his ``favorite aspect of the judge's writing is his ability to \nhumanize disputes.'' It appears that Gorsuch has more in common with the late Justice Scalia than just writing \nabilities. He has said that ``assiduous focus on text, structure, and history is essential to the proper exercise of the \njudicial function.'' That judicial philosophy has been borne out in his record on the Tenth Circuit. My home State of \nOklahoma is within the Tenth Circuit jurisdiction, so we know him very well. Oklahoma is the home of Hobby Lobby. \nEveryone is familiar with what Hobby Lobby is. A lot of people don't realize this, but it started out when I was in the \nState legislature. The Greens, who have Hobby Lobby, started out in their garage. At that time, they were putting \ntogether things that they could frame-- miniature picture frames and that type of thing. With a loan of $600, David \nand Barbara Green began making miniature picture frames. Today, Hobby Lobby is the largest privately owned arts \nand crafts store in the world, with over 700 stores in all but three States. They are people of faith, and when they \nwere facing fines under ObamaCare for not providing certain insurance coverage that violated their faith, they were \nfaced with an impossible choice. They took it to court, risking millions of personal dollars in doing so. In siding with \nHobby Lobby against ObamaCare's contraceptive mandate, Judge Gorsuch stressed the point that it is not for a \ncourt to decide whether the owners' religious convictions are correct or consistent, but instead the court's role is \n``only to protect the exercise of faith,'' and the Supreme Court agreed. Again, Judge Gorsuch defended the religious \nbeliefs of the Little Sisters of the Poor in his dissent of the Tenth Circuit's refusal to rehear their case against the \nObama administration regarding the same mandate that Hobby Lobby was contesting. Time and again, Judge \nGorsuch has defended religious expressions in public space. In addition to defending the First Amendment \nprotections regarding the free exercise of religion, he is also skeptical of the idea that agencies should be given a \nwide latitude when interpreting statutory language. In a recent opinion, Judge Gorsuch suggested that the \nprecedent of the judiciary to give deference to agencies on statutory interpretations limits the courts when reviewing \nthe legality of agency actions. Gorsuch believes it is for Congress to write the laws, the executive to carry them out, \nand the judiciary to interpret them, just as our Founding Fathers intended. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to move Judge Gorsuch's nomination forward. He is going to be confirmed, and he will make a great \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The \nSenator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my colleague from Oklahoma leaves the floor, \nwhile we disagree on this current debate in terms of voting, I just have to say when I see him that I constantly thank \nhim for his efforts last year to work with us for the community of Flint. We are finding some hope in terms of \n\n\n\nreplacing and addressing the lead contamination, and without the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, that \nliterally would not have happened. We have things we disagree on and agree on, and this one--coming together \nwith the families of Flint, particularly with the children and the water impacts--he will always have a warm place in \nthe hearts of all of us who care deeply about that issue. I thank my colleague very much. Mr. President, I want to \nspeak today about the nomination of Betsy DeVos. Betsy DeVos's nomination is very personal to many people who \nlive in Michigan because Betsy DeVos is from Michigan, and her vision of education and her actions have \nunfortunately played a major role in undermining our public schools. Families all across our State can tell the story \nof her work with Michigan [[Page S708]] schools firsthand because they have seen it firsthand. They have lived it \nfirsthand. They all say the same thing. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people who live in cities that are big \nand small, parents and teachers, principals, and community leaders from across the State-- overwhelmingly, they \nhave told me that Betsy DeVos should not be our next Secretary of Education. Everywhere I go, I can't believe how \npeople will stop me about this and how strongly people feel in Michigan about this. They are saying this because, \namong other things, she has pushed for policies that have made charter schools in Michigan less accountable and \nhas taken dollars away from public schools where the vast majority of children get their education. These are \npolicies that have hurt our children and put their futures at risk. I have received so many emails and phone calls \nfrom people involved every which way; at the grocery store, out at public events, people come up to me. I just want \nto share a couple of e-mails. Chris is a teacher from Harper Woods and worked as a teacher in the Detroit public \nschools for over 20 years. He wrote: Betsy DeVos believes in school privatization and vouchers. She has worked to \nundermine efforts to regulate Michigan charters, even when they clearly fail. The marketplace solutions of DeVos \nwill destroy our democratically governed community schools. Her hostility toward public education disqualifies her. \nThose were Chris's comments. In Michigan last year, State legislators put together a bipartisan plan, and our State \nlegislature--House and Senate--majority is Republican. They put together a bipartisan plan to increase both funding \nand accountability for Detroit public schools. There are a lot of wonderful things happening in Detroit. Businesses \nare coming back to Detroit, and economic development is also, but we have major work to do for our children and \ntheir schools. So there was a huge bipartisan effort that came together to increase funding and accountability for \nthe public schools, including charter schools. It was a commonsense proposal. Betsy DeVos led the effort to stop it, \nparticularly the part that brought critically needed public accountability for for-profit and nonprofit charter schools. \nUnfortunately, right now in Michigan we have a system where anyone can apply to open a charter school. There are \nno statewide standards for revoking the charter, and taxpayer money is sent to them with virtually no public \ndisclosure requirement. For example, we have for- profit charter management companies that say they are private \nbusinesses; therefore, even though they are getting public money, they say they are private businesses, and they \nshould not have to comply with a series of disclosure requirements regarding teachers and other information that, \nfrankly, parents would want to know and taxpayers have a right to know. Thirty-eight percent of charters in \nMichigan are at the bottom 25 percent of the schools in our State. When you look at the bottom one- fourth, 38 \npercent of the charters are in that category, and there is unfortunately very little accountability for their \nperformance. Sadly, precious taxpayer dollars have been taken away from public schools--neighborhood schools--\nto fund these charters. When it comes to funding for public schools, she will not commit to protecting the critical \nFederal dollars that serve our children. One mom, Hillary Young from Detroit, came to Washington to watch the \nconfirmation hearing on Betsy DeVos in the HELP Committee. She wrote to me. She said that she was not \nimpressed and told a group of parents afterwards: As a parent I can't stand silently and watch other children be \nsubject to similar circumstances to my child in Detroit. My sixth grader was without a math teacher for over half the \nyear last year because of funding reductions. The effect of DeVos's policies is not parents voting with their feet to \ngo to better schools; it is children bearing the burden for fixing the education system they are supposed to be \nserved by. She goes on to say: DeVos's free market school choice system has left our city's education landscape in \nchaos, leaving less choice, less quality, and even more government bureaucracy. We have seen parents get \ninvolved and speak out all across Michigan and, frankly, all across the country. I have received more mail, more \nemails, more phone calls on this nominee than any other, and I have received a lot on a lot of nominees, but there \nis a broad outcry. People like Kathleen, who is a farmer and a grandmother from Farmington Hills, wrote to me: We \nhave 15 grandchildren who are in the public school system, and we are terrified that there will be no more public \nschools and that the quality will be far inferior to charter and other private schools. I am writing you to respectfully \nask that you do not vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. I am deeply concerned about what we \nheard in committee about her views on special education. In the HELP Committee hearing last week, she \nsuggested that States should decide on whether or not to enforce IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Act that has \n\n\n\nbeen such a landmark, opening doors of schools in every neighborhood across our country, for children with \ndisabilities. This law was enacted in 1975, and makes sure that children with disabilities have the same educational \nopportunities as other children. My nephew Barry, who has now gone through the special education system in \nMichigan, is a wonderful young man with Down syndrome. And I have seen personally how important that was for \nhim, to be able to go on and be successful in the community as a part of the community. It is a very important civil \nright, frankly, for children with disabilities, as well as an essential part of our educational system. Betsy DeVos, after \nher hearing, when she was asked about special education, followed up with a letter days later and wrote about \nexpanding the conversation about school choice opportunities for parents of children with disabilities, but she didn't \nsay anything about helping those in traditional public schools or helping students in the schools they are in now. \nFor me, this is not about politics or partisan messaging or even charters or private schools versus traditional public \nschools; it really is about what is best for our children and for our country. Families in Michigan and all across the \ncountry know this. Tens of thousands of people have called me over the last few weeks and sent emails and letters. \nWho we choose to be the Secretary of Education doesn't just affect the over 50 million children who attend public \nelementary and secondary schools, it affects the future of our country, and it is a fundamental difference in views. A \ncompetitive free market system, with winners and losers, works in the private marketplace. I support that. Business \nis open. They compete, and if they don't do well, they close, or they do very well and they go on and they grow. \nThat is a strength in our country. But it doesn't work for educating our children because we can't afford losers. We \ncan't afford losers when it comes to something as basic as fundamental education and creating opportunity for our \nchildren in the future. We need to provide every opportunity for every child to work hard and succeed. I support \nhaving choices. I support magnet schools and public charters--I did that as a State Senator--as well as other \nchoices that are great opportunities for children, if there are equal standards and public accountability for taxpayers' \ndollars so that parents can have confidence in that accountability, and if it is part of the public school system, the \npublic process, and only if they are in addition to quality neighborhood schools in every neighborhood and in every \nZIP Code. It is not just a slogan to say it shouldn't matter where you live, what kind of opportunity you get or that \nyour child has, and that is becoming more and more true. It certainly is in Michigan, where this philosophy has been \na test case, and we are seeing it across the country. We can't afford losers. A winners-and-losers system is not \ngood enough for our kids. Betsy DeVos has a record of working against the vision of accountability and standards \nand choice within a system where every child has a quality neighborhood school in their neighborhood in every ZIP \nCode. She has worked against that vision. She doesn't believe in it. We have fundamental differences in what will \nhelp our children [[Page S709]] for the future. That is why I will be voting no on her confirmation. Thank you. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my \nfriend the Senator from Michigan for her comments and her views on this nominee. I rise today to add my voice to \nthose expressing concern about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as U.S. Secretary of Education. The \nchorus of concerns not only comes from those colleagues who have already come to the floor last week or earlier \ntoday or throughout the evening and into tomorrow morning, but it also comes from literally tens of thousands of my \nconstituents who have contacted me about Mrs. DeVos. I have been flooded with phone calls, emails, and social \nmedia messages from Virginians all across the Commonwealth, in many ways, in numbers that I haven't seen since \nthe debate about the ACA. These Virginians worry about Mrs. DeVos's confirmation. They worry about what it \nwould mean for our children, our students, and for progress toward improving and providing every child with a \nquality public education regardless of their ZIP Code. Like many of my colleagues, I bring to the debate some direct \nexperience as both a State and local elected official. I had the great honor of serving as Governor of Virginia. I was \nresponsible in that job for how we were preparing our students for success in college and in the workforce. I took \nthat responsibility very personally. As somebody who attended good public schools all of my life, as somebody who \nwas lucky enough to be the first in my family to graduate from college, I realized that I wouldn't have been able to \nhave been Governor or, for that matter, obviously, Senator without that foundation I received from my education. \nThose public schools--and I had the opportunity to go to public schools in three different States growing up, and \nmany of those public school teachers were the folks who framed my views about government, about our system, \nabout how we actually get through in life. I believe in many ways public schools and the whole notion of public \neducation really form the cornerstone of what is the social contract in America--that getting that basic public \neducation is the right of all individuals. When I think back on everything I was able to accomplish as Virginia's \nGovernor, the validation I valued the most was that when I left the Governor's office in 2006, Virginia was \nconsistently recognized by independent validators as the Nation's best State for a lifetime of educational opportunity \nfrom pre-K to college and beyond. So as someone who is committed to reforming and looking at how we can make \n\n\n\nsure our public education can work for all, as someone who spent a career before in business and tried working in \na philanthropic sense on how we could expand educational opportunities, I believe I bring some experience to this \ndebate. That is why I stand here today unable to support the nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as Secretary of \nEducation. To put it simply, Mrs. DeVos's single-minded focus on charter schools, on vouchers, and on converting \nFederal education dollars into a different program is simply out of step with the education climate in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. Let me make clear that I have supported public charter schools. I believe they are a tool \nthat ought to be in the toolkit. I have taken on those forces who stand for simply no reform in education. But I am \nunconvinced that Mrs. DeVos's complete setting of different priorities at the Federal level is in the best interest of \nour students, our teachers, or our public schools. That is exactly what I have been hearing from constituents all \nover the State, and I would like to very briefly share some of those concerns I have heard. Laura from my \nhometown of Alexandria writes this: While many of our . . . President's cabinet picks worry me, none worry me more \nthan Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. She says: I come from rural Appalachia, where [I] worked my way \nthrough public school in one of the poorest counties in the country, but that didn't stop me from ending up here in \nNorthern Virginia working for the intelligence community. In areas like my hometown, where public schools are the \nonly option, they become the lifeblood of a community. . . . On limited resources, our high school had to get creative \nabout how to provide for the students, often partnering with the local university. But shutting the school down in \nfavor of charters, or adding a for-profit alternative, definitely wasn't an option in my low-income area. Another letter \nfrom a school administrator from the Shenandoah Valley says this: At her confirmation hearing it was quite clear \nshe had no knowledge of instruction, curriculum, federal programs and-- most disturbing--had no understanding of \nthe federal laws that are in place to protect children with disabilities. It is a serious business to educate children, and \nthe consequences are huge if we do it wrong. Another comment--and again, these are just samples of thousands--\nis from Olivia, a teacher in Williamsburg, who shared this: I see so much potential in my students every day, and I \nfeel very energetic as a young teacher about the opportunities that I know our public schools are providing already--\nand are capable of providing in the future. She said: I am concerned for my LGBT students, low-income students, \nand for the future of myself and my colleagues as public school educators trying to do good for our students. I \nhave received thousands of similar heartfelt messages from every corner of Virginia. I welcome this level of public \nattention and citizen engagement. Sometimes, as the President's nominees have come forward, I voted for many of \nthem, much to the consternation of some folks. But it is my job to weigh, regardless of that public opinion, what I \nthink is best for students in Virginia and, for that matter, students across the country. With this outpouring from \nteachers, parents, students, administrators, civil rights groups, charter school proponents and opponents, and from \nboth sides of the political aisle, I believe it does weigh. That is what I have done. I have listened to my constituents, \nbut more importantly, I have listened to Mrs. DeVos's own words before the Senate HELP Committee, and let me \nsay that I still have a lot of unresolved questions after reviewing Mrs. DeVos's testimony. For starters, Mrs. DeVos \ndid not demonstrate that she understood the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. She didn't \nunderstand that it is actually a Federal law passed by Congress and signed by President George H.W. Bush, \ncontrary to the impression Mrs. DeVos seemed to have at her confirmation hearing, saying that somehow \ncomplying with IDEA was simply a voluntary measure. That is not right, it is not the law, and, boy oh boy, did that \nfrighten a whole lot of parents whose kids have special needs and without IDEA, would not have those needs met. \nThey are concerned that Mrs. DeVos's seeming lack of familiarity with IDEA is indicative of how, if confirmed, her \nDepartment of Education would fail to protect the rights of these children--and every child--toward a free and \nappropriate public education that allows even kids with special needs to flourish. Another area under the \nDepartment of Education's jurisdiction where I have concerns about Mrs. DeVos's commitment and level of \nunderstanding is campus sexual assault compliance and enforcement. Since 2014, I have been proud to support \nbipartisan legislation led by my colleagues, Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill, the Campus Accountability \nand Safety Act. At the end of last Congress, this legislation had the support of more than one-third of the U.S. \nSenate, as well as a broad coalition of advocacy groups, law enforcement organizations, and many of our leading \ncolleges and universities. The Department of Education's own Office of Civil Rights has also played a very \nimportant role in initiating and in conducting title IX investigations. So you can understand why so many folks, \nincluding myself, were concerned when Mrs. DeVos did not demonstrate any depth of knowledge about the \ndifference of opinion surrounding particular policy issues related to campus sexual assault. Similarly, when asked \nabout a basic principle of education policy related to measuring student achievement, Mrs. DeVos was not able to \narticulate an understanding of the difference between growth and proficiency. [[Page S710]] In the same vein--and \nwhile this has become the subject of late night comedy, I think it is a very serious matter--Mrs. DeVos was not able \n\n\n\nto clearly express her understanding or her commitment to enforcing the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which, again, \nis Federal legislation, also signed by President Bush, where compliance is not optional. These are fundamental \ntenets of Federal education policy, not some obscure metrics, not small bills that languish in committee or small \ncompromises. These are the principles and cornerstones of Federal education civil rights policy, and they cannot be \nmore central to the Secretary of Education's core responsibilities of safeguarding students' civil rights and safety. \nFor all of those reasons and others, I am not able to support Mrs. DeVos's nomination to be Secretary of Education. \nI know the Presiding Officer has had to hear a number of these comments. I hope that if she is not confirmed, the \nPresident will send down an Education Secretary nominee who brings more mainstream views to this very \nimportant issue. There are those of us, like me, who are all for education reform, but it has to be led by someone \nwho will always put the needs of our kids first, and making sure they get a fair and appropriate education is \nguaranteed. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. \nMr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the qualifications of President Trump's nominee to be the leader of our \nDepartment of Education. Betsy DeVos has clearly shown a disregard-- even a hostility--for the public school \nsystem. So I stand with the thousands of parents, teachers, and students of New Mexico in fighting to stop her \nconfirmation. Simply put, education is too important to New Mexico children and our State's economy to have a \nSecretary of Education not fully invested in the success of our public schools. As someone who grew up going to \npublic school, who is sending my own kids to public schools, I am deeply troubled by Betsy DeVos's record on \nprivatization, which goes well beyond simply voicing support for vouchers and private school. Mrs. DeVos has been \na key player in the well-moneyed effort to privatize and siphon funds away from public education, and she has time \nand again undermined the teachers we all rely upon. It appears as though Betsy DeVos's most notable experience \nin education is spending her career and her fortune advocating for policies that divert public tax dollars away from \npublic schools and into private schools. I cannot support a nominee who wants to weaken the kinds of public \nschools that so many New Mexicans rely on. The privatization policies pushed by Mrs. DeVos would be especially \ndamaging to rural New Mexico, where there are few options to begin with. It is not uncommon for students to travel \nmore than an hour to get to and from school in those parts of the State. School administrators often wear multiple \nhats, sometimes running the after- school program or driving the local schoolbus. In rural areas in my home State, \nthe public school is often the only choice, and there simply aren't enough students to support the kinds of for-profit \nprivate schools that Mrs. DeVos wants to replace them with. Having a Secretary of Education who has spent her \nentire career pushing a privatization agenda is not reassuring to New Mexicans and is at odds with the needs of the \nstudents and families across my State. Further, I do not believe that Mrs. DeVos understands the Federal \nGovernment's trust responsibility in serving Native American students. Given Mrs. DeVos's rushed nomination \nhearing in the HELP Committee, Senators were given very little opportunity to question her about her understanding \nof tribal issues and impact aid. So I am concerned that she will push her privatization agenda in these areas as well. \nFor example, the Zuni Public School District is a small rural district in Western New Mexico. Earlier this week, their \nschool board sent me a letter asking that I oppose Mrs. DeVos's nomination. I want to take a moment and read a \nfew passage from this letter: The beauty of the United States public school system, unlike many in the rest of the \nworld, is that we take everyone who walks through our doors and love every child who sits in our desks, without \nquestion. This Board therefore stands by all of our students, no matter what color or ethnicity, regardless of their \ncreed; every child who identifies on the spectrum of L,G,B,T, or Q; every child with either a physical or learning \ndisability, or both . . . every child who speaks a second language; every immigrant child as well as every Native \nAmerican child who can trace their lineage in this land back thousands of years; every child who sees their \neducation as the bridge between their most ardent dreams and their most hopeful futures. These are powerful \nwords that I fully support, and I thank the Zuni Public School District for speaking out on this matter. We should all \nbe this concerned. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from the Zuni Public School District \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. During her nomination hearing, Mrs. DeVos \ndemonstrated over and over that she is unfamiliar with even basic education issues, and she failed to commit to \nuphold the responsibilities of the Secretary of Education to support public schools. Given that Mrs. DeVos has no \nrelevant experience as a teacher or school administrator, we should be very concerned with entrusting her to \nenforce key protections under title IX, under IDEA, and under other civil rights laws. In particular, Mrs. DeVos's lack \nof commitment to the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education, combined with the fact that she and \nher family have donated enormous sums of money to organizations that are anti- LGBTQ, anti-women's rights, and \nanti-Muslim, is simply troubling. The mission of the Office of Civil Rights is to ensure equal access to education and \nto promote educational excellence throughout the Nation with vigorous enforcement of civil rights. During her \n\n\n\nnomination hearing, Mrs. DeVos would not commit to continuing the Office's policies that are making our college \ncampuses safer by focusing on prevention and response to sexual assault. In fact, she has donated money to \norganizations that actually make it harder to prosecute sexual assault on our college campuses. As amazing as that \nsounds, it is true. If my Republican colleagues rubberstamp this nominee, they will confirm a Secretary of Education \nwho doesn't believe in public schools, who will unravel rural education, and who has even worked to make it harder \nto protect women against sexual assault on college campuses. I believe that we have a moral imperative to ensure \nthat all students have equal protections while attending school. Mrs. DeVos will be a massive step in the wrong \ndirection. As the members of the Zuni Pueblo wrote to me in their letter, ``our children are our most sacred gifts.'' \nThis is what we are voting on with this confirmation. We need an Education Secretary who is committed to \nupholding these principles. We need an Education Secretary who is committed to ensuring that every student has \naccess to quality education, regardless of their background or their ZIP code, regardless of their ethnicity or their \nreligion, and regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. In the last few weeks, my office has fielded thousands \nof calls and letters asking me to oppose this nomination. I have heard from more than 8,000 constituents on this \none topic alone, many of whom called as parents, teachers, and some as students. That is more than any other \nTrump nominee whom we have considered to date. Never has an Education Secretary nomination received so \nmuch attention and opposition. I stand with the thousands of parents, teachers, and students across the country, \nand in my home State of New Mexico, fighting to stop this nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no. \nThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Zuni Public School \nDistrict #89, 12 Twin Buttes Dr., Zuni, NM, January 30, 2017. To our Honorable Senators and Representatives: We, \nthe Board of Education of Zuni Public School District, ask you to add [[Page S711]] your support as we stand in \nopposition to the appointment of Betsy DeVos as United States Secretary of Education on the following grounds: \nDuring her confirmation hearing, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated that she was woefully ill-equipped to head the \nDepartment of Education. She has never attended a public school, never taught or administered in a public school, \nand her children have never attended a public school. She does not hold any degree in the field of education, either \nin theory, administration, or practice. She has a documented history of promoting a charter and voucher based \nsystem that she supported in her home state of Michigan, diverting funding and support away from public education \nand deserving children. Furthermore, when questioned in her hearing, Mrs. DeVos was unable to explain the \ndifference between growth and proficiency, nor was she familiar with the federal law behind IDEA, two essential and \nbasic aspects of education. As well, Mrs. DeVos advocated in her hearing to allow the presence of guns in schools \nduring an era of rampant mass violence based primarily on the use of guns in schools. Mrs. DeVos has also \npublicly stated that she sees education as a way to further proselytize for the Christian faith, which would constitute \na violation of the Constitutional separation of Church and State in public schools as it would in all federal \ninstitutions. Our pueblo of Zuni is a small community in a western pocket of rural New Mexico. We are neither a rich \ndistrict nor one that wields a great deal of political influence. What this Board does represent is a rich, Indigenous \ntradition and culture that holds high the ideals of hard-work, humility, and integrity. We are an agricultural, peace-\nloving society that has lived in this land since time immemorial. Yet our memory is long. We remember the era \nduring which education was combined with religion to be used as a weapon against the Native peoples of this great \nnation. We know the trauma such action has caused to reverberate through generations of good, decent Americans \nWe also know the resilience of those same people who, despite the infliction of weaponized education, have come \ntoday to see literacy as their American birthright, and to crave that sacred American Dream for which we are all \nConstitutionally entitled to strive. This is a living medicine and healing that must not be undone through the \ndissolution of the separation of church and state, one that we must nurture and safeguard for all American children. \nWe are reminded during this time that, as you do, we hold publicly-elected positions designed to represent a broad \nspectrum of constituent. The beauty of the United States public school system, unlike many in the rest of the world, \nis that we take everyone who walks through our doors and love every child who sits in our desks, without question. \nThis Board therefore stands by all of our students, no matter what color or ethnicity, regardless of their creed; \nevery child who identifies on the spectrum of L,G,B,T,or Q; every child with either a physical or learning disability, or \nboth; every child who speaks a second language; every immigrant child as well as every Native American child who \ncan trace their lineage in this land back thousands of years; every child who sees their education as the bridge \nbetween their most ardent dreams and their most hopeful futures. We further stand by each parent, guardian, \ngrandparent, sibling, aunt, uncle; every member of kin that builds and holds strong the dream of education for each \nof our children, knowing as we have always known in Zuni that our children are our most sacred gifts. And we, the \nBoard of Education in Zuni Public School District, stand by the teachers, aides, administrators, counselors, liaisons, \n\n\n\nnurses, secretaries, custodians, cooks, and bus drivers who as their daily work participate in the painstaking and \ndeeply patriotic act of ensuring equitable access to education for all of our students. It is through the diligence and \naction of just such citizens that this nation is able to deliver unto each new generation of American a passport to the \npossibility of American success. The children, families and hard-working faculties and staff of the American public \nschool system deserve a Secretary of the Department of Education who is most eminently qualified, through both \neducation and experience, to advocate for all Americans: diverse, complex, and brilliant citizens; to work toward the \nmost equitable education for all; and to uphold this cornerstone of our democratic republic. It is for these reasons \nthat the Zuni Public School District Board of Education respectfully requests your most passionate and vocal \nsupport in opposing the appointment of Mrs. Betsy DeVos. We also ask that you look toward the experienced and \nqualified education professionals working within the public school system to fill this highest position in the field. \nE:lah'kwa (Thank you) for your representation, Zuni Board of Education: Mr. Jerome Haskie, Board President Ms. \nStephanie Vicenti, Vice Board President Ms. Masika Sweetwyne, Secretary Ms. Bernadette Panteah, Member Ms. \nShelly Chimoni, Member. Mr. HEINRICH. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The \nclerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern with the nomination of Betsy \nDeVos as the Secretary of Education. The State of West Virginia is a State made up of a lot of small towns. We \ndon't have any what you call large metropolitan areas. We are an urban rural State. For many communities in West \nVirginia, our schools are more than just classrooms, teachers, and textbooks. Our children in West Virginia learn \nmore in their public school than reading, writing, and arithmetic. They are the heart of the community and a home \naway from home for most of them. They are a safe place to stay after school where no harm will come to them. \nThey are a place where nutritional meals are served and health care services are provided by trusted school \nnurses. After meeting with Mrs. DeVos and watching her answer questions at her confirmation hearing, I have a \nhard time believing she has the qualifications to be the Secretary of Education. I believe in local control of education \nand also that strong public schools are vital to our State's future. Education is local. Each one of our 55 counties is \nresponsible for the financing of the schools. If the counties do not have the sufficient funds, we have what we call a \nschool aid formula that basically offsets that so that every child in West Virginia will get a quality education. In my \nState, charter schools and school vouchers would pull already limited public funds and resources from the schools, \nstudents, and teachers who need them the most and could be harmed and would probably be harmed. There are \nsome towns in West Virginia with only one school--one school only--or where students have to travel for more than \nan hour on a bus to get to the school that has been consolidated. Voucher policies would be completely useless in \nthese places. There is no place for them to attend. In areas where there are a few private schools in my State, a \nvoucher program would have devastating effects for public school children. The limited dollars that we do have, if \nyou deviate that money whatsoever, then basically you are going to have the strain on the public system that will \nnot be able to pick it up in the rural areas. There is no other way for us to have the funding we need. Vouchers will \nsiphon public funding away from our public schools, causing them to have to cut resources like teachers, advanced \ncoursework, and preschool programs. They often do not pay the entire cost of attendance at a private school, \nmaking them unusable by low- income students and families. Vouchers also can strip students with disabilities \nand their families of their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The most troubling part of that \nhearing, if you watched it or saw any parts of it, was the lack of understanding that every child deserves the \nopportunity for a quality education no matter what his or her disabilities may be. That is a responsibility we have as \nAmericans. With that, if you have never been in a public school setting, you have never attended a public school \nyourself and have always been privately schooled, your children have never attended a public school and have \nalways either been privately schooled or home schooled, you have probably never been in a setting where you \nhave seen a disabled child trying to get the opportunities that other children have, with a special aide who is \nworking with them. You can say that is a waste of resources. I guess you could say that if it wasn't your child. If it \nwasn't somebody you knew, it would be easy to say that, But just the empathy you would have--it would be hard for \na person to understand that. I believe that is a compelling reason to make me take pause and say that I believe we \nneed somebody who has had that diversity, who has had that real classroom experience. [[Page S712]] Another \nthing--never to be in a PTA meeting where you have problems with schools. You might have problems with the bus \nand transportation. You might have problems with extracurricular activities or lunch programs or a routine study \nprogram, where you can sit down with other parents and work through these programs. That is something that is \nhard for most of us in West Virginia to ever conceive, that you could never be in that position and never have that \n\n\n\nexperience in life. I believe communities in West Virginia know our students' needs better than someone who \nnever attended or worked in the public school system. Many West Virginians have called and written to me \nexpressing their concern about Mrs. DeVos. I have a letter I want to read from Diane from Marion County, my home \ncounty. We have hundreds of letters that have come in. Diane writes: I am asking you to vote against the \nconfirmation of Mrs. Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. As an educator with 44 years of experience in public \nschools, I recognize we have many issues, but I also know we do much that is right for children. Educators no \nlonger simply teach core content. We know that children can only thrive if their social, emotional and physical needs \nare met. The whole child is now the focus of every teacher, and teaching has become a very difficult but a very \nrewarding job. Educators need and DESERVE a Secretary of Education that knows and understands the \ntremendous responsibility each of us has accepted. We do not have the time to get the leader ``in step'' with us. We \nneed and DESERVE someone who understands how policies can impact what we are able to do for our children. . . \n. We need and DESERVE someone who understands the value of academic growth versus proficiency. We need \nand DESERVE someone who understands how important it is to send food home in backpacks because our \nchildren will not eat during a weekend or holiday break. I want to stop there and give you a personal experience. \nWhen I was Governor of the State of West Virginia, I would go around to the schools. The school would tell me \nwhat was going on in the community. I would always go to the cooks because they really had the pulse of the \nschool. This was May, and school was getting ready to let out for the summer. One of the cooks was crying in the \nkitchen. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I went back and tried to console her and talk to her. I said: Can you \nexplain why you are so upset? You are just about out for the summer. She said: I know these little kids aren't going \nto eat much this summer. She wanted to stay and cook through the summer, have all year so the kids would have \nnutrition. That tells you what we are dealing with in an awful lot of rural settings. We need and DESERVE a leader \nwho knows that almost every teacher utilizes his/her own personal funds to buy pencils, paper, classroom supplies \nand instructional materials for our students because the budget for what our children DESERVE is not given to us. \nThat is the strain we already have on the system now. If you put any more strain on that by taking funds away \nmakes it almost impossible. My request is not politically motivated--my request for you to vote against Mrs. DeVos \nis about the teachers I work with in Marion County and across WV. One of the pillars of a great civilization is \neducation. Although the American system of education is not perfect, we are still envied by many nations. \nEducation is a hope for children of poverty as well as those who have economic security. Please encourage \nPresident Trump to seek out a former or current state superintendent of education or a chancellor of higher \neducation or anyone with the knowledge to walk in step with us as we make a brighter future for our children. \nDuring her hearing, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated a lack of knowledge about the basic issues in public education, \nincluding the debate about how best to measure student progress. She also did not appear to have a solid \nunderstanding about the amount of student loan debt in this country, which is now the second-largest source of \nconsumer debt in the United States, surpassed only by home mortgages. Not only does she lack the institutional \nknowledge, but she has no personal or family experience with the student loan system or any experience running a \nmajor loan program like the one she would be in charge of as Secretary of Education. This leads me to believe that \nshe would be unable to run the program effectively and efficiently. What I have said and spoke to other people \nabout--I understand and I think most of us have been in Washington long enough to understand how the system \nworks. Even though the person would have the greatest of intent, the most honorable of intent, wanting to do a \nbalanced job, if they never had the experience and they are charged with setting up programs that are supposed to \nincentivize schools, school districts, States, those programs are not going to lean to where they have no knowledge; \nthose programs will go to where they have the most knowledge and in a direction of the policies they believe in. \nWith that being said, incentives would go in that direction. When the incentives go in that direction, it pulls further \nresources away from a rural public education system. At her hearing, Mrs. DeVos failed to recognize that the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act is a Federal law protecting access for individuals with disabilities to a \ndecent public education and that she would be in charge of ensuring that the school implemented the act. No child \nshould ever be denied access to the same public education because they suffer from a disability. As both a \nGovernor and a father, I can never look a parent in the eyes and tell them their child cannot get the same education \nas another child simply because they suffer from a disability and it would be too costly for us to do. West Virginians \nneed an Education Secretary who has an understanding of the needs of all children, including those with \ndisabilities, and is committed to ensuring they receive a quality education. A strong education is the building block \nfor success for every child and the foundation for our country's long-term economic strength. We need an Education \nSecretary that understands the challenges that students, teachers, and schools in rural areas face. Betsy DeVos \n\n\n\nhas spent her career working in the private school system, not investing in and improving the public school system. \nMuch of the policies that Mrs. DeVos supports would divert public funds to private schools--whether it was \nintentional or not--strip accountability from these schools, and significantly harm the public school system in my little \nState of West Virginia, which is all we have. It is difficult to speak--and I try not to make it personal because I don't \nbelieve in the toxic rhetoric that goes on sometimes in this room, and it shouldn't in this great Senate Chamber of \nours and on the Hill. So I know this is probably a good lady who is well-intentioned. She just doesn't have that \npersonal experience it takes to grab this entire country and understand that we are different. States are different. \nWe depend on it. We can't always go in one direction, and that is the flexibility. They are saying: Well, we will give \nyou flexibility. We need the support from Washington to have the flexibility to make sure the children of West \nVirginia have the same opportunities that a child in Pittsburgh, PA, might have in a larger school district, one in a \nmetropolitan area that could afford--because you don't have all the travel and everything else that is involved--to \nhave a charter school. In my State, even the legislature couldn't. They looked at charter and voucher systems, and \nthey couldn't find a pathway forward because of the limited funding and knowing that it would divert. If there is no \nmore funding going into it, that means you have to cut the pie more. They were concerned about even going in this \ndirection. My legislature, in the last 2 years, has flipped completely to a Republican majority in both the House and \nSenate. They are all good people, well-intended. They are looking at all these different avenues, but at the end of \nthe day, you have to take care of those whom you are responsible for. In rural West Virginia, that is a child who \nmight have to ride 1 hour just to go to school. I don't know where you would put a charter school. I don't know \nwhere, with the voucher system, you could send him. If we have a problem in deficiencies, that is basically the \nresponsibility of the county and the community. It is the responsibility of the parents and guardians to be involved. It \nis a responsibility for all of us to speak up. I guess what we are going to end up with is all the children with \ndisabilities or children who basically do not have the means or a person in their family who [[Page S713]] is able to \ndrive them or take them to a special school; they are all going to be left, so-called, behind. It is just not who we are \nin West Virginia. I ask for your consideration that maybe we can find a Secretary who has the experience and \nunderstanding and has the real-life experience--they might have attended a public school themselves. I am a \nproduct--I am sure you are a product of public schools. We are a product of the public school system, probably, \nmore than likely, rural public school systems. We did pretty well with them. People cared. We had to give a little bit \nand make some sacrifices, and we did that. The bottom line was that there were no options. We made the best out \nof what we had. These kids aren't going to have options. The majority of kids in West Virginia or Oklahoma will not \nhave those options. You better make sure that school system you have, a public school in a rural setting, is giving \nthat child every opportunity that he and she can excel. Who knows, maybe one day they will be sitting in my seat or \nyour seat. I hope so. With that, I say I must oppose her achieving the Secretary position that President Trump has \nnominated her for, with all due respect. I think I stated my reasons for that. I would hope that people understand our \nrural public schools truly need a champion. We need that champion to really step forward and lift us all up. I yield \nthe floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am here \nthis afternoon to stand up to one of the most dangerous nominees in President Trump's Cabinet of Big Oil, big \nbanks and big billionaires who are going to be populating the Cabinet of the United States. The Secretary of \nEducation is responsible for a budget that includes $36 billion for elementary and secondary education, $150 billion \nfor higher education each year. On top of that, the Secretary of Education is responsible for more than $1.2 trillion \nin outstanding Federal loans. This nominee, Betsy DeVos, would shape the policies and programs that affect more \nthan 50 million students across our country. Young people may be 16 percent of our population, but young people \nrepresent 100 percent of the future of the United States. We need a Secretary of Education who believes that all \nchildren deserve access to a quality public education, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, neighborhood, or \ndisability status. Betsy DeVos does not share this commitment to equal opportunity, and she is unqualified to serve \nas Secretary of Education. Betsy DeVos has a long and well-documented record of opposing public school \nsystems. She has implemented school choice voucher programs. She has simultaneously expanded and \nderegulated charter schools. In Massachusetts, we recognize that education is a passport to the job opportunities of \nthe 21st century. Massachusetts students at the 4th, 8th, and 10th grades are No. 1 in America in math, verbal, \nand science. We are No. 1 in math, verbal, and science, 4th, 8th, and 10th grades. If Massachusetts were a \ncountry, we would be second behind Singapore in reading for the whole planet. That is Massachusetts. We have a \nvery high percentage of our students who are minorities in our home State. I live in Malden. Malden is a city of \n60,000 people. Malden High School, 2016 graduation class, 28 percent White, 25 percent Asian, 24 percent \nLatino, 23 percent Black, 1 percent Pacific Islander. What is our goal? Our goal in Malden--our goal in \n\n\n\nMassachusetts--is to be No. 1. No. 1, not just in the United States but No. 1 in the world. We know you can do it if \nyou make a commitment to these kids. It is not just our traditional public schools. It is our public charter schools, our \nprivate schools, our preparatory schools that are enormously successful. Many of them are world famous, these \nhigh schools. People send their children from around the country to go to a school in Massachusetts. The success \nof our public charter schools is largely due to very strong accountability measures brought about through State \nregulations and rigorous oversight. That is the key to our charter school system. It is accountability. It is oversight. It \nshould not be draining money out of the charter school system for profits for private corporations. It has to be \ninvested in the kids, but Betsy DeVos wants charter schools to have less accountability and has fought to keep \ncharter schools unregulated across Michigan. When the Michigan State Legislature introduced a bipartisan bill that \nwould have expanded oversight of charter schools, Betsy DeVos stepped in. She and her family donated $1.45 \nmillion to State legislators in order to strip the helpful oversight accountability language out of the bill. That works \nout to $25,000 a day over the 7-week period the bill was being debated. Betsy DeVos and her unlimited funding \nultimately succeeded in blocking the commonsense accountability legislation. The students and families of Detroit \nwere denied the key protections in oversight that their schools needed. Betsy DeVos's school choice priorities go \nbeyond expanding and deregulating charter schools. She has pushed for voucher programs that would use \ntaxpayer money, your money, to pay for a child's private school tuition. Under a national voucher system, the \nfunding that would normally go to local school districts would instead be diverted away from public schools toward \nfor-profit, private institutions. In addition to the private schools that benefit from a voucher system, 80 percent of the \ncharter schools in Michigan are run by for-profit companies, a much higher percentage than any other State. These \ncompanies are focused first and foremost on making money. We don't allow this to happen in Massachusetts. We \nhave only one goal, and that is to be No. 1. That money must stay in the school system, especially if you are trying \nto educate a minority population, which is the future workforce of our country. That is key. They don't come from the \ntraditional backgrounds in many circumstances. The Secretary of Education must fight for all children and families, \nnot promote companies seeking to profit off the backs of our students. Not even Michigan--the State where DeVos \nand her family money have tried to exert the most influence over education policy--has implemented a statewide \nvoucher system. Despite spending $5.6 million on a campaign to promote school vouchers, the DeVos family failed \nto amend the Michigan State constitution. If Betsy DeVos is allowed to expand her school choice policies across the \nUnited States, it would be devastating for our students and for the future of our country. Her ideas are too extreme. \nThey will not work for our students or for school districts in our Nation. I also share serious doubts that Betsy \nDeVos will support all students in America. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is the primary Federal \nlaw that ensures that all students in every State have access to a free and appropriate public education, regardless \nof physical or mental handicaps, learning or attention disorders. This law covers students who are blind, deaf, \nvocally or mobility impaired, and those with autism or ADHD. Congress passed the original form of IDEA in 1975. It \nis a bedrock law in our country. Yet when Betsy DeVos was asked about it during her nomination hearing before the \nHELP Committee, she stated that States should be responsible for determining how, and even if, to enforce IDEA. \nRemember, IDEA goes right to the heart of what we are going to do for those kids with disabilities. That is a \nbedrock law in our Nation. States must abide by it. We need a Secretary of Education who understands \nlongstanding Federal education law and will commit to protecting every student in America because every student \ndeserves the guarantee that they can and they will receive a free and appropriate public education that is promised \nand protected by law. If this laundry list of efforts to undermine public education wasn't enough to cause skepticism \nabout Betsy DeVos's qualifications to be Secretary of Education, in her confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos would \nnot commit to keeping guns out of our schools. Her response when asked about the issue was: ``I think that is best \nleft to locals and States to decide.'' Guns do not belong anywhere near our schools or our students and teachers, \nnot in public or private schools, not in elementary schools, and [[Page S714]] not in our high schools. I am proud to \nhave stood with Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal on the floor of the Senate for 15 hours calling for \ncongressional action on commonsense gun safety legislation. As a Senator, the safety and security of \nMassachusetts' schools, neighborhoods, and communities are my top priority. Our Secretary of Education has the \nsafety of every student in every State in his or her hands, and I do not believe Betsy DeVos is up to that job. I do \nnot stand alone in this conclusion that Betsy DeVos is unfit to be Secretary of Education. I received tens of \nthousands of letters and phone calls from constituents all across Massachusetts urging me to reject her nomination. \nThese come from teachers and administrators, the people who work on these issues every day. I have a letter here \nfrom Todd Simendinger, the principal of Rockport Elementary School in Rockport, MA. He wrote to me last week \nand said: Senator Markey, as a strong supporter of public education, I ask that you oppose the confirmation of \n\n\n\nBetsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. We must have a secretary who can commit to supporting every student in \nall public schools and provide leadership that will help our neighborhood schools succeed. Betsy DeVos's record in \neducation and her performance at the recent confirmation hearing prove that she is the wrong candidate for the job. \nAs a principal, I have spoken with teachers, parents, students, and community members who agree that America's \nfuture depends on a strong investment in our Nation's public schools. The offices of so many of my colleagues who \nhave spoken on the floor already have, like me, received these kinds of letters and messages literally on a minute-\nby-minute basis from our constituents. Their passion is born of a deep commitment to ensuring that the very best \neducation for all of the children of the Commonwealth can only be provided if the standard for that education is high. \nI commend them, and I agree with their concerns. All children deserve that standard. So, from my perspective, you \ncannot have a more fundamental issue before us, this privatization of the public school system in America, the \nvoucherization of our public school system in America. There is a model. It is Massachusetts. We do it right now. \nWe are No. 1 in the country. We look over our shoulders at those who are behind us. But it is a standard that \nbasically says: We are going to invest in the public schools and the charter schools. We are going to make sure \nthey have the highest possible standards. That is a recipe for ensuring that every child, regardless of their national \nnationality or their income, gets the education they need for a portable passport to a global economy for the rest of \ntheir lives. That has to be our goal. What is happening using the philosophy of Betsy DeVos is a failure. It is a \nproven failure. We already see the results. What is happening in Massachusetts, what happens in implementing the \nstandards of the laws that we already have on the books across our country--it points us in the correct direction. So \nwith that, I urge a ``no'' vote on Betsy DeVos and her nomination as Secretary of the Education Department. I yield \nthe floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior \nassistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \nCongratulating the New England Patriots Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, American history was made last night. The \nNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl. This triumvirate of Robert Kraft, Bill Belichick, and Tom Brady continues \nthis historic journey to being recognized as the greatest single football team in the history of the United States. Even \nas the Falcons were ahead by 25 points, even as the rest of the country thought the game was over, we in \nMassachusetts, we in New England, we have our own motto: In Belichick we trust. In Brady we trust. We knew it \nwas not over. We knew there was still hope. We knew there was a plan that could be implemented that would \nensure that the Patriots once again would prevail. I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me this opportunity to be \nrecognized on this most important of all subjects. This incredible Patriots victory has brought joy to people all across \nNew England. It has brought dismay to people in other parts of the country. They still continue to be mystified by \nthis incredible team and the incredible leadership those three great leaders provide. But for us, we realize we are in \nthe presence of greatness. We know how spoiled we are to have such a great team. I just wanted to rise and \ncongratulate the New England Patriots, their leadership of Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, but all of this team, \nbecause their motto is a very simple motto. It says: Do your job. That is what every Patriot did last night. Because \nthey stuck it out through every single play, at the end of the day, they were able to enjoy that historic victory. For my \npart, I can't be more proud of any group of New Englanders. It was just a fantastic victory. As a season ticket \nholder, when I was 19 years old, when it was seven games at $6 apiece--$42 as a season ticket holder at Fenway \nPark. You can imagine how almost impossible it is to believe that we have reached such a stage where even those \nwho have been critics of the Patriots now are forced to recognize that Bill Belichick is the greatest coach of all time; \nTom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time; and the Patriots, led by Robert Kraft, is the greatest franchise of \nall time. We are very proud that victory last night cemented that place in history. Once again, I just want to \ncongratulate each and every one of them and especially the Patriots fans who, through thick and thin, have been \nwith that team every step of the way. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. \nMENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today as a product \nof New Jersey public schools, the son of Cuban refugees whose parents decided to leave everything behind \nbecause they did not like the dictatorship from the right and did not like what they saw in the Sierra Maestra, as the \nCastros were seeking to overthrow that government from the right, and who fled their own country in order to seek a \nbetter life in the United States. They were the lucky ones. They saw the handwriting on the wall, and they got out \nbefore the true brutality of the Castro regime took hold in Cuba. When they arrived here, they had nothing more \nthan the promise of a brighter future and, if not for them, then for their children. In so many ways, it is the \n\n\n\nquintessential immigrant story; indeed, the quintessential American story. My mother worked as a seamstress in the \nfactories of New Jersey. My father was an itinerant carpenter. We didn't have a lot of money--just enough to live in \na small apartment in a tenement in Union City and put food on the table. But that was plenty. It was plenty because \nmy parents knew that living in America gave their children access to a free public education, and they always taught \nus that an education was the key toward a better life. Growing up, I was a quiet kid. I was very studious. I got good \ngrades, but I struggled with public speaking. I know some of my colleagues wouldn't believe that today, but it is true. \nUnfortunately for me, one of the final requirements before I graduated high school was a public speech class. \nAgain, I did all the work, but I refused to actually stand up in front of the class and speak. I thought I could get away \nwith it, but my teacher, Gail Harper, had other ideas. She kept me after class. After my classmates left, she forced \nme to recite short stories and poetry and speeches I had written that were part of the classwork. Eventually she told \nme that I was going to be the narrator in a school production, which meant that I was going to be speaking on stage \nin front of the entire student body. I was [[Page S715]] petrified--petrified. And I was inclined to refuse. I am not \nsure if there would have been a more terrifying thought to me in the world than having to get up in front of my entire \nstudent body, but Ms. Harper told me that she knew that I could succeed. If I refused, however, she would have no \nchoice but to fail me. And if you knew my late mother, that was not an option. So I swallowed my fear, and when I \ngot out there, I found that Ms. Harper's work paid off. Not only did I realize that I could overcome all of that fear and \nanxiety, but it had instilled in me a hunger to keep working, to get better at speaking in front of people, a skill that I \nhonestly owe my life's work to. For me, Ms. Harper was so much more than a teacher; she was a mentor and one \nof the unsung heroes of our public education system. And I am privileged to have had an opportunity to tell her that \nduring her lifetime. Now, thanks to my parents' commitment and incredible public schoolteachers like Ms. Harper, \nthis product of New Jersey public schools went on to get a law degree from Rutgers University, a State institution, \nand was able to rise from a tenement in Union City to 1 of 100 Senators in a country of over 300 million people. I \ngot my start in politics fighting for public schools in my hometown. When I was in high school, I was told that \nbecause of my grades and my activities, I could be in the senior honors program but that I had to cough up $200 for \nthe books. My parents were poor. We lived in a tenement. I didn't have $200 for the books. And I couldn't \nunderstand, for the life of me, if I had the ability and the grades but not the money, that I would be barred from \nbeing in the honors program. So I raised such a ruckus that they gave me the books, told me to be quiet, and they \nput me in the honors program. But I had friends who had the same circumstances; they had the ability and the \ngrades, but they didn't have the money. Unlike me, they didn't say anything, and they didn't get in. So I didn't think \nthat was right. I petitioned to change the school board from being appointed by the mayor at the time to being \nelected by the public. Ultimately, I won the fight to change that school board and became the youngest school \nboard member at that time in history when I was 20 years old. So I understand the promise of public education. I \nunderstand the challenges that come with it. I understand the need for parental engagement and the extraordinary \nimpact that good teachers can have on our children's lives. I understand that our schools need access to adequate \nresources in order to allow every student to reach their full potential. And I understand that we have a long way to \ngo to ensure that we truly do guarantee every child in America equal access to a high quality public education \nregardless of where they live, regardless of the happenstance of where they were born, regardless of their station in \nlife. Most importantly, I understand that our public education system has formed the foundation upon which the \nAmerican dream has been built for generations. It is the great socializing factor of our Nation, and there is no \nsubstitute for it. At its core, it is an all-taker system. It does not care whether you are wealthy or poor, whether your \nfamily predates European settlement, came on the Mayflower, or is first- generation American. It does not care \nwhether you are White or Black or Hispanic or Asian or Christian or Jewish or Muslim. It does not care whether you \nstruggle with learning disabilities or autism or Down syndrome. Our public education system welcomes you with \nopen arms and adheres to the fundamental principles that all are welcome, all are equal, and all deserve a chance \nto learn and earn a better life for themselves and their families. While we work to improve public education and \nrenew our commitment to our children, we need a partner in the Federal Department of Education that also \nunderstands these challenges and shares our values. Unfortunately, I do not believe that Betsy DeVos is that \ncandidate. While I do not question her intentions, her limited experience and advocacy for policies that \nfundamentally undermine public education make her unqualified to be the Secretary of Education. Mrs. DeVos has \nnever participated in the public education system that she would be tasked with overseeing either as a student or a \nparent or a teacher or an administrator. I don't see that fact in and of itself alone as disqualifying but, coupled with \nthe policies that she has advocated for in her home State of Michigan--pushing for more charter schools while \nsimultaneously working against accountability for them, even as they profit off the backs of children while showing \n\n\n\nlittle improvement in student outcomes; advocating for voucher schemes that put public funding into private \nschools even for families that do not need the additional assistance, while depriving public schools of vital funding \nthat they depend upon to provide a quality education to every student--it becomes clear that Mrs. DeVos does not \nunderstand that fundamental commitment to American children. My concerns about Mrs. DeVos were compounded \nby the answers she gave in her confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee. Guns have no place in our \nschools--at least in my view--except in the hands of trained law enforcement personnel tasked with keeping our \nchildren safe, yet when asked if she would do away with gun-free school zones, if told to do so by the President, \nMrs. DeVos, after trying to avoid the question with a nonanswer about grizzly bears attacking schools, said she \nwould ``support the President.'' I do not believe that it is the role of a Cabinet Secretary to simply and blindly \nsupport the President, regardless of how misguided or dangerous an idea might be, nor do I believe that it is \nreasonable or responsible to make it easier to bring guns in and around schools, where they endanger our children. \nWe must do a better job of securing universal background checks and treating mental health issues, but more guns \nis not the answer. Mrs. DeVos also said in her testimony that she believed that compliance with the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act should be left up to the States. IDEA, as the act is known, guarantees a ``free, \nappropriate public education'' that is individualized to meet the needs of every student with disabilities. When \nCongress first passed IDEA in 1975--though it was called then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act--it \ncame with a promise that the Federal Government would cover 40 percent of the cost to educate those with special \nneeds. Unfortunately, we have not met that obligation, providing less than half of that funding in recent history. \nIDEA is Federal--not State--law. It is Federal law that needs increased funding and attention from the Federal \nGovernment. And when this was pointed out to Mrs. DeVos, she said simply that she ``may have been confused.'' \nOur children with disabilities deserve a real Federal partner that understands the challenges they face and is \ncommitted to getting them the resources they deserve, not a Secretary of Education who is confused about the \nFederal role in education. These are only a few examples of how Mrs. DeVos has shown herself to be unprepared \nand unqualified for the very serious position to which she has been nominated. If confirmed, Mrs. DeVos would take \nover a multibillion-dollar Federal student aid and student loan program that helps American families afford the \nskyrocketing cost of higher education. I, myself, was a recipient of Pell grants and other Federal student aid and \nwould not have been able to afford the cost of a college degree without them. Yet not only does Mrs. DeVos have \nno experience with student loans or managing such a program, she has very little, if any, engagement with any \npolicy issues pertaining to higher education. At a time when trillions of dollars of student debt are acting as a \nbarrier to obtaining a higher education, hindering a generation of graduates from entering the middle class, and \nacting as a drag on our economy, we deserve a nominee who understands these issues. As we continue to struggle \nwith the best ways to measure student progress and achievement, we deserve a Secretary of Education who \nunderstands basic concepts like the difference between proficiency and growth. So let me just say, my own \nexperiences have given me an incredible faith [[Page S716]] in the power of public education systems, while Mrs. \nDeVos has worked only to undermine them. I believe that the Federal Government can be a strong partner in \nensuring a free, quality public education for all students, especially those with disabilities, while Mrs. DeVos seems \nto think that the Federal Government should not be involved in these endeavors. I believe that guns must remain \nout of our schools, but Mrs. DeVos seemed to indicate that they could have a place there. Most importantly, I \nbelieve that our students, parents, teachers, and educators should be able to trust the person tasked with \noverseeing them. And the 50,000 New Jerseyans who have reached out to me to oppose her nomination have \nclearly shown that she has not earned that trust. Here is one example of a constituent who reached out to my office. \nDear Senator, My name is Beth More and I live in your great State of New Jersey in Fanwood in Union County. I am \nwriting today to express my deep opposition to the appointment of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. As a \nmother of two boys in our public school system, and one with special needs, I am deeply concerned and troubled by \nMrs. DeVos's lack of public school experience. In fact, the thought of her steering money and funding away from \npublic schools is not only a threat to my children, but a threat to the 50 million other children currently receiving a \npublic education. She lacks understanding in even the most basic issues that affect our schools, and that, my \nSenator, is scary. I urge you to strongly oppose this and tell your other colleagues in the Senate the same. So I \nimplore my colleagues to put politics aside, to examine Mrs. DeVos's qualifications closely, and to be open to the \ninput that you all are receiving from your own constituents, like Beth More. I hope that if you are open in your mind \nin that regard, you will oppose Betsy DeVos's nomination to be Secretary of Education, as I will. With that, Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the \nroll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL.

Res.\n\n 50 are located in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'') Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education. Simply put, Betsy \nDeVos is completely unqualified to serve as Secretary of Education in this great Nation. Many others share this \nview. I have heard from thousands of parents, teachers, and other citizens of Wisconsin who are concerned about \nthe future of our education system urging me to oppose Mrs. DeVos and certainly opposing her vision for America's \nstudents. As of today, over 20,000 Wisconsinites have emailed me, and we have had over 7,000 phone calls \nopposing the confirmation of Mrs. DeVos, and Senate Democrats are unified in our opposition to Mrs. DeVos \nserving in this capacity. Even two Senate Republicans have announced that they cannot support Betsy DeVos. If \njust one more of my Republican colleagues were to announce their opposition and were to vote no, we could do the \nright thing and tell President Trump that he really needs to find a new candidate, a new candidate for Secretary of \nEducation who is qualified to run that Department. While Betsy DeVos has spent decades advocating for a \nparticular vision for education, she has never actually worked as a teacher or as an administrator. Her career has \ninvolved investing hers and her family's considerable [[Page S717]] wealth and using those resources to advance \nthe privatization of our K- 12 education system. She did not attend a public school either for grade school, high \nschool, or college, and nor did her children. She has never worked as a teacher, principal, professor, counselor, or \n\n\n\nin any other formal role in our education system. Her confirmation hearing before the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee clearly demonstrated how little she knows about Federal education law and policy. It was \nstartling to see her ignorance about critical measures like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or the \ndebate over growth versus proficiency as a measure of student achievement. Betsy DeVos has demonstrated that \nshe has neither the knowledge nor the experience in education that would allow her to be a successful leader of the \nDepartment of Education. Mrs. DeVos has worked to advance a vision of K-12 education that is fundamentally \nhostile to our public education system. My home State of Wisconsin has a long and very proud tradition of support \nfor public education. Back at the founding of our State, we wrote the guarantee that every child should receive a \nfree public education into our very founding document, our State Constitution. Wisconsin had the first kindergarten \nin the United States. Wisconsin is proud of something that we actually call the Wisconsin idea in higher education; \nthat the walls of the classroom should be the borders of the State, if not the borders of this Nation or the entire \nworld. Mrs. DeVos's experience in education, however, has been a decades- long effort to privatize it. Her record of \nsupport for vouchers as well as charter schools that lack adequate accountability and oversight is very troubling and \ncould lead to diversion of public dollars in even greater amounts out of public education. Regardless of any vision or \nexperience on education, Mrs. DeVos is a nominee with, let's say, complex and opaque finances. She has a very \nopaque record of financial dealings and political giving, including on matters directly related to the work that the \nDepartment does which she seeks to lead. Given her and her family's investments in companies that benefit directly \nfrom Federal education programs, I remain very concerned about what we simply still don't know. I am also troubled \nby Mrs. DeVos's and her family's long history of contributing to organizations that have been hostile to the lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, and transgender community, even promoting the discredited idea that sexual orientation or gender \nidentity can be changed through conversion therapy. While she told me and several of my colleagues at her hearing \nthat she believes all students should be treated equally, I really remain concerned about how this long history of \nsupport for these anti-LGBTQ organizations will influence a Department which, over the last 8 years, has shown \nsome tremendous leadership in supporting LGBTQ students and parents in the education system. The Federal \nGovernment's primary role in elementary and secondary education is to promote equity. I am not convinced that \nMrs. DeVos will be the leader the Department needs to do just that. Congress passed the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in 1965 as a civil rights measure. It was designed to ensure that every student, \nregardless of ZIP Code or parents' income, has access to a quality public education. We continued that important \ntradition in reauthorizing this law, which is now in the form of a very strongly bipartisan bill, the Every Student \nSucceeds Act. The next Secretary of Education will have to implement that act. I fear that Mrs. DeVos, as a vocal \nproponent of State and local control, will not be the strong voice we need to hold States accountable for serving all \nstudents, particularly those who have been historically left behind. When we passed the Every Student Succeeds \nAct, we made sure there were strong Federal guardrails to assure that we never forget why there is a Federal role \nin education to begin with, for equity and civil rights and to make sure that every child can succeed. Furthermore, I \nam very concerned that Mrs. DeVos would not commit to robustly supporting the Department's Office for Civil \nRights or enforcing the very guidance that protects transgender students from discrimination. Betsy DeVos lacks \nknowledge about and commitment to the Federal laws that ensure students with disabilities have access to the \nvarious supports that they need to receive and benefit from a quality public education. As I noted, she has \ndemonstrated a complete lack of understanding about our Federal obligations to these students. I have heard from \nnumerous parents in Wisconsin, parents of students with disabilities who were appalled by her inadequate \nanswers to questions at our education panel hearing. She was unprepared to answer questions about the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, and these parents have written to express their distress about what her \nfilling the role of Secretary of Education could mean for their children if she were to be confirmed. One Wisconsin \nmother of three special needs children wrote to me about how this Federal law provided the legal rights that she \nneeded to advocate for them, to advocate for the best possible educational environment for her three sons with \nspecial needs. I heard from another mother, Melissa from Beloit, who detailed how the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act makes it possible for her daughter, Rowenna, who has Down Syndrome and autism, to actually thrive \nin a public education setting, along with her peers. Finally, as a strong proponent of making college more accessible \nand affordable, I do not believe that Mrs. DeVos has the experience or vision that will allow her to successfully lead \nthe Department in supporting higher learning. There is a student debt crisis in this country, but Mrs. DeVos doesn't \nhave a plan to address it and has even expressed skepticism about a Federal role. While she has acknowledged \nthat there are some bad actors in higher education, she has also refused to commit to enforcing regulations that \nhelp students who are defrauded by dishonest schools like Corinthian Colleges. We need a Secretary of Education \n\n\n\nwho is an advocate for those students, not one who is looking for ways to shirk that responsibility. Despite the fact \nthat the Department oversees billions of dollars in grants and loans that allow students to pursue higher education, \nshe has expressed skepticism about any Federal role in making college more affordable. She has even refused to \noppose cuts to a program that helps students who commit to a career in public service or to support efforts to \nensure that the value of the Pell grant keeps pace with the cost of college. For all of these reasons and many \nothers, Betsy DeVos is not the right choice for Secretary of Education. I call on my colleagues to defeat her on the \nquestion of confirmation and to afford this new President the chance to send us a nominee who is prepared to be \nan advocate for all students and public education in this country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from \nFlorida is recognized. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to Senator \nSchumer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from Florida is recognized. Chinese \nPolitical Prisoners Jiang Tianyong and Tang Jingling Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I know that we are in the middle of \nan important debate about a topic of education in our schools. One of the topics I hope young Americans will learn \nmore about is the state of affairs across the world when it comes to human rights. We are a vibrant society engaged \nin a heated debate, as we often have been throughout our history, about items of political matters. If you look here \ntoday, there are people standing up to speak on different sides of an issue. You see that the Republican Party \ntoday controls the White House, the Senate, and the House, and yet you have people with the freedom in this \ncountry to be able to stand up and oppose that. We have seen that across the country with demonstrations and \nspeeches and all sorts of other protected speech. We are very fortunate [[Page S718]] and blessed to live in a \nnation with those freedoms. That is not the case all over the world. I wanted to take this opportunity in the midst of \nall of this debate and discussion about an important topic, the nomination before the Senate, to remind people that \ndespite our differences on these issues, we are truly blessed to be able to live in a country where opposing the \nparty in power does not mean you go to jail. As I have been doing for some time now, I wanted to come this \nevening and highlight yet another example of human rights abuses that is taking place in a very important part of \nthe world. For the past couple of years, my office and I have been highlighting human rights cases through our \nsocial media campaign. We call it hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression.'' The goals of this are to raise awareness \nabout these cases and the individuals who are suffering at the hands of these repressive governments. We know \nthat through history some of the oppressed people--we may not think these floor speeches matter; we may not think \nthat mentioning it here in this forum matters, but it does to them because one of the first things oppressors tell them \nis that the world has forgotten about them, and they don't matter anymore. That is one of the first reasons we come: \nto raise awareness and let them know we know their names, we know their story, and we will continue to speak out \non their behalf. The second reason is to show their families and their loved ones that elected officials--like me here \nin the United States--have not forgotten them because we know that tyrants, as I said, like to tell political prisoners \nthat they are alone in their struggle. The third reason is to call for action, whether it is for the administration to make \ntheir causes a priority, too, or to call on these governments to release these individuals. There is one more reason I \nthink that this effort, hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression,'' is important. As well as all the good work being done \nhere on both sides of the aisle in defense of human rights, promotion of democracy and the defense of God-given \nfreedoms like religious freedom and freedom of the press and free speech, which we celebrate here even in this \ndebate, have to continue to be pillars of our foreign policy. I hope that these cases we highlight bring those guiding \nprinciples to light. Today, I want to discuss the cases of two Chinese political prisoners whose courageous wives I \nhad the opportunity to meet last week when they visited in Washington, DC. These women personally requested \nthat I intervene on behalf of their husbands, pressing on the Chinese Government to unconditionally release them \nand, in the case of one, to account for his whereabouts. Perhaps just as importantly, they urged me that I press our \nown State Department to prioritize these cases diplomatically in the hope that these families can be reunited in the \nnot-too-distant future. I come here today to urge our now new Secretary of State, Mr. Tillerson, to prioritize the \nrelease of these men in his diplomatic engagement with China. In the coming weeks, I also expect that we will have \na chance to hear from the President's nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad of Iowa. When \nhe comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, I will bring up these cases \nand others and urge him to make their freedom a priority of his work if confirmed. Jiang Tianyong is a 45-year-old \nlawyer. He was disbarred by the Chinese Government because of his vigorous human rights advocacy, including \nhis representation of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, fellow rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, Falun Gong \npractitioners, and other human rights cases. Despite the risks of this work, he has been steadfast in his support of \nthe families and of their right to lawyers and legal advocates caught up in China's sweeping nationwide crackdown \non the legal community in July of 2015, which ensnared roughly 250 lawyers and advocates. Consistent with a \n\n\n\nspate of recent media stories, Jiang's wife indicated that his family and friends lost contact with him in late \nNovember of last year. That is when a Chinese state-controlled newspaper reported he had been detained for a \nseries of trumped-up charges. His wife has received no formal confirmation of his precise whereabouts, and, to \ndate, he has been denied access to a lawyer of his choosing. Even more troubling is that this is entirely legal under \nChina's laws, even though it violates all international norms of justice. Under China's own laws, authorities may hold \nhim, or anyone, for up to 6 months without informing his family where he is held and without allowing him to access \na lawyer, conditions that the United Nations Committee Against Torture has found place ``detainees at a high-risk of \ntorture.'' Indeed, reports over the past months about four other human rights lawyers provide detailed information \nabout the Chinese authorities' use of torture to extract ``confessions'' and impose unbearable psychological \npressure. All of these realities underscore that China remains a country of rule by law. Congressmen Chris Smith of \nNew Jersey and I cochair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which found in our 2016 annual \nreport that ``the Chinese Communist Party has continued to reject the notion that the rule of law should supercede \nthe Party's role in guiding the functions of the State.'' As such, lawyers, advocates, dissidents and others often find \nthemselves in the party's crosshairs, persecuted under the law, rather than protected by it, and they have no \nrecourse of justice. A second Chinese individual I want to highlight today is lawyer Tang Jingling, who has also \nbeen disbarred for his rights advocacy. He first gained prominence as a lawyer working on cases related to village \ncompensation, corruption, and by representing activists. In January of last year, he was convicted of ``inciting \nsubversion of state power.'' That is the charge, and he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He was first detained in \nMay 2014 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and provoking troubles.'' Just imagine that. Picking quarrels and \nprovoking troubles is a crime in China. This happened, by the way, during the lead up to the 21st anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square protests, when the Chinese Government worked desperately to wipe out any discussion or \nmemory of this historically brutal crackdown. In reality, all Tang and other activists did was participate in a \nnonviolent disobedience movement seeking legal and social reform in China. Following his conviction, Tang \neloquently wrote: Inside the grand edifice of the court, we can see stately and ornate furnishings and decorations, \nand we can see the government employees in dignified attire. But we cannot see the law and we can definitely not \nsee justice. He continues, movingly, speaking of the faith that has sustained him in the midst of injustice: The Holy \nBible has a passage that reads: ``Blessed are those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'' Today, we have \nbeen pronounced guilty, thrown in prison, separated from our families, and have endured humiliation and \ndifficulties--and I am far from being able to convince and prove to others how these tribulations could have become \nmy blessings. But God's will is inevitably difficult to understand. I often pray and ask him to give me more strength, \nso that I may persevere until the moment of revelation. I dare say, in 2011, while in a secret jail, and now in \ndetention, almost every day I have passed has been calm and fulfilling. I have never lost my direction. The courage \nand conviction of these men should be an inspiration to us all--an inspiration that should propel us to act. I would \nadd a reminder again of how blessed and fortunate we are to live by the grace of God in a nation where we have \nthe freedom to speak, to object, to state our views without fear of the circumstances and the consequences that \nthese brave men now face. The Chinese people who yearn for the protection of their most basic human rights and \nbravely stand with their fellow marginalized countrymen are China's greatest asset--not its biggest threat, as the \ngovernment of the Communist Party wrongly believes. Any government which views its own people with such fear \nand hostility will, as has often been said, find itself on the wrong side of history. So I hope more of my colleagues in \nthis body, in the House, and especially in the administration will join their voices in support of these political \nprisoners and all who languish in jails, prisons, and gulags simply because [[Page S719]] they want a better life, \nbecause they want a say in their future and have bravely made these aspirations clear. With that, I yield the floor. \nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Congratulating The New England Patriots Ms. \nHASSAN. Mr. President, before getting to the matter at hand, I thought I would take a minute to congratulate the \nNew England Patriots, the Kraft family, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and all of the Patriots players and fans \neverywhere for the greatest comeback victory in Super Bowl history. They really demonstrated the grit and \ndetermination and resilience that New Hampshire and New England is known for, and we are very, very proud of \nthem. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as the \nSecretary of Education. Our Nation recognized early in its history that public education is a necessary foundation for \nour democracy. It is critical that we continue to support a strong public education system that prepares all of our \nyoung people to participate in our democracy and to compete in the 21st century workforce. All public officials, \nregardless of their party affiliation, should share a reverence for the importance of public education to our country's \nsuccess, both now and into the future. They must show a commitment to enforcing our laws so that all students \n\n\n\nhave the opportunity to succeed. I agree with my colleagues that Mrs. DeVos has not shown a commitment to or an \nunderstanding of these principles, and that is why I oppose her nomination. This nomination process has been \nextremely disappointing from the start. Mrs. DeVos failed to provide critical information on her finances. Members of \nthe HELP Committee were only given 5 minutes to question Mrs. DeVos on her views on our Nation's education \nsystem. In the questions she did answer before the committee, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated a complete lack of \nexperience in, knowledge of, and support for public education. She was unable to address basic issues-- issues any \nNew Hampshire school board member could discuss fluently. She showed that she lacks an understanding of \nissues facing students with disabilities. She has potential conflicts of interests that she still has not answered basic \nquestions about. She supports diverting taxpayer dollars to private schools without accountability requirements. As \nGovernor of New Hampshire, I supported public charter schools. They play an important role in driving innovation in \neducation and in providing additional opportunities for nontraditional learners, but they must meet the same \nstandards as other public schools. In Detroit, Mrs. DeVos led efforts to oppose accountability requirements, even for \nfor-profit charter schools. In her testimony before the HELP Committee, she declined to support enforcing \naccountability requirements. It is clear that Mrs. DeVos would pursue policies that would undermine public schools \nin my home State of New Hampshire and across our Nation. In the past several weeks, thousands of Granite \nStaters--including students, parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents--have called and written into my \noffice. They have shared their concerns about Mrs. DeVos. They understand that she is completely unqualified for \nthis position. Our children, their families, and our Nation deserve better than a Secretary of Education who does not \nvalue public education. Ensuring access to public education for every student is an issue that is deeply personal to \nmy family. Shortly after my husband Tom and I welcomed our first child into the world, our son Ben, we found out \nthat he had severe and pervasive physical disabilities. It became clear to Tom and me that we were going to need a \nlittle bit of extra help if our son was going to have the kind of future we all want our children to have. We were lucky \nbecause we found that help in our community--not only among friends and neighbors but in a public school system \nthat welcomed Ben. I still remember the day that a schoolbus pulled into our driveway. We wheeled Ben onto the lift \nand up into the bus, and off he went at age 3 to his first day of preschool--a publically funded, inclusive preschool. \nAs I sat on the stoop and watched the bus pull away, I found myself thinking that if Ben had been born a generation \nor two earlier, Tom and I would have been pressured to put Ben in an institution. There wouldn't have been the \nresources in our community or in our school system to include Ben. But because of the work of the champions--the \nfamilies, the advocates--who went before the Hassan family, Ben was able to go to school in his hometown. He was \nable to learn and to make friends, to do what we all want our children to do. That is the power of public education. It \nis the power of making sure that all kids are included. Our family was able to live like any other family and feel like \nany other family because Ben could go to school in his hometown. As Ben went from preschool to elementary \nschool to middle school to high school, we found that his peers accepted him, interacted with him, and grew with \nhim. I still remember a day when I got a call from one of Ben's teachers, saying that the tire on his power wheelchair \nhad gone flat. That is the type of call that a parent of a child with complex needs dreads because it means that you \nhave to stop everything--because if the wheelchair can't move, your child can't go through their day. But instead of \nmy needing to take a day off from work and pursue the repair of Ben's chair, it was other students in our Career \nand Technical Education Center in Exeter who came forward and said: ``We can fix that.'' Their education preparing \nthem for a trade and a career served Ben's needs that day beautifully. Both Ben and his peers learned that day. \nBen's experience in public education was made possible because of so many advocates, educators, and families \nwho came before our family. But this was not always the case for students who experience disabilities. When I \nserved in the New Hampshire State Senate, I grew to know a woman named Roberta. Roberta, born in the early \n1950's, had spent a good portion of her life in our State's school for individuals with disabilities. Roberta left that \nState school as we began to work, after the passage of the IDEA, to bring people out of institutions and into the \ncommunities. Later, as Roberta learned to advocate for herself and tell her story, she recorded some of her \nmemories from the Laconia State School, the separate school--so-called school--for students with disabilities. \nRoberta wrote: Some of the attendants and residents at the Laconia State School sexually, verbally, emotionally \nand physically abused and assaulted me. The staff said they did this to me because I misbehaved or acted silly. \nThe attendants and residents there hit and kicked me with their hands and feet. They pulled my hair, whipped me \nwith wooden or metal coat hangers, wet towels, hair brushes, mop and broom handles, hard leather belts, straps, \nrulers and hard sticks, stainless steel serving utensils and clothes. Roberta adds: Additionally, they bullied me by \nlaughing at me and calling me names. They spat at me, bit and pinched my arms and other body parts causing me \npain. The employees and supervisors at the institution threw buckets of cold water on my body, clothes and all. \n\n\n\nThey said that the cold water would calm me down. Roberta's experience was, unfortunately, what life was like for \nsome students with disabilities before IDEA. Years later, after Roberta left Laconia State School, after she was \nreintegrated into her community, she appeared before a State senate committee that I was chairing because she \nwas the main proponent of a law that we passed in the New Hampshire State Senate to remove the word \n``retarded'' from all of our State statutes. Roberta knew that it was the judgment of people who first interacted with \nher, people who believed she had intellectual disabilities, that caused her parents to believe that they had to put not \nonly Roberta but her sister Jocelyn in an institution. Both Roberta and Jocelyn happened to have the misfortune of \nbeing born with disabilities. It is that contrast between Roberta's experience and my son's that keeps me focused on \nthe importance of making sure that we include all children in our public school system but also that we have the \nlaws in place to ensure that they get the free appropriate education that all American children deserve. [[Page \nS720]] Unfortunately, Mrs. DeVos has demonstrated a lack of understanding of the challenges facing students with \ndisabilities. At our hearing earlier this month, I questioned Mrs. DeVos on whether she would enforce IDEA. Not \nonly did she decline to assure Senators that she would enforce the law to protect students with disabilities, but she \nwas confused about whether IDEA was indeed a Federal law to begin with. While I am pleased that Mrs. DeVos \nlater clarified that she is no longer confused about whether IDEA is a Federal law, she has done nothing to reassure \nme that she would enforce it or that she understands how fragile the gains we have made under IDEA are. The \nvoucher system that Mrs. DeVos supports has often, intended or not, hurt individuals who experience disabilities. \nChildren and families lose legal protections enshrined in the IDEA. In some cases, students and their families have \nto sign away their civil rights before they can receive their vouchers. Yet many of the private schools that take those \nvouchers--the schools that Mrs. DeVos wishes to push students to--lack basic resources or accommodations for \nchildren who experience disabilities. So if a family determines that the school that has accepted their voucher really \ndoes not have the resources or the expertise to educate their child, they have no legal recourse. Mrs. DeVos's \nunfamiliarity with IDEA, her comments on students with disabilities was something my office heard about often \nfrom Granite State parents who contacted the office with concerns about her nomination. A mother from Hopkinton, \nNH, wrote to tell me about her daughter who attends Hopkinton High School and experiences severe disabilities--is \nnonverbal and requires assistance for all aspects of her daily care. This mother wrote: Despite all of this, because \nof the extraordinary support we have received, she is living a rich and loving life at home and is part of the public \nschool system. I have no confidence that Betsy DeVos would understand or support the role that public schools \nhave for taking care of all students. This mother also called Mrs. DeVos's lack of understanding of IDEA \n``appalling.'' I also heard from a parent from Concord, NH, who said: My stepdaughter currently has a 504 plan for \nboth a physical and cognitive disability at Concord High School, who, incidentally, are doing an excellent job of \nworking with her to make sure her learning needs are met. My children deserve a future and so do all children. This \nparent said she was feeling ``vulnerable'' as a result of Mrs. DeVos's nomination. Parents all across our Nation \ndeserve to know that the rights of their children will be protected, and they are rightfully concerned with Mrs. \nDeVos's nomination. In New Hampshire, I am proud of our work to build a future where every child can get the kind \nof education they need to be competitive and successful leaders in the 21st century economy. Just last week, I \nvisited Souhegan High School in Amherst, NJ. Souhegan has become a pioneer in competency-based education. I \nvisited numerous classrooms where students were doing hands-on lessons in Earth science, in literature to make \nsure they could master the material before them in a way that would stick with them. They were great examples of \nwhat we have learned about the importance of hands-on, project-based learning, how much better students retain \ninformation, knowledge, problem-solving skills, when they actually have a problem to solve, and how important it is \nfor them to learn to collaborate with their fellow students, just the way we expect people to collaborate as a team in \nthe workplace. After I visited the classes, the students at Souhegan had formed a panel to talk with me. There, \nstudents with a variety of interests, backgrounds, and education levels talked to about how important it was for \nthem to have control of their own learning, to learn in a way, in a style that worked for them to work with their peers \nand build off of each other's strengths and learn from each other. I also talked with them about New Hampshire's \npilot, project-based competency assessment program called PACE, something that New Hampshire received \nwaivers to do over the last year, and they are in the process of continuing right now. New Hampshire is piloting a \nprogram that moves us away, just as was recommended and foreseen by the Every Child Succeeds Acts from high-\nstakes, one-time testing to project-based assessments that are built into the project-based competency learning \nthey are doing. We are seeing great success with this pilot, and schools across the country are beginning to adopt it \nas well. That is the power of strong, innovative public education. This was an approach developed by teachers and \nparents and students and our Department of Education and our statewide school board as well as local school \n\n\n\nboards together. Just as we have important initiatives surrounding project-based learning in New Hampshire, we \nalso have strong public charter schools. I still recall a visit to our North Country Charter School in one of the more \nrural parts of New Hampshire, a school that was formed--a regional effort--to allow students for whom traditional \nhigh school was not working, whether it be because of their learning style, because of particular events that were \nhappening in their home, or other emotional or developmental issues. It allows them to come together and go to \nschool in a way and in a place that works for them, keeping them in school, helping New Hampshire meet its goal \nset in law that no child drop out of high school before age 18. The strength of the students I saw at the Country \nCharter School graduation was extraordinary; students who would overcome particular challenges, whether it was \npersonal, whether it was academic--speaking for themselves and about themselves and their vision of their own \nfuture to a crowded, excited room of friends and family. That is another kind of public education that supplements \nour statewide public education system and is something we can work together to do, holding all schools \naccountable. The vision that Mrs. DeVos, on the other hand, outlined and has devoted much of her work to, would \ndismantle the progress we have made, diverting taxpayer dollars to private, religious, and for-profit schools without \naccountability requirements. Mrs. DeVos advocates for a voucher system that leaves out students whose families \ncannot afford to pay additional tuition costs, and leaves behind students with disabilities because the schools do \nnot accommodate their complex needs. In his book, ``Our Kids,'' Robert Putnam notes that education should be a \nmechanism to level the playing field, but today the inequality gap is growing because affluent students start better \nprepared and are more able to pay. Putnam also points out that daycare and transportation needs constrain the \namount of choice that poor parents have when it comes to voucher programs. We should all be working to fix that \ngap, but the voucher programs that Mrs. DeVos advocates for threaten to increase the gap. The system that Mrs. \nDeVos advocated for in Detroit, MI, has undermined public schools and hurt students in the process. In 2014, \nMichigan taxpayers spent $1 billion on charter schools, but laws regulating them are weak and the State demands \nlittle accountability. The Detroit Free Press reported on the Detroit school system, finding a system where school \nfounders and employees steered lucrative deals to themselves or to other insiders, where schools were allowed to \noperate for years despite their poor academic records. The Detroit Free Press described a system with no State \nstandards for those who operate charters and where a record number of charter schools, run by for-profit \ncompanies, refuse to detail how exactly they are spending taxpayer dollars. One Detroit mother said that Mrs. \nDeVos's ``push for charter schools without any accountability exposed my children and their classmates to chaos \nand unacceptable classroom conditions.'' In Florida, the McKay Scholarship Program voucher for students with \ndisabilities that Mrs. DeVos has pointed to also raises significant concerns, including no due process rights for \nstudents under IDEA, no accountability requirements for participating schools, and absolutely no evidence of \nstudent success. Additionally, the McKay voucher often does not cover the full cost of the [[Page S721]] private \nschool, leaving parents responsible for tuition and fees above the scholarship amount, not to mention responsibility \nfor transportation. This puts students and their families at risk. Rather than taking the approach we have in New \nHampshire, where charter schools supplement a strong public education system, this system of unaccountable \nschools destabilizes and undermines public schools. Now, given that Mrs. DeVos's goals for K-12 education are \nwhat they are and the fact that we were only given 5 minutes to question her at the hearing, many key issues facing \nAmerican students were not discussed at all in her confirmation hearing. In particular, we did not talk about higher \neducation. When I was Governor of New Hampshire, I was proud of our work to make college more affordable, \nbuilding a 21st century workforce pipeline for our businesses. We froze tuition for the first time in 25 years at our \npublic university system, and we actually lowered it at our community colleges. We engaged in increasing and more \nrobust job training efforts, where we partnered businesses with community colleges or other learning centers to \nmake sure we were engaged in the kind of job training that would prepare students for the 21st century economy. I \nwas hoping that at our hearing for Mrs. DeVos's confirmation, we would discuss higher education, but issues \nrelating to higher education have been lost altogether in this discussion. What is clear, though, is that Mrs. DeVos \nhas absolutely no experience in higher education. Her written responses following our hearing were troubling. On \nstudent debt, Pell grants, reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and job training efforts, her responses were \nvague and offered no vision for issues that are critical to millions of Americans. When asked about for-profit \ncolleges, which have had a history of taking advantage of students, including but not limited to our veterans, Mrs. \nDeVos said she was agnostic--that is her word--about the tax filing status of higher education institutions. That is \njust not acceptable. I believe we should be expanding Pell grants. We should lower the interest rates on student \nloans. We should be expanding apprenticeship and job training opportunities. We need to crack down on predatory \nfor- profit colleges. We need an Education Secretary who understands and is able to focus on higher education, \n\n\n\nand it is clear that Mrs. DeVos does not have that experience or focus. Mr. President, our Founders understood that \npublic education for our citizens was essential to the functioning of our democracy. In 1786, Thomas Jefferson \nwrote: I think by far, the most important bill in our whole code is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the \npeople. No other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom, and happiness. Generation after \ngeneration has worked to build on those ideals, including, as we do that work, more and more Americans in the \nprocess and creating a system that gives all students an opportunity to succeed. We need an Education Secretary \nwho is committed to upholding that principle, not rolling our progress back, and we should all be working together to \nensure that we have strong neighborhood public schools, not dismantling them. I join with my colleagues here today \nand the thousands from my State who have made their voices heard. We need just one more vote to defeat this \nnomination and to make clear that the Senate truly values our Nation's public schools. I surely hope that there is \nanother Senator willing to break with the President and vote against this woefully unqualified nominee. We all have \nlearned in this wonderful country of ours, with each generation, as we include more and more people who have \nbeen marginalized, left out, who weren't counted, that when we include them, we certainly honor their freedom and \ndignity--important and sufficient, of course, in its own right. Then when we do that, we also unleash the talent and \nenergy of everyone, and that strengthens us all, helps us thrive, helps our economy grow, and makes sure that \nAmerica not only leads but deserves to. It is our job in the Senate to listen to the thousands speaking up for our \nchildren and for the public education system that serves all Americans. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. \nDONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise today \nto speak about the nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. I am here not only to reiterate my concerns \nabout Mrs. DeVos but to share some of the letters and emails I have received from Hoosiers about her nomination. \nEvery Hoosier and every American deserves access to a quality education. It prepares our students to enter the \nworkforce, to secure good-paying jobs, and to succeed. As I have said, after reviewing the record of Mrs. DeVos, I \nbelieve she lacks the commitment to public education needed to effectively lead the Department of Education. I am \ndeeply concerned that she will not focus on priorities important to Hoosier families: expanding access to early \nchildhood education, improving our public schools, and addressing increasing student loan debt. Now I want to \nshare some of the concerns I have heard from people all across Indiana about Betsy DeVos. A current \nundergraduate student at Purdue wrote to me, urging me to vote against Betsy DeVos. The student wrote as \nfollows: I am concerned that she will cause major damage not only to our public K-12 schools, of which I graduated \nfrom, but also to federal student aid programs, which allow many of my fellow students and I to attend our nation's \nfantastic public universities. A mother of three children in Fishers wrote: I believe our democracy needs well-funded \nand accountable public schools for all. Mrs. DeVos demonstrates zero interest in supporting strong public \neducation. For the future of our children, our democracy, and our standing in the global economic system, I ask that \nyou vote against Mrs. DeVos. A soon-to-be college graduate who is pursuing a career in public education wrote: I \nwill be graduating from Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion. I have spent the past semester student teaching at \na local school district in Gas City, IN. One of the largest reasons that I wanted to embrace a career in public \neducation is to push students to see their potential, just as I had a teacher do the same for me. Teaching is not \nsimply facilitating learning, but rather it is taking the time to fully invest in the students. Getting to know their \nstudents, listening to what they have to say, and using the resources presented to best prepare students to \nsucceed. I have been able to see this firsthand and put this into practice as I have been in three different school \ndistricts throughout my time at Indiana Wesleyan University. . . . As a soon-to-be teacher in the state of Indiana, I \nask you to consider voting no for the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. I chose this path as it \ndirectly impacted me, and I want to see students find success. With the right reform, we can see this happen, but \nwith the suggested reforms of Betsy DeVos, we will not be able to help students succeed. Here's another story. \nThis one is from Muncie. As a mother and public education advocate, I am writing to request that you vote no to the \nappointment of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. As you are aware, there are many challenges facing \neducation in the United States. . . . Ms. DeVos' track record in the state of Michigan would be devastating to the \ncountry as a whole if she were to be given the position of Secretary of Education. For the sake of my children, their \ndedicated teachers and children across the nation, I respectfully request your ``no'' vote to her appointment. A \nwoman in Zionsville wrote as follows: I feel that the DeVos agenda plans a dangerous voucher program that robs \npublic schools of money and allows unprecedented support of K-12 programs with opaque standards, curriculum \nand accountability. In Indiana we have struggled with the skills gap and graduating students that are prepared for \n\n\n\nthe available workforce positions. . . . I beg you to speak out against the appointment of Ms. DeVos as Secretary of \nEducation. Hoosiers have the right to an educational system that strives for high standards, transparency, and \nsuccess, and I do not believe the DeVos model will be able to deliver on any front. [[Page S722]] A retired special \neducation teacher who taught in Mishawaka for 24 years wrote: I implore you to vote ``no'' on the confirmation of \nBetsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Her selection by Donald Trump was clearly an attempt to further dismantle \nthe public school system in the United States. The poor, the disadvantaged, and the disabled would suffer great \neducational setbacks with her as Secretary of Education. A woman in West Lafayette wrote: As a future special \neducation teacher, I find it horrifying that [Ms. DeVos] seems to be unaware of the IDEA Act, which protects the \nrights of millions of children with disabilities. It is completely unacceptable that our country should have someone in \ncharge of education who is unaware of this monumental law. Education is so important for the future of this country \nand everyone deserves equal opportunity to get a good education. . . . This is why I ask you to please vote no for \nDeVos. In a letter from Greenwood, a woman wrote: As a mother of two children, one with severe disabilities, \nplease know I do not support Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. I can only hope that you will bear with me as \nI offer the story of my son below. My son was born full-term and healthy. From 18 hours until two weeks old, he \nfought for his life. At two weeks old, a heart defect was discovered. Next was heart surgery, recovery, and he was \nhome at exactly one month old. Saying we were ill-prepared for the future would be an understatement, to say the \nleast. We had no way of knowing the repair to his heart would not also repair all the damage to his brain and body. \nHe was eventually gifted multiple diagnoses: cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease, significant mental and \nphysical disabilities and severe GERD. To match the diagnoses, he was also provided coordinating medical \nequipment: wheelchair, communication device, standing equipment, a special seating device, feeding pump, and \nleg braces. Skip ahead to today and you'll discover a 15-year-old doing his absolute best to find his place in this \nquick-paced world. It took a long time, but over the past 3 to 4 years, he mastered his communication device and \nhas shown he is capable of learning and understanding. While it took all this time for him to show us, it took the \nrelentless dedication of very special teachers to really make it happen. His teachers worked tirelessly to develop \nextremely specific Individualized Education Plans for him. I am certain without the Individuals with Disabilities Act \nand Free Appropriate Public Education, he would not have achieved his current level of learning. I also feel his \nteachers would not have been able to get him to this level without the right educational tools in our public schools. I \nwanted you to feel my emotions and how difficult his life truly is. Please don't make his education any harder than it \nalready has been. A former public schoolteacher in Indianapolis wrote: I watched all of Betsy DeVos's Senate \nconfirmation hearing. As the minutes churned by fear, fury, and grief built within me. I will not sit back and watch as \na nominee for Secretary of Education prepares to take the helm who does not commit to protecting children in \npublic schools. I hope you stand with me to firmly reject Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. We must commit \nour care, our love, and our attention to upholding the promise that all kids deserve a shot at success through \neducation. These kids are our future, and we owe it to them to lead wisely. Unfortunately, Ms. DeVos will not lead \nus to that future. A mom in Evansville wrote: I have one child in college and two others in public elementary \nschools. My children have received and are getting very good education in public school and are in advanced \nclasses. I am very concerned about the appointment of a woman who has been advocating against our public \nschool system for years. We must do better for our children. Please fight for our public schools and our children, \nand do everything in your power to keep Betsy DeVos from becoming our Secretary of Education. This is just a \nsmall sampling of the letters and emails I have received from Hoosiers all over our State who are deeply troubled \nand who are opposed to Betsy DeVos. They wrote to me not as Republicans, Democrats, or Independents but as \nconcerned Hoosiers, as moms and dads who love their kids. They are worried about an issue we should all be able \nto agree on: the importance of ensuring our children have access to a quality education. While I said I would vote \nagainst Betsy DeVos's nomination, I will continue to fight for our public schools, our teachers, and our students. I \nwill continue fighting for them because ensuring our students have access to good schools and good teachers lays \na foundation for our students to reach their potential, and it is fundamental to their success and in turn our \ncountry's success. We love our schools, we love our kids, and all we want is the best for them and an extraordinary \neducation. That is why I will be voting against Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. Mr. President, I yield the \nremainder of my postcloture debate time to Senator Schumer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New \nYork may accept 18 minutes. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HARRIS. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nominee for the \n\n\n\nDepartment of Education, Betsy DeVos. I cannot vote for her confirmation. The mission of the Department of \nEducation, as mentioned, ``is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by \nfostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.'' The Department achieves this by establishing policies \non Federal financial aid for education and distributing as well as monitoring those funds, collecting data on \nAmerica's schools and disseminating research, focusing national attention on key educational issues, prohibiting \ndiscrimination, and ensuring equal access to education. After considering that mission, I do not believe Betsy \nDeVos should be the next Secretary of Education. Surely we can agree that every child in the United States should \nhave access to a first-rate education to ensure a chance of a good job and good pay. I know this from my own life \nexperiences and, in particular, the impact that a good teacher can have on a young child. You see, my first grade \nteacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I would not be standing here \nwere it not for the education I received, and I know that to be true for so many of our colleagues in the Senate. After \nI reviewed Betsy DeVos's nomination, including her record and confirmation testimony, and after speaking with \nteachers and students and parents from across California, it is clear she does not understand the importance or \nthe impact of a public school teacher like Mrs. Frances Wilson. Why? Well, first and foremost, our country needs a \nSecretary of Education who has demonstrated basic competency when it comes to issues facing children. They just \nneed to know what they are talking about. When questioned in the hearing by my colleague Senator Franken, it was \nclear Mrs. DeVos didn't know the difference between two basic theories of testing: proficiency and growth. This, in \nfact, is one of the biggest debates occurring in the education community today, and she was unaware of the \nsignificance of the nuances and the difference between the two. As we know, proficiency essentially asks whether a \nstudent has a basic competency or understanding of a subject; looking at a child and asking: Is that third grader \nreading at third grade reading level? Growth. It is a question of whether a student is progressing from year to year \nor asking if a third grader who started their year reading at first grade level can now read at second grade level. Has \nthere been progress? This debate will define how we are judging schools across the country, and her lack of \nknowledge and fluency demonstrates her complete lack of experience, understanding, and curiosity about one of \nthe hottest issues in modern education. Now let's talk about guns in schools. At first, she at best showed \nambivalence toward gun-free school zones, but it gets better. She went on to say that she does not have any \nquestions, and that without any questions, she does not believe you need guns in schools. Then she went on to \nsay, well, but we need guns in schools, yes, because grizzly bears may pose a significant threat to the safety of our \nchildren and perhaps their education. I say Ms. DeVos poses a far greater threat to public education. Let's talk \nabout title IX. Another moment in her hearing is when the [[Page S723]] nominee refused to commit to actually \nenforcing title IX. Now, let's be clear that title IX was brought into being because our country had a rampant policy \nof discrimination against women in our education system. For example, women were not being admitted to the \nUniversity of Virginia. Even Luci Baines Johnson, the daughter of President Johnson, was barred admission to \nGeorgetown University after she got married because it was common perception at that point in time that if she was \nmarried, then that is what she should pursue. She should pursue a career in the home and could not be capable of \ndoing that as well as working outside the home. Title IX is a law that guarantees women and girls the right to a safe \neducation, free from discrimination. Let's be clear how title IX helps today. It is title IX that required universities to \nprioritize a safe environment for girls--safe from abuse and sexual assault. We know this is a real issue. In fact, the \nDepartment of Education estimates that one in five women has been sexually assaulted during her college years. \nAs attorney general of California, I was proud to bring together colleges and local law enforcement agencies to \ncreate protocols for investigating and prosecuting sexual assaults. It has helped schools and law enforcement \nimplement changes to California law to better protect survivors of sexual assault. I championed new methods to \nallow California to process rape kits and clear a longstanding backlog of rape kits in the State crime labs. I fought to \nensure that survivors have the support they need and that their attackers face swift accountability and \nconsequences for their crimes. There is no question that ending campus sexual assault should be a moral \nimperative for our country, and it should be a priority for the next Secretary of Education of the United States. For \nthat reason, it is unfortunate--and, yes, troubling--that Mrs. DeVos will not guarantee enforcement of title IX. Then \nlet's talk about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. I know my colleague Senator Hassan has \nspoken extensively about this. This act has been around for decades--four decades, to be exact. Before it existed, \nwe were not prioritizing these children. We did not give them the services they needed. We had written off a whole \npopulation of our children. When asked by my colleague Maggie Hassan about this piece of legislation, the \nnominee showed a complete lack of knowledge about how it is implemented. That is simply unacceptable. We \ncannot go back to a time when we wrote off a whole population of people, and it cannot only be the parents of those \n\n\n\nchildren--but all of us, as the adults of a society and a country--who look out for our most vulnerable children. Then, \nlet's talk about for-profit colleges, which I know something about since I had to sue one of the biggest for-profit \ncolleges, which was defrauding students as well as taxpayers. I know about the reality of abuses of for-profit \ncolleges, and I applaud my colleague Elizabeth Warren, who asked whether or how she would protect against \nwaste, fraud, and abuse at for-profit colleges. She asked this of the nominee, and it was troubling to see that the \nnominee was equivocal at best. Now, let's talk about the nominee's record as it relates to the children of her home \nState of Michigan. Since the growth of charter schools, Michigan has gone from performing higher than average on \nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress in the year 2000 to below average by the year 2015. A 2015 \nFederal review found an ``unreasonably high'' number of charters in Michigan which were among the bottom 5 \npercent of schools nationwide. According to a report from Chalkbeat, an education publication, when the Michigan \nlegislature attempted to add oversight for both charter schools and traditional public schools in Detroit, the \nnominee's family opposed the measures and poured $1.45 million in the legislature's campaign coffers--an average \nof $25,000 a day for 7 weeks. The oversight measures, she is happy to say, never made their way into the \nlegislation. We cannot have someone who wants to lead our highest Department of Education who does not \nsupport the importance of oversight, of making sure that the children are getting the benefit of their bargain. \nAccording to data released from the Michigan Association of Public School Academies in 2015, only 17 percent of \nDetroit charter school students were rated proficient in math, compared to 13 percent of students in traditional \npublic schools. Even Eli Broad, a great Californian and strong supporter of dramatic education reforms, has \nexpressed strong concerns about the nominee's nomination. That should tell us all something. Now let's talk about \nthe impact on California. During the campaign, President Trump said he would take $20 billion from existing Federal \neducation programs--which, by the way, is more than half of the Department's budget for K-12 education--and \ninstead put that money into a voucher-like system. The President also committed to getting rid of the Department of \nEducation in its entirety, which would put half a million teachers out of work. The nominee has committed to working \nwith him on these plans. Let's be clear. This plan would be devastating for public schools, including the schools in \nCalifornia that serve over 6 million students. This also means California students could lose $2.3 billion in Federal \neducation funding, which could end critical programs. For example, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nserves thousands of California's disabled students and serves them well. But his plan would slash $1.3 billion in \nFederal funding--money that our children rely on. The Trump proposal to cut the Department of Education budget \nwould also harm California's students. Some $3.8 million in Pell grants for California students could be lost, \n43,000 or more teacher positions in California could be eliminated, and $8.96 billion in student loans could be at \nrisk for California's college students. The bottom line is this--fewer teachers, fewer resources for students and \nparents, and less aid to make college affordable. Maybe one school will cut their after-school program or stop \nteaching the arts, or it doesn't have a guidance counselor or decides they will just let class size balloon because \nthey don't have enough teachers. We know that is not good enough for any of us. There is a clear connection \nbetween public education and public safety. When I was the district attorney of San Francisco, there was a rash of \nhomicides one year. All of us in a position of leadership were rightly concerned, and we did the predictable and the \nright thing: We figured out how to put more cops on the street, we looked at our gang intervention strategies, and \nwe figured out very predictable and good ways of reacting to these crimes after they occurred. But I asked a \nquestion. I asked a member of my staff: Do an assessment and tell me who are these homicide victims? In \nparticular, who are the homicide victims under the age of 25? The reason I asked that question is pretty simple. \nThere were just a lot of them. Sure enough, the data came back to me. It included the fact that, of the homicide \nvictims under the age of 25, 94 percent were high school dropouts. Over the years, I have taken a closer look at \nthis issue. I have learned that 82 percent of the prisoners in the United States are high school dropouts. I have \nlearned that an African American man who is a high school dropout between the age of 30 and 34 is two-thirds as \nlikely to be in jail, have been in jail, or dead. There is a direct connection between what we do or do not do in our \npublic education systems and the price we all pay in terms of our public safety. I say to everyone concerned: There \nare good reasons to care about the education of children. If nothing else, be concerned about why you have to \nhave three padlocks on your front door. If we don't educate our children in our public school system, we all pay the \nprice. Mrs. DeVos's agenda means fewer teachers and resources and worse schools. Fundamentally, her lack of \nunderstanding of the rights teachers have today, the rights parents have today, and the rights students have today \nmean one thing: She cannot--and will not--uphold the law if she does not understand the law. Her testimony has \nmade clear that she does not understand IDEA, she does not understand initiatives like gun-free zones in schools, \nand she does not understand the history or the need for title IX. [[Page S724]] If Betsy DeVos gets her way and cuts \n\n\n\nfunding for public schools, that means fewer teachers. If she does what she did in Michigan, that will mean poor \noutcomes with fewer high school graduates. What we know is that these are the kinds of policies that prevent us \nfrom actually achieving all that we know we can be as a country, which is about paying attention to all the members \nof our society, and, in particular, our children, and investing in them with the education they so richly deserve so \nthey can one day stand in this Chamber as a Member of the Senate, doing the best of what we know we can do as \na country. Simply put, I will say this. It is clear from her testimony that Betsy DeVos has not done her homework. \nShe hasn't done her homework in terms of preparing for the job, and she did not do her homework in terms of \npreparing for her hearing. I say that right now the Senate must do our job, we must do our homework, and we must \nrefuse to confirm her as the next Secretary of Education. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. BENNET. Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior \nassistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. \nBENNET. Mr. President, I wish to begin by congratulating our new Senator from California for her first speech in the \nChamber. I know it is not her first official speech, but she is here on this important night to talk about the state of \npublic education in this country and this confirmation process. So I thank her for her remarks. I also want to thank \nthe ranking member of the Education Committee of the Senate, Senator Murray from Washington State, who is \nhere tonight as well. I know she has been here all day today and was here all day on Friday as well, because the \nset of issues we are discussing are so important. As I sat here listening to the Senator from California, I was \nthinking about the work we have done recently on the committee on which we both serve--the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee-- with the leadership of Chairman Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, and \nRanking Member Senator Murray, from Washington State, to pass a new reauthorization of No Child Left Behind--a \nbill that if you said: Let's have a rally on the steps of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the same, not a single \nperson in the United States would have shown up for that rally. It took this body 7 years--7 years after we were \nsupposed to reauthorize No Child Left Behind--to actually do the work. But when we did the work, we were able to \nget it through the committee once unanimously. This committee has on it, among other people, Senator Bernie \nSanders from Vermont and Senator Rand Paul from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. They seldom agree on \nanything, but they agreed on that bill. We got it out of the committee almost unanimously, and then passed it on the \nfloor of the Senate with over 80 votes. It passed with a huge bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and it \nwas signed by the President. It was 7 years too late, but we were able to do it in a bipartisan way--which is what \neducation issues should always require. It is a shame that tonight we are here with a partisan divide because of the \nselection President Trump has made to lead the Department of Education. So I just want to say thank you again to \nSenator Murray for her leadership. Since our first days before we founded this country, education has been an \nAmerican value. In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, colonists recognized their collective responsibility \nto educate their children. They wrote into law that children, both wealthy and poor, must be taught to read and write, \nand to learn a skill, like blacksmithing, weaving, or shipbuilding, to secure their economic independence. As \ndemocracy took root in early America, public education became not just an ideal but an imperative. An enlightened \npublic, the Founders believed, was essential to self-government. Thomas Jefferson wrote that we must ``educate \nand inform the whole mass of the people. . . . They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.'' \nBenjamin Franklin believed: ``The good education of Youth has been esteemed by wise Men in all Ages, as the \nsurest Foundation of the Happiness both of private Families and of Common-wealths.'' With education, the common \nman would be able to select leaders wisely and fight back against the tyrannical instincts of those in power. He \nwould be able to understand, maintain, and protect his rights, so that government could not usurp authority and \ndevolve into despotism. In a country ``in which the measures of Government receive their impression so \nimmediately from the sense of the Community as in ours,'' George Washington explained, ``knowledge . . . is \nproportionally essential.'' This set of beliefs represented a fundamental break from the aristocratic ways of the old \nworld. A republic that was ``for the people'' and ``by the people'' required an educated people. With this new world \nalso came a new conviction that individuals could determine their own future, that their birth or circumstance no \nlonger limited their potential. This foundational idea grew to become the American dream: Every child, regardless of \nwho her parents are or where she came from, could achieve an education and grow up to achieve a better life. Over \ntime, as our Republic became more and more democratic, as the right to vote and lead was secured by African \nAmericans and women, education became the fundamental means by which Americans sought to secure their \nliberty and their equality. Perfecting our Union by expanding education has not come without struggle, but we have \noften succeeded because we have recognized that symbiotic relationship among the needs of our country and the \n\n\n\nsuccess of individual Americans and our aspiration to move forward. This included the need for a universally literate \nworkforce in the 1830s and the creation of Horace Mann's Common School Movement; the demand at the turn of \nthe 20th century to replace out-of-date Latin schools with progressive high schools that prepared students for the \nemerging industrial workforce; the challenge of providing World War II veterans with a career path and the creation \nof the GI bill for college education; and the need to tear down the barriers of Jim Crow school systems in the 1950s \nand 1960s. Too often, as a country, we confronted these challenges too late and at the tragic expense of our fellow \nAmerican's potential. ``With all deliberate speed'' has proven not fast enough, especially for children living in places \nlike the Mississippi Delta and South Central Los Angeles. At each of these turning points, we have asked for more \nfrom our public schools. To their credit, our educators--teachers, specialists, and principals--have risen to the \nchallenge, many times much sooner than the rest of us. They have helped us build a nation admired for our forward \nprogress, for opportunity, and for equality. That is the American ideal from our founding until today. I come to the \nfloor tonight with a sense of urgency because our generation is at risk of being the first American generation to \nleave less opportunity to our children than we inherited. If we do that, we will have broken a fundamental American \npromise to our children. In our Nation, education is supposed to be at the heart of opportunity, but today our \neducation system fails far too many kids. Schools that once were engines of opportunity and democracy are now \ntoo often traps for intergenerational poverty. As a result, only 3 out of 10 children born to very low-income families in \nthe United States will make it into the middle class or higher. Only 4 out of 100 will make it to the top 20 percent of \nincome earners. Already, the United States has less social mobility than at least 12 other developed countries--\namong them, Canada, Japan, and Germany. In America, children growing up in poverty here hear 30 million fewer \nwords than their more affluent peers by the time they reach kindergarten. In fourth grade, only one in four of our \nstudents in poverty is proficient in math, and fewer than that can read at [[Page S725]] grade level. As few as 9 will \nreceive a bachelor's degree by age 25. As a nation, we are falling behind the rest of the world. When George Bush, \nthe son, became President in 2000, we led the world in college graduates. Today we are 16th in the world. \nAmerican 15-year-olds score lower than their peers in 14 countries in reading, 36 countries in math, and 18 in \nscience. Much of the rest of the developed and developing world is figuring out how to produce more and more \neducated citizens, while the United States is standing still and therefore falling behind. We must refuse to accept \noutcomes that are a tragedy for our children, a threat to our economy, and an immeasurable risk to our democracy. \nTo make change, we need to stop treating America's children as if they belong to someone else. To meet our \nchildren's needs, we must invent a 21st century approach to education, a system for the delivery of free, high-\nquality education built for the future, not for the past. We must have the courage to shed old ways of thinking, \nabandon commitments to outdated approaches, and explore new ideas. This reenvisioned system must focus like a \nlaser on what is best for kids, not what is convenient for adults. It must be comprehensive and integrated from early \nchildhood to postsecondary education. A 21st century system of public education must set high expectations, \ndemand rigor, and create meaningful accountability. This system must embrace different kinds of schools and \ncreate a culture that is focused on continuously learning from each other--among traditional, charter, and innovation \nschools, and across districts, cities, and States. We need to change fundamentally how we prepare, recruit, place, \ntrain, retain, and pay teachers and school leaders. That entire system belongs to a labor market that discriminates \nagainst women and said you have two professional choices: one is being a teacher and one is being a nurse. So \nwhy don't you come teach Julius Caesar every year for 30 years of your life in the Denver Public Schools, where we \nare going to pay you a wage far lower than anybody else in your college class would accept. Those days are gone. \nWe had discrimination in the labor market that actually subsidized our school system because very often the \nbrightest students in their class--very often women--had no other career options and therefore were willing to \nteach. That whole system needs to be transformed in the 21st century. We have 1.5 million new teachers whom we \nhave to hire over the next 6 to 8 years in this country, and we have no theory about how to hire them or how to keep \nthem. Fifty percent of the people are leaving the profession now in the first 5 years. This new system of public \neducation should embrace technology and personalized learning. We must create space for innovation in school \nautonomy, and we must also provide choice to parents and kids, but our goal is not, and should not be, school \nchoice for choice's sake. For a youngster in a low-income family, there is no difference between being forced to \nattend a lousy school and being given the chance to choose among five lousy schools. That is no choice at all. It is \ncertainly not a meaningful one. The goal is, and must be, to offer high-quality education at every public school so \nparents can choose among grade schools in their neighborhood and throughout their cities and towns. We must \nrefuse to accept the false choice I have heard over and over again during this confirmation process that you either \nsupport school choice in whatever form or you defend the status quo, just as we must reject the idea that you \n\n\n\ncannot support public schools and advocate for change. This old rhetoric and manufactured political division will not \nwork for our kids. We need to rise above the narrow, small politics that consume our attention and permit and \nprevent us from making tough choices. Instead, we need to recognize that a 21st century education can and should \nlook very different than a 19th century education or a 20th century education, and no matter what approach or \nmethod of delivery, it must be high quality. The good news is, we know it is possible to reverse course and create \nmeaningful change. Several cities around the country have already begun creating roadmaps to this 21st century \napproach. Denver is one of them. In Denver, we made a deal--create a public choice system that authorizes \ncharters, creates innovation schools, and strengthens traditional schools. We empowered schools through \nautonomy and worked to create a culture of shared learning and innovation focused on all ships rising. We \ndemanded quality, and we implemented strong accountability. High-performing schools were rewarded, replicated, \nand expanded. Low-performing schools had to be improved or be shut down. We made tough decisions. We closed \nschools. I sat in living rooms, classrooms, and gymnasiums with parents urging them to demand more from the \nschool district, even if it meant that their child had to go to a different school. Along with concerned citizens, \nteachers, and principals, I went door-to-door to enroll kids in new schools. Denver created innovative teacher and \nschool leadership policies. We tried to rethink the tired model of the last century and create a new career for this \none. That is why today in Denver you will find teachers teaching other teachers and being paid for it, knowing that \ntheir job is not only to educate their students but also to improve the honorable craft of teaching so our kids can \nachieve even more. We used the levers of Federal law, strong accountability, and civil rights protections as the \nbackbone of change. We cannot have made the changes we did had it not been for the national demand for \nimprovement in our schools--the civil rights impulse that underlies the Federal involvement in public education, as \nwell as the courage of our community to demand something better for our children. Denver has begun to see the \nresults of hard work. Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools students' achievement growth increased faster \nthan the State's in both math and English. This outcome was achieved by students qualifying for free and reduced-\nprice lunch and also students not qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch. Latino and African-American \nstudents' achievement in English and math grew faster than their counterparts' throughout the State. Sixty-one \npercent more students graduated in 2016 than in 2006. We have a long way to go, but I would suspect that if we \ncould say of every urban school district in America that we are graduating 60 percent more students this year than \nwe were a decade ago, we would be feeling a lot better about where we are headed as a country. In Denver, over \nthat time, the overall ontime graduation rate increased almost 30 points, and the ontime graduation rate for Latino \nstudents has doubled since 2007. Since 2006, Denver Public Schools' enrollment has increased--many cities have \nlost enrollment--over 25 percent, making it the fastest growing urban school district in America, partly because \nDenver has grown but also because parents and kids and families have now found schools that are responsive to \ntheir families' needs and supportive of their children. I am the first to say, and I always will be the first to say, that \nwe still have a lot of work to do to make sure the ZIP Code Denver's children are born into doesn't determine the \neducation they receive. But cities like Denver are moving in the right direction. Now we need to move a nation in the \nright direction. Tonight, as we stand here in this marbled Chamber among these statues that tie us to our past, I am \nthinking of our future. I am thinking of the millions of poor children across time zones our Founders could not have \nimagined, heading home after a long day at school, shifting their backpacks of books to find a comfortable spot, \nsharpening pencils for math and pastels for art, clearing a space on a busy dinner table for homework. I am thinking \nabout children teaching other children, older brothers and sisters teaching their younger siblings, expecting that \nthey will have more opportunity than their parents. I am remembering the naturalization ceremony I attended just \nlast Friday at Dunn Elementary School in Fort Collins, CO, where Kara Roth's fifth grade class welcomed 26 new \nAmericans from 13 countries to the United States. I am thinking about [[Page S726]] teachers and principals and \nstudents--while we are here speaking--who are up tonight, planning for tomorrow, and hoping for a future that \nallows them to review at home before they teach tomorrow the best lessons for teaching the productive and \ndestructive forces of volcanoes, what Scout learns in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' or the mathematical reasoning that \ncalls on us to invert the second fraction when we divide. I am imagining a country that fulfills our generational \nresponsibility by providing quality early childhood education to every American family who wants it--a K-12 school \nfor every child to which every Senator would be proud to send his or her child or grandchild and access to college \nand skills training that prepare students for economic success without shackling them to a lifetime of debt. All of \nthat leads me to comment briefly on President Trump's nomination for Education Secretary. I have no doubt that \nMrs. DeVos sincerely cares about children. It is not her fault that President Trump nominated her. So let me be \nclear that I am addressing the President and not Mrs. DeVos when I say that this nomination is an insult to school \n\n\n\nchildren and their families, to teachers and principals, and to communities fighting to improve their public schools all \nacross this country. Even with the limited questioning allowed at the education committee hearing, it quickly \nbecame clear that Mrs. DeVos lacks the experience and the understanding to be an effective Secretary of \nEducation. The bipartisan progress of American education achieved over the last 15 years was predicated on a \ndeep commitment to three principles: transparency, accountability and equity. Mrs. DeVos's testimony and public \nrecord failed to establish her commitment or competence to protect any of these foundational principles. Her ``let a \nthousand flowers bloom'' approach asks American school children to take a huge step backward to a world without \nthe high expectations and transparency that we need to give parents and taxpayers the information they deserve on \nhow our schools are performing. Those high expectations, paired with the clear commitment to accountability, \nensure that our successful schools should be replicated and our struggling schools should be held accountable for \nimprovement, regardless of whether it is a choice school or a district school. Finally, we know that the Secretary of \nEducation holds the sacred job of ensuring that every child in America gets the resources and the support they \ndeserve, regardless of their income, background, or educational needs. This commitment to equity is at the core of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Mrs. DeVos has shown no evidence of her commitment to be the \ntorch bearer for both excellence and equity. Her ideology and dogmatic approach communicates a lack of \nunderstanding and appreciation of the challenges we face and the depths of solutions they demand. A commitment \nto choice without a commitment to quality serves ideology rather than improvement, and a commitment to \ncompetition without a commitment to equity would forsake our democratic ideal that a free, high quality public \neducation must open the doors of opportunity for all. For the first generation of students to whom that promise feels \nelusive, they deserve an Education Secretary who has the courage, competence, and commitment to orient our \nmighty education system to build opportunity for all. Mrs. DeVos shows none of those skills, and our young people \ncannot afford to wait 4 years for their chance at the American dream. Millions of Americans recognize this, which is \nwhy this nomination has generated more controversy than any other. I look forward to working with anyone--as I \nhave over the years, including even Mrs. DeVos--anyone interested in improving our children's opportunities and \ntaking seriously the future of our democracy. But I will not support her nomination. I will vote no on this nomination \nand urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the course of this debate, over the last 9 \nhours, plus 6 hours on Friday of the 30 hours that we have on this, many Senators have come to the floor to talk \nabout their concerns about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education. There are open questions \nabout her extensive financial entanglements. There are open questions and a clear concern about her lack of \nunderstanding of basic education issues. We have heard that time and again, as well as the many ways in which \nher vision for our education system is really at odds with where families and communities nationwide want us to go. \nBut let me take just a moment to focus on one major concern in particular. It is a public health threat that I know is \ndeeply concerning for families and communities across this country, and that is the epidemic of sexual violence on \nour college campuses. One out of five women and 1 out of 71 men are sexually assaulted while in college. In 2013 \nalone, college campuses reported 5,000 forcible sex offenses, and a recent study indicated that number could be \nmuch greater. There should be no question that sexual violence on our campuses is a great, widespread, and \nunacceptable problem--one that I expect any incoming Secretary of Education to be informed about, to be \nconcerned about, and committed unequivocally to confronting head-on. Much of the discussion so far has been \nabout the commitment of a Secretary of Education to our K-12 system. Serious concerns have been raised, but it is \nimportant to know in this debate that the Secretary of Education also has responsibility over our higher education \ninstitutions. In our hearing, Betsy DeVos actually agreed with me that President Trump's horrifically offensive leaked \ncomments from 2005 describe sexual assault. She was clear. But I was deeply disappointed, to say the least, in \nMrs. DeVos's responses to simple questions about whether she would seek to continue the Obama administration's \nwork to protect students and stand with survivors. When she was asked whether she would uphold the guidance \nissued under the Obama administration to hold schools accountable for stronger, more effective investigations of \nsexual assault, she wouldn't commit to that. She would not commit to that. When I asked her whether she would \ncontinue key transparency measures, like weekly public reports on active investigations into potentially mishandled \nsexual assault cases, she dodged the question. These answers are especially concerning given that Mrs. DeVos \nhas gone so far as to donate to an organization dedicated to rolling back efforts to better support survivors and \nincrease accountability. Let me tell you that again. Mrs. DeVos has gone so far as to donate to an organization \n\n\n\ndedicated to rolling back efforts to better support survivors and increased accountability. Let's be clear. The \nepidemic of sexual assaults on our college campuses means that in States across the country, students' basic \nhuman rights are being violated. I am deeply proud to see the work that has been done on this issue over the last \nfew years. Survivors have bravely stepped up to make clear they expect far better from their schools and their \ncommunities. By speaking out, by being courageous and speaking out, they have shown other survivors they are \nnot alone. Key university leaders have made fighting campus sexual assault a top priority by developing new \npartnerships in their communities and prioritizing prevention. New measures to increase transparency and \nawareness went into effect in 2013 thanks to the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. These are \nhard-won steps forward on an issue where some Democrats and Republicans have finally been able to find \ncommon ground. There is much more to do. The next Department of Education should not be standing on the \nsidelines, much less taking us backward on an issue that is so critical to student safety on campus. [[Page S727]] \nSo I hope that as my colleagues are listening to the debate here today, tonight, and tomorrow, that they consider \nwhat Mrs. DeVos's leadership at the Department of Education means on this issue, the issue of making sure men \nand women on our college campuses can go there to learn and not be worried about being a victim of sexual \nassault and having nowhere to turn and not have the confidence that their voices will be taken seriously. On \nanother area, nominees for Secretary of Education have largely been people, over the past, who were very \ncommitted to our students, who had long careers dedicated to education, and who were focused on keeping public \neducation strong for all of our students and for all of our communities. Public education is a core principle that our \ncountry was founded on, that no matter who you are, where you come from, or how much money you have, this \ncountry is going to make sure all young people get an education. That is how our country has been strong in the \npast. That is how our country has to be in the future. Free public education. Well, Betsy DeVos is a very different \nnominee. She has spent her career and her fortune rigging the system to privatize and defund public education, \nwhich will hurt students in communities across our country. She is not personally connected to public school--\nexcept, by the way, through her work over the years trying to tear them down. She has committed herself for \ndecades to an extreme ideological goal to push students out of our public schools and weaken public education. I \ncan talk at length about Betsy DeVos's record of failure and her devastating impact on students, but all people \nreally need to do is watch her hearing in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Just go back and \nwatch the hearing. This was a hearing that people across the country heard about--and for good reason--from local \nnewspapers, to local news, to ``The Daily Show,'' to ``The View,'' and posts that went viral on social media. A lot of \npeople in our country heard Betsy DeVos for the first time in that hearing. They were not impressed. She refused to \nrule out slashing investments in our public schools. She was confused that Federal law provides protections for \nstudents with disabilities. She did not understand the basic issues in education policy or the debate surrounding \nwhether students should be measured based on their proficiency or their growth. She argued, as we have all \nheard, that guns needed to be allowed in schools across the country to ``protect from grizzlies.'' Even though she \nwas willing to say that President Trumps's behavior toward women should be considered sexual assault, as I just \ntalked about, she would not commit to actually enforcing Federal law protecting women and girls in our schools. Her \nhearing, quite frankly, was a disaster. It was so clear to millions of families how little she really understood about \neducation issues. I have to tell you, as a former preschool teacher myself and a former school board member, \nsomeone who got my start in politics fighting for strong public schools, as a Senator committed to standing strong \nfor public education in America, as a mother and a grandmother who really cares deeply about the future of our \nstudents and our schools, I know that we can and we must do better for our children and our students and our \nparents and our teachers. The decision we are making here on whether to confirm Betsy DeVos for Education \nSecretary will help set the course for our public education system for years to come. So I hope, again, that our \ncolleagues are listening to this debate and thinking about it and not just voting rotely on this. This is so important. \nQuite frankly, I am disappointed that our Republican colleagues have moved us so fast into this debate. I have been \nin the Senate a long time. I know what the usual practices are when we go through hearings and listen to nominees \nfrom Presidents who are Republican and Democrat, Republican majorities and Democratic majorities. I was here \nwhen the Senate was 50-50. There are practices we have to make sure that all Senators get the information they \nneed so they can make a wise decision with their vote for which they will be held accountable. Quite frankly, the \nusual practices here were really being ignored. The right thing to do was being ignored. This nominee was jammed \nthrough like I have seen none other. Corners were being cut. The minority was being brushed aside. I really think \nthat is wrong. Earlier this month, Republicans on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee scheduled \nMrs. DeVos's hearing even though she had not yet finished her standard ethics paperwork and even though she \n\n\n\nhad not and still, by the way, has not answered my questions about her financial disclosures to our committee. In \nfact, when we started the hearing, the Republican chairman, the senior Senator from Tennessee, whom I have \nworked with greatly--we worked together to pass the replacement of No Child Left Behind. I have a tremendous \namount of respect for him. But I was shocked and surprised when he preemptively declared that he would be \nlimiting questions for each Senator to just 5 minutes--a shocking and disappointing breach of committee tradition, \nclearly intended to limit public scrutiny. Mrs. DeVos is a billionaire. She has extraordinarily complicated and opaque \nfinances, both in her own holdings and those in her immediate family. We know that she has invested in education \ncompanies, for- profit companies, for decades. Over 100 conflicts were identified. Her ethics paperwork raises \nquestions about the company in which she plans to remain invested. She still, by the way, has not fully answered \nmy questions about her committee paperwork. As I told the Republican chairman at our markup, the process that \nhas taken place on Mrs. DeVos's nomination is a massive break in the tradition of this body. We should not have \nhad a vote in this committee until all Senators had received appropriate responses to reasonable questions and \nuntil a second hearing was held so that Senators could get these serious concerns addressed and do their job \nscrutinizing the nominee. Understand, we had a hearing. We were limited to 5 minutes each. And we did not have \nall of the paperwork, so we could not do our homework to make sure we were asking the questions we needed that \nneeded to have a public debate. So, again, that is another reason I am deeply concerned about this nominee. We \ndo not yet know whether there are conflicts of interest. For a Secretary of Education who wields tremendous power \nover our K- 12 system and our higher education system--as we all know, there have been tremendous questions \nover the past decade about access to higher education; whether you go to college and get the degree you have \nbeen promised; whether institutes have been responsible and accountable; and how we as the Senate and House \ncan come together to make sure that when a student takes out a student loan or invests in a higher education \ninstitution, they know they are getting their money's worth and if there are taxpayer dollars involved, that the \ntaxpayers are getting their money's worth as well. So conflicts of interest are extremely important to this nominee. \nTo this point right now, here we are voting tomorrow, and we don't have the answers to those questions. So these \nare just a few things. I have been out here on the floor to talk about them. We have heard from many of our other \ncolleagues. It is no surprise to me that this has lit a firestorm across the country. Having a Secretary of Education, \nsomeone who is responsible for our children's education--schools are the center of our community. Community \nmembers own those schools in their minds. This is where they send their kids to school, where they have basketball \ngames, music concerts. It is where the community comes together. Yes, we all complain about public education. \nWho hasn't? But at the end of day, we love our local schools, and we want them to know that the Secretary of \nEducation--the highest person in the land to oversee them--has that love, too, and is there because they want to \nmake them better, not because they want to tear them down. So, yes, this nominee has taken off like no other \nbecause of her hearing, because of her conflicts, because she has attacked and gone after basic public education, \nwhich so many people [[Page S728]] are proud of in their own communities and want to make better. So I, like \neverybody else, have heard from many of my constituents, more than I can ever remember in my entire Senate \ncareer. This has ignited a public storm. I want to share some stories from my constituents who have reached out \nand urged me to vote against Betsy DeVos because they know better than anybody why their school is so important \nto them, why their teachers are so important to them, why their children's public education is so important to them. \nOne of the major concerns I have continued to hear from my constituents about is her disconnect from the working \nclass. A woman from Marysville, WA, said: Betsy DeVos, a billionaire herself, does not represent the working class \nand certainly not her family experience with public education. Betsy DeVos never attended public school or even \nsent her own children to public school. In Olympia in my State, an employee at a high-poverty public school says \nshe works with some of the most in-need children in the area. She is very concerned that Betsy DeVos's push \ntoward a privatized public school system would only benefit those in wealthy communities and leave her most \nvulnerable students behind. She believes Betsy DeVos would absolutely not look out for their best interests. In our \nrural communities, there is no private school to get that voucher and send your kids to. The policies she is pushing \nonly mean that those schools will have taxpayer dollars taken away from them to send to other kids with vouchers \nto go to private schools, who live nearby or have the additional resources to use those vouchers to go to school. A \nteacher in Seattle wrote to me with a story that I can't get out of my head. It really inspires me to keep going in this \nfight. This teacher serves preschoolers with special needs who face a number of challenges. She teaches at a title I \nschool, where most families are low income, and many of them are immigrants and non-native English speakers. \nShe believes that her children deserve access to the best educators out there and that if DeVos's agenda was put \nin place--a system of privatized public education--her students would be failed, because without strong public \n\n\n\nschools, we would fail students who are low income or living with disabilities or impacted by trauma or who belong \nto racial or ethnic minorities. She says Betsy DeVos does not have her students' best interests in mind, and her \nstudents deserve the best, as I believe all of our students do, no matter their financial status, their race, their \nreligion, or any other difference they might have from their peers. A mother in North Bend wrote to me expressing \nher worry that vouchers only benefit the wealthy, leaving the middle class and poor without the benefit of a good \neducation. Being part of a middle-class family herself, she is proud that her first grader is already mastering addition \nand subtraction and is reading and writing sentences all because of her local public school. My constituent in \nAuburn said that money and ZIP Code should not determine who gets a better education, and she said that Betsy \nDeVos's worrisome policies would make that the case. She is strongly urging me to reject a nominee who doesn't \nlook out for those who are the most in need. A man in Kelso wrote in, saying that the public school system is what \nensures we all get a good education. It is what gives so many parents hope that their child can have an even better \nlife than they had, that public education is a great equalizer for everyone to have a chance to succeed, and I \ncouldn't agree more. Those are just a few of the letters I have gotten from people who are worried that the \nnominee's push for taking public tax dollars and using them for private schools and for-profit schools only, robbing \nour public schools of the resources they need, will not be the right choice for public education. I wanted to share a \nfew other letters from my constituents who wrote to me regarding Betsy DeVos's nomination. One of them was from \nSeattle. She emphasized how important it is that our Secretary of Education be dedicated to providing a quality \neducation to all students and to strengthening our public education institutions. She strongly believes that Betsy \nDeVos will not be that kind of Secretary. A retired teacher in Federal Way asked me to work as hard as I can to \nprotect public education because she believes every child's right to a free and quality public education is at risk with \nBetsy DeVos's nomination. Many constituents expressed their disbelief that the nominee for Secretary of Education \nhas absolutely no experience in public education. Her children never even attended a public school. One, a teacher \nin Bellingham, is fearful of an Education Secretary who doesn't truly understand what the needs of kids look like \ntoday. She asked how someone with no experience can be expected to lead our country's education system. A \nwoman in Puyallup wrote to me, saying that education is the greatest gift we can give to our children, and she \nthinks that confirming Betsy DeVos, with her plans to weaken public education, will rob so many children of that gift. \nMr. President, those are just a few of the letters I am getting. There are many more, and later this evening, I will be \nreading from some of those letters because they tell the story better than I do. I know some of our colleagues are \nwondering why this woman set off such a firestorm when her nomination came up and why so many people are \ncalling and writing and rallying and letting their voices be heard. It is not easy to rally the public. This came from \nwithin. This came from many people in this country who understand, as so many of us do, that public education and \nthe right to an education, free--free education is critical and fundamental and a core philosophy of this country that \nall of us want to be successful and want to be great again. To have a Secretary of Education who doesn't agree \nwith that, who in fact promotes the exact opposite, who has said that our public education system is a dead end, \nwho has proposed, promoted, and paid for campaigns to take public tax dollars to send to private, for-profit schools, \nthat is not what our country was built on. It is not the foundation that our forefathers put out in front of us. They said: \nWe are going to build a system unlike any other, where no matter who you are or where you come from or how \nmuch money you have or what you look like, in this country, we are going to make sure you get an education, a free \neducation, paid for by all of us, to go to school in your community and to be who you want to be. That is a dream of \nthis country, and we will not stand by and give our votes to a Secretary of Education who does not share that \nphilosophy. That is why there is a firestorm. That is why parents and teachers and students and grandparents and \ncommunity leaders and superintendents from across the country are writing us and asking us to vote no. It is not \ntoo late. If we have one more Republican who votes no, then we will be able to say to the President: Mr. President, \nwe reject this nominee, and we ask that you send us one who will work with all of us to make sure our public \neducation system is a core principle of this country, is valued by this country, and is pursued by the top person in \nthe Department of Education, our Secretary of Education. It is not too late. With that, I have many more letters that I \nwill be reading later. I know some of our other colleagues will be over here. Again, I ask everyone to stop and think. \nThis is a critical nomination. It has hit a chord in our country because people do care. They want our country to be \nstrong. They want this country to be great, and they know our public education system is an absolutely critical part \nof that. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. \nGardner). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Presiding Officer. [[Page S729]] Mr. President, I rise \n\n\n\nthis evening in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be our next Secretary of Education. This is one of \nthe most important jobs in our government. The Department of Education bears responsibility for making sure that \nevery child in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential, which means that the Secretary of Education \nhas an enormous amount of power to shape our Nation's future. This is not a job for amateurs. President Obama's \nfirst Secretary of Education was Arne Duncan, who had spent 7\\1/2\\ years building a record of accomplishment as \nCEO of Chicago's public school system, previous to which he had been director of a mentoring program and the \nfounder of a charter school. When Secretary Duncan stepped down, he was replaced by Dr. John King, Jr., the \nrecipient of a doctorate in education administrative practice. He had served as Deputy Secretary under Arne \nDuncan and was previously the education commissioner for the State of New York. Each brought to the job a \nbackground in public education that informed their understanding of what students, parents, teachers, and \nadministrators need in order to succeed, which brings me to Betsy DeVos. There are reasons to be skeptical about \nMrs. DeVos's nomination right off the bat. As my Republican colleague, Senator Collins of Maine, put it: ``The \nmission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core.'' Well, in Mrs. \nDeVos, President Trump sent us a nominee with no experience in public education. Mrs. DeVos has never been a \npublic school superintendent or a public school principal or a public schoolteacher. She has never attended a public \nschool. She has never sent a child to a public school. Mrs. DeVos has no formal background in education, no \nclassroom experience, and no demonstrated commitment to supporting public education whatsoever. In fact, Mrs. \nDeVos has a long history of actively undermining public education. She and her family have spent millions of dollars \nadvocating for an ideology that would steal funds from public schools in order to fund private and religious \neducation. Let's take a moment to talk about what that means. Mrs. DeVos ran a political action committee called \n``All Children Matter,'' which spent millions in campaign contributions to promote the use of taxpayer dollars for \nschool vouchers. The argument was that these vouchers would allow low-income students to leave the public \nschool system and attend the private or religious school of their family's choice. Mrs. DeVos has described this as \n``school choice,'' claiming that it would give parents a chance to choose the best school for their children, but that is \nnot how it works. In reality, most school vouchers don't cover the whole cost of private school tuition, nor do they \ncover additional expenses like transportation, school uniforms, and other supplies, which means the vouchers don't \ncreate more choices for low-income families; they simply subsidize existing choices for families who could already \nafford to pay for private school. As it happens, we have a real-life test case that we can look at to determine \nwhether Mrs. DeVos's argument holds water. Mrs. DeVos heads up a voucher program in the State of Indiana, and \nguess what happened. Today, more than half of the students in the Hoosier State who received vouchers never \nactually attended Indiana public schools in the first place, which means that their families were already in a position \nto pay for private school. Indeed, vouchers are going to families earning as much as $150,000 a year. I am sure \nthese families appreciated the extra help, but as of 2015, nearly half of Indiana's children relied on free and \nreduced-price lunch programs. These are the kids Mrs. DeVos claims would be helped by school vouchers; instead, \ntaxpayer dollars were taken away from public schools that remain the only choice for these low-income families and \ngiven to families who could already afford private school, who were already sending their kids to private school. \nThat is the reality of school vouchers. That is why after Mrs. DeVos developed a similar proposal for a voucher \nprogram in Pennsylvania and an analysis projected that, just like in Indiana, the vouchers would mostly benefit kids \nalready enrolled in private schools, voters rejected it on multiple occasions. Yet Mrs. DeVos and her family \ncontinued their fight for school vouchers. In fact, she has been such a fervent advocate that her political action \ncommittee, ``All Children Matter,'' received the largest fine for violating election law in Ohio's State history--a $5.3 \nmillion fine that nearly a decade later she still hasn't paid. Why do this? The evidence is clear that Mrs. DeVos's \nvoucher obsession doesn't help low-income families. Quite to the contrary, it represents a serious threat to the \npublic school system--a system that as many as 90 percent of the children rely on--but Mrs. DeVos describes as \n``a dead end.'' The truth is that Mrs. DeVos's education advocacy isn't really about education at all. She describes \nher goal as follows: to advance God's kingdom. Now many families choose to send their children to religious \nschools, and many children receive an excellent education at religious schools, but it is the public school system \nthat the Secretary of Education is supposed to focus on, and that is not the part that Mrs. DeVos and her family \nhave put at the forefront of her advocacy. Mrs. DeVos spent a decade serving on the board of the Acton Institute, \nwhich seeks to infuse religion in public life, beginning with public education. She and her family have devoted \nmillions to promote the institute's work, including promoting ideas like this: We must use the doctrine of religious \nliberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know there is no \nreligious neutrality, no neutral law, no neutral education, and no neutral civil government. Then they will get busy in \n\n\n\nconstructing a Bible-based social, political, and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the \nenemies of God. Those are the words of Gary North, a Christian Dominionist for whom the Acton Institute serves as \na forum. Of course, not everyone who believes in the potential of parochial schools shares his view, but this is the \nkind of stuff Mrs. DeVos and her family have spent millions and millions of dollars promoting. It is fine for someone \nto hold strong religious views and to advocate for those views and to spend their family fortune encouraging others \nto adopt, but it is entirely fair to ask whether the mission of building a Bible-based social, political, and religious \norder is compatible with the mission of the Department of Education. So, yes, based on Mrs. DeVos's radical \nideology, I was skeptical when her nomination was sent to the Senate, but I understand that others in this body may \nnot have shared my discomfort. Within this Chamber we have important differences when it comes to education \npolicy and, for that matter, the appropriateness of using taxpayer funds to advance God's Kingdom. And do you \nknow what? That is fine. But we all have the exact same responsibility when it comes to vetting the President's \nCabinet nominees. Each of us is called upon to determine not just whether we agree with the nominee's ideology \nbut whether that nominee is free from relevant conflicts of interest and, critically, whether the nominee is competent, \nwhether he or she is capable of doing the job. Making that call is our job, and that is why we have the process that \nwe have. It is why we ask to see the nominee's financial information. It is why we ask them to submit written \nanswers to questionnaires about their experience and their record. And it is why we have them come to the Senate \nto sit in front of committees and to answer our questions. Unfortunately, during her hearing, Mrs. DeVos proved \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt not only that her ideology is fundamentally incompatible with the mission of the \nDepartment of Education but that she is fundamentally incompetent to be its leader. Throughout the hearing, she \nwas unable to answer basic questions about her views on important issues, she was unfamiliar with basic concepts \nof education policy, and she was unwilling to make basic commitments to continue the Department's work on behalf \nof our most vulnerable children. Let me give you one example of what I mean. During my 5 minutes of questioning, I \nasked Mrs. DeVos to weigh in [[Page S730]] on the debate about measuring growth versus measuring proficiency. I \nam going to take a few moments right now to make sure that everyone here and everyone watching at home \nunderstands what this debate is about and just how central it is to the future of education policy. The difference \nbetween the two approaches, proficiency and growth, is very easy to explain. Let's say a fifth grade teacher has a \nstudent who comes into the classroom reading at a second grade level. Over the course of the school year, the \nteacher brings the student up to a fourth grade level. If we are measuring growth, we would say: Well, that teacher \nbrought that student up two grade levels in 1 year. That teacher is a hero. If we are measuring for proficiency, we \nwould say: Well, that student is still reading below grade level. That teacher is a failure. That is the difference \nbetween measuring growth and measuring proficiency. It took me all of 30 seconds to explain that, but I could \nspend all night talking about what this debate means for students, teachers, school leaders, and our entire \neducation system. Everyone agrees that there should be accountability in our education system--accountability for \nschool systems, schools, teachers. We want to know we are getting results. That was the core idea behind all the \nstandardized testing in No Child Left Behind. The problem was that No Child Left Behind set up a system in which \nwe assessed student learning by measuring proficiency and only proficiency. As the law was implemented, all sorts \nof problems emerged from taking this approach. For example, teachers in Minnesota would tell me how measuring \nproficiency would lead to what they called ``a race to the middle.'' See, measuring proficiency only measures \nwhether or not students are performing at grade level--at this line of proficiency, at grade level--and a teacher is \nmeasured by what percentage of her students or his students are above proficiency or at proficiency. A teacher \ndoes not get credit for helping kids who were already well above grade level to perform better, and they don't get \ncredit for helping kids who are way below grade level start to catch up. So we had this race to the middle because it \nis a yes-or-no question: Did this student achieve proficiency or not? A teacher's entire career could depend on how \nmany of his or her students met that arbitrary goal. So under this system, understand this, please. A teacher had a \nstrong incentive to ignore all of the students at the top who were already going to meet proficiency. No matter what \nyou did to that kid, that kid was going to beat proficiency in the No Child Left Behind test at the end of the year. \nThey had a strong incentive to ignore all the kids at the bottom because, no matter what you did, that student \nwouldn't reach proficiency. The only thing--or one of the only things--I liked about No Child Left Behind was the \nname. And we were leaving behind the kids at the top and the kids at the bottom because of the insistence on \nproficiency. I can't overstate how central this issue is to education, and I can't tell my colleagues how important it is \nto educators across America. If you talk to any State education secretary, any district superintendent, any local \nschool board member, any principal, any classroom teacher-- and, heck, parents--they will have an opinion on \nmeasuring growth versus measuring proficiency. So when Mrs. DeVos came before the HELP Committee, I asked \n\n\n\nfor her opinion on this very basic--this extremely basic--extremely important question, and she had no idea what I \nwas talking about. Let me be clear. She wasn't reluctant to declare her opinion. She wasn't trying to strike a middle \nground. She did not know what I was talking about. We would not accept a Secretary of Defense who couldn't \nname the branches of the military. We would not accept a Secretary of State who couldn't identify Europe on a \nmap. We would not accept a Treasury Secretary who doesn't understand multiplication. In fact, in nearly any \ncircumstance, if a candidate for a job is asked a question that basic and that important and simply whiffs on it the \nway that Mrs. DeVos did, there is no second question. There is just a thank you for your time, and we will let you \nknow, and will you please send in the next candidate. Earlier this year, the University of Minnesota hired a new \nhead football coach. I wasn't there for the interview. But imagine if the first question for a candidate for football \ncoach of your university was as follows: How many yards does it take to get a first down? And imagine if the \ncandidate answers as follows: Thank you for your question, Mr. Athletic Director; I can pledge to you that I will work \nvery hard to get as many first downs as possible to make sure, we hope, that we lead the team to touchdowns. This \nwasn't the question. The question was this: How many yards does it take to get a first down? Well, thank you again \nfor the question. I can tell you this: I will look forward to working with you to prevent the other team from getting first \ndowns also. Understand, that is how basic my question to Mrs. DeVos was, and that is how shocking it was that she \nsimply didn't know enough about education policy to answer it. This inexplicable failure alone was enough for me to \nconclude that Mrs. DeVos lacked the knowledge and understanding that should be a bare minimum for anyone \nseeking the position. But the entire hearing--the entire hearing--was a showcase for her lack of qualifications. I \nwould urge any of my colleagues who haven't had a chance to watch it. I urge you to do so before casting a vote for \nthis nominee. It was one of the most embarrassing scenes I have witnessed during my time in the Senate. In fact, I \nbelieve it may have been one of the most embarrassing performances by a nominee in the history of the Senate. \nAsked about the right of children with disabilities to get a quality public education, she didn't know that this right is \nprotected by a Federal law--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Asked about guns in schools, she \nsuggested that maybe guns should be kept on hand in case grizzly bears attacked. This was in answer to a \nquestion from Senator Murphy, who in Congress represents Sandy Hook and who, as a Senator, represents those \nparents. That was her answer to him. Asked about whether she would hold private parochial schools that get \ntaxpayer funding to the same standard of accountability as public schools, she couldn't or wouldn't say. Asked \nabout a family foundation that has donated millions of dollars to an organization promoting conversion therapy for \nLGBT youth, she claimed she had no involvement, which is ridiculous. Even if Mrs. DeVos's own role as vice \npresident of that foundation was a 13-year clerical error, as she now claims, she herself has donated approximately \n$75,000 to support that anti-LGBT organization's work. Now, understand that none of these were difficult questions. \nNone of these were gotchas. All of these failures took place during a single 5- minute-per-Senator round of \nquestioning, because after that first round, the hearing was cut off and our chairman refused to allow any further \nquestions. By the way, I would like to say a word about that move to cut off questioning. I have great respect for the \nchairman of the HELP Committee, Lamar Alexander. We have worked together, and he worked with Senator \nMurray on the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, changing it to ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act. I \nrespect the chairman tremendously. But his decision to end that hearing was wrong, and his rationale was simply \nfalse. Our chairman insisted that because Secretary Duncan and Secretary King had been subject to only a single \nround of questions, there was a precedent to deny the minority a second round of questioning of Mrs. DeVos. That \nsimply isn't so. First of all, as I discussed earlier, both Ernie Duncan and John King were experienced education \nprofessionals with long records of public service. Even if Republican Members had occasion to disagree with them \non policy matters, there was no question that their backgrounds had prepared them for the job of Secretary of \nEducation, and that is the bigger point here. There were no further questions. In both cases, committee members \nweren't denied the opportunity for a second [[Page S731]] round of questioning. They simply chose not to engage in \none. Indeed, when I asked the Congressional Research Service, they confirmed that those hearings did not \nestablish the precedent that our chairman claimed. Instead of allowing us to question Mrs. DeVos further, the \nchairman invited us to submit additional questions in writing, presumably so that she could get some help from her \nTrump administration handlers in answering them. Even so, her written responses only served to further expose her \nown lack of understanding of how education policy affects Americans. For example, I asked Mrs. DeVos in writing \nabout the effects of trauma and adverse childhood experiences on education. This is a subject I have been \ninterested in for a long time. A lot of kids in our country live in extreme poverty. Some may have a parent in prison \nor a parent who has passed away. These kids may also experience physical abuse or emotional abuse or neglect. \nThere may be some drug or alcohol abuse taking place in the house. Some have witnessed domestic violence in \n\n\n\ntheir home or street violence in their neighborhood. Some have seen siblings shot and killed right in front of them. \nDecades of research have shown that the trauma that comes from such adverse childhood experiences actually \nchanges a child's brain chemistry and affects their behavioral development, their mental and physical health, and \ntheir chances to succeed in school and in society longterm. But research has also shown that these challenges can \nbe overcome and that the kids who do overcome them are the most resilient kids you have ever met. Our public \neducation system was designed to give these kids a shot. Teachers and administrators often lack the resources \nthey need to give these children the chance they deserve. Because Mrs. DeVos's crusade for school vouchers \nwould further rob our public schools of these limited funds, I wanted to know her thoughts on this important issue. \nThis is take-home. Her written answer was brief and superficial. She wrote that she had heard that children are \nimpacted by trauma and that trauma can cause difficulties in a child's education. That was it. Was she unfamiliar \nwith the literature? Was she unwilling to acknowledge that poor kids face special challenges? Would she be \nremotely interested in addressing these challenges as Secretary of Education? I guess we may never know. I also \nasked Mrs. DeVos in writing about her vision for education in rural communities. As the Presiding Officer knows--\nthe Governor and now Senator from South Dakota--many of our children in America attend school in rural America, \n10 million American kids, schools that struggle with teacher shortages and transportation challenges. I asked how \nwould her school choice agenda help them. In her response, she pointed to online schools, which are often run by \nfor-profit companies, many with questionable records. In fact, one of the country's biggest online schools recently \nagreed to a $168.5 million settlement in California for allegedly defrauding families--a $168.5 million settlement. But \neven online schools that aren't out to rip off students often wind up failing them. A 2015 Stanford study showed \nthat, on average, kids in online schools lose the equivalent of 72 days of learning in reading and 180 days of \nlearning in math, and that is for each 180-day school year, which means that kids in online schools can fall up to a \nyear behind in math. Of course, as the Presiding Officer knows, many rural communities lack reliable broadband \naccess. I have been on rural education tours where I find students who go to a McDonald's parking lot so they can \nget WiFi to read their public school assignment or get materials to study. This is another answer that wasn't an \nanswer at all, yet another piece of evidence that Mrs. DeVos is simply not up to this job. Like many Americans, I \nhave serious concerns about many aspects of the Trump administration's agenda. Still, I believe that as a United \nStates Senator, it is my job to evaluate each nominee on his or her own merits. That is why I voted for nominees \nlike Secretary Mattis and Secretary Chao, even though I disagree with them on important issues. General Mattis, for \nexample, has nearly a half century of military service under his belt, he has earned the respect of leaders on both \nsides of the aisle, and I believe he will be a much needed voice of reason on the Trump administration's foreign \npolicy. Ms. Chao has a lengthy background in public service, including as Secretary of Labor and Deputy Secretary \nof Transportation. I believe she will bring significant and valuable experience to her important role. I may well take \nissue with the decisions they make and the agenda they implement as members of President Trump's Cabinet, but \nat the very least, each illustrated during their confirmation hearings that they have a basic understanding of the \nissues they will be responsible for. Mrs. DeVos is different. I have heard from Minnesotans about many of President \nTrump's nominees, but the outcry over this nomination far surpasses anything else. As of a week ago, my office \nhad received 3,000 calls about this nominee. A grand total of 12 were in favor of her confirmation. Additionally, we \nreceived more than 18,000 letters and emails, and again the overwhelming majority of them have urged me to \noppose this nomination. For example, a woman from Brainerd, MN, wrote to say that she never contacted one of \nher representatives before and didn't consider herself very political--in fact, she was neither a Democrat nor a \nRepublican, but she has a daughter in second grade and a son beginning kindergarten in the fall, and she wanted \nme to vote against Betsy DeVos. ``How,'' she asked, ``is someone who has never had any experience in public \neducation supposed to competently preside over it?'' A mother of two public school students in Faribault, MN, \nwrote of Mrs. DeVos: ``As I watched her during the hearing, I was in disbelief that she would be appointed to such \nan important position.'' Another constituent from Warren, MN, wrote: ``This woman is so unqualified, it's scary.'' Last \nweek, I went to dinner with Vice President Walter Mondale at his favorite restaurant. Afterward, he took me into the \nkitchen to greet some of the men and women who worked at the restaurant. One of the guys in the kitchen--I am a \nlittle unclear of whether he was taking dishes to the dishwasher or he was washing dishes. He is not a teacher, he \nis not an education advocate, just a guy who works in the kitchen. He said: ``Please vote against DeVos.'' There is \na reason why this nomination has been met with such overwhelming resistance on the part of the American people, \nand I know I am not the only one who has heard it. In fact, two of my Republican colleagues and fellow HELP \nCommittee members who sat through that hearing, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, have stepped forward \nto announce they cannot vote for this nominee. They don't agree with me on every aspect of education policy, but, \n\n\n\nbelieve me, when we put ESSA-- Every Student Succeeds Act--together, the committee voted unanimously. There \nis a lot of agreement on education policy on our committee, but Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski saw the \nsame hearing I did. Like me, they saw a nominee who simply does not understand the needs of the students our \nSecretary of Education is supposed to serve. I will let my colleagues speak for themselves as to the reasons why \nthey will be joining me in voting against this nominee, but I would like to close by asking a few questions of my \ncolleagues who are still considering a vote in her favor. If Mrs. DeVos's performance didn't convince you that she \nlacks the qualifications for this job, what would have had to have happened in that hearing in order to convince you? \nIf you cannot bring yourself to vote against this nominee, is there anyone President Trump could nominate for any \nposition that you could vote against? If we cannot set party loyalty aside long enough to perform the essential duty \nof vetting the President's nominees, what are we even doing here? The Constitution gives us the power to reject \nCabinet nominations specifically so we can prevent fundamentally ill-equipped nominees like Betsy DeVos from \nassuming positions of power for which they are not qualified. Let's do our job. For the sake of our children, let's do \nour job. Mr. President, I yield the floor. [[Page S732]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. \nMr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to add a few Rhode Island voices to the voice of the Senator from \nMinnesota. By the way, I am not cherry-picking my correspondence to find the rare letters in opposition to this \nnominee. We have had an unprecedented avalanche of opposition to this nominee. It is running well more than 100 \nto 1 against her, and it is people from all walks of life. Here is a letter from William, a 12th grader in Pawtucket, RI. \nWilliam took the trouble to write to me. Let me start with the topic line: ``Concern over Betsy DeVos.'' Hello, Senator \nWhitehouse! My name is William and I am a senior at Blackstone Academy Charter School, a public charter school \nin Pawtucket, Rhode Island. I am contacting you today due to my concern about educational equality, specifically \nBetsy DeVos' ability to commit to practices that ensure that the children who need the most help aren't forgotten \nabout and brushed under the rug. These children are our kids of color, as well as our low-income kids attending \nurban public schools with limited resources. Having attended a Pawtucket public school, I can confidently say that \nthere are some genuinely brilliant minds here in this very city, in the areas where somebody like Mrs. DeVos would \nleast expect. Yet it also cannot be denied that the students here begin their journey on ground that is unequal to \nthat of other kids who are not people of color, or are not part of the public school system, etc. These bright young \nsaplings are being crushed before they are given the chance to blossom, and that is a systemic problem that \nDeVos, given her various shortcomings, will only serve to perpetuate and make worse. DeVos, given her support of \nthe privatization of public schools and her open disdain towards the LGBTQIA community, has established that she \nwill not improve the experiences of marginalized communities. Her interest is not the betterment of education for \npeople, but the monetization of education to put money in her pockets and the pockets of people like her. DeVos \nwill never spearhead movements that promote equity in education and will continuously disappoint us all throughout \nher term which will not be defined by deviating from the status quo and creating a system that our troubled but \ngifted youth can thrive in. In fact, she will do the opposite. With this in mind I ask that you, Senator Whitehouse, \nopenly speak out against Betsy DeVos, and do everything in your power to keep her out of the Secretary of \nEducation office. I also ask that you continue to remember me and children like me; public school youth who could \nbe incredible if they are just given the opportunity to thrive. Thank you for your time! William. Now let's hear from \nDa-naijah, a 10th grader from Central Falls, RI. Dear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, My name is Da-naijah Gibbs, \nand I am in 10th grade at Blackstone Academy School which is a public charter school. I live in Central Falls, RI. I'm \nwriting today because I'm concerned about kids being able to afford college, regardless of background. I care about \nthis because I have plenty of family members and friends who go to public school, and they either want or are \ntrying to go to college. I know they will need help with paying for college because they don't come from a very \nwealthy background. Fair and equal education is so important to me because I think everyone should be treated \nfairly regardless of how they look because we are humans. I am concerned about Betsy DeVos being nominated for \nSecretary of Education because she doesn't have any experience with classrooms. Also because she basically \ndoesn't like public schools since she is trying to make public school private and is trying to take resources away \nfrom public schools. With that being said, I hope that you do everything you can to help the kids in public school get \nequal education and fair education as much as private schools do. Please read my email when you can and I would \nlike to thank you for your time. Sincerely, Da-Naijah Next is Sara. She also lives in the city of Central Falls. I am \nwriting today because I'm concerned about the education in the public schools in my city. The students in Central \nFalls are not given the education they deserve in the environment of Central Falls as of schools in other districts. \nThis is important to me because my younger brother is a disabled boy, and it worries me that he won't continue to \nget the education he deserves. I'm very concerned about the nominee Betsy DeVos because she has 0 experience \n\n\n\nin the role of Secretary of Education and there are videos on almost any social media as well as YouTube to prove \nit and it clearly shows she has no experience and will put our education, or I'll say ``future'' at risk. Please Senator I \nhope you can do everything you can to prevent her nomination. . . . Thank you! Sincerely, Sara The last one I will \nread is from Jennyfer, 10th grade at Blackstone Academy Charter School, from Pawtucket. I'm writing today \nbecause I'm concerned about students in public schools not receiving the same and fair education students in \ncharter and private schools have. I care about students in public schools because I want every student to have the \nprivilege of receiving fair and equal education as I have the chance too. Fair and equal education is so important to \nme because I'm a Latina and a woman of color, I deserve the same equal and fair education as every other \nindividual. I want my siblings who go to a public school to receive the same education and resources I get. I am \nconcerned about Betsy DeVos [that she] will take that privilege away from students in public schools. I hope you \ndo everything you can to prevent Betsy DeVos from taking this privilege away from students in public schools. \nThank you for your time! There are more letters that I could read, but one point I would like to make is that these are \nstudents writing from charter schools. In the flood of opposition from Rhode Island that we have seen to this \nnominee, it has included teachers, managers, and students in charter schools. There has been a notion developed \nthat this is a battle between public schools and charter schools and that public schools aren't good, but they want to \ntrap children in them; that charter schools are the way out; and that Mrs. DeVos will lead us off into that charter \nschool happy land. The fact is, it is not that simple. We have great charter schools in Rhode Island, and we have \nsome great public schools in Rhode Island. We have both. The charter school leaders are opposed to her \nnomination. Why is that? It is in part because the transition from charter to public schools can be done fairly or it \ncan be done unfairly. In all of her work, Mrs. DeVos has shown that she would do it unfairly. There is an obvious--\nwhat demographers would call--selection bias between the kids who turn up in a charter school that they have to \nselect to go into and the kids who are still in the public school that is left behind. The selection bias is based on all \nsorts of different reasons. It could be as simple as they have more engaged parents. The parents are interested \nenough in their education to take the trouble to sign them up for the charter school, and that creates a slightly \ndifferent demographic than the ones who are left behind. It helps the charter school population, and it makes it \neasier for the charter school. Charter schools have authority that public schools don't have with respect to \ndiscipline; indeed, the ability to remove children and return them to the public schools. They are able to force \nstudents to sign contracts and agreements regarding their behavior. Public schools can't do that. Again, that \nconfers an advantage on the charter school that a public school doesn't have. Children with disabilities often get \nimmense support through the public school system. When they try to go to the charter school, they see that the \nsupports for the children with disabilities aren't there, and so it doesn't make sense to move to a charter school. The \ncharter schools tend to get a smaller population of children with disabilities. They don't have that additional expense \nof dealing with and meeting a child wherever their abilities and disabilities are. The public school keeps that \nexpense. In Rhode Island, we have people flooding into Providence. We teach kids who speak something like 70 \noriginal languages in our Providence public schools. A new immigrant is going to go to the public school. That is \nwhere they go. It is going to take them time to get settled and to learn about America and to pick up enough \nlanguage to understand that a charter school exists, to make the choice to move their child there, and by the time \nthey do, fine, if they make the choice. But, again, the public school had to be there for them; again, it is an \nadvantage to the charter school. It is all great for charter schools, but the idea that they are outperforming public \nschools and there is no recognition of that selection bias is just unfair to the public schools. It gets worse when you \nmove from the selection bias on students to the funding because the way it often works and the way it works in \nRhode Island is that the money follows the student. If you are [[Page S733]] in the public school and you are \nselected for a charter school, then a certain stipend of money goes with you to support that charter school. The \nproblem is that as that money gets taken out of the public schools' budget, the costs in the public school didn't \nfollow you to the charter school. The money followed you to the charter school, but many of the costs remained. If \none child leaves a public school classroom and goes to a charter school, you still have to turn the lights on, you still \nhave to hire the teacher, you still have to heat the building, you have maybe one less pencil and one less piece of \npaper in the room, but those are tiny costs. The fixed costs remain. That is a very serious threat to public schools. \nAnybody who truly supports the charter school movement, as our charter schools do, has to understand, first, the \nselection bias problem and understand that the testing and accountability has to be fair between public and charter \nschools and, second, this funding problem--that if you are simply pulling the money out of the public schools into \ncharter schools and the costs are staying behind, what you are doing is crashing the revenues but leaving the \nexpenses of public schools. The public school students are going to suffer from that. If you don't adjust for it, you \n\n\n\nare being unfair to the public schools, and you are being unfair to the students. This is a serious enough problem \nthat our Providence City Council is debating the issue right now and, as students move to charter schools, trying \nto figure out: How do you provide adequate funding so you are not stripping the public schools of what they need to \ncontinue to teach the other students? Not only are they serious about trying to figure out this budget equation at \nthe city council level, but Moody's, the service that looks at municipal budgets and determines how sound they are \nand rates municipalities, has looked at this problem of charter school movement and the remaining costs in public \nschools and identified it as a fiscal threat to municipalities. These are both real problems, and the refusal of Mrs. \nDeVos to grapple with them suggests to our charter school leaders and to me that this is not just an effort to \nenhance students in being able to go to a good charter school; this is actually an attack on public schools. There \nare all sorts of reasons somebody might want to knock down public schools. One is that they simply don't like \nteachers unions. Teachers unions tend to vote Democratic, let's face it. If you want to cripple teachers unions, \ndestroy the schools they work in. That is a really nasty reason to get into this charter school fight, but it is real, and it \nis out there. A second is, if you want to bring for-profit investment into this space, a lot of money gets spent on \neducation. People who could figure out how to make money in this space want to get their noses in and to get a \nchunk of that money. When they come in, they may or may not do a good job, but they are highly profit motivated. If \nyou are interested in trying to facilitate them and to give them a money making opportunity, then you may well want \nto damage public schools in order to support their move to for-profits. This creates a fairly significant problem when \nyou connect it to the next piece of Mrs. DeVos's application. That is conflict of interest. One of the basic elements \nthat we are here to look at in our advice and consent process is conflict of interest. Will the nominee be able to do a \nfair job? Will she be looking at things fair and square or will she have conflicts of interest that impede the fair \nexercise of her judgment? One place that we need to look for conflict of interest is when we have nominees who \nhave run political dark money operations. This is a new thing for us. Not too long ago we swore in a new President-- \nPresident Barack Obama. When we did, we had ethics rules, government ethics offices, filing requirements, and all \nof that in place. That was 2008. Then came the Citizens United decision--one of the worst decisions that five \nJustices on the Supreme Court have ever made, and it opened up the floodgates of dark money. This nominee is a \npractitioner of the dark arts of dark money. We know nothing about what she has done, but the conflicts of interest \nought to be pretty obvious. If you raised millions of dollars from people in your dark money operation, then there is \nan indebtedness there that somebody might think could be an appearance of impropriety or conflict. We should \nknow so that evaluation can be made. Or if you spent dark money in support of certain things, we should know so \nthat we can connect the dots and evaluate the linkages and see whether it is a conflict of interest. We wrote to Mrs. \nDeVos about this. The first letter was January 5, 2017. We got an answer, and the answer was spectacularly \nincomplete and unhelpful. So we wrote a second letter on January 27. I wish to take a minute and read this letter \nbecause I think it explains our predicament. Elisabeth DeVos Trump-Pence Transition Team Pennsylvania Avenue, \nNW Washington, DC Dear Mrs. DeVos, Thank you for your response of January 17, 2017, to our January 5, 2017 \nletter-- Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter at the end of my \nremarks. Thank you for your response of January 17, 2017, to our January 5, 2017 letter requesting additional \ninformation on your vast political fundraising and spending network. Along with various responses and objections to \nour request, you produced a series of already public campaign finance reports related to the American Federation \nfor Children Action Fund, a 527 organization, and its various State affiliates. For the reasons that follow, we view \nyour response as, while sizable, nonresponsive. We requested you provide information about two 501(c)(4) \norganizations with which you have been associated: the American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes \nEducation Fund. You acknowledged your association with these entities in your disclosures to the Office of \nGovernment Ethics (OGE). You also acknowledged in your letter to us that ``[e]ach organization with which [you] \nhave been involved is independent.'' It is not clear what you mean by ``independent'' since you have already \nacknowledged your association with these organizations. I hope you can appreciate how both fundraising and \nspending of these organizations (from whom? to whom? in what amounts? your personal role?) might produce \nconflicts of interests in potential decisions if you are confirmed to serve as Secretary of the Department of \nEducation. Our concerns are not hypothetical as known contributors to your political organizations have had \nbusiness before Department of Education. For example: Vahan Gureghian: In 2010, Gureghian donated $100,000 \nto the American Federation for Children Action Fund. Mr. Gureghian founded and is the CEO of CSMI LLC, a \nPennsylvania charter school management company and helped found the Chester Community Charter School. He \nhas been a major donor in promoting charter schools in Pennsylvania. I will interrupt reading the letter for a moment \nto point out how obvious it is that somebody involved in the charter school movement could very easily have \n\n\n\nbusiness before the Department of Education. Who knows how much he gave? We know of about $100,000, but it \ncould be a lot more. He knows. She knows, but the public won't know. When bids or competitions are up, that is \nsimply not fair. On to the next one and back to the text of the letter: J.C. Huizenga: Between 2005 and 2007, \nHuizenga donated $25,000 to All Children Matter, and in 2010 he donated $30,000 to the American Federation for \nChildren Action Fund. Mr. Huizenga founded the National Heritage Academies, a for- profit charter network that has \n80 schools in 9 States and has received over $43 million in federal funding. According to a 2012 review by the \nMichigan Department of Education of the schools in the ``focus'' category, due to significant gaps in achievement, \nmore than half were managed by National Heritage Academies. It has been reported that Mr. Huizenga said that his \ninvolvement with charter schools was due to realizing that ``privatizing public education was not only practical but \nalso desperately needed.'' Again, to step back out from the letter, here is somebody who is in the for-profit charter \nschool business, whose charter schools are more than half of the troubled charter schools reviewed by the \nMichigan Department of Education and who wants to privatize public education. He is linked with her through the \ndark money operation. We don't know anything about the dark money side. David L. Brennan: Brennan donated a \ntotal of $200,000 to All Children Matter from 2004 to 2007, prior to AMC's wind down due to campaign finance \nviolations. This is a series of campaign violations, finance violations, that led to the $5 million fine that neither the \nentity nor Mrs. DeVos have ever paid. [[Page S734]] In 2010, he donated $39,000 to the American Federation for \nChildren Action Fund. He is the founder of White Hat Management LLC, a for-profit charter school management \ncompany that operates 15 schools in three states with over 12,000 students. Since 2008, Whitehat and its affiliates \nhave received $3.6 million in federal funds including IDEA funds. How are we ever going to know if people like this--\nwho are making big, dark money contributions into the dark money operation that she runs--will not be rewarded in \na pay-to-play fashion with grants and favors and an advantage in competition at the Department of Education? You \nwould ordinarily evaluate that by knowing that the conflict of interest existed. But because it is dark money, we will \nnever know. They will know. She will know, but the public will never know. The Senate will never know. The press \nwill never know. While you may not have a direct financial interest in the for-profit education enterprises headed by \nthose listed above, your political fundraising relationship with them, and perhaps others, could cause a reasonable \nperson concern over your impartiality in matters involving them. Let me step out of the letter again. Doesn't that \nmake sense? If you were applying for a grant before the Department of Education and your competitor was \nsomebody who had given $1 million to Mrs. DeVos's Action Fund, wouldn't you want to know that? Don't you think \nthe public should know that? If you were to find out later that had taken place, and they were awarded the grant and \nyou were not, wouldn't that rankle you a bit? Wouldn't that suggest to you that perhaps we are not being treated \nfairly because of that big contribution that was made? But we will never know. We are disabled from doing our \nconstitutional job of reviewing these nominees for conflict of interest when it is dark money that is at stake. The \nOGE process does not capture conflicts that arise through political activity. . . . This is the first transition of \nPresidents since the Citizens United decision. This is the first one; so there is no history. We have to do it now, but \nwe are not--not for this nominee, not for other nominees. We are leaving a black hole of secrecy around this \nenormous conflict of interest potential. The OGE process does not capture conflicts that arise through political \nactivity so it is incumbent upon us to assure the Senate record is complete as to such conflicts and how they will be \nresolved. These are just the publically known examples of potential conflicts. Our original request asked you for \ninformation to assess potential conflicts with 501(c)(4) organizations that are not required to publicly disclose donor \ninformation. Accordingly, we reiterate our request that you provide: A list of all donors, their total donations, and \naffiliations, who have contributed to the American Federation for Children 501(c)(4), and the Great Lakes Fund \n501(c)(4) since their inception. A list of donations made by you, members of your family, and foundations or \norganizations with which you are affiliated, to other 501(c)(4) organizations over the past five years. That seems like \na perfectly reasonable request. According to the American Federation for Children's IRS Form 990 filed for the year \n2014, it spent nearly $1.1 million on political activities, including a $315,000 transfer to the American Federation for \nChildren Action Fund, Wisconsin IE Committee. I think most people here know how this works, but to make it clear \nfor people listening, many political organizations require that the donors be disclosed. So if you want to engage in \nthe dark money game and hide your political influence-seeking, what you do is you take your money and you give it \nto a 501(c)(4), a dark money operation. Then they in turn give it to the political action group. That is what happened \nhere. $1.1 million into the American Federation for Children, $315,000 transferred to the American Federation for \nChildren Action Fund in Wisconsin. The only function that provides is to launder the identity of who the donor was. \nSo that all you see is the money emerging from the dark money organization, with no transparency as to who put it \nin. Because donations to a 501(c)(4) are anonymous, they effectively launder the identities of donors to the other \n\n\n\nparts of the political apparatus. But you know, and the donors know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of \ninterest. Additionally, you refused to disclose donations to 501(c)(4) organizations that you, your family and your \nfoundation have made. You explained, ``(t)he information request requested has no bearing on the office to which I \nhave been nominated nor the duties of the Department of Education.'' That was her answer to the first letter. Our \nletter here continues: Your donations to 501(c)(4) organizations are indeed relevant to your nomination, just as your \ndonations to political candidates, parties and causes are. One obvious instance would be where groups to which \nyou have made political contributions are before the Department as advocates or grant seekers. Again, you know \nand the donors know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of interest. Senators have a Constitutional duty to \nprovide advice and consent on Presidential nominees, and understanding the scope and nature of potential \nconflicts of interest is at the heart of that duty. I do hope that we can agree on that in this Body: That part of our \nadvice and consent role is to understand the potential for conflicts of interest. If we can't agree on that, then we \nhave a real problem here, because that is the purpose or at least one purpose of what we do. Your role in raising \nand distributing ``dark money'' clearly raises the possibility of such conflicts. As a result, we renew our request for \ninformation related to your 501(c)(4) organizations as outlined above. Please contact us if you have any questions \nregarding this request. We look forward to your additional information and disclosures and timely and responsive \nanswers. Well, as of today, what we have is no answer at all--no answer at all. This is a recurring problem here. \nThis business of dark money not being caught by the rather obsolete, in that respect, government ethics reporting \nconventions that have been carried forward from the Obama transition before all of this became a problem doesn't \njust apply to Mrs. DeVos. Secretary of State Tillerson, as CEO of ExxonMobil, ran a massive dark money operation. \nExxonMobil has money all over front groups that deny climate change, all over political groups to try to discourage \naction on climate change, and a lot of it is dark money. There has been reporting that traces it back to Exxon, but \nwe never know how much because it is dark money, and Mr. Tillerson hasn't told us one thing about it in his \nhearing. We will be considering shortly the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the EPA Administrator. Scott Pruitt ran a \ndark money operation as the attorney general of Oklahoma. Why would an attorney general want to run a dark \nmoney operation in the first place? That is a whole separate question--but he did. It was called the Rule of Law \nDefense Fund, and what it did was it took in money, prevented the donors from having their identities revealed, and \nthen funneled the money publicly to the Republican Attorneys General Association. It was an identity laundering \nmachine for the Republican Attorneys General Association for big donors who didn't want anybody to know who the \nsource was of the money that was being funneled into the Republican Attorneys General Association. That is fine, I \nguess. I would like to be rid of all of it. We should pass the DISCLOSE Act and clean this mess up. But for sure, \nwhen somebody who has run a dark money operation comes before the Senate seeking to be nominated to a \nCabinet office, we hold a constitutional duty to protect that office from improper conflicts of interest. Surely, then, \ntheir role in the dark money operation should be disclosed. It only makes sense. But, no, like Mrs. DeVos, absolute \nstonewall on any information related to the Rule of Law Defense Fund and Mr. Pruitt's dark money operation, a \nblack hole of secrecy and enormous opportunity for conflict, because obviously, given his background and given \nwhere the rest of his fundraising went, you can draw a reasonable conclusion about where the dark money came \nfrom: Devon Energy, ExxonMobil, American Petroleum Institute, Murray Coal--the usual suspects. That is where a \nlot of his other money came from. You have to believe it went here. But do we know that? No. He could have taken \n$1 million from one of those groups and then, as EPA Administrator, be ruling on an application of theirs and we \nwould not know. Please don't anyone tell me that is not a potential conflict of interest. I mean, we can deal with \nalternate facts around here, but that is just crazy. We don't know about Mrs. DeVos's dark money. We don't know \nabout Tillerson's dark money. We don't know about Pruitt's dark money. It is as if [[Page S735]] there has been an \nunderstanding--some secret handshake around here-- that nobody will allow dark money information into the \nnomination process. That is just wrong. That is just wrong. It infects this nomination of Mrs. DeVos. We have to get \nanswers to these questions. Let me move on to one other point: student college debt. I had a meeting recently. I \nthink all of us had the same experience. From our home States, groups come to visit us and to get our time and to \nbring our attention to problems that concern them. I think we all get visits from the same groups. We get visits from \nour community bankers from our home States. We get visits from our credit unions in our home States. We get \nvisits from the automobile dealers in our home States. We get visits from the insurance brokers in our home States. \nWe get visits from the Realtors in our home States. When the Realtors of Rhode Island came in to visit me the last \ntime, they raised a new issue that I had not heard before from them. The issue that they raised was this: You know, \nwe are starting to have a real problem financing houses for the next generation of home buyers, the young home \nbuyers who are coming into the market and who would ordinarily be buying their starter homes. The problem we are \n\n\n\nfinding with them is that they are so loaded up with college debt that we can't finance the purchase of a home for \nthem. That is how enormous the student loan debt problem is in this country. It is now preventing so many young \npeople from buying a home that the Realtors have noticed and put it on their problem list as something for us to \ntake action on. If the Realtors have noticed this, I don't think it is asking too much for a nominee for Secretary of \nEducation to have noticed this. If, in fact, she has noticed this, I don't think it is asking too much for her to have \nthoughts and a plan, because we are well over $1 trillion in debt for these kids. I think it is about $1.3 trillion now. It \nhas been a known problem for some time. Over and over again, Democrats have tried to find and propose \nsolutions here in the Senate. Over and over again, we have been shot down. But it remains a very considerable \nissue. You would think that a new Secretary of Education coming in would want to hit the ground running on this \nissue. She would have something she wanted to get done to solve it. There would be a plan or an outline. We may \nnot agree with it, it may be something that we have to work together to find a way to get it to the floor, but at least \nthere would be a starting point. All I got was, well, I would be interested in your views on that issue. How is it \npossible that with over $1 trillion in student debt piled up, with the student debt problem so severe that even \nRealtors have put it on their to-do list to get something done about it, that a nominee for the Secretary of Education \nhas nothing? Pockets out. Nothing to get started on this problem. Is she ever going to take an interest? I don't \nknow. But it would seem to me, particularly when you look at where we are in the HELP Committee--our ranking \nmember, Senator Murray, is here. Senator Murray and Chairman Alexander helped lead us together through the \nESSA, the reform of No Child Left Behind, the Every Student Succeeds Act. It passed roaring through the Senate. \nThe House even picked it up and took it. It came out of committee unanimously. States are still working on \nimplementation of it because it freed them up to do a lot more things, and so they have to go through the process of \ndeciding how they are going to take advantage of its new freedoms. So with respect to elementary and secondary \neducation, we are actually in pretty good shape. All we have to do is implement the bipartisan popular law that we \npassed. So where is the attention going to be? Well, what we have not passed is the Higher Education Reform Act. \nSo if you know at all that has been going on in education in the Congress, which is not asking too much of a \nSecretary of Education nominee, you know that we have just implemented a major reform of elementary and \nsecondary education, that our next order of business is higher education, and that an elemental part of that is going \nto be college debt. So the fact that this nominee has nothing on that issue and is in the traditional deer-in-the-\nheadlights-nominee mode of, well, I look forward to working with you on that Senator. Oh, yes, I understand that is \na serious problem, Senator, but actually I don't have any ideas; I don't have any plans; I don't have any strategy; I \nhave nothing. Let's just work together on it. That is not very convincing to me. I see the Senator from New Jersey \nhere. The night is going on, so I will yield the floor to him, but I will close by saying that this recurring question about \nnominees who are involved in dark money operations and then refuse to disclose anything about their dark money \noperations so that it remains a black hole of secrecy and potential conflict of interest is wrong. It is just wrong. I \nknow there are forces in this building that love the dark money, and there are huge special interests behind the dark \nmoney. There are a lot of people who benefit from the dark money who don't want any light on it ever. But once a \nnominee has had their name put in for a Cabinet position of the Government of the United States, by God, they \nought to disclose their dark money connections because otherwise it is an avenue toward conflict of interest. Where \nthere is conflict of interest, there comes scandal. It is our job to head that off by getting the information before the \npublic so everybody can evaluate it, and we have been knee-capped in that effort by an absolutely positive \nshutdown from the other side of the aisle on any information about any dark money from any nominee. They don't \nhave to be nominees. If they don't want to cough up their dark money information, they can turn the papers back in \nand tell President Trump: Find someone else. I would rather keep my secrets. But you should not keep your secrets \nand get the job. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: January \n27, 2017. Elisabeth DeVos, Trump-Pence Transition Team, Washington, DC. Dear Mrs. DeVos, Thank you for your \nresponse of January 17, 2017, to our January 5, 2017 letter requesting additional information on your vast political \nfundraising and spending network. Along with various responses and objections to our request, you produced a \nseries of already public campaign finance reports related to the American Federation for Children Action Fund, a \n527 organization, and its various state affiliates. For the reasons that follow, we view your response as, while \nsizeable, non-responsive. We requested you provide information about two 501(c)(4) organizations with which you \nhave been associated: the American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes Education Fund. You \nacknowledged your association with these entities in your disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). \nYou also acknowledged in your letter to us that ``[e]ach organization with which [you] have been involved is \nindependent.'' It is not clear what you mean by ``independent'' since you have already acknowledged your \n\n\n\nassociation with these organizations. I hope you can appreciate how both fundraising and spending of these \norganizations (from whom? to whom? in what amounts? your personal role?) might produce conflicts of interest in \npotential decisions before you if you are confirmed to serve as Secretary of the Department of Education. Our \nconcerns are not hypothetical as known contributors to your political organizations have had business before \nDepartment of Education. For example: Vahan Gureghian: In 2010, Gureghian donated $100,000 to the American \nFederation for Children Action Fund. Mr. Gureghian founded and is the CEO of CSMI LLC, a Pennsylvania charter \nschool management company and helped found the Chester Community Charter School. (he has been a major \ndonor in promoting charter schools in Pennsylvania. J.C. Huizenga: Between 2005 and 2007, Huizenga donated \n$25,000 to All Children Matter, and in 2010 he donated $30,000 to the American Federation for Children Action \nFund. Mr. Huizenga founded the National Heritage Academies, a for- profit charter network that has 80 schools in 9 \nstates and has received over $43 million in federal funding. According to a 2012 review by the Michigan Department \nof Education, of the schools in the ``focus'' category, due to significant gaps in achievement, more than half were \nmanaged by National Heritage Academies. It has been reported that Mr. Huizenga said that his involvement with \ncharter schools was due to realizing that ``privatizing public education was not only practical but also desperately \nneeded.'' David L. Brennan: Brennan donated a total of $200,000 to All Children Matter, from 2004 [[Page S736]] to \n2007, prior to AMC's wind down due to campaign finance violations. In 2010, he donated $39,000 to the American \nFederation for Children Action Fund. He is the founder of White Hat Management LLC, a for-profit charter school \nmanagement company that operates 15 schools in three states with over 12,000 students. Since 2008, White Hat \nand its affiliates have received $3.6 million in federal funds including IDEA funds. While you may not have a direct \nfinancial interest in the for-profit education enterprises headed by those listed above, your political fundraising \nrelationship with them, and perhaps others, could cause a reasonable person concern over your impartiality in \nmatters involving them. The OGE process does not, capture conflicts that arise through political activity so it is \nincumbent upon us to assure the Senate record is complete as to such conflicts and how they will be resolved. \nThese are just the publicly known examples of potential conflicts. Our original request asked you for information to \nassess potential conflicts with 501(c)(4) organizations that are not required to publicly disclose donor information. \nAccordingly, we reiterate our request that you provide: A list of all donors, their total donations, and affiliations, who \nhave contributed to the American Federation for Children 501(c)(4) and the Great Lakes Education Fund 501(c)(4) \nsince their inception. A list of donations made by you, members of your family, and foundations or organizations \nwith which you are affiliated, to other 501(c)(4) organizations over the past five years. According to the American \nFederation for Children's IRS Form 990 filed for the year 2014, it spent nearly $1.1 million on political activities, \nincluding a $315,000 transfer to the American Federation for Children Action Fund--Wisconsin IE Committee. \nBecause donations to a 501(c)(4) are anonymous, they effectively launder the identities of donors to the other parts \nof your political apparatus. But you know, and the donors know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of interest. \nAdditionally, you refused to disclose donations to 501(c)(4) organizations that you, your family, and your foundation \nhave made. You explained, ``[t]he information requested has no bearing on the office to which I have been \nnominated nor the duties of the Department of Education.'' Your donations to 501(c)(4) organizations are indeed \nrelevant to your nomination, just as your donations to political candidates, parties, and causes are. One obvious \ninstance would be where groups to which you have made political contributions are before the Department as \nadvocates or grant seekers. Again, you know, and the donors know, and therein lies the potential for conflict of \ninterest. Senators have a Constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and \nunderstanding the scope and nature of potential conflicts of interest is at the heart of that duty. Your role in raising \nand distributing ``dark money'' clearly raises the possibility of such conflicts. As a result, we renew our request for \ninformation related to your 501(c)(4) organizations as outlined above. Please contact us if you have any questions \nregarding this request. We look forward to your additional information and disclosures and timely and responsive \nanswers. Sincerely, Sheldon Whitehouse. Robert P. Casey, Jr. Tammy Baldwin. Bernard Sanders. Al Franken. \nElizabeth Warren. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. \nPresident, I know the night is going on. I just want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all the staff \nmembers and Senators who remain here on the floor. A lot of folks who work here, from the gentleman typing very \nquickly, all the way to a lot of the folks working, I just want to express my gratitude for the long night, particularly to \nthe pages. It is their second week here, and they suddenly are being forced to grapple with not just school but the \nlong nights of the Senate. I really do respect them and am grateful for their, how should I say, endurance tonight as \nwell. I rise today, as many of my colleagues have, to speak to the nomination of Betsy DeVos and to speak \nspecifically in opposition to her nomination to serve as Secretary of Education. I have listened to as many of my \n\n\n\ncolleagues' words as I can. I want to say that particularly those on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPension Committee have and will and continue to expand upon many of the concerning elements of Mrs. DeVos's \nrecord, concerns that I share about her lack of support for critical accountability measures, her lack of familiarity \nwith many of the basic financial aid policies and programs which are so essential for people to have access to \nhigher education, her inability to say that guns should not be in school, and her seeming lack of understanding of \nmany of the fundamental yet critical education policy perspectives that I think are necessary for a job of this \nmagnitude. I know there has been much said and there will be many more issues brought up of concern to many of \nthe Democrats who spoke tonight, but tonight I would like to focus on an area that is very personal to me and also \nvery personal to millions of Americans, that is essential to this role but one that may not be immediately understood \nwhen you talk about a Secretary of Education, but it is absolutely critical to that Department. In fact, I think it is one \nof the more critical roles of that Department when it comes to fulfilling the ideals of our Nation. Within the \nDepartment of Education is the Office for Civil Rights. That office is profoundly important, but it is one that many \npeople don't have a full understanding of. What I would like to do right now is highlight four areas in which the Office \nfor Civil Rights functions and also talk as it relates to my concerns about and my opposition to Betsy DeVos to \nserve as Secretary of Education. First, I would like to talk about what is at stake for children with disabilities and \ntheir families and their parents. About 13 to 14 percent of our American school-age children--about 6.5 million kids \nand young adults in America--are students with a disability. Here in the United States, I am so proud that we have \na deep belief and, in fact, our laws, passed by people of both Houses, both parties, dictate that all children be \ntreated with dignity and respect and that they will get the educational opportunities all children deserve. Indeed, our \nlaws reflect that, but the spirit of America is to see that in this Nation all of our children have unique gifts, all of our \nchildren have beauty, and we as a nation collectively believe they all deserve a strong pathway to the fundamental \nAmerican ideal. They deserve pathways to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that when we say ``justice \nfor all,'' we really do mean all children. But unfortunately, as the work of the Department of Education's Office for \nCivil Rights demonstrates, the Federal Government is often at odds with some school districts that do not properly \nenforce protections granted to students with disabilities under the Federal law, again passed by both Houses, \npassed by both parties. Within our country, thousands of parents do not believe their children are receiving justice \nin their local school systems for their children with disabilities. They reach out to the Federal Government for help, \nfor relief, for that justice. Take the example of one child, the case of a 9-year-old child in California whose name is \nwithheld for privacy. This child--and let's call her Jane--is a student like so many others. She has the same dreams \nand aspirations, has hopes, has promise, and has untapped, unlimited potential. At the age of 9, this child, ``Jane,'' \nhad been physically restrained in her school more than 92 times during an 11-month period by her school because \nof her disability. As a part of that restraint, she had been held facedown for a total of 2,200 minutes. The Office for \nCivil Rights at the Federal level, the Federal Government, it took them to investigate this case, and they found that \nthe district was in violation of the Federal law and required the school district to stop using these kinds of restraints \non students and to actually take the time and energy to invest the resources in training the staff on alternative \nintervention methods, methods that recognize the dignity of that child and show that we have the potential and \npower to elevate that child, not to so savagely restrain them. This was not only unconscionable treatment that the \nFederal Government intervened in, but clearly it was illegal within the bounds of Federal law. This is not the way \nthat anyone here, anyone in this body with a child with a disability, any of us would want our children to be treated. \nIf I had a child, I know it is not the way I would want them treated. Frankly, when it comes to the children of \nAmerica, they are our children. Whether Republican or Democrat, we know that our children, our kids, American \nchildren--all children, frankly--deserve better than this kind of physical abuse. It is for these kinds of reasons [[Page \nS737]] that I believe we need to have an aggressive Office for Civil Rights because the story of Jane, of a 9-year-\nold, is not an anomaly. It is not something that is rare. Unfortunately, as we are seeing, there are many violations of \nFederal law that go on when it comes to our children with disabilities. There is tremendous evidence that this kind of \nabuse still goes on in our country, and there needs to be an ultimate authority that can investigate this abuse and, if \nnecessary, hold those people accountable who are the abusers. And the additional step that the Office for Civil \nRights does is it gives advisement, gives instruction on how to make sure the abuse does not happen in the future. \nWe need our Office for Civil Rights to work with school districts to establish those policies and procedures to \nprevent that abuse. When Mrs. DeVos, during her testimony, was given the opportunity to speak to the millions of \nparents who have real, legitimate concerns about their children with disabilities and the treatment they receive in \nschool--she was given the opportunity to speak to the vital role of the Federal Government in protecting our children \nand affirming those rights, about the role of the Office for Civil Rights, and instead of taking that opportunity, instead \n\n\n\nof seizing the moment to talk about what she would be doing to lead, she actually denied a role for the Federal \nGovernment. When asked about protecting students with disabilities, she simply said: ``It should be left up to the \nStates.'' Well, I will tell you right now, for that 9-year-old child physically restrained more than 92 times, held \nfacedown for hours, the Federal Government clearly had an important role to play for that mom, for that family, for \nthat child in making sure this kind of atrocity doesn't happen and will not happen for more children. Secondly, I \nwould like to talk about what is at stake with the Office for Civil Rights as it relates to children who are different, \nwhether that be the color of their skin, whether they wear a hijab to school as an expression of their faith or if they \nare a minority or, again, a child with a disability. For example, I have spoken much as a Senator about the school-\nto- prison pipeline and often how certain categories of children experience different types of discipline for the same \nact in school just because of how they look. School disciplinary policies, we know, play a big role in a child's \nsuccess, and those disciplinary policies are clearly treating different children in different ways. There will be different \noutcomes for those categories of kids. We know that children who have out-of-school suspensions often graduate \nat significantly lower rates, have significantly higher run- ins with the law. I am one who believes we cannot allow \ndiscrimination to happen in that manner in our school. These are the facts. This is the data. Take, for example, the \nfact that Black students are 3.8 times more likely than their White peers to receive one or more out-of-school \nsuspensions, while students with disabilities actually are twice as likely as those without to receive one or more \nout-of-school suspensions. Let me give you the specific case of Tunette Powell, who wrote about her son who is \nBlack. His name is Joah. He was suspended five times in 2014. He was 3 years old. She said: ``One after another, \nWhite mothers confessed the trouble their children had gotten into. Some of the behavior was similar to JJ's,'' her \nson's. ``Some was much worse. Most startling'' to her was that ``none of their children had been suspended.'' She \ncontinues to write. ``After that party,'' where she had heard this from other White parents, ``I read a study reflecting \neverything I was living. Black children represent 18 percent of preschool enrollment but make up 48 percent of \npreschool children receiving more than one out-of-school suspension, according to the study released by the \nEducation Department's Office for Civil Rights in March,'' she writes. One of the critical things about the Office for \nCivil Rights is that they have been proactively collecting data about differences in treatment in our schools. Now \nthere are many people who actively assert that the role of the Office for Civil Rights has grown too large, that they \nare poking around in local matters too much, that even collecting such data, as was relied on by this mother, is an \nintrusion into States' rights. I believe, when it comes to civil rights, when it comes to religious freedom and the \ntreatment of our children, I do not believe that the Office for Civil Rights has grown too large. I believe they are \noffering critical transparency into the workings of our schools; that they are collecting data that parents and \npolicymakers and civil rights groups can use to see who is being left behind, who might be facing discrimination, \nwho is not receiving justice. What do we have to be afraid of even on just the collection of data to allow ourselves to \nhave that transparency, to create an environment of accountability? I worry that if this is not a priority for the next \nSecretary of Education, then closing the achievement gap, shutting down the school- to-prison pipeline, and \nempowering all children to have an equal opportunity to learn will be undermined. These are real problems in our \ncountry, and they aren't just going to go away. The Federal Government, especially when they insist upon data \ntransparency, is an active partner in helping us to receive the justice that we deserve and need and pledge \nallegiance to as a country. I had hoped during the hearings of Mrs. DeVos that I would hear more; that even if I had \nthe opportunity to talk to the nominee myself, I would have asked for more information around these issues, but I \ndidn't have that opportunity, and in the very rushed hearing, the issue wasn't raised. I believe, though, that based on \nthe testimony that was given, that the nominee may not see this as a vital function of the Office for Civil Rights and, \nin fact, may shrink that office and the ongoing proactive investigations that we see right now into such matters. We \nknow that the school-to-prison pipeline, particularly for young people of color, isn't just real; it is actually pervasive. \nBut during Mrs. DeVos's confirmation hearing, when asked about the Office for Civil Rights within the Department of \nEducation that is responsible for rectifying such unjust situations, she refused to comment. She refused to \ncomment. She refused to commit herself even to directing the Office for Civil Rights to investigate such civil rights \nviolations. I don't understand why it is difficult to even commit the Department to continuing such investigations, but \nthat commitment was denied. I want to next talk about the serious problem we have in America with sexual assault \nand sexual violence in schools and on college campuses. Mr. President, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually \nassaulted in their college years, but only 1 percent of assailants on college campuses are arrested, charged, or \nconvicted. We still know that too many people on college campuses who have been sexually assaulted, who are \nsurvivors, are routinely denied justice and are forced to even live or even go to class with their attackers. The Office \nfor Civil Rights has risen to this challenge and this crisis. They have opened investigations in over 200 schools in \n\n\n\nAmerica. There is a crisis of campus sexual assault in America, and now the Office for Civil Rights is expanding \ntheir work. They have stepped up to that challenge. In addition to that, they have issued guidance to all college \ncampuses on preventing and combating sexual assault. Mrs. DeVos, again, during her testimony--many of us were \nhoping she would rise to the occasion, that she would speak to this issue. She was given a chance, given a chance \nnot just to speak to the issue but to talk to the Federal role in meeting this crisis, to acknowledge that this is an \nissue our Nation must grapple with and must end, but she did not speak to the concerns of parents. She did not \nspeak to the concerns of survivors. She did not speak to America about the urgent need for all of us to be engaged \nin dealing with the crisis for which there has been silence for too long. More than this, she did not speak to the role \nof the Office for Civil Rights, to the expanding role they have been taking, to the expanding investigations on college \ncampuses all across the country, giving no confidence to me or [[Page S738]] to others that this will be a role that \nwill continue--in fact, a role that I believe should be expanded. Again, even when she was specifically asked about \nupholding guidance within the Department of Education on combating and preventing sexual assault--not asked to \ncommit on the investigations, not asked to commit to expanding the efforts but just asked about upholding the \nguidance within the Department of Education on combating and preventing sexual assault, she refused to commit to \nmaintaining that guidance. I would like to speak to another area. Before I do, I do believe in this idea of \ntransparency that my previous colleague talked about when it comes to donations. Some of the charities that have \nreceived donations from Mrs. DeVos have a history of fighting against efforts to combat sexual assault, and some of \nthese organizations worked to make it more difficult for sexual assault victims to seek justice. That brings me to an \narea in which I have a deep level of concern. I hope Mrs. DeVos will take the opportunity to set the record straight \nbecause much has been written even before the hearings involving an area where there is a clear crisis in our \ncountry. It is the crisis involving the safety and security of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in \nAmerica. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth face a stunning level of discrimination inside and outside of \nschools starting at a very young age. We know that LGBT youth are two times more likely than their heterosexual \npeers to be physically assaulted in schools. LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide. According to \nyouth risk behavior surveys, 34 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender students were assaulted on school \nproperty. More than one-third of LGBT school students were bullied on school property, and 13 percent of lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, and transgender students did not go to school because of concerns for their safety. We know in \nAmerica that this kind of harassment has no place in our classrooms, no place in our schools, and it has no place \nanywhere in our country, but it is all too common and all too often unaddressed. I would like to talk about a parent. \nHer name is Wendy Walsh. The harassment against Wendy's son Seth began for him in the fourth grade when his \nclassmates suspected he was gay. By the time he reached the seventh grade, the bullying, the verbal and physical \nabuse in person and online was so bad that he was afraid to walk home from school. This child lived in terror of just \ngoing to class. After one bullying incident in a local park, his mom says that 13-year-old Seth came home from \nschool. She talked to him. He asked to borrow a pen from his mom. That conversation will be the last time she \nwould see her son alive. The next time Wendy saw her son Seth, he had hanged himself on a tree in their \nbackyard. After Seth's death, Wendy, experiencing a level of grief and agony I cannot imagine, decided to file a \ncomplaint with the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. When the Office for Civil Rights came in and \ninvestigated, they found that Seth's school district was in violation of several Federal laws, that they failed to \nintervene and stop the bullying and harassment and torment that this child endured from a precious age until his \ndeath, that their actions could have potentially prevented the death of one of our children, an American child, a child \nof beauty and of worth and of dignity and protection. Wendy went to the Federal Government to the Office for Civil \nRights, and they took her concerns seriously. They aggressively investigated. Because of their investigation and \nbecause of Wendy's courage in her time of grief, the school district, in violation of Federal law, was required to take \nsteps--though not there to prevent her child's death-- they were required to take steps to prevent the kind of \nharassment, tormenting, and bullying from happening to other students. I am not sure if any of that is solace to a \nmother who lost her child. I am not sure if it gave her comfort, but I am hopeful that with an active Office for Civil \nRights at the Federal Department of Education, at a time where more than 10 percent of lesbian, gay, and bisexual \nyouth are missing school because of that kind of fear, when one-third are reporting bullying and harassing in person \nor online, at this level of unconscionable treatment for any child, there is a role for the Federal Government to \nprotect our children. I believe if we take these matters seriously that we can insure that this kind of bullying and \nharassment will come to an end in America. It is unacceptable in a country this great. There are laws against this, \nand there are folks who have an obligation to enforce those laws; that is, the Office of Civil Rights. I believe things \nwill get better, but they will not get better automatically because we hope for them, because we pray for them; they \n\n\n\nwill get better because we are a country that loves our children, and love is not a being verb. It demands action. We \nsee time and time again that children aren't seeing the kind of action where they are, and thank God right now there \nis a place for parents to go. They can appeal to the Federal Government. The Department of Education, the Office \nfor Civil Rights, has to be led by someone who takes this seriously, who sees the calls for justice for lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender youth as valid, that sees the crisis, that sees the problem. It was widely reported, when \nMrs. DeVos's nomination was made--widely reported--that her family had given support, significant support, and \nthat she herself gave significant support to discriminatory extremists, dangerous and hateful groups that promote \nideas that say a child who is gay is somehow lesser than a child that is not; groups that have supported things like \nconversion therapy, something that has been resoundingly condemned--dangerous ideas that are hurtful to \nchildren. With all of that, with all the articles that have been written, this was a chance for Mrs. DeVos to sit before \nthe American public knowing that these concerns are out there, and it is understandable, even if she doesn't hold \nthem, it is understandable that this was a moment for her to allay the fears of the thousands and thousands of \nchildren who are being isolated and hurt by bullies, the people who are assaulting their dignity--these children have \nsuicide rates that are unconscionably high--for the parents mourning their kids, with all that swirl, the hearing was \nher chance to set the record straight to say: I will uphold the value and dignity of these children, but more than that, \nI recognize there is a crisis in our country, and I will work with the Office for Civil Rights to do something to address \nthis evil in our country. We have so many kids being hurt and harmed. This was her chance to go beyond just \ndenying that she believed in conversion therapy, to go beyond just words in asserting that she values equality. This \nwas her chance. It should have been understood that because of the record and the charitable donations that there \nwas a degree of suspicion; that there was an understandable degree of legitimate fear that she would not continue \nthe courageous work of the Office for Civil Rights in combating discrimination, harassment, and physical abuse of \nchildren across our country. She had the opportunity. Given the fears and concerns that have been expressed, I \nwould have hoped she would have spoken directly to the work of the Office for Civil Rights to protect lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender teens who are factually experiencing some of the highest levels of hate crimes and \nviolence and bullying of any children in America; that she would have made some affirmation that she would be a \nchampion for their equality, for their dignity, and the Office for Civil Rights would continue its needed work, but she \ndidn't. I hoped she would stand up and say: We have violence on our college campuses; that right now silence is \nallowing insidious realities to exist. We have a problem with reporting rates. We have a problem with reports being \nmade and not being taken seriously; that she could have used that as an opportunity to speak against what is \nhappening to an unconscionable level of young women on college campuses--something that we would never want \nto have happen to any of our daughters; to make a pledge that the Office for Civil Rights would not just continue \ncampus advisories but would fight to hold those college campuses accountable, but she didn't. For students and \nfamilies across the country, this may not be a celebrated [[Page S739]] part. We may not all know in America that \nthe Department of Education has an Office of Civil Rights, but for so many families with children on college \ncampuses and preschools, grade schools, high schools, the Office for Civil Rights has been the difference--the \ndifference makers between injustice and justice, the difference makers between violence and security, the \ndifference makers between who we say we are as a nation, liberty and justice for all, and experiencing a terrible, \nawful lie. I feel compelled to speak out on the vital importance of the Education Secretary, regardless of party, \nregardless of background. I feel a personal responsibility to assure that if I cast my vote as a Senator, that whoever \ntakes that office will be tireless in the defense of all the rights, privileges, and liberties of our students because I \npersonally stand here today because of the role of the Federal Government in enforcing civil rights laws. I stand \nhere today because of the courageous Federal laws that were put in place--bipartisanship, Republicans and \nDemocrats, great battles on this floor for civil rights and disability rights, for title IX protections for women. I am a \nproduct of these kinds of fights over the Federal role when it comes to civil rights. I stand here today because of our \ncollective history. I stand here today because of our dramatic history. I believe in States' rights. It is enshrined in our \nConstitution, but I cannot ignore the role of the Federal Government. Brown v. Board of Education is perhaps one of \nthe most famous Supreme Court cases affirming the Federal role. I hung a picture in the front of my office. I come \nout of my office into where my assistant sits, and the first thing I see on the wall in front of me is a Norman Rockwell \npainting. There is this young girl in that painting, and she is striding proudly to school, and behind her are racial \nepithets, a tomato smashed against that wall. She is a little girl--God, her courage--named Ruby Bridges. There are \nthese White men surrounding her walking just as tall, and they are escorting that girl to school. There is clearly hate \nswirling around. You can look at that picture, and you can feel it. But I don't care what your background or religion \nis, you look at Norman Rockwell's painting--as I make sure I do every day as I leave my office as a U.S. Senator \n\n\n\nand I see that picture--and I am reminded that sometimes when there is hate, sometimes when there is violence, \nsometimes the State doesn't get the job done. Sometimes, the most vulnerable child needs a little help--not just \nfrom a loving teacher or a loving parent but from a government that stands behind her and says: You matter. I can't \nstand here today without recognizing that this is my history, that this is your history, that it is all of our history, and \nthat our Federal Government has a role to play. I drink deeply from the wells of the freedom and the struggles and \nthe sacrifice. I reap the harvest from Ruby Bridges and her courage. Our country has come so far. There is so much \nlove, so much more recognition of the dignity of all children. But, come on, we are not there yet. Children are often \nharassed because they wear a head scarf. I recently heard about a Sikh child wearing a turban who was still \nharassed; a mother concerned that her kid, no worse than another but seems to get suspended more for the same \nbehavior. As to children with disabilities, parents are still concerned that even though we have affirmed their rights \nand dignities in law, those laws aren't being carried out like they should. God, there are young women on a college \ncampus today who rightfully question whether their campus is committed to eradicating sexual violence. With all of \nthese things going on, we have to have champions here. We have to have people who understand that public \neducation is a right for everyone. Some of the most profound battles in our country have been fought to get equal \naccess for children to school, so that they can stride toward that school door knowing that they will get a quality \neducation, free from bullying, free from harassment, free from the binds of hatred or discrimination that might hold \nthem back in their lives. Now, I have faith in who we are as a Nation. I know we are a loving country and a good \ncountry, but we haven't got it perfect yet. So I stand here today in opposition to this nomination because I believe \nwe need a champion. I wish I had a chance to meet with the nominee. I wish the hearings had been longer. I have \nnever seen them so rushed. But there is too much at stake right now. There are too many problems that still exist. \nSadly, there still is a need for an Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education that is aggressive when it \ncomes to the defense of freedom and our rights. I did not hear such a commitment from this nominee. There are \nmillions of parents who didn't hear her speak to the concerns they have about their gay child, the concerns they \nhave about their child with a disability, their concerns about their children going off to college. We did not hear that \ncommitment. In fact, what we heard was a belief that States can figure it out. There was a failure to commit to even \nthe most basic continuance of the Office of Civil Rights. I am glad I hung that picture in front of my office. I may not \nbe able to get what I consider an open hearing and answers to these questions because I walk by Ruby Bridges. I \nfeel I owe her a duty to not vote for someone who has been silent on the issues that are so critical to this country \nbeing who we say we are. There is a child, I think, who wonders right now. Somewhere in America, that child is \nwondering if this country will prove itself true to them. They are probably enduring some things I never had to \nendure. They are probably worried about their safety. They are probably being put in a situation where they are \nquestioning their worth. They probably feel alone and isolated. My prayer is that this child knows that, even though \nit isn't perfect and it won't be easy, that child somehow knows that they are not alone, that there will be people \nfighting for them. I was taught, in the words of a great poet, that there is a dream in this land with its back against \nthe wall; to save the dream for one, we must save it for all. May the Office of Civil Rights in the years to come \nremain vigilant, remain strong, and remain expansive in their efforts. I have no confidence it will do so under this \nperson and, therefore, I oppose this nomination. Thank you very much. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \nThe Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey, who \nhas given us such a compelling reason to remind all of us why we are here at almost midnight and why we all \nintend to keep talking and keep working and keep trying to convince one more Senator to say no to this nominee. \nHe reminds us of the basic principle in this country that our forefathers dreamed of and that they put into our \nConstitution and that we have fought for, which is that every child should have dignity and every child should have a \npublic education. That is why it is so important that we have someone who leads this agency who shares that \nconviction. I really want to thank Senator Booker for his tremendous words tonight. As the ranking member on this \ncommittee, who has been here throughout the Friday debate and through the 12 hours of debate we have had \ntonight and we will continue to have up until the vote tomorrow, I have had the opportunity to hear many Senators \nspeak passionately. Senator Tester was here on Friday. He is from a very rural State, and he was speaking about \nhow important it is to not have funds robbed away from the public education systems in those small little school \ndistricts to go to students with vouchers for private schools that don't exist in those rural communities. He talked \nabout the importance of our public schools and our public school institutions in a slightly different way than the \nSenator from New Jersey did. He talked about how, when his grandparents settled in Montana, instead of being \nranchers like those before them, they were wheat farmers. There were cattlemen and wheat farmers who were \nfighting and at odds with each other in the community, and where they came together was in their schools, because \n\n\n\nboth cattlemen's kids and ranchers' kids were in the same school, and they played basketball together, and it \nhealed the wounds of that community. [[Page S740]] The Senator from New Jersey just talked about the Office of \nCivil Rights and why it is so important--that no matter what we look like or what this country stands for, this country \nsays you have a right to an education. It is in our public schools where kids from all strata and all economic lives, \nwith different backgrounds and different colors and different religions and different thoughts come together and heal \nour communities. That is what is at risk with this nominee, and that is why so many Senators on our side have said: \nTo one more Republican Senator, send this nomination back to the President who campaigned saying: Let's heal \nthis Nation; let's bring people together; send us a nominee who actually does that. Again, I want to thank the \nSenator from New Jersey and all of the Senators who have been here to speak about how important it is to have a \npublic education. I wouldn't be in the Senate tonight without a public education. I come from a family of nine, and \nmy father, who was a World War II veteran, got sick when I was in junior high. He was diagnosed with multiple \nsclerosis. My mom had been at home taking care of seven kids. She didn't have a job. She didn't have skills. We \ndidn't know what was going to happen to us. But we had a public education system that was there for us. Our \ncountry was there for us with a public education system--not with a voucher that said you can go to a private school \nthat we couldn't afford even with it or to be able to get one, but a public education school in our community that \ngave the education to each one of those kids in my family--all seven of us. Then it allowed us to go on to college \nwith Pell grants and student loans, because our government was there for us, even though my dad was sick and \nmy mom had to stay home and take care of him. We had food stamps for a while, and it was tough, but we made it \nbecause this country had a commitment to public education for every student, no matter where you lived or where \nyou came from or what challenges you had at home. That is why I am here in the Senate, and that is why many of \nus are here in the Senate. It is why this nominee has sparked such an interest across this country. Like many \nSenators--I think, like all Senators--my office has been inundated with mail and phone calls and emails and rallies \nand people saying: Please, stop this nominee, and send us someone who can actually work for all of us, because \neducation is a critical piece for each one of us. It is across the country. I want to share some of the letters that I \nhave received about this nominee. I have received 48,000 pieces of mail opposed to Mrs. DeVos; the number of \npro-DeVos emails and letters is in the teens. I have 48,000 pieces, and they are all personal. These aren't rote \nemails and letters; these are personal pleas. Why and how? Because these people saw this nominee at this \nhearing, and their expectations for our education system in this country are high. They want someone leading the \nDepartment of Education who knows the issues, who believes in public education. They were appalled at what they \nheard, and they said no. Mrs. Mary Ann Whittaker, a woman from Longview, WA, a small rural community: Dear \nSenator Murray, As an educator of 30 years and a mother who has helped to raise and educate five children, I was \nshocked and dismayed by the lack of knowledge and depth of understanding that Ms. DeVos has about education. \nOur education system needs a leader who can be a true leader in this arena, with the background and backbone to \ndo what is in the best interest of the children of this great country--please do everything in your power to make sure \nthis woman is not allowed to gain this position. Thank you--on behalf of thousands of children and educators in the \nstate of Washington!! I heard from Joel Puchtler of Seattle, WA. He said: Please do everything in your power to stop \nDeVos from becoming Secretary of Education. She is transparently incompetent, and will be destructive to the \nnation's education system through both intent and ineptitude. Demand a competent appointee from the president-\nelect. I am an educator. My wife is an educator. My grandfather was the first Commissioner of Education (so called \nat the time) under the Johnson administration. He would be thrilled to see a competent woman in this appointment, \nbut categorically horrified at the possibility of DeVos, just as I am. These are the kinds of reactions I am hearing \nfrom my constituents. Why? Because we had this nominee come before our committee. We were allowed 5 minutes \neach to ask her questions. She has a very complex financial background. We were not allowed to look at those \nfinancial background papers before we had a chance to talk to her, so we only had some information. The only \nthing we could do was ask her questions about what she believed in. Her answers were astounding, and many \npeople saw them, whether it was about IDEA and the ability of children with disabilities in this country to get an \neducation, whether it was about policy debates we are having on education, or what she saw as her drive and her \nambition. People in this country want someone who feels passionate about public education, not someone who has \nused her vast amounts of wealth and her experience to go after what she calls an education system that is \nincompetent and, in her opinion, needs to go away. Her drive has been to take the funds out of public education \nand go for private, for-profit education. I can understand that a woman who is a billionaire with a lot of money \ninvested in companies wanting companies to succeed, but our public education system is not a company. Our \npublic education system is something that is derived from the communities that it is in, from the teachers who are \n\n\n\nthere, from the parents who participate as school board members and teacher volunteers. It is the driving passion of \nour communities. It is not something people want ripped away, torn apart, or degraded. That is why this nominee \nhas touched a nerve across the country. I heard from Mrs. Rebecca Blankenship. She lives in Gig Harbor. She said: \nDear Senator Murray, I am writing to urge you to oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of \nEducation. As a certified teacher who has taught for many years in Public schools and as a parent of two young \ngirls in the Peninsula School District, I find DeVos to be completely unqualified for the position as she has no public \nschool experience, has actively funneled money away from schools in need and lacks the fundamental educational \nbackground to make decisions that impact millions of students. There is no issue more important to me than our \neducation system. I heard from Ms. Carol Pelander, a former teacher, from Tacoma, WA: As a retired public school \nteacher, who continues to work part-time training new teachers, I am extremely concerned about the potential \ndamage that will be done to public education if Betsy DeVos is confirmed as the Secretary of Education. Our \nmission as educators includes teaching our kids how to live and work together effectively in a diverse community, \nand the proposals brought to the table by Ms. DeVos to privatize education will further divide us as a community \nand significantly reduce our already limited resources. She is not qualified for this important leadership position. I \nhave been in the Senate for a long time. I have gotten a lot of emails, a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of \nconstituents, and been to a lot of community meetings. These thousands of letters that we are getting are not form \nletters. These are letters of people telling stories. They are passionate about their public schools. They have spoken \nlouder about this nominee than any other, saying: This is not what I want for my country. I have heard from many \npeople in our rural communities who are so concerned about privatizing our public education system because they \ndon't have a private school to send their kids to, even if the voucher that she espouses were enough to put them \ninto one. I grew up in a rural community. I grew up in the small town of Bothell. Coming in to town, I remember the \nsign that said 998 people, and I remember the day it said that 1,000 people lived in Bothell. Our schools were the \nheart and soul of our community. It is where your met your neighbors. It is where you sent your kids to play \nbasketball. Everybody showed up for the football games and the music concerts. It was our community. We loved it, \nand we owned it. Did we say it was perfect? Did my parents say it was perfect? No. But it was the heart and soul of \nthat community, and they did not want to lose it, just as so many other parents in this country want a Secretary of \n[[Page S741]] Education who wants all kids to have a good education. I have so many letters here. I have one from \nAdam Brickett, from McClure Middle School in Seattle. He says: Thank you for your years of service representing \nour state. I have never contacted an elected official before-- By the way, many of my letters start with that. I have \nnever contacted an elected official before but with the changes happening in our country I feel the need to now. I'm \nwriting specifically to you today about the nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. As a middle school \nteacher for Seattle Public Schools I work hard every day to ensure that my students get the best education \npossible to be successful in their future careers and lives. I am concerned that Ms. DeVos does not have the \nexperience necessary nor the best intentions for our nation's students and schools to be our Secretary of \nEducation. I believe she would put profits and money ahead of students, schools and teachers. I felt this way \nbefore her nomination hearing and feel even more strongly after her hearing. I am worried about the damage she \ncould do to an already fragile public education system. I know I am not alone as virtually all the colleagues I have \nspoken with have expressed similar dismay with her nomination. Her record of attacking public schools and \nfunneling money to charter and parochial schools with little to no oversight is troubling. Her lack of experience \nwhatsoever with public education is also very disturbing. Not only has she never been an educator or administrator \nbut she has never even attended or enrolled her children in public education. A high quality, public education is one \nof the most powerful tools a society has. Please don't allow someone with no experience and who is fundamentally \nagainst public education to become the person in charge of it. I respectfully ask you and your colleagues in the \nsenate to do what is right by our nation's students and reject Ms. DeVos as Secretary of Education. Thank you \nagain for your tireless service to the residents of Washington. I have 48,000 letters. My staff handed me a pile of \nthem. They are all very similar. They are very heartfelt. They are not just writing a rote letter to us. They watched \nthe hearings, they listened, they care about our public schools, and some of them are Trump supporters. They want \nthis President to support our public schools. They did not in this past election have a debate about whether we \nshould privatize public schools. We talked about the debate--and I know my candidate didn't win. But in this \ncountry, I never heard a debate about taking public education away, about voucherizing our public schools, about \nhaving someone who is the top person--the Secretary of Education--espouse positions that are so fundamentally \nopposed to what I grew up with and obviously to so many parents, teachers, students, family members, \nsuperintendents, people involved in schools, and business leaders. They are writing to us now because they saw \n\n\n\nthe same thing we did in this hearing. Let me read a letter from Trina Whitaker from Mukilteo Schools. She says: \nThis is my 16th year of being a teacher in our public school system in WA State. I am an advocate of public schools \nas I feel strongly that all our students deserve the right to free and quality education. I am opposed to the \nnomination of Betsy DeVos for the Secretary of Education system. Her past actions and beliefs clearly demonstrate \nthat she is not an advocate for our public schools. It would be so damaging if we move in the direction of privatizing \npublic education. Please consider opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos in the best interest for our public school \nsystem. Let me read another letter from Rachel Guim of Seattle. She says: As a committed public school teacher, I \nbelieve in our neighborhood public schools, which open their doors to all children, because unlike Betsy DeVos, I \nsee them work for children and their families every single day. We as a community are being undermined by \ncharters, vouchers, for- profit schools and online schools. Precious tax dollars are being wasted creating a parallel \nschool system (when we're already underfunded and not meeting the legal requirements)! Our democratically \ngoverned schools--we, the people you have vowed to represent--need your commitment and support. Choice is a \ndisguise for school privatization, nothing more. Stop the takeover of our democratically governed schools. . . . Do \nnot vote to confirm Betsy DeVos. And she goes on. Again, there are so many letters from so many people from so \nmany different walks of life, all concerned about having a Secretary of Education who doesn't represent the best \nvalues and the best beliefs of our country. Ms. Amanda Smith, a Kindergarten teacher, wrote to me and said: Hello, \nI am a kindergarten teacher in a public elementary school. I am very concerned about Betsy DeVos' potential \nnomination as secretary of education. As someone who never attended public school, didn't send her kids to public \nschool, does not have an education degree and has never taught, she hardly seems like a fitting candidate for \nsecretary of education. Can anything be done to stop this nomination? From Gina McMather, a teacher in Port \nTownsend, WA: Dear Patty Murray, As a recently retired public school teacher, I especially urge you to fight against \nBetsy DeVos's nomination for education secretary. She is not in any way qualified for the job. Her commitment to \ncharter schools combined with a lack of experience with public schools could destroy our nation's educational \nsystem. Public school teachers provide an education for all of our students. Teachers need more respect and \nremuneration. We need the very best college graduates to be attracted to the profession. I have known so many \ndedicated and effective public school teachers during my 25-year career and those of us retiring baby boomers \nneed the best successors possible. They need your support. Don't let this undermine our efforts. Thank you again \nfor all your [work]. What I hear from people over and over again is that they want somebody leading our public \nschool system in this country who actually believes in public schools, who has the education, the experience, the \ncompassion, the willingness to understand what our forefathers did when they created this country and said: We \nare going to have a country--a democracy--that has a public education system paid for by all taxpayers to assure \nthat everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, is not denied a public education. They can learn to \nread and write and communicate and get the skills they need to be successful. They can dream who they want to \ndream to be and be there. We do not want to go backward, and we are one vote away from changing where we are \non this nomination, sending this back to the President, and asking him to please send us a Secretary of Education \nwho can get the votes in the Senate, who will be an Education Secretary for all people, from all walks of life, from \nour rural communities and our urban communities, no matter who they are or where they come from. That, I think, is \na great possibility and would be a great outcome. I know that my colleague is on the floor and is ready to speak as \nwell. Again, I have so many letters from so many people--48,000--who have voiced their opinion on this, more than I \nhave ever had with any other nominee in my memory or any other issue in my memory. I thank all those who have \nwritten in and spoken out and stood up for public education. It is the foundation of our democracy, and it is our \nresponsibility, our goal to continue that for them. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  \n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: \neditorial@plusmediasolutions.com \n"}
