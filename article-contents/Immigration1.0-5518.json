{"title": "INS TURNED BACK IN APPEALS CASE ON DEPORTATION", "body": "\nAn appeals court in California has upheld a nationwide injunction against the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization \nService for failing to notify thousands facing deportation of their right to contest allegations of using false \ndocuments. The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower-court ruling that the \nINS had violated the Constitution by failing to inform people charged with using false documents that they could \nrequest hearings to rebut the allegations.\n\nIn 1996, a Seattle judge barred the INS from continuing its current practices and ordered the government to provide \nclear information to immigrants about their rights. Moreover, the INS was ordered to place media notices in Mexico \nand elsewhere in Latin America to notify people who may have been wrongly deported because of allegations of \ndocument fraud without understanding those rights.\n\nThe appeals court opinion, written by Judge Stephen Reinhardt after hearings in Pasadena, largely backed the \nlower-court ruling. The judges assailed the \"complexity and ineptness\" of the INS procedures, concluding that even \nthose with \"a reasonable command of the English language would not receive adequate notice\" from the agency. \nSome 5,000 immigrants nationwide faced deportation after being accused of using false documents under a 1990 \nlaw. Those accused are seeking hearings to contest the charges. The INS has argued that everyone targeted had \nreceived adequate notice.\n\nNotes\n\nNational News in Brief\n"}
