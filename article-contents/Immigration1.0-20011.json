{"title": "National Briefing  Southwest: Texas: Sentencing In Smuggling Deaths", "body": "\nA woman who pleaded guilty to directing a smuggling operation in which 19 illegal immigrants died was \nsentenced to 17 years in prison on Monday. The punishment for the woman, Karla Patricia Chavez Joya, 28, was \nless than the life term prosecutors requested but greater than that recommended under federal sentencing \nguidelines. The 19 people who died were among 74 illegal immigrants abandoned in a locked tractor-trailer near \nVictoria in 2003. The authorities said temperatures inside the vehicle exceeded 170 degrees. Thirteen other \ndefendants were charged in the case, including the driver, against whom the government is seeking the death \npenalty.    STEVE BARNES (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
