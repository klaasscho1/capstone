{"title": "The Immigration Impasse; Why the GOP can't decide if immigration reform will be its death or its salvation.", "body": "\nOn Tuesday, William Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard and Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, \nwrote a rare joint editorial denouncing the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform plan. They said it was full \nof loopholes and exceptions that would do nothing to end illegal immigration. Republican Senators had signed on \nto the bill fueled by a \"panic\" about attracting Hispanic voters. House Republicans, they argued, should not only \nrefuse to vote on the Senate bill, they should refuse to join a conference committee where their version could be \nmelded with the impure Senate's product. Republicans should shelve immigration reform until after the 2014 \nelection, they argued. What's the rush?\n\nThere used to be a simple answer: existential dread. After the 2012 elections, Republicans had to get right with \nHispanic voters or face another loss as the country's demographics shifted away from the GOP's base of older, \nwhite voters. Immigration reform was the only solution. This view was so roundly accepted that the Republican \nNational Committee endorsed it in the party autopsy commissioned after the election: The GOP \"must embrace and \nchampion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core \nconstituencies only.\" \n\nSince that time, the political theory has faced two sustained assaults. The first, argued by Rush Limbaugh and \nothers, is that Hispanic voters will not suddenly find Republicans attractive after immigration reform passes. As a \nvoting bloc, they are temperamentally in line with the Democratic Party. The second blow to the political case was \nthe argument, put forward by Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics,            Byron York, and others, that Hispanics \naren't the key voting bloc for the GOP's future hopes of creating a winning presidential coalition. The GOP can also \nmake a path to the presidency by courting lower-income white voters. Kristol and Lowrey added a third reason to \nslow the political stampede: If Republicans wait, they might take control of the Senate in 2014, which would allow \nthem to pass a more conservative version of immigration reform in 2015.\n\nWith the political arguments weakened, the slapdash construction of the Senate bill is harder for its proponents to \ndefend. But Hispanics were not the only constituency Republican immigration proponents were trying to reach. \nWhen I interviewed Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, a member of the Gang of Eight, last April, he said \ncomprehensive immigration reform would also appeal to moderate voters who watched Republicans debating \nimmigration and came away with a sour view. \"When people see a party that is not rational, they're not going to go \nwith that party,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans don't always look good when debating immigration reform. They get emotional, judge each other's \nmotives, and generally provide Democrats with opportunities to point fingers at them. Republicans on both sides of \nthe issue point to the trouble the GOP has had talking about immigration in the past. Rep. Tom Tancredo of \nColorado is blamed for years of immigrant bashing that made the party look intolerant. In the 2012 GOP primary, \n\n\nthe unresolved immigration issue caused a rolling fracas between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. When Romney \ncame out for \"self-deportation,\" many in the party believe it defined Romney and the GOP as cold and \nunwelcoming. This public squabbling not only looks unseemly, it also blocks Republicans from spending time \ntalking about a positive agenda for the future that appeals to a wider range of voters.\n\nThis level of public acrimony hasn't defined this debate so far, say Lowrey and Kristol. \"During the debate over \nimmigration in 2006-07, Republican rhetoric at times had a flavor that communicated a hostility to immigrants as \nsuch. That was a mistake, and it did political damage. This time has been different. The case against the bill has \nbeen as responsible as it has been damning.\" It's true that the debate has been relatively benign (with the exception \nof Alaskan Rep. Don Young who referred to Latino farm workers as \"wetbacks\" and had to apologize twice), but \nthat's not a condition that is guaranteed to continue.\n\nThe risk that an unresolved immigration debate will define the party in the next few years is the pro-reform crowd's \nanswer to Lowrey and Kristol's question of \"why now?\"\n\nThe public debate over immigration reform has the potential to erupt into a self-inflicted wound again because it \ntouches on the most sensitive issues of racism, tolerance, morality, and adherence to the rule of law. Both sides \nhave been trying to appeal to the other in order to build a coalition for a final piece of legislation, so the rhetoric has \nbeen somewhat tempered. But each side thinks the stakes are enormous. On Meet the Press two weeks ago, \nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Republicans were in a \"demographic death spiral as a party and the only \nway we can get back in good graces with the Hispanic community, in my view, is to pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\" The next week, Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho made the opposite case. If Republicans support \nthe Senate bill that Sen. Graham is promoting, \"politically it's going to be the death of the Republican Party.\"\n\nWhatever happens, someone is going to need bereavement therapy. All this talk of death may be hyperbole, but a \nvoter not involved in the clubhouse spat might wonder why one side or the other is committing suicide. Whatever \nthis voter decides, the rhetoric from Republicans leaves him or her with the view that half of the party is not simply \nwrong, but insane. \n\nWaiting for 2015 also means Republicans will have to live with the collapse of immigration reform for the next year \nor so. Perhaps voters will applaud that Republicans didn't rush a bill that was bad policy. But given Congress' \napproval ratings and willing Republicans ready to point fingers, it's also just as possible that the independent voter \nmight conclude that the GOP cannot apply reason to the problems of the day to find a workable solution.\n\nVoters unsure of where to place the blame will have trusted sources like the Wall Street Journal helping them. \nWhen senators appeared ready to block the effort in that body on the grounds it did not secure the border, the \nJournal's editorial page questioned the motives of senators on the \"restrictionist right,\" arguing that their concerns \nabout security were a fig leaf for their basic disinterest in granting citizenship to undocumented workers. \"The real \ngame here is to kill a bill that would create a more pro-growth and humane immigration system for America and \nthe millions already here or in line to come. If the right succeeds in blowing all this up, one wonders what comes \nnext? Perhaps Republicans can campaign in 2014 on self-deporting the 11 million illegals who are here now. That \nworked so well for Mitt Romney.\"\n\nIf House Republicans follow Lowry and Kristol's advice, that kind of tone and language is likely to become more \ncommon.\n"}
