{"title": "POLL FINDS SUPPORT FOR LEGALIZING IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nMost voters favor legalizing undocumented workers if they pay their taxes, have no criminal record and learn to \nspeak English, according to a nationwide bipartisan poll released Tuesday.\n\nThe poll was sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, one of the nation's largest unions, and \nCatholic Healthcare West, which employs about 40,000 workers at 48 hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nOf the 1,000 likely voters surveyed this month, 92 percent said an important criteria for legalization would be \nwhether undocumented immigrants pay U.S. taxes every year. An additional 88 percent said it was key that they \nhave no criminal record, and 87 percent said it was important that they learn English and have steady work.\n\nWithout such criteria, voters were split 40 percent in favor of legalizing undocumented workers and 49 percent \nopposed. But with such conditions, those in favor rose to 59 percent, with 34 percent opposed.\n\nThe poll has a margin of error of 3.2 percent.\n\nNotes\n\nCALIFORNIA & THE WEST\n\nIN BRIEF\n"}
