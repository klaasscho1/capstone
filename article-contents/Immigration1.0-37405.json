{"title": "Immigrant crushed to death on escalator", "body": "\nAn elderly Cuban immigrant taking her first steps in the United States was crushed to death Sunday in an \nescalator accident at Miami International Airport, police said. At least five other passengers were injured.\nBertola Agrispina Acosta-Bereda, 75, was killed under the weight of other passengers as they fell on an escalator \nto the U.S. Customs Service and immigration offices, said police officer Ralph Fernandez. \"As they came up the \nescalator, someone fell, causing other people to fall. It was a domino effect,\" he said. It was not immediately clear \nwhether the escalator malfunctioned or whether the immigrants' unfamiliarity with the machinery prompted the fall, \npolice said. \"It's possible they've never seen an escalator before,\" Fernandez said. Airport spokeswoman Amalia \nFernandez said the six arrived on an Eastern Airlines flight, a weekly charter from Havana bringing Cuban \nimmigrants to the United States and exiles home from visits to the island. At least five people, including the dead \nwoman's husband, were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, said Fernandez, who declined to release the \nhusband's name. Sam Cratis, duty administrator at the hospital, said all were in stable condition, but he refused to \ndescribe their injuries. Fernandez said Ms.  Acosta-Bereda and her husband were moving to Miami.\n"}
