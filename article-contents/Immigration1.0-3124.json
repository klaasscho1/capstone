{"title": "Metro News Briefs: NEW YORK CITY;After Guilty Plea, Man Is Told to Leave U.S.", "body": "\nA man who aided a gunman who fired on a van filled with Hasidic students in 1994 must leave the country on his \nown, or face deportation, a judge ruled yesterday.\n\nThe ruling, by Immigration Judge Gabriel C. Videla, drew criticism from the mother of Aaron Halberstam, a 16-year-\nold killed in the attack at the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nThe woman, Devora Halberstam, had called on Judge Videla to deport Hlal Mohammed, a 34-year-old illegal \nimmigrant living in Brooklyn. Mr. Mohammed had pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and altering evidence by \naiding the gunman, Rashid Baz. Instead, the judge in a written opinion agreed to let him leave the country by Sept. \n5 on his own or face deportation to Jordan. Mr. Mohammed has sought asylum so he would not have to return to \nJordan.\n\nMr. Baz, 30, was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of murder and attempted murder.\n"}
