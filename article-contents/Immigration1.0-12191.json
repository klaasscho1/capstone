{"title": "The Immigrants And the Suburbs", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n     \"A Suburb All Grown Up and Paved Over,\" by David Plotz (Op-Ed, June 19), maintains that Fairfax County, Va., \n\"is the very model of the benefits of immigration.\" \n\n The benefits he describes: up to six cars parked on paved-over yards; climbing poverty rates; \"sprawled suburbs,\" \npacked houses of \"sisters, husbands and cousins,\" and a lost rural character. If those are the benefits of \nimmigration, what are the disadvantages?\n\nLINDA H. THOM\n\nCoupeville, Wash., June 20, 2002\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
