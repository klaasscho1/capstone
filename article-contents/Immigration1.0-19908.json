After a prompt Rule 16 conference, because of approaching events \nthat threatened to deprive the City of Philadelphia of this grant money, and the non-monetary consequences of the \nfederal government\u2019s proposed actions, the City has moved for a preliminary injunction.2 The Court held an \nevidentiary hearing on October 26, 2017.\n 1 W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943), (Jackson, J.).\n\n\n\n 2 The parties agreed that responses to the Complaint, including any Rule 12 motions, would be stayed pending \nresolution of the preliminary injunction motion.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 5 of 132\n\n 2\n I. Summary of the Counts in the Complaint\n\n The City filed a six-count Complaint on August 30, 2017, alleging in detail the City\u2019s overarching commitments to \nwelcoming immigrants, holding wrongdoers accountable for their criminal conduct regardless of their immigration \nstatus, and promoting the health, safety, and welfare of all residents. The City evidently prizes the hard-won trust it \nhas earned with immigrant communities, and believes that the City is both safer and better off when immigrants \ndo not \u201cfear adverse consequences to themselves or to their families from interacting with City officers.\u201d (ECF 1 \n(\u201cCompl.\u201d) &para; 2). In the City\u2019s view, fostering trust with immigrant communities promotes cooperation with \npolice\u2013\u2013particularly by immigrant victims and witnesses of crimes\u2013\u2013which in turn promotes public safety. (Id. \n&para; 3). To that end, the City has instituted a number of policies intended to limit collection of immigration status \ninformation in the provision of City services and routine policing efforts, and limit coordination with federal \nimmigration enforcement. (Id. &para;&para; 21\u201351). Philadelphia hastens to add, however, that it cooperates with \nfederal authorities in various arenas of criminal justice, including by participating in federal task forces, and employs \nseveral databases that are visible to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (\u201cFBI\u201d) and Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (\u201cICE\u201d). The City has applied for, and received, federal funding through the Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrants Program (\u201cJAG Program\u201d) every fiscal year since the JAG Program assumed its present form in 2005. (Id. \n&para; 60). In fiscal year 2016, it had to agree to some fifty-three special conditions in order to receive $1.68 million \nin JAG Program funds, as demonstrated on its 2016 grant approval sheet. (Id.; Compl. Ex. 9).\n\n The City objects to three conditions recently imposed by the Department of Justice through the Attorney General, \nand has filed suit to enjoin them. Specifically, it alleges that the Attorney General cannot condition JAG Program \nfunds on 1) requiring federal immigration agents access to\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 6 of 132\n 3\n\n City detention facilities (the \u201cAccess Condition\u201d); 2) providing the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) at \nleast 48 hours\u2019 advance notice of the date and time of the release of any inmate about whom DHS has requested \nsuch information (the 48 hour \u201cNotice Condition\u201d); and 3) certifying compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373 (\u201cCertification \nCondition\u201d; collectively, the \u201cChallenged Conditions\u201d). (Compl. &para; 5). The City alleges six counts for injunctive \nand declaratory relief.\n Count I asserts that the Attorney General acted ultra vires and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by \nimposing the Challenged Conditions, because the Challenged Conditions are not authorized by the Congressional \nstatute creating the JAG Program, do not concern administration and spending of JAG Program funds, and are at \nodds with the JAG Program\u2019s formula grant structure. (Id. &para;&para; 105\u201312).\n\n Count II asserts that the imposition of the Challenged Conditions is unconstitutional and therefore violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). The City argues that the Constitution bestows upon Congress the exclusive \npower to enact spending legislation pursuant to Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1 (the \u201cSpending Clause\u201d), whereas the President \nand the Executive Branch are separately tasked with \u201ctak[ing] Care that the Law be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S. Const. \nart. II, \u00a7 3, cl. 5 (the \u201cTake Care Clause\u201d). The City also claims that Attorney General\u2019s imposition of the new \nconditions amounts to an unconstitutional refusal to disburse money that Congress has already appropriated. (Id. \n&para;&para; 113\u201321).\n Count III alleges that the Attorney General\u2019s imposition of the Challenged Conditions is arbitrary and capricious, \nand therefore violates the APA, because it deviates from past agency policy without reasoned explanation or \njustification. (Id. &para;&para; 122\u201324).\n\n\n\n Count IV asserts that even Congress could not have imposed these conditions on JAG Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 7 of 132\n 4\n\n Program grants because doing so would violate the Spending Clause. The Challenged Conditions, the City \nargues, are unrelated to the purpose of the JAG Program, do not impose unambiguous obligations on recipients, \nand transgress principles of federalism. (Id. &para;&para; 125\u201331).\n\n Count V alleges that the conditions on JAG Program funds seek to commandeer City officials into the enforcement \nof federal immigration law in violation of the Tenth Amendment. The City seeks injunctive and declaratory relief \npreventing the Attorney General from interpreting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373 and the two other grant conditions in a way that \nwould violate the Tenth Amendment. (Id. &para;&para; 132\u201337).\n\n Count VI seeks a declaration by this Court that the City is in compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, as constitutionally \nconstrued. (Id. &para;&para; 138\u201344).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 8 of 132\n 5\n II. Summary of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n After the City\u2019s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction was filed, the Court determined that the parties should have a \nchance to present relevant facts, in order to supplement the declarations which had been filed. Testimony was \nreceived from various City officials, and the most crucial witnesses were Police Commissioner Ross, Deputy \nManaging Director Abernathy, and Health Commissioner Farley \u2013 who established Philadelphia\u2019s actual practices \nwith regard to so-called \u201cundocumented\u201d aliens \u2013 and also, \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d\n\n Philadelphia is a not a \u201csanctuary city\u201d \u2013 if that term means that there are any policies that would prevent or inhibit \nthe investigation, arrest, prosecution and sentencing of aliens. There are none. The term \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d although \nnot defined by any statute, includes individuals who are not citizens, but who have been convicted of serious \ncrimes, or have reentered the United States after being deported. This category of criminal alien represents a fairly \nsmall percentage of the total number of non-citizens.\n Approximately one half of unlawfully present non-citizens can be accurately described as \u201cvisa overstayers\u201d \u2013 that \nis, they entered the United States legally, on a properly issued visa, but have stayed after the visa expired.3 \nAlthough Congress has enacted laws that allow civil proceedings to deport any undocumented alien, the record of \nthe case establishes that our federal government, for decades, with both Democratic or Republican presidents, has \ntaken no steps whatsoever to deport visa overstayers or aliens who entered unlawfully and without being arrested. \nAll deportation efforts, from World War II to the present time, have focused on \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d\n\n 3 DHS statistics indicate that as of January, 2012 there were approximately 11.4 million unlawfully present non-\ncitizens in the U.S. Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January \n2012, Bryan Baker and Nancy Rytina. These statistics further indicate that roughly half of that population is made \nup of visa overstayers, while the other half is comprised of individuals who have entered the United States without \ninspection. A very small percentage of the overall 11.4 million, including both visa overstayers and those who \nentered without inspection, have criminal convictions. This topic is discussed in detail below.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 9 of 132\n 6\n As the record shows, Philadelphia has certain protective policies which primarily apply to aliens who are \u201cvisa \noverstayers.\u201d4 The government asserts these policies allow it to deny the Byrne JAG grants to Philadelphia.\n\n This factual testimony forms an important part of the Court\u2019s rulings, which also depend on established statutory \nand constitutional principles. Turning to the legal issues presented by the City, as the moving party for preliminary \ninjunction, the Court finds that the Attorney General\u2019s implementation of two of the conditions for receiving the \nByrne grant, which we will term the \u201c48 hour notice\u201d condition, and the \u201cjail access\u201d condition, were issued without \n\n\n\nappropriate authority under the Administrative Procedure Act, a statute enacted by Congress many years ago which \nregulates the matters on which federal government agencies, of which the Department of Justice is one, may issue \nconditions.\n For the remaining issues, this opinion will explain in some detail the intersection between federal and state criminal \nlaws, and federal immigration practices. Regulation of immigration is exclusively a federal function, but it is not \nexclusively within the province of the executive branch of government. Congress has enacted specific laws which \ngive the federal government significant authority to deport \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d There is abundant statutory authority for \nusing civil proceedings to deport visa overstayers, as well as individuals who entered without inspection, but have \nnot been convicted of any crimes. However, there has been virtually no enforcement action whatsoever to deport \nvisa overstayers, or illegal entrants who were not arrested at the time they crossed into the United States, usually \nfrom Mexico.\n\n Turning to the other allegations in the City\u2019s complaint, the Court gives careful analysis to\n\n 4 Analysis of 2014 statistics suggests that 67 percent of Pennsylvania's unlawfully present noncitizen population is \nmade up of visa overstayers. Robert Warren and Donald Kerwin, The 2,000 Mile Wall in Search of a Purpose, 5 J. \nMigration and Hum. Security, 124, 129, (2017).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 10 of 132\n 7\n\n the Spending Clause in Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, and also to the Tenth \nAmendment, which reserves to the states (and by definition, local governments) those powers not designated for \nthe federal government. In analyzing other actions issued by the Department of Justice, which claims that their non-\nobservance by the City warrants rejection of the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant to Philadelphia, the Court concludes the \nCity is likely to succeed in its claims that the Department of Justice\u2019s conditions are improper under settled \nprinciples of the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and principles of federalism.\n\n In doing so, the Court acknowledges that Congress has prohibited state or local governments restricting \ncommunications about aliens to the federal government. Although the Court declines to rule whether a certification \ncondition is applicable, the record of the case clearly shows, giving due credibility to the testimony about the City\u2019s \npractices, that Philadelphia is in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with all of these DOJ conditions.\n\n Applying the requisite proof for preliminary injunction of probability of success on the merits, irreparable harm, a \nbalancing of equities, preserving the status quo, and the public interest, the Court will issue a preliminary injunction \nin favor of the City, that the City may certify its compliance with these conditions, and to enjoin the Department of \nJustice from denying the City\u2019s FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 11 of 132\n 8\n III. Byrne JAG Program\n\n The federal grant at issue is awarded under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (the \n\u201cJAG Program\u201d or the \u201cByrne Program\u201d). See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10151 (formerly 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3750). Named after a fallen \nNew York City police officer, the JAG Program supports state and local law enforcement efforts by providing \nadditional funds for personnel, equipment, training, and other criminal justice needs. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10152 \n(formerly 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3751).\n A more robust understanding of federal grants, appearing below, is important to fully appreciate the contours of the \nJAG Program.\n Federal awarding agencies have no independent power to award grants. Thus, all grants must be authorized by \nCongress in the form of enabling legislation. The degree of discretion afforded to awarding agencies depends on \nthe statutory text and the type of grant. However, regardless of the amount of authority delegated by Congress to \nthe awarding agency, all grant terms must be consistent with the authorizing statute.\n\n\n\n There are two main categories of federal grants: (1) discretionary grants, and (2) mandatory grants. The JAG \nProgram is a mandatory grant.\n (1) Discretionary grants are those for which an awarding agency generally possesses discretion to select the \nawardees and the amount they receive. Discretionary grants are typically made through a competitive grant process \nfor a specific project, and federal awarding agencies often attach program or project-specific requirements to grant \nfunds.\n\n (2) Mandatory grants are those which an awarding agency must make if a grantee meets the requirements set forth \nin the authorizing statute. States seeking mandatory grant awards must submit a plan to the federal agency \nadministering the program detailing how it will use the grant funds. Notably, mandatory grants are not \u201ccompetitive,\u201d \nand no applicant that complies with grant requirements is excluded from receiving funds.\n Mandatory grants can be further divided into three sub-categories: (A) entitlement grants, (B) block grants, and (C) \nformula grants. The Byrne Program is a formula grant.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 12 of 132\n 9\n (A)Entitlement grants are those in which the beneficiary is entitled to receive money upon demonstrating that it \nqualifies for assistance. One example is Medicaid, where the beneficiaries are individuals.\n\n (B) Block grants are those awarded pursuant to formulas set out in their respective authorizing statutes, which \noften take into account factors such as population and annual Congressional appropriations. Block grants are \nsubject to several, but not all, provisions of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s \u201cUniform Guidance,\u201d codified at \n2 C.F.R. 200.\n (C) Formula grants, such as the Byrne Program, are similarly awarded pursuant to formulas in their respective \nauthorizing statutes. However, formula grants are subject to all provisions of the Uniform Guidance.\n Grants awarded under the Byrne Program are based on a formula which takes into account the applicant \njurisdiction\u2019s population and violent crime rate. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10156 (formerly 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3755). The Attorney \nGeneral has limited the eligibility of applicant jurisdictions to JAG Program funds for many years, by imposing \nvarious conditions. In the present case, Philadelphia brings no challenge to more than fifty of these conditions, \ninstead focusing on the three most recently imposed conditions. (See Pl. Mot. Ex. 11).\n The Attorney General claims that the three Challenged Conditions are authorized under two statutory provisions.\n The first is 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6), which does not appear in the same statutory subchapter as the Byrne \nProgram. It states in relevant part:\n The Assistant Attorney General shall . . . exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the \nAssistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing \nspecial conditions on all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.\n The second source of statutory authority claimed by the Attorney General does in fact appear in the same \nsubchapter as the Byrne Program. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153. The Attorney General contends that this separate \nsource of authority independently supports the Section 1373\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 13 of 132\n 10\n Certification Condition:\n To request a grant under this part, the chief executive officer of a State or unit of local government shall submit an \napplication to the Attorney General within 120 days after the date on which funds to carry out this part are \nappropriated for a fiscal year, in such form as the Attorney General may require. Such application shall include the \nfollowing:\n [...]\n (5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed by the chief executive officer of \nthe applicant (or by another officer of the applicant, if qualified under regulations promulgated by the Attorney \nGeneral), that\u2014\n [...]\n (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\n\n\n\n 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D) (emphasis added).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 14 of 132\n 11\n IV. The Three Challenged Conditions\n The Attorney General cites a May, 2016 report from the Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) finding deteriorating \nlocal cooperation with \u201cefforts to remove undocumented criminal aliens from the United States,\u201d (Compl. Ex. 10), as \nan important catalyst for the imposition of the Challenged Conditions.\n\n Accordingly, in late July 2017, the Attorney General announced two new conditions on every grant provided by the \nJAG Program. (See Backgrounder on Grant Requirements, Pl. Mot. Ex. 1). The two new conditions require, first, \nthat local authorities provide federal agents advance notice of the scheduled release from state or local correctional \nfacilities of certain individuals suspected of immigration violations (the \u201cNotice Condition\u201d), and, second, that local \nauthorities provide immigration agents with access to City detention facilities and individuals detained therein (the \n\u201cAccess Condition\u201d). Id. Additionally, a third condition on Byrne JAG funds was added last year that requires the \nCity to certify compliance with a federal statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, which prohibits local government and law \nenforcement officials from restricting the sharing of information with the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(\u201cINS\u201d)5 regarding the citizenship status of any individual (the \u201cCertification Condition\u201d). Id.\n The three conditions are as follows:\n (1) The Notice Condition\n A State statute, or a State rule, regulation, policy, or practice, must be in place that is designed to ensure that, \nwhen a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the \nImmigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular \nalien in such\n 5 The enforcement function of INS is now performed by ICE, after a government reorganization in 2003.

Section \n1373 is titled \u201cCommunication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u201d and \nprovides as follows:\n (a) In General\n Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or \nofficial may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or \nunlawful, of any individual.\n (b) Additional Authority of Government Entities\n\n\n\n Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way \nrestrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information \nregarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual:\n\n (1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 16 of 132\n 13\n Service.\n\n (2) Maintaining such information.\n (3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity.\n (c) Obligation to Respond to Inquiries\n The Immigration and Naturalization Service shall respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, or local government \nagency, seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of \nthe agency for any purpose authorized by law, by providing the requested verification or status information.\n\n The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) asserted by letter dated October 11, 2017, a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d that the \nCity did not comply with Section 1373. (ECF 28 (\u201cDef. Opp.\u201d), Ex. A to Declaration of Alan Hanson (\u201cHanson \nDecl.\u201d)). The City responded by letter dated October 27, 2017, disputing that assessment and requesting a delay in \nany withholding of the FY 2017 JAG award pending resolution of this litigation. (ECF 61).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 17 of 132\n 14\n V. Philadelphia\u2019s Policies at Issue\n\n The Attorney General contends that \u201c[a]t least two [Philadelphia] policies do not comply with Section 1373, and at \nleast three additional policies may also be non-compliant depending on how the City interprets and applies them.\u201d \n(Def. Opp., at 38).\n First, Philadelphia Executive Order No. 5-16, states in Section 1:\n\n No person in the custody of the City who otherwise would be released from custody shall be detained pursuant to \nan ICE civil immigration detainer request pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7, nor shall notice of his or her pending release \nbe provided, unless such person is being released after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving \nviolence and the detainer is supported by a judicial warrant.\n (Compl. Ex. 6). Although Executive Order No. 5-16 appears to restrict compliance with detainers and advance \nnotice requests, a subsequent memorandum issued to the Prisons Commissioner clarified that \u201cthe Department of \nPrisons is directed to cooperate with all federal agencies, including ICE, when presented with a judicial warrant,\u201d \nirrespective of whether \u201csuch person is being released from custody after conviction for a first or second degree \nfelony involving violence.\u201d (Compl. Ex. 7).\n\n Second, Police Commissioner Memorandum No. 01-06, which has as its express goal the \u201cpreserv[ation of] \nconfidentiality of all information regarding law abiding immigrants to the maximum extent permitted by law,\u201d states \nin Section III.C:\n\n The Philadelphia Police Department will continue to cooperate with federal authorities in investigating and \napprehending immigrants suspected of criminal activities. However, immigrants who are victims of crimes will not \nhave their status as an immigrant transmitted in any manner.6\n\n 6 As further discussed below, during the evidentiary hearing in this case, Philadelphia\u2019s witnesses stated that a \ncriminal suspect who is also a victim would not be protected under Police Commissioner Memorandum No. 01-06; \nthis narrow category of victim-suspects (e.g., two defendants both charged with felony assault on the other as the \nresult of a fight) could have their status as an immigrant transmitted to federal authorities.

Law enforcement officers shall not:\n \u2026\n\n (2) inquire about a person\u2019s immigration status, unless the status itself is a necessary predicate of a crime the \nofficer is investigating or unless the status is relevant to identification of a person who is suspected of committing a \ncrime (other than mere status as an undocumented alien);\n\n (3) inquire about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or others who call or approach the police \nseeking help; or\n (4) inquire regarding immigration status for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.\n C. Law enforcement officers shall continue to cooperate with state and federal authorities in investigating and \napprehending individuals who are suspected of criminal activity.\n (Compl. Ex. 4).\n Fourth, Executive Order No. 8-09, Section 3, states:\n\n A. As used herein, \u201cconfidential information means any information obtained and maintained by a City agency \nrelating to an individual\u2019s immigration status.\n\n B. No City officer or employee shall disclose confidential information unless:\n (1) such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains . . .;\n\n (2) such disclosure is required by law; or\n (3) the individual to whom such information pertains is suspected by such officer or employee or such officer\u2019s or \nemployee\u2019s agency of engaging in criminal activity (other than mere status as an undocumented alien).\n (Id.).\n Fifth, Police Commissioner Memorandum No. 01-06, Section III.A, states:\n\n In order to safeguard the confidentiality of information regarding an immigrant, police personnel will transmit such \ninformation to federal immigration authorities only when:\n (1) Required by law, or\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 19 of 132\n 16\n\n (2) The immigrant requests, in writing, information be provided, to verify his or her immigration status, or\n\n (3) The immigrant is suspected of engaging in criminal activity, including attempts to obtain public assistance \nbenefits through the use of fraudulent documents.\n (Compl.

Prior Litigation Over \u201cSanctuary City\u201d Policies\n\n The present litigation represents the latest skirmish between state or local governments and the federal \ngovernment over so-called \u201cSanctuary City\u201d policies. Two recent cases in particular merit discussion prior to this \nCourt\u2019s analysis of the current dispute between Philadelphia and the Attorney General.\n A. County of Santa Clara v. Trump\n Less than a week after assuming office, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768, entitled \u201cEnhancing \nPublic Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d which \u201cpurport[ed] to \u2018[e]nsure that jurisdictions that fail to comply \nwith applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law\u2019 and to establish a procedure \n\n\n\nwhereby \u2018sanctuary jurisdictions\u2019 shall be ineligible to receive federal grants.\u201d Cty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. \nSupp. 3d 497, 507 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (quoting 82 Fed. Reg. 8799). Two California jurisdictions, which had policies in \nplace prohibiting the use of resources to aid in enforcement of federal immigration law or limiting the circumstances \nin which they honored ICE detainers, sought to enjoin Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, which states:\n Sec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, \nthat a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.\n (a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent \nconsistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary \njurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes \nby the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the \nextent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate \nenforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice \nthat prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 21 of 132\n 18\n Exec. Order No. 13768 (emphasis added).\n The plaintiff counties alleged that this part of the Executive Order violated the principle of Separation of Powers, \nviolated the Spending Clause of Article I of the Constitution, improperly conscripted them in enforcing federal \nimmigration law in violation of the Tenth Amendment, was unconstitutionally vague, and violated the counties\u2019 \nprocedural due process rights. Id. At oral argument, the United States argued that this section of the Executive \nOrder applied only to three grant programs administered by the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Justice, including the Byrne JAG Program. Id. at 507\u201308, 510.\n Rejecting this interpretation, the court found that the Executive Order \u201cr[an] afoul of \u2026 basic and fundamental \nconstitutional structures,\u201d which it explained: The Constitution gives Congress the federal spending power and \nplace conditions on receipt of federal funds; once legislation is enacted, the President is \u201crequired to \u2018take Care that \nthe Law be faithfully executed.\u2019\u201d Id. at 531 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3, cl. 5). The court stated that \u201c[w]here \nCongress has failed to give the President discretion in allocating funds, the President has no constitutional authority \nto withhold such funds and violates his obligation to faithfully execute the laws duly enacted by Congress if he does \nso.\u201d Id. The court concluded: \u201cSection 9 purports to give the Attorney General and the Secretary the power to place \na new condition on federal funds (compliance with Section 1373) not provided for by Congress. But the President \ndoes not have the power to place conditions on federal funds and so cannot delegate this power.\u201d Id. The court also \nnoted that Congress had considered, and rejected, conditioning federal spending on compliance with Section 1373 \nand immigration law, which placed the President\u2019s power \u201cat its lowest ebb.\u201d Id. (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube \nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952)).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 22 of 132\n 19\n Even if the President possessed spending powers, that court continued, the Executive Order would nonetheless \nhave overstepped constitutional limitations on spending legislation. The court found that the Executive Order did not \nimpose unambiguous conditions on jurisdictions. Id. at 532. Moreover, its attempt to defund sanctuary jurisdictions \nlacked the requisite relationship between the condition and the purpose of the funds because there was \u201cno nexus \nbetween Section 1373 and most categories of federal funding, including without limitation funding related to \nMedicare, Medicaid, transportation, child welfare services, immunization and vaccination programs, and emergency \npreparedness.\u201d Id. at 532\u201333. It did suggest some relationship between immigration enforcement and law \nenforcement, however:\n The Executive Order inverts the nexus requirement, directing the Attorney General and Secretary to cut off all \nfederal grants to \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d but giving them discretion to allow \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d to receive \ngrants \u201cdeemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.\u201d EO \u00a7 9(a). As the subset of grants \u201cdeemed necessary \nfor law enforcement purposes\u201d likely includes any federal funds related to immigration enforcement, the Executive \nOrder expressly targets for defunding grants with no nexus to immigration enforcement at all. This is the precise \nopposite of what the nexus test requires.\n\n\n\n Id. at 533 (emphasis added).7 The court also found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their \nargument that the attempt to defund sanctuary jurisdictions amounted to an unconstitutionally coercive use of the \nspending power. Id. The court further found that the Executive Order attempted to conscript states and localities \ninto enforcing federal immigration law in violation of the Tenth Amendment, contained \u201cstandardless guidance and \nenforcement provisions\u201d rendering it void for vagueness, id. at 536, and violated jurisdictions\u2019 procedural due \nprocess rights by failing to establish any notice or opportunity to be heard regarding their potential\n 7 Note that the Court did not issue any ruling regarding whether Section 1373 had a relationship to the JAG Byrne \nProgram.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 23 of 132\n 20\n loss of federal funding. Id.\n Accordingly, the court entered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring enforcement of Section 9(a) on April 25, \n2017. Id. at 540. It clarified that the injunction did not \u201cimpact the Government\u2019s ability to use lawful means to \nenforce existing conditions of federal grants or 8 U.S.C. 1373\u201d or \u201crestrict the Secretary from developing regulations \nor preparing guidance on designating a jurisdiction as a \u2018sanctuary jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n B. City of Chicago v. Sessions\n\n Prior to the initiation of the Philadelphia litigation, the city of Chicago, which had enacted a \u201cWelcoming City \nOrdinance\u201d as part of its municipal code, filed suit challenging the imposition of the Challenged Conditions attached \nto Byrne funding. The arguments in the Chicago litigation in many ways parallel those at issue in the Philadelphia \ncase, and Chicago, like Philadelphia, sought preliminary injunctive relief in federal court. See City of Chicago, No. \nCV 17 C 5720, 2017 WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2017).\n\n On September 15, 2017, after Philadelphia had filed its Complaint, a Judge of the United States District Court for \nthe Northern District of Illinois ruled that the Attorney General lacked authority under the authorizing statute to \nimpose substantive conditions on Byrne grants, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10151-58, and acted ultra vires in imposing the Notice \nand Access conditions. Id. The court rejected the Attorney General\u2019s attempt to claim authority to impose such \nconditions on the basis of 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6), a provision of a separate statutory subchapter establishing the \nOffice of Justice Programs allowing the Assistant Attorney General to \u201c\u2018plac[e] special conditions on all grants\u2019 and \nto \u2018determin[e] priority purposes for formula grants.\u2019\u201d Id. at *5 (alterations in original). However, the court ruled that a \nprovision of the Byrne JAG Program authorizing statute, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D), requiring certification that an \napplicant for Byrne funds \u201cwill Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 24 of 132\n 21\n\n comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws\u201d gave the Attorney General the statutory \nauthority to impose the Section 1373 Certification Condition. Id. at *7. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he most natural \nreading of the statute authorizes the Attorney General to require a certification of compliance with all other \napplicable federal laws, which by the plainest definition includes Section 1373.\u201d Id. at *9. It specifically noted that \nChicago had not challenged the Certification Condition under the Spending Clause. In short, the court found that \nChicago was likely to succeed on the merits of its challenges to the jail access and advance notification conditions, \nbut not on the 1373 compliance provision. The City of Chicago court did not hold an evidentiary hearing in reaching \nits legal conclusions.\n\n With respect to irreparable harm, the court found that \u201c[t]he harm to the City\u2019s relationship with the immigrant \ncommunity if it should accede to the conditions is irreparable\u201d and that \u201cforcing the City either to decline the grant \nfunds based on what it believes to be unconstitutional conditions or accept them and face an irreparable harm, is \nthe type of \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019\u201d that the Supreme Court had found to support irreparable harm for purposes of \ngranting injunctive relief. Id. at *13 (citing Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 381 (1992)). Finally, \nthe court found the balance of the equities and the public interest favored neither party because both Chicago and \nthe Attorney General had \u201cstrong public policy arguments\u201d grounded in \u201cconcerns of public safety,\u201d \u201cthe wisdom of \nwhich [was] not for the Court to decide.\u201d Id. at *14.\n\n\n\n Accordingly, the court entered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Notice and Access conditions. Id. It \nsubsequently denied a stay of the nationwide application of the injunction. City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. CV 17 \nC 5720, WL 4572208 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 13, 2017). An appeal is pending.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 25 of 132\n 22\n VII. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n Philadelphia asserts it is likely to show that the Attorney General\u2019s imposition of the Challenged Conditions violates \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) because the Attorney General:\n (1) acted in excess of his statutory authority as well as contrary to the authorizing federal statute;\n\n (2) violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers; and\n (3) acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n (See Pl. Mot., at 15\u201316).\n Philadelphia\u2019s contentions that the Attorney General acted in excess of, and contrary to, the authorizing federal \nstatute, rely on the statute\u2019s text, legislative history, and implementation history, while rejecting the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s reliance on a statutory provision that defines the \u201cpowers and functions\u201d of the Assistant Attorney General \nof the Office of Justice Programs. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6).\n Philadelphia\u2019s motion also asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s actions are in contravention of the Constitution\u2019s \nSpending clause, the Tenth Amendment, and principles of Federalism.\n\n The City also contends it is likely to show that the City\u2019s policies are consistent with Section 1373 as \nconstitutionally and lawfully construed, and therefore that the Attorney General should be enjoined from denying the \nCity funding on that basis.\n\n The City alleges irreparable harm, not only from the denial of receipt of the money, but also from a loss of goodwill \nin the immigrant community. Lastly, the City asserts that the public interest warrants preserving the \u201cstatus quo\u201d \npending a final hearing. The standards for a preliminary injunction are set forth below.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 26 of 132\n 23\n VIII. Review of Testimony and Sworn Declarations Filed by Plaintiff in Support of Motion\n A. Testimony of Police Commissioner Ross\n Born and raised in Philadelphia, Richard Ross has been a member of the Philadelphia Police Department (\u201cPPD\u201d) \nfor over 28 years, and for the past 22 months has served as Police Commissioner. In this role he is responsible for \neverything from hiring and termination decisions, to training, to policy implementation, to communication. Prior to \ntaking on the Police Commissioner position, Commissioner Ross rose through the ranks of the PPD, from working \nas a sergeant, to a lieutenant, working his way up to Captain of the Homicide department, before becoming the \nDeputy Commissioner in Internal Affairs and eventually the First Deputy Commissioner for eight years.\n\n Commissioner Ross reported that the PPD is budgeted for 6,525 police officers, and currently employs \napproximately 6,400, along with an additional approximately 800 civilian employees, making it the fourth largest \npolice department nationwide. Commissioner Ross reported that PPD\u2019s budget is in excess of $600 million, \nhowever between 96-98% of that budget is dedicated to personnel costs and benefits. Thus, while the $1.6 million \nthat the City must forego if it rejects JAG funds represents a small percentage of PPD\u2019s overall budget, it is \nsignificant to crime fighting efforts and represents 10% of non-personnel costs. Specifically, this funding would be \nused for overtime salaries, crime suppression, and technological updates.\n 1. Philadelphia Police Priorities\n\n When asked what the most important issues are to the PPD currently, Commissioner Ross pointed to gun violence, \nand the development and maintenance of police-community relationships. When asked to articulate his theory of \npolicing, he highlighted two major themes: smart policing\u2014that is, using intelligence to react to, and proactively \nanticipate crime as quickly as Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 27 of 132\n\n\n\n 24\n possible\u2014and community policing\u2014in the sense of viewing citizens as \u201cpartners\u201d in crime fighting, and being \nintentional about developing relationships with the community in order to promote this idea of a partnership and the \nattendant benefits. He emphasized the connection between these two themes, noting that it is not possible for the \nPPD to be omnipresent, in the sense of having a police officer on every single corner, so they must leverage \ncommunity relationships to increase their capacity to detect crime.\n\n He identified some of the ways that community members help the PPD respond to crime, for example, the PPD \nreceives tips from the public in response to surveillance video and photos connected to requests for information; in \ngeneral, he asserted, the greatest source of intelligence used for resolving criminal investigations comes from \npeople, not through technologically advanced techniques. He highlighted domestic violence and sexual assault as \ncontexts in which crime can typically only be detected and addressed if victims come forward with information. \nFurther he described PPD\u2019s efforts to utilize pattern information and analysis to anticipate and react quickly to \nneighborhood crime, for example robbery; information from victims and other community members regarding these \npatterns is incredibly valuable, and if community members are in fear of being deported as a result of approaching \nPPD they won\u2019t come forward. This would put PPD far behind in their efforts to effectively respond to crime.\n\n 2. Reasons for Philadelphia Police Department Policies on Immigrants\n\n Commissioner Ross discussed the likely consequences if the PPD were required to disclose the immigration status \nof every victim and witness with whom they came into contact. He stated that this practice would be \u201cstifling\u201d \nbecause community members would fear PPD. Although developing community relationships can be incredibly \nhard, but because it is so important to the PPD\u2019s ability to collect information about ongoing crime, it is something to \nwhich the PPD has Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 28 of 132\n 25\n dedicates substantial resources.\n\n Overall, Commisioner Ross emphasized that a broad policy of sharing the immigration status of non-criminal \nimmigrants would detract from PPD\u2019s mission, impacting not only the individuals subject to such information \nsharing, but also their wider communities and those of adjacent neighborhoods. Commissioner Ross reported that \nas of 2016, crime in Philadelphia was at a 40-year low, which is an indicator of the progress that has been achieved \nthrough smart policing and community partnership efforts, including in immigrant communities. He made clear that \navailable evidence suggests no link between an individual\u2019s status as an undocumented immigrant, and their \nlikelihood to commit a crime; in fact, it is primarily people born and raised in Philadelphia who commit crime in the \nCity.\n 3. Community Policing\n He indicated that the PPD engages in both department-wide and district-specific programmatic efforts to develop \ncommunity relationships. Special interest groups, including some associated with various ethnic identities, are \nemployed to build relationships with the groups they represent. He described the PPD\u2019s efforts, including \ncommunity engagement through meetings, social media, the Police Athletic League, and town halls. He highlighted \nthe difficulty, particularly in the current social climate, to maintain an image of legitimacy with the community. \nEstablishing trust, he explained, can sometimes only be achieved on a block-by-block basis. Once gained, losing \nthe community\u2019s trust can be almost impossible because it leaves the public with no reason to believe that the PPD \nis legitimate. \u201cTrust and legitimacy go together,\u201d he stated.\n\n Commissioner Ross described the PPD\u2019s interactions with the immigrant community as no different from the rest \nof the population, explaining that the PPD must have a strong partnership Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 \nFiled 11/15/17 Page 29 of 132\n 26\n\n with this group just as with any other. He asserted that without them \u201cwe would be in peril.\u201d The PPD recruits \nbilingual officers in order to enable communication between the police and community members who do not speak \n\n\n\nEnglish. He also noted the value in showing to immigrant communities that many PPD officer share their same \nheritage.\n\n 4. Immigrants Have No Immunity from Arrest and Prosecution for Crimes in Philadelphia\n\n Commissioner Ross stated emphatically that he does not consider PPD to be an extension of ICE, noting multiple \ntimes that pursuing immigration enforcement would detract from the PPD\u2019s mission. With regard to the term \n\u201csanctuary city,\u201d Commissioner Ross stated that he is not clear on exactly what the term refers to and personally \ndoes not use it. Philadelphia is a \u201cwelcoming city,\u201d he offered. He noted that some people might infer that the \nconcept of a sanctuary city indicates that if an immigrant commits a crime, they won\u2019t be arrested or prosecuted, \nbefore clarifying that this not the PPD\u2019s policy: \u201cwe don\u2019t harbor criminals in the Philadelphia police department.\u201d \nCommissioner Ross emphasized that a suspect\u2019s immigration status makes no difference to arrest procedures or \nprosecution decisions.\n 5. Reasons for Police Policies Criticized by the Attorney General\n Commissioner Ross explained that internal PPD memoranda represent policies to be implemented, and provide \ndirections to guide the manner in which police officers are to conduct themselves. The method for dissemination is \nvia submission of memos to local police districts. Officers are generally required to sign each memo to confirm \nreceipt.\n\n Referring to PPD Memorandum 01-06, dated May 17, 2001 and issued by then Police Commissioner Timoney, \nCommissioner Ross clarified that the Policy outlined in Section II accurately reflects the current policy of PPD. With \nrespect to Section II, Part B, which indicates that PPD \u201cwill preserve the confidentiality of all information regarding \nlaw abiding immigrants to Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 30 of 132\n 27\n\n the maximum extent permitted by law,\u201d Commissioner Ross explained that the motivation behind this policy is the \nneed for the entire population to understand that the PPD is there to protect and serve them, and that they should \nfeel comfortable coming forward with any information to help police fight crime. He highlighted the fact that this \npolicy protects the confidentiality only of those who are \u201claw abiding,\u201d and says nothing about those who are \nbreaking the law. He emphasized the built-in exception in Section III which clarifies that police will share with federal \nauthorities information about any immigrant who \u201cis suspected of engaging in criminal activity\u201d to underscore the \ndistinction that the PPD draws between, on the one hand, victims and witnesses, and on the other, criminal \nviolators.\n Commissioner Ross explained that nothing in the policy set out in Memo 01-06 prevents PPD from cooperating \nwith the federal government, and that in the 16 years it has been in place the federal government has never \nidentified any issues with it.\n\n Commissioner Ross also commented on Mayor Nutter\u2019s Executive Order 8-09, signed on November 10, 2009, \nwhich sets out the City\u2019s policy with respect to immigrants\u2019 access to City services and sets out a general \nprohibition on City officials inquiring into and disclosing individuals\u2019 immigrations status, subject to exceptions. He \nexplained that this policy is important because the PPD\u2019s mission is to safeguard the population, not to engage in \nimmigration enforcement. The PPD would not be able to effectively pursue its obligation to protect and serve if the \nCity\u2019s population is concerned about officers revealing residents\u2019 immigration status. Sub-section 3 of Part B of \nSection 3 provides an exception by which City employees may disclose information regarding an individual\u2019s \nimmigration status when that individual is suspected of engaging in criminal activity, \u201cother than mere status as an \nundocumented alien.\u201d Commissioner Ross again highlighted this exception as establishing PPD\u2019s position that \nthese protections do not Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 31 of 132\n 28\n extend to individuals who are engaged in criminal activity, noting that PPD has no interest in withholding \ninformation about criminals from ICE.\n\n Under the City\u2019s policies, including Memorandum 01-06 and Executive Order 8-09, police officers would not be \nrestricted from responding to an ICE request for information regarding any noncitizen who has been arrested. \n\n\n\nHowever they would likely not provide address information for a former inmate who had been released and is no \nlonger suspected of criminal activity, as this broaches on immigration enforcement and is not within PPD\u2019s purview. \nWhen asked about the policy with regard to an individual who fits the description of both a victim and a \nperpetrator,8 Commissioner Ross clarified that the PPD will make determinations about whom to arrest and charge \nwith crimes, and ultimately will be willing to communicate to ICE information regarding the immigration status of any \nindividual who is actually charged with a crime. Commissioner Ross confirmed that PPD employees had been \ntrained with respect to these policies, however Section 1373 had not been mentioned by name in training.\n 6. Cooperation with Federal Law Enforcement Agencies\n\n Commissioner Ross asserted that the PPD has a good relationship with all federal agencies, and that nothing in \nCity policy prevents PPD\u2019s cooperation with federal agencies. He identified examples of cooperation such as the \njoint terrorism task force between the PPD and the FBI\u2013\u2013which feature local and federal officials working together.\n When asked about the example of a noncitizen who has not committed any state crime, but who has unlawfully \nreturned to the U.S. after being deported in violation of federal criminal law, Commissioner Ross indicated the PPD \nwould not be likely to encounter such a person. Generally speaking, police are not involved unless a state crime is \ncommitted. He clarified though, that if\n 8 For example, if two individuals have a physical altercation and both are injured.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 32 of 132\n 29\n such a person were to commit a state crime, they would be arrested and charged according to normal PPD \nprocedures, which include fingerprinting the suspect and sharing his fingerprints through a database to which ICE \nand other federal authorities have access. In this way, the suspect\u2019s immigration status would be shared with ICE.\n B. Declaration and Testimony of Julie Wertheimer\n In her declaration, Ms. Wertheimer identifies herself as Chief of Staff, Criminal Justice, in the Managing Director\u2019s \nOffice of Philadelphia, in which she oversees the \u201cOffice of Violence Prevention.\u201d She also discusses Philadelphia\u2019s \nunbroken history of receiving Byrne JAG grants since the program\u2019s inception in 2005. In FY 2016, Philadelphia \nreceived $1.67 million, and a slightly lower amount in FY 2015. Ms. Wertheimer asserts that Philadelphia relies \nupon federal funding provided by the Byrne JAG program to support a number of priorities and programs.\n Ms. Wertheimer relates that on July 25, 2017, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) notified Philadelphia as follows:\n As a condition to receiving any Byrne JAG funds in fiscal year 2017, Philadelphia must comply with three \nconditions. Philadelphia must:\n\n (1) certify that the City complies with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373;\n\n (2) permit officials from the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) access to any detention facility maintained \nby Philadelphia in order to meet with persons of interest to DHS; and\n (3) provide at least 48 hours\u2019 advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an inmate \nfor whom DHS requests such advance notice.\n Ms. Wertheimer relates that the application deadline for the local FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding was September 5, \n2017 and that Philadelphia submitted a timely application.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 33 of 132\n 30\n Her declaration gives further details of how Philadelphia plans to spend the JAG funds, if awarded, with further \ndetails supplied at the hearing at which she testified.\n\n She explained at the evidentiary hearing that the Byrne Program involves congressionally allocated and \ncongressionally appropriated formula grant funds based on population and crime rate. Ms. Wertheimer also \ndistinguished between, on the one hand, competitive grants and, on the other hand, formula grants, which do not \nrequire the City to compete to acquire the grant funds. In her experience, the City has never failed to receive \nformula grant funds for which it applied. In fact, Ms. Wertheimer recalled that on one occasion, due to a \ntypographical error, the city accidentally applied for less money than the formula authorized. She received a \n\n\n\ntelephone call from an officer at the DOJ informing her that Philadelphia would need to remedy the error because \nthe City was required to receive the full amount for which it was eligible under the terms of the Byrne statute.\n\n Ms. Wertheimer also provided an explanation of the City\u2019s budgeting process. Because the City\u2019s fiscal year runs \nfrom July 1 to June 30, the Mayor typically submits a proposed budget around February of each year. City Council \nthen holds hearings and votes on the budget in May or June. If additional resource needs arise thereafter, city \nofficials must generally wait until the following fiscal year to seek those funds.\n\n She further explained that Byrne Program grants are awarded early in the City\u2019s fiscal year, which typically enables \nthe City to acquire additional funds for criminal justice programs that do not appear in that year\u2019s fiscal year budget. \nIn order to decide which criminal justice programs Philadelphia will seek funding for, a sub-committee of the \nCounty\u2019s Criminal Justice Advisory Board meets and decides which programs should be prioritized based on \nurgency and need. In FY 2016, the opioid crisis was one such urgent need.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 34 of 132\n 31\n\n Ms. Wertheimer also testified that the City has applied and been awarded funding under the Byrne Program every \nyear since 2005, without controversy. In no prior year were any conditions added such as those in FY 2017, in \nwhich DOJ asked for a legal opinion from Philadelphia\u2019s City Solicitor and signatures on the grant application from \nthe Solicitor and Mayor.\n\n Importantly, she testified that Byrne grants are not in the City\u2019s general fund budget. Instead, the Byrne funds are \nlocated in the unanticipated funds budget, which signifies that if the grant is not awarded, the projects for which \nthose funds were allocated will not occur. She emphasized that no funding will be diverted from other sources to \npay for what would otherwise have been several projects funded by the Byrne grant, including naloxone supply for \nofficers to use in case of civilian opioid overdose, overtime pay for officers, and case management software used to \ndeliver the City\u2019s limited resources efficiently.\n C. Declaration and Testimony of Eva Gladstein\n\n Plaintiff also submitted a declaration of Eva Gladstein, who is Deputy Managing Director of Health and Human \nServices in the Office of Managing Director. After detailing her personal and professional experience, she detailed \nthe City policies and practices regarding what she refers to the \u201cimmigrant community,\u201d specifically that the City \nrefrains from asking for immigration status information to determine benefits eligibility. Ms. Gladstein defends this \npractice and details the number of individuals and children, totaling over 114,000, who have received mental health \nservices through City-funded programs, almost 33,000 individuals who have sought substance abuse treatment \nthrough City funded programs, and over 6,000 children who have benefitted from early intervention services by the \nCity.\n\n Ms. Gladstein estimates the immigrant community to include approximately 200,000 people, or 13% of the overall \npopulation. However, because the City does not collect data or Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 35 of 132\n 32\n\n statistics regarding immigration status of residents accessing City services, her estimates are not firm numbers. \nMs. Gladstein states as follows:\n\n If the City were required to collect immigrant status information as a requisite to providing services, that would \nhave a significant impact on the [immigrant] community\u2019s willingness to access these services, and I would expect \na significant drop in these numbers, which would put all Philadelphians at risk.\n\n Eva Gladstein also testified at the evidentiary hearing that all five of the agencies she supervises comply with \nExecutive Order 08-09 (\u201cThe Confidentiality Order\u201d). She further testified that Philadelphia residents can use the \nCity\u2019s services without regard to immigration status. In fact, the agencies that Ms. Gladstein oversees specifically \n\n\n\nperform outreach to immigrant communities, often using the City\u2019s language and cultural capacities to do so. \nBecause some of these services are stigmatized\u2014e.g., substance abuse, treatment services\u2014the City has sought \nto remove as many \u201cobstacles\u201d as possible to ensure that immigrants, like other Philadelphia residents, are able to \nuse the City\u2019s services.\n For example, Ms. Gladstein explained that the Department of Human Services operates a hotline which receives \nreports of suspected abuse and neglect of children. These reports generally lead to investigations by the \nDepartment, which seeks to determine if the complaint is founded. These investigations typically rely on some \nmeasure of cooperation from the child\u2019s neighbors, friends, and family. Ms. Gladstein testified that, without the \nConfidentiality Order in place, Philadelphia would not receive the same level of cooperation needed to ensure the \nsafety of Philadelphia\u2019s children.\n\n Ms. Gladstein also gave examples of other city services under her supervision that would be compromised in the \nimmigrant community if the City\u2019s Confidentiality Order were not in effect, such as emergency shelters, transitional \nhousing, the domestic violence hotline, and Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 36 of 132\n 33\n\n domestic violence shelters. Ms. Gladstein credibly testified that immigrants would be less likely to use the City\u2019s \nservices if they feared that their immigration status would be readily revealed to ICE.\n D. Declaration and Testimony of Brian Abernathy\n\n Plaintiff filed the declaration of Brian Abernathy, who as First Deputy Managing Director supervises the Police and \nFire and Emergency Management Departments. In addition to providing details about his personal and professional \nbackground, Mr. Abernathy summarizes the structure and organization of the Police and Fire Departments. He also \ndetails prior and existing mayoral orders, which do not require that immigrants disclose their immigrant status in \ndealing with the agencies that he oversees, specifically Philadelphia\u2019s six prison facilities, and the Police \nDepartment.\n\n Mr. Abernathy details in May 2017 a new \u201cconsent form\u201d provided by the City to inmates that gives an inmate the \nright to speak with a federal immigration official or to decline to do so. His reasons for this policy were set forth as \nfollows:\n\n It is the expectation that such a policy will further encourage trust by the immigrant community and foster \ncooperation with law enforcement, without any fears of deportation looming above. The consent-based policy also \nensures the orderly administration of Philadelphia\u2019s prisons, by avoiding the unnecessary expenditure of time and \nresources that sometimes would be incurred when inmates are delivered to ICE only to then exercise their \nconstitutional rights to remain silent or have counsel present.\n\n Mr. Abernathy then details the City\u2019s responses to detainer notification requests by ICE and justifies them as \nfollows:\n\n The City\u2019s law enforcement protocols, its notification policy, and its consent-based jail access provisions have led \nits immigration population to trust Philadelphia\u2019s police officers and prosecutors, to believe that reporting a crime or \nparticipating as a witness in a trial will not results in that individual or his family being turned over to Case 2:17-cv-\n03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 37 of 132\n 34\n\n ICE, and to view Philadelphia\u2019s law enforcement personnel not as extensions of ICE or as immigration enforcement \nagents, but as persons whose primary job is to keep their families and communities safe from crime. If City officials, \nincluding Philadelphia police officers, were required to affirmatively collect immigration information, this long built \ntrust with the immigrant community would be broken, compromising public safety and pushing a significant \nsegment of Philadelphia\u2019s community into the shadows. Simply put, we would expect crime reporting and witness \nparticipation in criminal proceedings to drop and use of healthcare, education, and other services among segments \nof the immigration population to be reduced.\n\n\n\n Abernathy oversees the day-to-day operations of the City, including public safety departments like police, fire, and \nemergency management, and is responsible for establishing broad policy in fields such as opioid response, \nimmigrant affairs, and homelessness. Through his work, he interacts with Blanche Carney, Commissioner of the \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons. He also testified to enjoying a \u201cprofessional, cooperative relationship\u201d with \nICE\u2014although they \u201ch[ad their] disagreements\u201d\u2014and referenced a recent meeting at which he explained City \npolicy regarding immigrants to ICE officials.\n\n Abernathy testified that as of Friday, October 20, 2017, Philadelphia\u2019s six prisons held some 6,833 inmates, of \nwhom 79% are being held pre-trial, and 17% have been sentenced. Another 2% have been convicted but not \nsentenced, and a further 2% are in some other form of temporary custody. Abernathy several times reiterated that \nonly 17% of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, who are all serving sentences of 23 months or less, have scheduled \nrelease dates.\n\n City law enforcement employ several case management databases, among them the Preliminary Arraignment \nReporting System (PARS), the Automated Fingerprint Information System (AFIS), and the National Crime \nInformation Center (NCIC). Suspects booked by Philadelphia police are fingerprinted. The fingerprints are uploaded \ninto a state system, which Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 38 of 132\n 35\n\n interfaces with federal information, and shared with law enforcement across the country, including ICE. PARS, \nwhich is co-owned by the City, the First Judicial District, and the District Attorney, is an information-sharing system \nfor real-time case updates; although PARS does not contain immigration status information, ICE has had access for \n\u201ca number of years.\u201d A memorandum of understanding with ICE limits access to victim and witness information, \nhowever. Abernathy testified to reading on the ICE website that most ICE detainers were generated from biometric \ndata provided by local law enforcement.\n\n Abernathy stated that the City often receives requests for an inmate to be detained at the behest of another \njurisdiction or agency. Sometimes these are criminal warrants signed by a judge, such as if an inmate were facing \ncharges in another jurisdiction. In other instances, the City receives civil, administrative detainers from ICE, which \nare typically signed by an ICE agent. Between December, 2015 and October 20, 2017, the City received 140 ICE \ndetainer requests. Of these 140 detainers, only four were accompanied by a judicial warrant; all four of these \nindividuals are still in custody. When an immigration detainer request is received, it is placed in the inmate\u2019s file and \nmarked within the prison computer system, which also codes whether the detainer is accompanied by a judicial \nwarrant. Abernathy had heard of only one example of an immigration detainer being sent to local police, which \nmade sense, he said, because police hold an individual only briefly.\n\n Abernathy was familiar with City policies regarding immigration status collection and immigration detainers. He \nstated that Executive Order 8-09 did not prohibit employees from asking about status information, and did not forbid \nemployees from contacting ICE to inquire about an individual\u2019s immigration status, although he did not know why \nanyone would do this. He repeatedly stressed this importance of respecting court orders and warrants, and \ndescribed\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 39 of 132\n 36\n\n issuing a memorandum to Prisons Commissioner Blanche Carney on March 22, 2017 (ECF 1-7) clarifying \nExecutive Order 5-16. That memorandum ordered City prisons to honor all judicial warrants. Pursuant to Executive \nOrder 5-16 and the clarifying memorandum, the City does not hold individuals based on civil ICE detainers alone. \nThe operative question is always whether a judicial warrant was received. He clarified that the City does not honor \nimmigration detainers signed by an immigration judge unaccompanied by a criminal warrant.\n\n When posed with various hypotheticals regarding whether City policies prevented employees from sharing an \nindividual\u2019s status in custody or identifying information, Abernathy frequently seemed puzzled\u2014why was asking \nCity employees necessary when the information was already available to ICE through shared databases? He \n\n\n\nadded that City policies allowed employees to share with ICE an individual\u2019s location, but not that individual\u2019s \nrelease date, unless the request for release date was accompanied by a judicial warrant. Providing advance notice \nof a release date for an unsentenced inmate would also pose administrative burdens and practical problems, \nAbernathy explained, because inmates are often released directly from court or on short notice pursuant to a court \norder.\n\n This spring, Abernathy began hearing reports that ICE had been contacting individual prison wardens in order to \ninterview inmates. In response, the City began sending consent forms to inmates that informed them of their right to \ndecline an ICE interview. The policy was a compromise between advocates, who wanted the City to prohibit all ICE \naccess to prisons, and federal immigration authorities. The City has consent forms only for ICE, Abernathy said, \nbecause only ICE is investigating civil matters. Since the consent form was implemented, ICE has sought to \ninterview three people, two of whom declined interviews, and the last of whom agreed to be interviewed only in the \npresence of a lawyer, at which point ICE cancelled the Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 \n Dr. Farley stressed that he cooperates with federal public health agencies, including the Center for Disease \nControl. The Department, he testified, does not receive Byrne JAG funds.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 42 of 132\n 39\n IX. Review of Sworn Declarations Filed by Defendant in Opposition to Motion\n The declaration of the Acting Assistant Attorney General, Alvin Hanson, sets forth the basic facts of the Byrne AG \nprogram and are not disputed.\n\n The Jim Brown declaration (ECF 28-2), submitted by defendant, sets forth his position as Deputy Assistant Director \nof Enforcement of ICE, and several reasons why ICE desires to have immigrant status information provided by \nstate and local governments. The City objected to part of the Brown declaration and the defendant declined the \nopportunity to present him for live testimony and cross-examination. Therefore, the Court gives low weight to his \ndeclaration. Specifically, Mr. Brown does not at all address the various sources of computer-based information \nthrough which ICE, like the City, has access to immigrant status information, and those who deserve the status of \n\u201ccriminal aliens\u201d\u2013\u2013as to whom Philadelphia policies do not preclude removal. Nor does he discuss specific \nPhiladelphia policies providing exceptions for persons convicted of felony crimes, or for whom there is a judicial \nwarrant. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 43 of 132\n 40\n X. Findings of Fact\n Based on the facts presented by the various declarations summarized above, and the testimony received at the \nhearing on October 26, 2017, the Court makes the following findings of fact:\n\n 1. All of the witnesses called by the City to testify are credible and the Court will give significant weight to their \ntestimony, which is based on their personal knowledge as City officials and/or employees.\n\n 2. The Attorney General\u2019s phrase for certain cities, including Philadelphia, is \u201cSanctuary Cities\u201d\u2013\u2013which this Court \nrejects as a misnomer. Philadelphia is not a sanctuary for anyone involved in criminal conduct, nor is it a sanctuary \nas to any law enforcement investigation, prosecution, or imprisonment after having been found guilty of a crime. \nThe Court does not need a label for Philadelphia\u2019s policies.\n\n 3. The City has a comprehensive criminal justice system reflecting the broad continuum that must deal with crime \nin a large urban setting, ranging from minor offenses for which there is usually very little or no jail time upon \nconviction, but also dealing with recidivist and violent criminals who deserve and receive lengthy prison sentences. \nThis City policy extends through many City agencies, including the police department, responsible for law \nenforcement, through the District Attorney\u2019s Office, and its investigation and prosecution function, through the \nDefender Association and various private attorneys who defend individuals accused of crime, the court system and \nthe prison system which is responsible for custodial maintenance of those sentenced to prison. This continuum \nincludes the probation department and other social service agencies which provide useful services to individuals \nwho may be awaiting trial, or have served any sentence but are still under court supervision, and are re-entering \nsociety.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 44 of 132\n 41\n\n 4. The conditions that the Attorney General has placed on receipt of Byrne JAG grants have no relationship to \nsuccessful police practice or the enforcement of criminal laws in the City. Arrest and prosecution of non-citizens \nwho have committed crimes, is an important part of law enforcement. However, disclosing their immigration status \nto ICE has nothing to do with law enforcement, and will not prevent crime. The City has adopted policies designed \nto improve re-entry, to encourage non-criminal behavior by individuals who were previously convicted of a crime, \nwhether citizens or aliens, and to preserve public health.\n\n 5. The City\u2019s reasons for this were well explained during the testimony, particularly by Police Commissioner Ross, \nDeputy Managing Director Abernathy, and Dr. Farley. Their reasons express valid principles of public health, of \n\n\n\nundue burdensomeness of administrative adherence to the ICE requests, and the reasonable and fact-based belief \nthat giving ICE 48 hours\u2019 notice of release of an immigrant would endanger public safety, and also endanger public \nhealth. The reasons for this are set forth in the testimony and include the concept of rehabilitation once an individual \nleaves a prison setting, the need for individuals to have jobs so they can support themselves and their families, and \nto educate their children, without fear of deportation.\n\n 6. Nonetheless, the City has a firm policy that it will honor judicial warrants and, as various witnesses pointed out, \nICE as a federal law enforcement agency has access to the same national databases as any other law enforcement \nagency, from which ICE can secure information about where an individual subject to removal/deportation, has \nrecorded his or her last known address and other important facts such as medications, continuing of medication for \ncertain diseases, etc.\n\n 7. The 48 hour Notice requirement, if strictly enforced, would impose substantial administrative burdens by City \npersonnel, and may require hiring additional employees, at a Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 45 of 132\n 42\n\n significant but unnecessary cost. The testimony established only 17% of the occupants of Philadelphia City prisons \nare sentenced and have a \u201crelease date.\u201d\n\n 8. In the prison setting, the recent requirement of providing 48 hours\u2019 advance notice would not only create \nadministrative burdens, but would be basically impossible to administer, even with extra personnel. As noted above, \nonly 17% of the inmates in Philadelphia City prisons have actually been sentenced, and would have a release date. \nAs to an inmate who has not been tried, or has been convicted but not been sentenced, or has been sentenced to a \nterm of 24 months or more (and thus will be transported to a state institution), compliance with the 48 hour notice is \nimpossible. The City has no way of knowing the release date of individuals who were in that prison without the \nspecific sentence having been imposed by a judge.\n\n 9. The City\u2019s policy of respecting judicial warrants serves a valid purpose and will enable ICE to fully perform its \nimmigration and law enforcement functions. As noted at the hearing, City law enforcement officials, as well as ICE, \nhave access to national databases that indicate the name, any aliases, and addresses, past, present and future, of \nindividuals, whether citizens or aliens. Thus, ICE really has no need for the City to designate individuals who are \nsubject to a specific release date.\n 10. As to the request for interviews, once again ICE has access to information of criminal aliens who are subject to \ndeportation and can check that database information against the listing of inmates in the Philadelphia prison \nsystem, which is periodically reviewed and updated.\n\n 11. As Commissioner Ross testified, both citizens and non-citizens who happen to be in prison are anxious to get \nout of prison. Most of them want to resume a normal life with a paying job and a constructive family life. The Court \nfinds that if the City were to succumb to the DOJ conditions at issue here, that there would be a marked decrease \nin the provision of City Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 46 of 132\n 43\n services to aliens, whether criminal or otherwise, but not presently in prison, and the overall security and safety of \nmany neighborhoods and communities would suffer.\n\n 12. There is no evidence in the record whatsoever that non-citizens in Philadelphia commit any more crimes than \nthe citizens. In fact, Commissioner Ross testified that Philadelphia born and bred residents are much more \nresponsible for crime in the City of Philadelphia than aliens.\n\n 13. Dr. Farley, Health Commissioner, corroborated this testimony and gave specific examples of how designating \nand publicizing immigration status information, of non-citizen residents would be counterproductive to public health. \nAs one example, there are a number of communicable and infectious diseases prevalent in a large city as \nPhiladelphia at various times, and if infected non-citizens had to disclose their immigrant status and their \naddresses to City agencies, with later disclosure to ICE, they would likely not accept any kind of care where they \n\n\n\nwould have to disclose their non-citizenship status, and thus, there would be a significant exposure of City \nresidents to these diseases. These individuals currently do not have to disclose their non-citizenship status, but if \nthey were required to do so, this would cause spread of an infectious disease much to the detriment of the entire \nCity.\n\n 14. The evidence of record in this case, and considerable research, including newspaper accounts of the \ndiscussions in Congress over \u201cimmigration reform\u201d lead the Court to find that the federal immigration authorities \nhave, for decades, concentrated virtually exclusively on the removal of aliens who have committed crimes. The \nextensive discussion below, of the various immigration provisions, and criminal sanctions for immigration violations, \nshow that the emphasis on federal removal practices is limited to a group that could be fairly described as \u201ccriminal \naliens\u201d \u2013 those non-citizens who have committed serious (felony) crimes while present Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 47 of 132\n 44\n in the United States. The Court has no disagreement whatsoever with these policies, and they are really not \nrelevant for the issues in this case, except that the fact has been established that, over decades, only criminal \naliens have been subject to removal.\n\n 15. The Court agrees with footnote 4 in the City\u2019s proposed findings of fact (ECF 65), that of the estimated 11 \nmillion non-citizen immigrants in the United States, only 8% would be classified as criminal aliens. The policies in \npractice of the federal government for decades have been basically to ignore removal practices against \u201cvisa \noverstayers.\u201d9 However, the breadth, and the generalizations implied in the Attorney General\u2019s conditions, which \nare the subject of the City\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, threaten to include visa overstayers and other non-\ncitizen immigrants who cannot be classified as criminal aliens. Examples of this would be persons arrested for \nminor crimes and not convicted, immigrants arrested and convicted for minor crimes but receiving very minimal \nsentences, and also individuals who may find themselves in prison, having been found in contempt of court for \nfailure to pay child support or similar family court sanctions. None of these groups can be classified as criminal \naliens. Furthermore, as Commissioner Ross explained, some ICE policies seek to use civil \u201cimmigration detainers\u201d \nto require City prisons to detain aliens who have been notified of removal proceedings, irrespective of any status as \na criminal alien, which may reflect a change in the existing policy of non-enforcement as to visa overstayers, but the \nrecord is not clear on this point.\n\n 16. The Court has reviewed the City\u2019s proposed findings of fact (ECF 65), and finds that they accurately reflect the \ncontents of the various memoranda that were discussed by the witnesses at the hearing, and the impact which the \nAttorney General\u2019s conditions would have on\n\n 9 As discussed in more detail below, a first offense of illegal entry into the United States is a misdemeanor, but \nsubsequent convictions are a felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325. This type of alien is generally not included in the term \n\u201ccriminal alien\u201d and in any event does not represent any significant numbers of aliens in Philadelphia. There may be \nsignificantly larger number of illegal entrants in the western United States. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 \nFiled 11/15/17 Page 48 of 132\n 45\n\n these very valid City practices. The Court does not see a need to incorporate in detail all of the provisions of the \nvarious memoranda, but agrees that they establish valid municipal policies, including law enforcement practices, \nand that the decision of the City not to make disclosure of an immigrant\u2019s status on any publicly available reports \nis a sound one, that is not in violation of any federal law, and serves valid public policy and public health principles.\n 17. ICE is legitimately concerned about release of convicted criminal aliens from prison and into a community. The \nPhiladelphia policies provide an exception for any person as to whom a judicial warrant is lodged as a detainer. The \nvarious computer databases described by Police Commissioner Ross provide ample data to ICE to identify criminal \naliens who are situated in Philadelphia prisons for whatever reason. Obtaining a judicial warrant is not a \nburdensome procedure. ICE enforcement officers are well trained in preparing warrants based on \u201cprobable cause\u201d \nas the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides. Numerous United States judicial officers in \n\n\n\nthis court are available on a 24/7 basis to review and approve warrants, which can then be transmitted electronically \nto a Philadelphia prison and lodged as a detainer against an inmate.\n\n 18. The various arguments and reasons that the Attorney General gave for the conditions are refuted by the \ntestimony of the City witnesses. The Attorney General does point out, see Proposed Finding of Fact 42 (ECF 64) \nthat there are certain instances in which Byrne JAG grant money could be used to assist a former prison inmate \nwho is an alien, for whom ICE seeks removal, such as a person not convicted of a felony, and for whom ICE did not \nsecure a judicial warrant. The Court finds these instances are likely to be very few in number and that the beneficial \nlaw enforcement and public health benefits of the City\u2019s policies would outweigh any minor disregard of ICE \npolicies.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 49 of 132\n 46\n\n 19. Based on the foregoing Findings of Facts, and the discussion below, the Court finds that the City is in \nsubstantial compliance with the Challenged Conditions for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant and that it can certify its \ncompliance with Section 1373. Any lack of strict compliance is de minimis, as Philadelphia policies provide no safe \nharbor nor sanctuary for any criminal alien.\n\n 20. Denial of the Byrne JAG grant for FY 2017 would result in irreparable harm. The testimony shows that this \nmoney constitutes 10% of Philadelphia Police budget for non-personnel uses, and this would make a substantial \ninroad on City programs which have depended on the Byrne JAG grants in prior years. Denial will deter crime \nprevention efforts, and also public health efforts, such as fighting the opioid epidemic.\n\n 21. In conclusion, the undersigned notes his experience as an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia, and also \nserving as United States Attorney in this district, which has given me substantial personal experience in the \nworkings of the criminal justice system, the availability of judicial warrants, the cooperation between federal and \nlocal officials, the data contained on computer-based information about criminal histories, of people arrested, likely \nincluding their immigrant status or at least data showing that they are immigrants, and whether legal immigrants, \nor visa overstayers.

The APA and the Challenged Conditions\n\n The APA exempts from rulemaking requirements any \u201cmatter relating to agency management or personnel or to \npublic property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2) (emphasis added). Although this \nexception may have \u201ccreate[d] a serious gap in the procedural protections the APA was enacted to provide,\u201d it is \nclear that the language, \u201cany matter relating to . . . grants,\u201d includes an agency\u2019s imposition of grant conditions. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n v. Snow, 561 F.2d 227, 231 (D.C. Cir. 1976).\n Therefore, grant conditions\u2014such as those at issue in this case\u2014are not subject to the rulemaking requirements of \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, including requirements that the agency publish general notice of proposed rulemaking in the \nFederal Register, \u00a7 553(b) (i.e., notice), and provide interested persons an opportunity to participate in rulemaking \nthrough submission of written data or arguments, \u00a7 553(c) (i.e., comment).10\n The JAG Program\u2019s enabling statute provides for limited procedural protection to be afforded to grant applicants. It \nstates, \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall not finally disapprove any application . . . submitted under this part without first \naffording the applicant reasonable notice of any deficiencies in the application and opportunity for correction and \nreconsideration.\u201d 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10154.\n The JAG Program statute also clearly delegates authority to the Attorney General to \u201cissue rules to carry out this \npart.\u201d 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10155.\n\n Philadelphia does not claim that the Attorney General lacked all authority to promulgate grant conditions, failed to \nprovide a required notice-and-comment period, denied the City notice of\n\n 10 The Supreme Court has cautioned that while \u201c[a]gencies are free to grant additional procedural rights in the \nexercise of their discretion, [] reviewing courts are generally not free to impose them if\u201d the agencies \u201cemployed at \n\n\n\nleast the statutory minima.\u201d Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, \n524, 548 (1978).

Instead, Philadelphia brings three claims under APA \nsection 706, contending that the Attorney General:\n (1) acted in excess of his statutory authority (and contrary to the authorizing federal statute);\n\n (2) violated the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers; and,\n (3) acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n However, before analyzing Philadelphia\u2019s claims, this Court must first determine whether the Attorney General\u2019s \naction is in fact final and reviewable.\n A. Final Agency Action\n First, the Attorney General challenges Philadelphia\u2019s APA claims on the grounds that there has been no \u201cfinal \nagency action\u201d and thus, that the claims are not ripe for this Court\u2019s review. Therefore, the threshold question with \nrespect to the APA claims is whether the DOJ \u201cconsummated its decision-making process\u201d such that the action of \nimposing the grant conditions is \u201cfinal\u201d and therefore ripe for judicial review.\n 1. The Parties\u2019 Contentions\n\n The Attorney General claims that the City\u2019s APA claims are likely to fail because the City\u2019s challenge relates to \nnon-final agency action. The FY 2017 Byrne grant process is still unfolding, without any ultimate decision as to \nwhether Philadelphia will be awarded Byrne funds. According, the Attorney General contends, there has been no \n\u201cconsummation\u201d of DOJ\u2019s decision-making process. The APA does not permit judicial review unless the agency has \nmade a final determination, and as a result, the Attorney General asserts that the City\u2019s APA claims are not yet \nripe.\n\n Philadelphia claims that the agency action\u2014in this case the imposition of the Challenged Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 52 of 132\n 49\n\n Conditions\u2014is final because the Department definitively announced that it \u201cwas going to impose three new \nconditions.\u201d The City points to the Attorney General\u2019s own presentation of facts, which demonstrates that each \nlocality\u2019s FY 2017 Byrne Program award will contain the Challenged Conditions. (See Hanson Decl. &para; 5). \nBecause the Attorney General can impose the new conditions at any time\u2014especially if the nationwide stay is \nreversed in the City of Chicago case\u2014the agency has acted.\n\n 2. The Agency Action at Issue is Final\n \u201cAs a general matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be \u2018final\u2019:\n First, the action must mark the \u2018consummation\u2019 of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process . . . it must not be of a \nmerely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which \u2018rights or obligations have \nbeen determined,\u2019 or from which \u2018legal consequences will flow\u2019 . . . .\u201d\n Ocean Cty. Landfill Corp. v. U.S. E.P.A., Region II, 631 F.3d 652, 655 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 177\u201378 (1997)). The following factors are used to determine whether an agency action is final:\n 1) whether the decision represents the agency's definitive position on the question;\n\n 2) whether the decision has the status of law with the expectation of immediate compliance;\n 3) whether the decision has immediate impact on the day-to-day operations of the party seeking review;\n 4) whether the decision involves a pure question of law that does not require further factual development; and\n 5) whether immediate judicial review would speed enforcement of the relevant act.\n Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of N.J. v. Corrigan, 347 F.3d 57, 69 (3d Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n The Court agrees with Philadelphia that the Attorney General has decided to impose the Challenged Conditions on \napplicants for JAG Program funds, and that the decision is one from Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 53 of 132\n 50\n which legal consequences will flow. The Attorney General\u2019s decision to impose the conditions \u201crepresents the \nagency's definitive position on the question,\u201d such that it is now \u201cfinal\u201d and ripe for this Court\u2019s review. Corrigan, 347 \nF.3d at 69; see Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967).\n\n B. The City\u2019s Challenges under APA Section 706\n In reviewing agency action, this Court must use the defined \u201cScope of Review\u201d contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. \nSection 706 states in relevant part:\n To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of \nlaw, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an \nagency action. The reviewing court shall\u2014\n\n (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\u2014\n (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\n (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; or\n (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;\n\n For reasons that will become clearer below, this Court will analyze the City\u2019s claims pursuant to Section 706 in the \nfollowing order:\n (1) The Attorney General acted in excess of statutory authority;\n\n (2) The Attorney General acted arbitrarily and capriciously; and\n (3) The Attorney General acted contrary to the Constitution.\n 1. Statutory Authority\n\n The Attorney General cites to two different statutory provisions as purported authorization of the Challenged \nConditions. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 54 of 132\n 51\n The first is 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6), which authorizes the Assistant Attorney General (\u201cAAG\u201d) of OJP to \u201cplac[e] \nspecial conditions on all grants\u201d and to \u201cdetermin[e] priority purposes for formula grants.\u201d The Attorney General \nclaims that this section authorizes all three Challenged Conditions. The second source of statutory authorization \nclaimed by the Attorney General is 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D), which requires JAG Program applicants to include a \n\u201ccertification\u201d that \u201cthe applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\u201d \nThe Attorney General claims that this section authorizes the Certification Condition.\n Below, each of the bases for statutory authority is addressed in turn.\n a) \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d Authorization\n The Attorney General claims authority to impose all three of the Challenged Conditions under 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10102(a)(6), which states in relevant part:\n The Assistant Attorney General shall . . . exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the \nAssistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing \nspecial conditions on all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.\n (1) The Parties\u2019 Contentions\n\n The City claims that this provision does not provide any independent basis of authority to the AAG\u2014let alone the \nAttorney General himself\u2014because the statute states plainly that the AAG is empowered only with that authority \nconferred by \u201cthis chapter\u201d or \u201cby delegation.\u201d\n\n The Attorney General contends that the City\u2019s reading would render a portion of the provision superfluous, and \ntherefore, the reading cannot be correct. Instead, the Attorney General reads the provision as a conferral of \u201cbroad \npower,\u201d limited only by the Constitution and jurisdictions\u2019 ability to reject overly demanding obligations.\n\n\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 55 of 132\n 52\n\n (2) Section 10102(a)(6) Does Not Authorize Any Challenged Condition\n This Court concludes that reading 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) as a conferral of authority on the Attorney General to \nimpose the Challenged Conditions would require this Court to overlook several impediments.\n First, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6)\u2019s grant of authority to the AAG is located in a different subchapter from the Byrne \nProgram.\n Second, the statute does not state that it applies 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) to the rest of the chapter, let alone to the \nByrne Program. Chapter 101\u2014in which the JAG Program and 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) both appear\u2014relates to \ngrants for wide-ranging topics such a residential substance abuse treatment and criminal child support \nenforcement. If 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) were found to apply to the JAG Program, such grants would also be \nsubject to conditions under the Attorney General\u2019s purported \u201cbroad power,\u201d an interpretation which, according to \nthe Attorney General, would be limited only by the Constitution and the prospect of state and local jurisdictions \nrejecting the condition\u2014an apparent toppling of Congress\u2019s appropriations to those programs.\n Third, if 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) were to apply to the Byrne Program, it would render superfluous the explicit \nstatutory authority Congress gave to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (\u201cBJA\u201d) on other BJA grants. \nSee id. \u00a7 10142(B) (\u201cThe Director shall have the following duties: . . . Establishing programs . . . [and] awarding and \nallocating funds . . . on terms and conditions determined by the Director to be consistent with Part B of subchapter \nV of this chapter\u201d).\n\n Fourth, Congress delegated authority to impose conditions on other grants in the same chapter, and did so clearly. \nSee, e.g., id. \u00a7 10446(e)(3) (In the subsection relating to grants for efforts to combat violence against women, it \nstates, \u201c[i]n disbursing grants under this subchapter, Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page \n56 of 132\n 53\n the Attorney General may impose reasonable conditions on grant awards to ensure that the States meet statutory, \nregulatory, and other program requirements.\u201d). \u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d Russello v. U.S., 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983). What is more, \u201c[w]e do \nnot lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to \napply, and our reluctance is even greater when Congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows \nhow to make such a requirement manifest.\u201d Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enf\u2019t, 543 U.S. 335, 341 (2005).\n Fifth, Congress is unlikely to ground the Attorney General\u2019s authority to impose substantive conditions in a \nsubsection dedicated to conferring power on the AAG.\n\n Sixth, the term \u201cspecial conditions\u201d referred to in the subsection\u2013\u2013which states that the \u201cpowers and functions\u201d \nvested in the AAG \u201cinclud[e] placing special conditions on all grants,\u201d id. \u00a7 10153(a)(6)\u2013\u2013is a term of art for \nconditions intended for \u201chigh-risk grantees\u201d with difficulty adhering to existing grant requirements. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n66.12(a) (in effect from Mar. 11, 1988 to Dec. 25, 2014) (listing possible problems as justifying \u201cspecial conditions,\u201d \nincluding that the grantee \u201c[i]s not financially stable\u201d); see also, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.10 (defining \u201cspecial conditions\u201d for \nthe Department of Agriculture); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.12 (same for the Department of Education); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.14 (same \nfor the Department of Health and Human Services); see also Brief of Amici Curiae ACLU, National Immigrant \nJustice Center, et al., at 11\u201313.\n Thus, it is clear that \u00a7 10102(a)(6) was not intended to confer upon the Attorney General the authority to impose \nthe Challenged Conditions.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 57 of 132\n 54\n b) \u201cAll Other Applicable Federal Laws\u201d Authorization\n The Attorney General contends that, independent of the authority conferred to the AAG in 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102, a \nseparate source of authority supports the Section 1373 Certification Condition, namely 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D), \nwhich states:\n\n\n\n To request a grant under this part, the chief executive officer of a State or unit of local government shall submit an \napplication to the Attorney General within 120 days after the date on which funds to carry out this part are \nappropriated for a fiscal year, in such form as the Attorney General may require. Such application shall include the \nfollowing:\n [...]\n (5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed by the chief executive officer of \nthe applicant (or by another officer of the applicant, if qualified under regulations promulgated by the Attorney \nGeneral), that\u2014\n [...]\n (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\n (Emphasis added).\n (1) The Parties\u2019 Contentions\n\n The City asserts that while Section 1373 is a Federal law, it is not an applicable Federal law. While acknowledging \nthat the phrase \u201capplicable Federal laws\u201d is not defined in the statute, the City states that the most reasonable \ninterpretation is that the phrase refers to Federal laws that \u201cdirectly speak to recipients on federal funds.\u201d This \ninterpretation is reinforced, it contends, by the fact that it is a \u201cresidual\u201d term within the longer phrase, \u201call provisions \nof this part and all other applicable Federal laws,\u201d such that the residual term is limited by the qualities of the \nspecific term. (See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D)). Thus, the City asserts, the term \u201call other applicable Federal laws\u201d \nshould be interpreted as \u201creferring to other federal statutes that, similarly, impose requirements on federal \ngrantees.\u201d\n\n In furtherance of its argument that the Section 1373 Certification Condition goes beyond Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 58 of 132\n 55\n\n the Attorney General\u2019s statutory authorization, the City compares the Byrne statute to other federal statutes in \nwhich Congress conferred discretion upon the executive branch to add substantive conditions to federal grants or \nestablish criteria for grant distribution that go beyond the stated text or purpose of the statute. The City also \nhighlights that Congress made delegations of the same kind to the DOJ and Attorney General for other grant \nprograms codified in the same Chapter of Title 34 as the Byrne Program.\n\n Philadelphia also suggests that reading 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153 to allow the Attorney General to create conditions, such \nas the Section 1373 Certification Condition, would upend the formula approach that Congress created for \ndistributing Byrne funds based on jurisdictions\u2019 populations and rates of violent crime, because it would permit the \nAttorney General to substitute his preferred criteria for the express statistical criteria Congress established. The \nCity points to the stated purpose of the JAG Program\u2014to fund local criminal justice agencies to implement \nprograms that, in their view, will assist in criminal justice efforts\u2014in order to emphasize that Congress did not intend \nto confer discretion in the hands of the Attorney General to impose the Certification Condition.\n\n The City also contends that the legislative history of the Byrne statute and Section 1373 confirm that the \nCertification Condition exceeds the Attorney General\u2019s authority. Citing the legislative purposes of the Byrne \nProgram\u2019s two predecessor statutes, as well as that of the Byrne Program itself, the City asserts that Congress did \nnot intend to authorize the Attorney General to override the flexible use of funds by state and local governments as \nthey believe best suit their own criminal justice systems. Moreover, the City urges the Court to make a \u201cnegative \ninference\u201d that Congress did not intend for Section 1373 certification to be a requirement for receipt of Byrne funds \nbecause Congress has proposed and subsequently rejected provisions in several bills that Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 59 of 132\n 56\n would have tied Section 1373 compliance to eligibility for Byrne funds and other federal grants.\n\n Philadelphia also asserts that the Section 1373 Certification Condition departs radically from the Attorney General\u2019s \nhistorical practice because Section 1373 is not substantively \u201capplicable\u201d to the Byrne Program\u2019s focus on \n\n\n\nstrengthening criminal justice systems. The City contends that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cnew interpretation\u201d of the \nByrne statute would substantially expand the DOJ\u2019s authority without clear congressional authorization.\n\n Contrary to the City, which views Section 1373 as a Federal law that is not \u201capplicable,\u201d the Attorney General \nasserts that the term \u201capplicable laws\u201d has been interpreted broadly by federal courts and that the most natural \nreading of the provision is that \u201capplicable Federal laws\u201d refers to all federal laws that actually apply independently \nto JAG Program grantees. For example, the Attorney General contends that because all grantees are state and \nlocal jurisdictions, \u201capplicable\u201d could mean that the DOJ cannot require those jurisdictions to certify compliance with \nFederal laws that apply only to private individuals.\n\n The Attorney General also disputes the City\u2019s contention that the imposition of the Section 1373 Certification \nCondition would run contrary to the JAG Program\u2019s purpose of enabling state and local jurisdictions to use JAG \nProgram funds in furtherance of their own criminal justice prerogatives. According to the Attorney General, because \nthe Certification Condition relates to eligibility to receive funds, rather than directing how a grantee must spend the \nfunds received, it does not contravene Congress\u2019s stated purpose for the JAG Program. In fact, the Attorney \nGeneral contends, the Section 1373 Certification Condition does even less to mandate a universal approach than, \nfor example, the annual requirement attached to Byrne funds that prohibits the use of award funds to purchase \nvarious types of equipment and weapons.\n\n Moreover, the Attorney General asserts that the Section 1373 Certification Condition is Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 60 of 132\n 57\n consistent with the historical discretionary conditions that the DOJ has imposed, such as the equipment and \nweapons restriction mentioned above and requirements that certain training be completed for law enforcement task \nforces in jurisdictions that receive Byrne funds.\n\n Lastly, the Attorney General asserts that the City\u2019s citation of various statutes in which Congress delegated to \nagencies the discretionary power to impose grant conditions shows nothing more than that Congress routinely \ndelegates such power using a variety of textual formulations.\n\n Lastly, the Attorney General cautions the Court not to credit the City\u2019s argument that a \u201cnegative inference\u201d can be \ndrawn by Congress\u2019s repeated consideration and rejection of bill provisions that would have tied Byrne and other \nfederal grant eligibility to Section 1373 compliance.\n\n (2) Section 10153(a)(5)(D) May Authorize The Certification Condition\n The statutory language is far from unambiguous as it applies to the present case, as it is unclear whether Congress \nintended to permit the Attorney General to require certification from JAG Program applicants on \u201cFederal laws\u201d in \ncontexts beyond the awarding of federal grants. It is clear that the present case is not guided by the first part of \nsubsection (D), requiring certification of compliance with \u201call provisions of this part,\u201d as Section 1373 is not \ncontained within the same Part as 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D). Therefore, whether the Certification Condition falls \ninside or outside the Attorney General\u2019s Congressionally-delegated authority turns on the phrase, \u201call other \napplicable Federal laws.\u201d\n\n This Court agrees with the Court in City of Chicago v. Sessions, insofar as that Court found that \u201c[b]oth positions \nare plausible.\u201d 2017 WL 4081821, at *7. However, because this Court rests its decision to grant the motion for \npreliminary injunction on other grounds, it need not conclude at this time whether the Attorney General acted \noutside his delegated authority. It Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 61 of 132\n 58\n suffices to say that the question is a \u201cclose call.\u201d\n\n 2. Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n The APA requires this Court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In many \n\n\n\ncases, an agency\u2019s findings and conclusions are well-documented as part of formal rulemaking, notice-and-\ncomment requirements, and associated hearings. However, as mentioned above, none of those procedures are \nrequired here, because the City is challenging grant conditions.\n a) The Parties\u2019 Contentions\n\n The City claims that the Attorney General\u2019s imposition of the Challenged Conditions was arbitrary and capricious. \nFirst, it contends that the DOJ deviated from its prior practice of granting Byrne funds without any requirements of \nthis type and without any sound reason or explanation. Second, it claims that the DOJ failed to rely on reasoned \ndecision-making in reaching its decision to impose the Challenged Conditions. Third, the City contends that the \njustifications offered by the Attorney General in public statements run counter to the testimonials provided by \nseveral jurisdictions evidencing that the policies promote rather than detract from effective policing. Lastly, the City \ncriticizes the DOJ for failing to release reports, studies, or analysis in support of the Challenged Conditions.\n\n The Attorney General asserts that the City\u2019s claims that the DOJ acted in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner are \nlikely to fail because the standard for review is unexacting and the connection between criminal justice funding and \nthe Challenged Conditions is apparent under DOJ\u2019s \u201ccommon-sense rationale.\u201d Because, the Attorney General \ncontends, federal immigration enforcement undoubtedly intersects with criminal justice, conditioning Byrne funding \non Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 62 of 132\n 59\n\n compliance with Section 1373 passes the low standard of review applied to claims of arbitrary and capricious \nagency action. Moreover, the Attorney General asserts that the Inspector General report finding deteriorating local \ncooperation with \u201cefforts to remove undocumented criminal aliens from the United States,\u201d (ECF 1-10, at 1-2 n. 1), \njustifies the Certification Condition.\n An agency\u2019s departure from prior practice can serve as a basis for finding an agency\u2019s interpretation to be arbitrary \nand capricious, so long as the change in policy constitutes an \u201cunexplained inconsistency.\u201d Nat\u2019l Cable & \nTelecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005); see also Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42\u201343; Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117 (2016); \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). However, where Courts found that an agency\u2019s \npolicy shift were found to constitute an \u201cunexplained inconsistency,\u201d the agencies had an explicit rule in place, only \nto later issue the opposite rule with limited or no explanation. See, e.g., Encino, 136 S. Ct. at 2123 (Department of \nLabor reversed its rule that service advisors at automobile dealers were exempt from overtime payments under the \nFair Labor Standards Act, but \u201cgave little explanation for its decision\u201d); Motor Vehicles, 463 U.S. at 35 (\u201cBriefly \nsummarized, we hold that the agency failed to present an adequate basis and explanation for rescinding the \npassive restraint requirement and that the agency must either consider the matter further or adhere to or amend \n[the rule] along lines which its analysis supports.\u201d). Importantly, an agency \u201cneed not demonstrate to a court\u2019s \nsatisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one . . . it suffices that the \nnew policy is permissible under the statute . . . .\u201d FCC, 556 U.S. at 515.\n\n Nonetheless, \u201can agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions.\u201d Encino, 136 S. Ct. at 2125. An agency \n\u201cmust examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document \n74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 63 of 132\n 60\n its action including rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle, 463 U.S. at \n43. An agency\u2019s action is not considered the result of \u201creasoned decision-making\u201d when the agency:\n 1. \u201chas relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider,\u201d\n\n 2. \u201centirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,\u201d\n 3. \u201coffered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or\u201d\n 4. Provides a justification that \u201cis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product \nof agency expertise.\u201d\n Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n Notably, a claim based on the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is accorded a \u201cnarrow standard of review\u201d under \nwhich \u201ca court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \n502, 513\u201314 (2009).\n The Attorney General points to three public explanations to demonstrate that the DOJ articulated \u201cadequate \nreasons for its decisions\u201d to impose the three conditions.\n First, the DOJ issued a \u201cBackgrounder on Grant Requirements\u201d on July 25, 2017. (ECF 1, Ex. 1).\n Second, the Attorney General issued a press release, also on July 25, 2017. See DOJ Press Release No. 17-826.\n Third, the Attorney General points to a May, 2016 memorandum, discussed previously, in which the Office of the \nInspector General presents findings to DOJ on local and state compliance with Section 1373.\n\n As demonstrated below, the three items that the Attorney General cites as evincing \u201cadequate reasons for [DOJ\u2019s] \ndecisions,\u201d Encino, 136 S. Ct. at 2125, do not \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for [DOJ\u2019s] action.\u201d Motor \nVehicle, 463 U.S. at 43. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 64 of 132\n 61\n b) The \u201cBackgrounder on Grant Requirements\u201d\n The Backgrounder explained that the new conditions have a \u201cgoal of increasing information sharing between \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement\u201d so that \u201cfederal immigration authorities have the information they need to \nenforce the law and keep our communities safe.\u201d (ECF 1, Exh. 1). The Backgrounder continued:\n These common-sense measures will improve the flow of information between federal, state, and local law \nenforcement, and help keep our communities safe. Every year, the Department of Justice awards billions of dollars \nin grants to state and local jurisdictions across the United States. Unfortunately, some of these jurisdictions have \nadopted policies and regulations that frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration law, including by refusing to \ncooperate with federal immigration authorities in information sharing about illegal aliens who commit crimes.\n These measures will also prevent the counterproductive use of federal funds for policies that frustrate federal \nimmigration enforcement. By refusing to communicate with the federal officials, these jurisdictions jeopardize the \nsafety of their residents and undermine the Department\u2019s ability to protect the public and reduce crime and violence.\n The Backgrounder demonstrates DOJ\u2019s concerns with:\n 1. jurisdictions that \u201crefus[e] to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in information sharing about illegal \naliens who commit crimes,\u201d\n\n 2. the \u201cuse of federal funds for policies that frustrate federal immigration enforcement,\u201d and\n 3. \u201cjurisdictions [that] jeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the Department\u2019s ability to protect the \npublic and reduce crime and violence.\u201d\n These are reasonable goals, and, to the extent authorized by statute and the Constitution, the Attorney General \nmay impose conditions on grant money based on these goals so long as there is a \u201crational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle, 463 U.S. at 43. However, certifying compliance with Section 1373 \ndoes not have a rational connection\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 65 of 132\n 62\n with these goals.\n With respect to the first concern of the Backgrounder\u2014reducing or eliminating the flow of Byrne funds to \njurisdictions that do not share information about illegal aliens who commit crimes\u2014Section 1373 is far too broad. By \nits plain language, Section 1373 is not limited to illegal aliens who commit crimes.\n\n Section 1373(a), for example, states that a \u201clocal government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way \nrestrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [INS] information regarding the \ncitizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, it explicitly \nencompasses United States citizens as well as immigrants with lawful status.\n\n Section 1373(b) suffers the same inadequacy by referencing \u201clawful\u201d immigrants, stating that \u201cno person or \nagency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the \n\n\n\nfollowing with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual: Sending \nsuch information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, [INS] . . . .\u201d\n\n Section 1373(c) does not obligate state and local jurisdictions to perform any task. Instead it directs its focus at INS \nitself, stating that \u201cINS shall respond to an inquiry by [agencies] seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or \nimmigration status of any individual . . . .\u201d Therefore, when a state or city like Philadelphia certifies compliance with \nSection 1373, they functionally only certify compliance with 1373(a) and (b), which, as mentioned above, are far too \nbroadly drawn to find their justification in information-sharing regarding illegal immigrants who commit crimes.\n\n The Backgrounder\u2019s second concern also appears to be a valid objective, yet not Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 66 of 132\n 63\n\n accomplished by the Certification Condition. If DOJ were to impose a condition prohibiting the \u201cuse of federal funds \nfor policies that frustrate federal immigration enforcement,\u201d that would be an example of a rule geared towards that \nend. However, the Attorney General\u2019s Certification condition does not restrict the use of Byrne funds based on \nwhether the funds are used to frustrate the ends of federal immigration enforcement. Instead, practically speaking, \nthe Certification Condition prevents the flow of Byrne funds to jurisdictions that the DOJ deems to be non-compliant \nwith Section 1373, which, as mentioned above, includes immigration status information about United States \ncitizens. And at the risk of stating the obvious, United States citizens are not subject to federal immigration \nenforcement. It would strain credulity\u2014and the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard\u2014if this Court were to find that \nthe Certification Condition furthers DOJ\u2019s goal of prohibiting \u201cuse of federal funds for policies that frustrate federal \nimmigration enforcement.\u201d For example, if the Certification Condition is imposed, the City will not be able to obtain \nfunding for naloxone to treat opioid overdoses. This alone demonstrates that the Certification condition is geared \nnot towards the use of Byrne funds, but rather the user of Byrne funds.\n\n The third concern expressed in the DOJ\u2019s Backgrounder is that, through lack of cooperation with federal \nimmigration authorities, \u201cjurisdictions jeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the Department\u2019s ability \nto protect the public and reduce crime and violence.\u201d However, DOJ has not anywhere asserted that there is a link \nbetween localities maintaining as confidential the immigration status of non-criminal aliens or citizens and increases \nin crime and violence. If anything, Philadelphia has demonstrated through testimony that the policies it has \nimplemented encourage immigrants to seek medical services that prevent the spread of communicable diseases, \nreport crime, and apprehend criminal suspects who may recidivate and Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 \nFiled 11/15/17 Page 67 of 132\n 64\n\n harm other residents. Philadelphia has also demonstrated that those who commit crime in the City are not given \n\u201csanctuary\u201d by virtue of their immigration status. In light of the evidence that Philadelphia has presented, and the \nlack of any contrary evidence cited by the Attorney General, this Court cannot find a link between, on one hand, \nimposing the Certification Condition, and on the other hand, \u201cprotect[ing] the public and reduc[ing] crime and \nviolence.\u201d\n In summary, no objective discussed in the Backgrounder justifies the Certification Condition.\n c) The July 25, 2017 Press Release\n Next, this Court considers the Attorney General\u2019s second source in seeking to demonstrate that the DOJ \narticulated \u201cadequate reasons for its decisions\u201d to impose the three conditions. See DOJ Press Release No. 17-\n826. The release stated that the new conditions were aimed at \u201cincreas[ing] information sharing between federal, \nstate, and local law enforcement,\u201d as well as \u201censuring that federal immigration authorities have the information they \nneed to enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe.\u201d It continued:\n\n So-called \u201csanctuary' policies make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and protect \nillegal aliens who have committed crimes,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. \u201cThese policies also encourage \nillegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live \noutside the law. This can have tragic consequences, like the 10 deaths we saw in San Antonio this weekend. As \n\n\n\npart of accomplishing the Department of Justice's top priority of reducing violent crime, we must encourage these \n'sanctuary' jurisdictions to change their policies and partner with federal law enforcement to remove criminals. From \nnow on, the Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to cities and states that comply with federal law, allow \nfederal immigration access to detention facilities, and provide 48 hours notice [sic] before they release an illegal \nalien wanted by federal authorities. This is consistent with long-established cooperative principles among law \nenforcement agencies. This is what the American people should be able to expect from their cities and states, and \nthese long overdue requirements will help us take Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 68 \nof 132\n 65\n down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs, and make our country safer.\n Id. The Press Release thus makes the following claims, without any support whatsoever:\n 1. \u201cSanctuary policies\u201d make \u201call of us less safe,\u201d\n\n 2. \u201cSanctuary policies\u201d \u201cprotect illegal aliens who have committed crimes,\u201d\n 3. \u201cSanctuary policies\u201d \u201cencourage illegal immigration\u201d and \u201chuman trafficking,\u201d\n\n 4. \u201cSanctuary policies\u201d \u201cperpetuat[e] the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law,\u201d\n 5. \u201cSanctuary policies\u201d led to \u201cthe 10 deaths we saw in San Antonio,\u201d [apparently referring to the then-recent deaths \nof ten Mexican and Guatemalan nationals who attempted to illegally cross the border in the back of a poorly \nventilated tractor-trailer]\n 6. \u201cEncourag[ing] these \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d to change their policies\u201d is \u201cpart of the [DOJ\u2019s] top priority of \nreducing violence crime,\u201d\n 7. The Challenged Conditions are \u201cconsistent with long-established cooperative principles among law enforcement \nagencies,\u201d\n 8. The Challenged Conditions \u201cwill help us take down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs,\u201d and,\n 9. The Challenged Conditions \u201cmake our country safer.\u201d\n\n Claims 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 all parrot the third \u201cconcern\u201d in the Backgrounder, i.e., that, through lack of cooperation \nwith federal immigration authorities, \u201cjurisdictions jeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the \nDepartment\u2019s ability to protect the public and reduce crime and violence.\u201d Backgrounder at 1. However, as \nexplained in the prior discussion about that concern, DOJ has not anywhere demonstrated a link between localities \nmaintaining as confidential the immigration status of non-criminal aliens or citizens and increases in crime and \nviolence, let alone \u201cillegal immigration\u201d and \u201chuman trafficking.\u201d See Claim #3. Nonetheless, Section 1373 prohibits \ncities from protecting immigration status, including as it pertains to lawful immigrants and citizens.\n\n Claims 2 and 4 are factually untrue in Philadelphia: the City\u2019s policies do not protect illegal Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 69 of 132\n 66\n aliens who commit crimes. Criminal aliens are not shielded from criminal prosecution or from federal immigration \nauthorities.\n\n While true in the most abstract sense, Claim 7 is untrue in this particular circumstance. \u201c[S]ince 1996, the United \nStates government has never sought to enforce [Section 1373] against a state or local government,\u201d and neither the \nDOJ nor any other agency has made compliance with Section 1373 a requirement of receiving a federal grant. \nElizabeth M. McCormick, Federal Anti-Sanctuary Law: A Failed Approach to Immigration Enforcement and a Poor \nSubstitute for Real Reform, 20 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 165, 170 (2016). Even if the Certification condition were \nconsidered \u201cconsistent with\u201d principles of cooperation between agencies, DOJ lacks the requisite \u201cadequate \nreasons\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis this particular condition.\n d) The 2016 OIG Report\n Third, the Attorney General seeks to justify the Certification Condition based on a memorandum from May, 2016, in \nwhich the OIG presents findings to DOJ on compliance with Section 1373 from local and state jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n That report, in summary, advised that local cooperation had \u201cdeteriorated\u201d with respect to \u201cefforts to remove \nundocumented criminal aliens from the United States,\u201d and proposed\u2013\u2013among other ideas\u2013\u2013that the DOJ \u201cprovide \nclear guidance to grant recipients regarding whether Section 1373 is an \u2018applicable federal law\u2019 that recipients \nwould be expected to comply with in order to satisfy relevant grant rules and regulations.\u201d (ECF 1, Ex. 10). Notably, \nthe memorandum did not purport to assess the wisdom of such a proposal and its effect on immigration policy or \ncriminal justice; instead, the memorandum\u2019s scope was limited to assessing whether jurisdictions that received \ngrant awards were in fact complying with Section 1373. The Attorney General cannot justify the Certification on a \ntautology; a report concluding that many jurisdictions are not Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 70 of 132\n 67\n complying with Section 1373 does not justify imposing a condition requiring those jurisdictions to certify compliance \nwith Section 1373. Because the OIG memorandum did not assess the benefits or drawbacks of imposing a \ncondition, but instead merely assessed whether jurisdictions would be compliant were such a condition imposed, \nthe memorandum does not justify the imposition of the Certification Condition.\n\n Therefore, DOJ has failed to \u201cgive adequate reasons for its decisions,\u201d Encino, 136 S. Ct. at 2125, by \u201cexamin[ing] \nthe relevant data and articulat[ing] a satisfactory explanation for its action including rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made,\u201d Motor Vehicle, 463 U.S. at 43. DOJ also \u201centirely failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem\u201d by failing to recognize how Section 1373 interferes with local policies that promote public \nhealth and safety, and \u201coffered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.\u201d \nId. Its justifications cannot \u201cbe ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d Id. In sum, this \nCourt concludes that the Certification Condition is arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n 3. Constitutionality of Conditions\n\n The APA also requires this Court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to \nbe contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B). As further discussed below, \nPhiladelphia asserts that the grant conditions imposed by the Attorney General violate principles of Federalism and \nthe Separation of Powers, and more specifically, the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment.\n\n One aspect of the City\u2019s Spending Clause challenge is based on the purported lack of \u201crelatedness\u201d between the \nChallenged Conditions and the JAG Program, as the Challenged Conditions pertain to Federal civil immigration \nenforcement and the JAG Program pertains to Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 71 of \n132\n 68\n local criminal justice enforcement. In assessing this \u201crelatedness\u201d challenge, this Court is mindful of the many ways \nin which the areas of immigration law and criminal law intersect, addressed below.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 72 of 132\n 69\n XII. The Intersection between Criminal Law and Immigration Law\n Public discourse about aliens and crime takes many forms, including fact, fear, and hyperbole. All governments \n(federal, state and local), have a legitimate interest in arresting and prosecuting those aliens (and all others) who \ncommit crimes. A crucial theme running through federal law, and this case, is the bright line drawn between aliens \nwho commit crimes and those aliens who live here as law abiding in all respects.\n Arizona v. U.S. is a major case which has led this Court to several legal conclusions. Arizona addressed the \nconstitutional validity of pieces of an Arizona state law, S.B. 1070. Specifically, the Court reviewed two provisions \nthat imposed criminal liability on the violation of particular federal immigration laws, and two provisions that \nexpanded local investigative authority over immigration law compliance. Arizona, 567 U.S. 387, 393-94 (2012).\n The federal government filed suit against the state of Arizona seeking to enjoin the state law as preempted by \nfederal law. Ultimately, the Court held that three provisions were preempted, but one provision was not preempted. \nId. at 400-415.\n Congress has exclusive power to enact immigration laws. Federal law provides for the removal of noncitizens \nwithin U.S. borders who are determined to be \u201cdeportable\u201d as defined by statute, and of noncitizens apprehended at \n\n\n\nthe border who are determined to be \u201cinadmissible.\u201d11 A formal determination of whether an individual is deportable \nor inadmissible is made by an Immigration Judge at a removal proceeding, which is a civil, not criminal, proceeding \nand must adhere to legal procedures set out by statute.\n Arizona clarified that \u201c[a]s a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain\n 11 A noncitizen who is apprehended within U.S. borders may also be determined to be inadmissible. Such an \nindividual will not be subject to removal as a consequence of this finding, but will be barred from reentering the \ncountry if she leaves voluntarily, and will be barred from adjusting her immigration status while she remains in the \nU.S. This is addressed below.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 73 of 132\n 70\n present in the United States.\u201d Id. at 407 (citing INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984)).\n The grounds for deportability and inadmissibility are defined by statute. They are numerous. Involvement in \ncriminal activity is the most common ground. Unlawful presence in the United States is another. Practically, though, \nthe statutory framework is just the beginning. In practice, for decades, the federal government has pursued only \nlimited aspects of the far-ranging grounds for removal. The Court in Arizona stated, \u201cDiscretion in the enforcement \nof immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for \nexample, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime.\u201d Id. at 396.\n The broad statutory bases for removal are reviewed below, with a particular focus on criminal grounds for removal. \nThis is followed by a review of changing federal immigration policy priorities over time, which has dictated the \nparticularized enforcement regime that has emerged.\n A. Lawfully Present versus Unlawfully Present Noncitizens\n As an initial matter, noncitizens living in the United States fall into one of two categories: those who are present \nlawfully, and those who are present unlawfully.\n Lawful presence turns on the formal permission of the federal government. This permission comes in many forms. \nLawful permanent residents (\u201cLPRs\u201d), also known as Green Card holders for the documentation associated with \nLPR status,12 are broadly permitted to live\n\n 12 There are several bases of eligibility for obtaining a green card: through a U.S. citizen family member; through \nemployment, a category reserved for skilled workers and other special professionals; pursuant to membership in \ncertain categories of immigrants, including religious workers, members of the international media, and abused and \nneglected children; through a former grant of asylum or refugee status; through a former award of a visa due to an \nindividual\u2019s identity as a human trafficking victim or a crime victim; through one\u2019s identity as a victim of abuse, \naccording to certain standards; and through an additional handful of very specific bases for eligibility. USCIS, Green\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 74 of 132\n 71\n\n and work in the U.S. indefinitely, and are permitted to freely travel across U.S. borders.13 USCIS, Green Card, \nUSCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/greencard. Visa holders are a second category of lawfully present noncitizens. Visa \nholders live legally in the United States pursuant to the terms of their particular visa, which variously impose \ndifferent restrictions related to travel and employment, and provide for varying lengths of legal residence.14 \nNoncitizens who have been granted refugee or asylum status, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1157\u201358, are two additional \nclasses of noncitizens present lawfully in the United States.\n Noncitizens who have no grant of permission to live in the United States are present unlawfully. More specifically, \nthose who have entered the United States without inspection by immigration officials and without authorization are \npresent unlawfully and can be prosecuted criminally.15 However, the Supreme Court has specifically held that \nnoncitizens who remain in the United States beyond the expiration of their visa (\u201cvisa over-stayers\u201d) have not \ncommitted any crime.16 Arizona v. U.S., 567 U.S. 387, 407 (2012). However, these individuals are nonetheless \npresent in the U.S. unlawfully. Thus, under existing laws they are technically both deportable and\n\n Card Eligibility Categories,            https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/eligibility-categories.\n\n\n 13 If an LPR travels abroad for longer than one full year, she must obtain a reentry permit. USCIS, After a Green \nCard is Granted,            https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted#Reminders.\n\n 14 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 sets out rules for the allocation of three types of visas: visas for family members of U.S. citizens \nand LPRs; employment-based visas; and diversity visas, which are reserved for immigrants from countries with \nhistorically low rates of immigration to the United States. Within each of these general categories there are several \nsubtypes of visas. For example, there are several different type of employment-based visas available divided \namong five different categories of preference depending on an individual\u2019s skill and training in their field of \nemployment. U.S. Department of State-Bureau of Consular Affairs, Employment-Based Immigration Visa,            \n 16 Notably, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253 makes it a criminal act for any deportable noncitizen against whom a final order of \nremoval is outstanding to remain in the United States by refusing to leave, failing to obtain the documents \nnecessary to do so, failing to present himself for removal at the time and place ordered by the Attorney General, or \nto take any action to prevent his or her departure. It is not a criminal act, however, for a technically removable \nnoncitizen who is not subject to a final order of removal to remain in the United States. As discussed, infra, before \nsuch an order becomes final there are several opportunities to appeal. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 \nFiled 11/15/17 Page 75 of 132\n 72\n inadmissible and are therefore removable from the country.\n A crucial issue, ignored by much discussion of immigration policy, past, present and future, is whether a non-citizen \nhas committed specific types of crimes. If so, consistent Executive branch practice for decades has focused on \nremoval of people who are \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d The very few who are not criminal aliens but subject to removal in \npractice turns on many additional factors that go beyond mere unlawful presence. These factors are important in \ndetermining some of the issues in this case.\n \u201cFederalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts the principle that both the National and State Governments \nhave elements of sovereignty the other is bound to respect.\u201d Arizona v. U.S., 567 U.S. at 398.\n B. Removal: Deportability (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227) versus Inadmissibility (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182)\n 1. Overview\n Noncitizens can only be subject to removal following a finding of deportability or inadmissibility by an Immigration \nJudge in a formal proceeding known as a removal proceeding. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227 sets out classes of deportable \nnoncitizens, while 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 sets out classes of inadmissible noncitizens. Removal proceedings may properly \nbe brought against any noncitizen who is deportable or inadmissible on any basis set out in \u00a7 1227 and \u00a7 1182; this \nincludes any noncitizen whose mere presence in, or entry into, the United States is unlawful. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(1), \n1182(a)(6).\n\n Congress recognized the significance of criminal convictions: Section 1229(d)(1), makes clear that in the case of a \nnoncitizen who is deportable by virtue of a conviction, \u201cthe Attorney General shall begin any removal proceeding as \nexpeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.\u201d Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 \n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 77 of 132\n 74\n 1229a(a)(1), (c)(1)(A). There are varying standards for these proceedings. When a noncitizen is subject to removal \nproceedings to determine deportability, the burden rests with the government to establish by clear and convincing \nevidence that she is deportable. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A). A finding of deportability can only be sustained on the basis of \nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence. Id. A noncitizen being put through removal proceedings may argue \nthat she is entitled to various forms of relief from removal, and faces the burden of proof in establishing her eligibility \nfor such relief (and in the case of discretionary relief, that she merits a favorable finding). \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A). The \ndecision of the Immigration Judge can be followed by an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), and \nthen to a Circuit Court of Appeals. This process can delay any final decision for a lengthy period of time; several \nyears is not unusual.\n 4. Consequences of Deportability and Inadmissibility\n\n Upon a finding of deportability, and assuming any appeal is rejected, a noncitizen will then be subject to an order of \nremoval. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231. Upon a finding of inadmissibility in the case of apprehension at the border, a noncitizen \nwill be denied entry and likewise subject to an order of removal. Id. When a noncitizen is ordered removed due to a \nfinding of deportability or inadmissibility, \u201cthe Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within \na period of 90 days,\u201d and \u201c[d]uring the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien.\u201d \u00a7 1231(1)-(2). As \nelucidated in \u00a7 1182, consequences of a finding of inadmissibility for a noncitizen who is apprehended within the \nU.S. include the automatic denial of any application to change one\u2019s immigration status (e.g. an application for a \nGreen Card, an application for a visa, or an application for citizenship).\n C. Criminal Grounds of Deportability and Inadmissibility\n\n Certain criminal convictions and involvement in other specified criminal activity are bases Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 78 of 132\n 75\n\n for deportability and inadmissibility, as specified in \u00a7 1227(a)(2), and \u00a7 1182(a)(2), respectively.\n\n In this context a \u201cconviction\u201d is defined in two ways, either of which is sufficient to establish a conviction for the \npurposes of this statutory scheme: (1) \u201ca formal judgment of guilt entered by a court\u201d; or (2) when adjudication of \nguilt has been withheld, but both of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) a judge or jury has found the noncitizen \nguilty or the noncitizen has entered a plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, or has admitted sufficient facts to \nwarrant a finding of guilt; (ii) and the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the \nnoncitizen\u2019s liberty to be imposed. 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A).\n\n 1. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) Sets out Criminal Grounds of Deportability\n\n\n\n 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) sets out criminal grounds of deportability, most of which hinge on criminal convictions. When \n\u00a7 1227(a)(2) refers to noncitizens, it refers both to lawfully and unlawfully present noncitizens. LPR\u2019s and visa \nholders who engage in criminal conduct face the same removal consequences as unlawfully present non-citizens \nwho engage in criminal conduct. Lawful presence as an LPR or visa holder does not insulate non-citizens from \nbeing subject to removal on the basis of criminal involvement.\n a) Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude (\u201cCIMT\u201d)\n\n Under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) a noncitizen who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (\u201cCIMT\u201d) punishable by \na sentence of imprisonment of one year or longer, within five years of her admission to the United States, is \ndeportable.17 Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) any noncitizen who is convicted of two CIMTs at any time after her \nadmission to the U.S. is deportable. The concept of CIMT has no statutory definition; it is shaped through case law.\n\n 17 For noncitizens who receive Lawful Permanent Resident status pursuant to U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(j)\u2014which is reserved \nfor individuals who provide material information to law enforcement that substantially contributes to the success of \ncriminal or terrorism investigation or prosecution\u2014the time frame during which one CIMT conviction will lead to \ndeportability is extended to ten years. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 79 of 132\n 76\n Courts look to the \u201celements of the statutory state offense, not to the specific facts,\u201d to determine whether the \nconviction at issue constitutes a CIMT. Knapik v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 84, 88 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Wilson v. \nAshcroft, 350 F.3d 377, 381\u201382 (3d. Cir. 2003). In reviewing the statute the court should credit \u201cthe least culpable \nconduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.\u201d Id. (citing Matter of Marchena, 12 I. & N. Dec. 355, \n357, 1967 WL 14033 (BIA 1967)). Only where a statute is \u201cdivisible,\u201d that is, it covers both conduct involving moral \nturpitude, and conduct that does not, does the court refer to the record, \u201cto determine whether the alien was \nconvicted under that part of the statute defining a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d Partyka, 417 F.3d at 411; see, \ne.g. Rodriguez-Castro v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2005)\n CIMTs involve conduct that is \u201cinherently base, vile, or depraved\u201d and which is done with a criminal intent. See \nMarmolejo-Campos v. Holder, 558 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201cIn a series of published decisions, the BIA has \nset forth its general understanding that a \u2018crime involving moral turpitude\u2019 involves \u2018conduct that shocks the public \nconscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality and the duties owed \nbetween man and man, either one's fellow man or society in general.\u2019\u201d) (quoting In re Perez\u2013Contreras, 20 I. & N. \nDec. 615, 618 (B.I.A.1992)); Partyka, 417 F.3d at 414 (\u201c[T]he hallmark of moral turpitude is a reprehensible act \ncommitted with an appreciable level of consciousness or deliberation.\u201d); see also, Sotinakau v. Lynch, 846 F.3d \n731, 736 (4th Cir. 2017) (\u201cTo involve moral turpitude, a crime requires two essential elements: a culpable mental \nstate and reprehensible conduct.\u201d) (quoting In re Ortega\u2013Lopez, 26 I. & N. Dec. 99, 100 (BIA 2013)).\n\n Criminal statutes that provide for a conviction based on proof of criminal negligence and strict liability crimes are \ntherefore typically found not to fall into the CIMT category due to the Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 80 of 132\n 77\n absence of a criminal intent. See\n In re Perez\u2013Contreras, 20 I. & N. Dec. at 619; Sotnikau, 846 F.3d at 738; but see, Mehboob v. Attorney General of \nU.S., 549 F.3d 272, 277 (3d Cir. 2008) (\u201cwe hold that the absence of mens rea as to a specific element of a crime \ndoes not necessarily preclude a finding that a strict liability sex offense involves moral turpitude.\u201d). Recklessness \ncrimes can be considered CIMTs, but typically only \u201cif certain statutory aggravating factors are present,\u201d such as a \nrequired showing of a \u201cconscious[] disregard[] [of] a substantial risk of serious harm or death to another.\u201d Knapik, \n384 F.3d at 90. Essentially all specific intent crimes are considered CIMTs.\n b) Aggravated Felonies\n\n Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) any noncitizen convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d at any time after admission \nis deportable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) defines aggravated felony in list format and includes the following specific \ncrimes and categories of crimes: murder; rape; sexual abuse of a minor; drug trafficking (one sale conviction counts \nas an aggravated felony under this category); firearms trafficking; theft or burglary with an imposed sentence of one \nyear imprisonment or more (e.g. robbery, grand larceny, etc.); a crime of violence with an imposed sentence of one \n\n\n\nyear imprisonment or more (e.g. assault, aggravated harassment, etc.); fraud or deceit in which more than $10,000 \nwas involved (i.e. grand larceny, trademark counterfeiting, etc.); bail jumping; arson; child pornography felonies; \nand the attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the named offenses.\n c) Other offenses\n\n There are several other criminal offenses that trigger deportability. Controlled substance offenses constitute one \nmajor category. One conviction for a controlled substance offense, with the exception of an individual\u2019s first \nconviction for the possession of less than 30 grams of Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page \n81 of 132\n 78\n\n marijuana, renders a noncitizen deportable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n\n 18 Firearms offenses make up another expansive category. One conviction of any firearms offense, broadly \ndefined (e.g. sale, purchase, possession, etc.), triggers deportability. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C). \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(D) \ndesignates national security related criminal offenses, one conviction of any of which triggers deportability. Under \u00a7 \n1227(a)(2)(A)(v) a noncitizen who is convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250, which sets out the laws regarding sex \noffender registration and notification, is deportable. Under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iv) a noncitizen who is convicted of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 758, which criminalizes high speed flight from an immigration checkpoint, is deportable.\n\n Some of the categories of offenses which trigger deportability include conduct that is not necessarily linked to a \nconviction. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(F) makes deportable any noncitizen who is described in 8 \u00a7 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(H), which \ndefines \u201csignificant traffickers in persons.\u201d A criminal conviction is not required, however, for a person to fall within \nthat category; rather, it leaves the determination up to federal officials. There is also an expansive category of \ndomestic violence conduct that triggers deportability, and a conviction is not required in the case of an order of \nprotection violation.19\n\n 2. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) Sets out Criminal Grounds of Inadmissibility\n\n \u00a7 1182(a)(2) designates \u201ccriminal and related grounds\u201d of inadmissibility. The criminal bases that trigger \ninadmissibility are quite similar to those triggering deportability, however the bar is often much lower with regard to \ncriminal conduct. A conviction is most often not required\n\n 18 Notably, \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(ii) designates that any noncitizen \u201cwho is, or at any time after admission has been, a \ndrug abuser or addict is deportable\u201d; this section is unique in that it does not require a criminal conviction, but rather \nimposes deportability based on an apparently subjective determination of an individual\u2019s conduct or status.\n\n 19 One conviction for a crime of domestic violence, as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 16; stalking; or a crime against a child \nrenders a noncitizen deportable. 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). Under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii)a noncitizen who a \u201ccourt determines\u201d \nviolates a protection order by engaging in credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury to the \nperson protected under the order, is deportable. This section does not require a conviction but rather turns on the \nvague concept of a court\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 82 of 132\n 79\n in this context.\n 20 Additionally, there are some criminal bases for inadmissibility that extend beyond the subject matter of those \nwhich trigger deportability.21\n D. The Relevance of Padilla and Galarza\n 1. Padilla v. Kentucky\n Under Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), which held that defense counsel has a duty to advise criminal \ndefendants of potential immigration consequences to a guilty plea pursuant to the Sixth Amendment guarantee of \neffective assistance of counsel, the court undertook a brief historical review of the interaction between immigration \nlaw and criminal law in the U.S. The Court recounted the steadily increasing weight of immigration consequences \nas a result of criminal convictions over time. The Court observed that \u201cchanges to our immigration law have \ndramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal conviction,\u201d such that \u201cas a matter of federal law, \n\n\n\ndeportation is an integral part\u2014indeed, sometimes the most important part\u2014of the penalty that may be imposed on \nnoncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.\u201d Id. at 364. As a practical matter the Court noted that \n\u201c[u]nder contemporary law, if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense\u2026his removal is practically \ninevitable.\u201d Id. at 363-64.\n Despite the Court\u2019s apparent view that deportation as the result of a criminal conviction is in many practical ways \nabsorbed within the realm of criminal punishment, the opinion does highlight the technical distinction between the \ncivil process of removal proceedings, and the criminal process: \u201c[w]e have long recognized that deportation is a \nparticularly severe penalty, but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil \nin nature,\n\n 20 Under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for example, any noncitizen who is convicted of, or admits to committing the \nessential elements of, a CIMT or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a CIMT, is inadmissible. The same standard \napplies to controlled substance offenses, and drug and human trafficking. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(H).\n\n 21 For example, any noncitizen who is involved in prostitution or money laundering, or is attempting to enter the \nUnited States to engage in any such conduct, is inadmissible. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(D), (a)(2)(I). Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 83 of 132\n 80\n deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process.\u201d Id. at 365 (internal citation and quotation \nomitted). This entanglement led the Court to the conclusion that classifying deportation as collateral to the criminal \nprocess and to decisions about pleading guilty would be unhelpful and impractical. Ultimately, the Court concluded \nthat \u201cadvice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel.\u201d Id. at 366. As such, in order to satisfy the demands of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance \nof competent counsel, defense counsel must inform noncitizen clients that deportation will result from a particular \nplea when the law is clear on that point, and when the law is less straightforward, advise noncitizen clients of a \ngeneralized risk of adverse immigration consequences resulting from the criminal charges. Id. at 369. The differing \nstandards reflect the Court\u2019s recognition of the complexities of immigration law, a field which merits professional \nspecialization, and the limitations of any one criminal defense lawyer. Id. at 369.\n The Court observes that while deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is a civil penalty subject to a \ncivil process technically distinct from the criminal process, it is so \u201cintimately related\u201d to the criminal process that it is \n\u201cuniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.\u201d Id., 559 U.S. at 366.\n\n The federal government\u2019s choice to pursue deportation on the basis of local criminal justice outcomes is something \nthat cities and localities have no control over and presumably no input in. The Philadelphia policies at issue here do \nnot interfere with the federal government\u2019s legal ability to deport individuals convicted of serious crimes.\n\n 2. Galarza v. Szalczyk\n\n A recent Third Circuit case considered whether Department of Homeland Security regulations at 8 C.F.R. 287.7 \ngoverning immigration detainers imposed legally binding obligations Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 84 of 132\n 81\n on states and localities. See Galarza v. Szalczyk, 745 F.3d 634 (3d Cir. 2014). Regulations allow immigration \nauthorities to notify other law enforcement agencies if DHS seeks custody of the individual and set parameters on a \nstate or municipality keeping the individual in custody after a potential release date:\n (a) Detainers in general. Detainers are issued pursuant to sections 236 and 287 of the Act and this chapter 1. Any \nauthorized immigration officer may at any time issue a Form I\u2013247, Immigration Detainer\u2013Notice of Action, to any \nother Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. A detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency \nthat the Department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting \nand removing the alien. The detainer is a request that such agency advise the Department, prior to release of the \nalien, in order for the Department to arrange to assume custody, in situations when gaining immediate physical \ncustody is either impracticable or impossible\u2026.\n\n\n\n (d) Temporary detention at Department request. Upon a determination by the Department to issue a detainer for an \nalien not otherwise detained by a criminal justice agency, such agency shall maintain custody of the alien for a \nperiod not to exceed 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays in order to permit assumption of \ncustody by the Department.\n 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7.\n In Galarza, police in Allentown, Pennsylvania arrested a New Jersey-born man of Puerto Rican descent on a drug \ncharge and had him transported to Lehigh County Prison. An Allentown detective notified ICE, which filed a \ndetainer. Despite repeatedly protesting that he was born in the United States\u2014and posting bail\u2014Galarza was held \nin the Lehigh County Prison for several days pursuant to the detainer before being released. The district court \ndismissed Galarza\u2019s claim against Lehigh County Prison on the grounds that the prison was legally required to hold \nGalarza pursuant to the detainer. 745 F.3d at 638.\n The Third Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cimmigration detainers do not and cannot compel a state or local law \nenforcement agency to detain suspected aliens subject to removal.\u201d Id. at 636. The panel construed the language in \n8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7(a) \u201cgenerally defin[ing] a detainer as a\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 85 of 132\n 82\n \u2018request\u2019\u201d and the title of 287.7(d), \u201cTemporary detention at Department request,\u201d to mean that detainers were not \nmandatory. Id. at 639-40. In the Third Circuit\u2019s view, a contrary reading would also raise serious federalism \nconcerns: \u201creading \u00a7 287.7 to mean that a federal detainer filed with a state or local [law enforcement agency] is a \ncommand to detain an individual on behalf of the federal government, would violate the anti-commandeering \ndoctrine of the Tenth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 644.\n E. ICE Programming and Enforcement Priorities\n Tasked with carrying out U.S. immigration law, DHS and ICE must pursue these authorizations in light of existing \nfunding restraints which make it impossible to achieve total enforcement of all of the statutes cited above. The \nfederal government therefore designs initiatives to improve the efficacy of immigration enforcement. A program \nknown as Secure Communities was initiated in 2008 for this purpose; this program was replaced by the Priority \nEnforcement Program (\u201cPEP\u201d) in 2015, for a brief period. The Secure Communities program was reinstated in 2017.\n\n The federal government, at times through DHS Memoranda and at times through Executive Orders, has issued \nguiding principles and specific commands often referred to as \u201cenforcement priorities,\u201d related to the carrying out of \nthese various programs. These have reflected the change in immigration enforcement policy over time and over the \ncourse of the transitions between programs and political administrations. However, there has been one constant: \nvisa-overstayers have not been affected unless they are a subject of a criminal investigation or prosecution and \nhave been convicted. There is an important but seldom employed exception, as individuals who are determined to \nbe threats to national security are legitimately subjected to removal.

PEP Priority 1\n More specifically, Priority 1 included the following classes of removable noncitizens: (a) those engaged in or \nsuspected of terrorism or espionage, or otherwise deemed a threat to national security; (b) those apprehended \nwhile crossing the border illegally; (c) those involved in gang activity, established either through conviction or not; \n(d) those convicted of any crime classified as a felony; (e) and those convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined \nunder immigration law. Id. at 3.\n\n b. PEP Priority 2\n\n Priority 2 identified \u201cmisdemeanants and new immigration violators\u201d as \u201cthe second-highest priority for \napprehension and removal,\u201d and included: (a) noncitizens convicted of three or more misdemeanors arising out of \nseparate incidents, \u201cother than traffic offenses or state or local offenses for which an essential element was the \nalien\u2019s immigration status,\u201d; (b) those convicted of a \u201csignificant misdemeanor\u201d including a domestic violence \noffense, sexual abuse or exploitation, burglary, unlawful possession or use of a firearm, drug distribution or \ntrafficking, driving under the influence, or any offense for which the actual sentence was at least 90 days; (c) those \nwho unlawfully entered or re-entered the U.S. after January 1, 2014; (d) and those who have \u201csignificantly abused \nthe visa or visa waiver programs\u201d as per the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, or a USCIS District Director \nor Service Center Director. Id. at 3-4.\n F. President Trump\u2019s Executive Order: New Enforcement Priorities\n An Executive Order entitled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\u201d (\u201cEO\u201d) issued by \nPresident Trump on January 25, 2017 ordered the termination of PEP and the reinstitution of the Secure \nCommunities program. Although there is, as cited above, an injunction\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 88 of 132\n 85\n in effect as to Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, pertaining to non-compliance with Section 1373, other parts of \nthe Executive Order remain in effect. This Order established new expansive enforcement priorities. It prioritizes the \nremoval of noncitizens falling into categories that extend far beyond those set out under PEP, several of which are \ndefined according to vague concepts, and the application of which allows for highly discretionary and subjective \njudgment calls.\n\n The new priorities for enforcement include noncitizens described in any of the following statutory sections: \u00a7 \n1182(a)(2) (criminal grounds for inadmissibility), (a)(3) (national security grounds for inadmissibility), and (a)(6)(C) \n(procuring admission by fraud); \u00a7 1225 (expedited removal of inadmissible noncitizens attempting to cross the \nborder); and \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (criminal grounds for deportability) and (4) (national security and related grounds); as well \nas removable noncitizens who qualify under any of the following:\n (a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;\n (b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;\n (c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;\n\n\n (d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a \ngovernmental agency;\n (e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;\n (f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United \nStates; or\n (g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\n Executive Order: Enhancing Public Safety, Section 5(a)-(g).\n President Trump\u2019s EO alters the enforcement priorities in three major ways as compared with the priorities under \nPEP.\n\n First, with respect to criminally involved removable noncitizens, the EO vastly expands the enforcement priorities. \nUnder PEP the priorities had been limited to those who pose a threat to national security, are involved in gang \nactivity, are convicted of a felony, are convicted of either Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 \nbail, but ultimately are released without conviction. Individuals who fit this description are technically removable, but \nthey do not fall under the current enforcement priorities. The harm to this group is especially great, as they are at \nrisk of being swept into immigration enforcement and subjected to removal proceedings, despite never being found \nguilty of any criminal activity. They are among the group of unlawfully\n 23 While technically even under the PEP regime, such an individual would be deportable pursuant to immigration \nlaw, the practical application of PEP was to \u201cpursue [the stated PEP] priorities at all stages of the enforcement \nprocess\u2014from the earliest investigative stage\u201d and thus counseled strongly against detaining and seeking removal \nof an individual who did not fall into one of the three enforcement priority categories, such as the individual \ndescribed in the hypothetical. It was therefore highly unlikely that such an individual would have been subject to \nremoval proceedings.\n 24 Notably, the risk that ICE will improperly pursue detention and/or removal of lawfully present noncitizens, a risk \nwhich existed under PEP, persists under the EO. This was exemplified in the case of Ernesto Galarza, born in New \nJersey, who was erroneously detained for three days on a temporary ICE detainer. Galarza v. Szalczyk, 745 F.3d \n634 (3d Cir. 2014).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 91 of 132\n 88\n present noncitizens who escape the extraordinarily broad enforcement priorities under the EO, yet they are \nnevertheless at risk of being subject to removal proceedings if they are arrested but ultimately not convicted of any \ncrime. This state of affairs goes so far as to threaten the presumption of innocence.\n H. Statutes Which Impact Both Immigration and Criminal Law\n\n The Department of Justice\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction cites a \nnumber of statutory provisions that it argues support the proposition that immigration enforcement and criminal \njustice are sufficiently related to survive a Constitutional challenge under the Spending Clause. (ECF 28 at 29). \nFirst, the Memorandum identifies \u00a7 1227(a)(2) as highly relevant to this consideration, see supra.\n\n The Memorandum also points to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(g), which provides for the performance of federal immigration \nenforcement functions by state actors. \u00a7 1357(g)(1) provides that the Attorney General may enter into a written \nagreement with a state or local government by which a state or local officer deemed qualified may engage in the \ninvestigation, apprehension, or detention of noncitizens. \u00a7 1357(g)(2)-(10) set out terms for these agreements. \nState and local employees are required to be trained in and adhere to federal law in carrying out these functions, \nand these actors are also subject to the supervision of the Attorney General. The statute also clarifies that an \nagreement under this section is not a prerequisite to state actors\u2019 cooperation and communication with the Attorney \nGeneral for the purpose of carrying out these functions.\n\n The DOJ additionally highlights 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(c), which falls within a section which prohibits the transportation of \nnoncitizens into or within the United States in any manner not authorized by the relevant laws (as well as the \nharboring or employment of such individuals). This subsection details criminal and civil forfeiture penalties for such \nconduct. Specifically, \u00a7 Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 92 of 132\n 89\n 1324(c) authorizes \u201call [ ] officers whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws\u201d to make arrests for violations of this \nsection.\n The Memorandum also identifies 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252c. This section authorizes state and local law enforcement \nofficials to arrest and detain any noncitizen illegally present in the United States following deportation from, or \nvoluntarily leaving, the United States after being convicted of a felony. The statute clarifies that this authorization \nexists only after the state or local official confirms the noncitizen\u2019s status via ICE data, and extends only for as long \nas necessary for ICE to transfer the individual to federal custody. The statute further directs the Attorney General to \nshare information within his control that would help enable this purpose.\n\n Finally, the DOJ\u2019s Memorandum references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c), which falls within a statute that provides rules for \nthe arrest and detention of noncitizens pursuant to a warrant pending a removal determination. \u00a7 1226(c) in \nparticular addresses the detention of \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d which in this context is a reference to those who are \n\n\n\ndeportable or inadmissible on the criminal bases set out in \u00a7 1227 and \u00a7 1182, respectively. It dictates that the \nAttorney General shall take these individuals into custody \u201cwhen the alien is released, without regard to whether the \nalien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may be \narrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.\u201d The DOJ\u2019s Memorandum suggests that the fact that this statute \n\u201ccontemplates the federal detention of certain aliens upon their release from state or local custody\u2026further \nanimat[es] the sort of cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement that the conditions are \ndesigned to foster.\u201d The DOJ\u2019s Memorandum does not highlight \u00a7 1226(d), however it is highly relevant. This \nsubsection directs the Attorney General to create an information system by which federal, state, and local \nauthorities can determine whether individuals they have arrested for aggravated felonies are noncitizens; to \nmaintain records Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 93 of 132\n 90\n of noncitizens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies and have been removed; and to train certain \nofficers within ICE \u201cto serve as a liaison to Federal, state, and local law enforcement and correctional agencies and \ncourts with respect to the arrest, conviction, and release of any alien charged with an aggravated felony.\u201d\n There are many other statutes which illustrate the intersection of criminal and immigration law that the DOJ\u2019s \nMemorandum does not reference. There are several criminal laws set out in the Immigration and Nationality Act \nthat are prosecuted in federal courts. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 establishes criminal liability for the return or attempted return \nto the U.S. by any noncitizen who has been denied admission or removed in the past. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 criminalizes \nentry or attempted entry into the United States at a time or place not authorized, without inspection by immigration \nofficers, or by making a willfully false or misleading representation. \u00a7 1325(c) designates punishment of up to five \nyears imprisonment and/or a fine up to $250,000 to be imposed on \u201cany individual\u201d who knowingly enters into a \nmarriage to evade \u201cany provision of the immigration laws.\u201d There are many additional criminal laws, as well as civil \npenalties, that relate to immigration requirements.25\n I. Selective Enforcement\n\n The paucity of prosecutions for first offenders of illegal entry is shown by federal government statistics that, from \n10/1/2013 to 9/30/2014, only 67 individuals were prosecuted for a first time commission of illegal entry. Federal \nJustice Statistics, 2014-Statistical Tables, March, 2017, at 16,            \n 25 \u00a7 1325(d) makes it a criminal act for \u201cany individual\u201d to \u201cknowingly establish a commercial enterprise for the \npurpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 establishes civil liability for owners and \noperators of aircraft and other transportation methods to provide a noncitizen the means to enter the U.S. at any \ntime or place not properly designated. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 makes it a criminal act to bring a noncitizen to the United \nStates in any manner outside of the lawfully designated immigration procedures or to transport or harbor any \nperson who has entered the United States in violation of the law. This is not an exhaustive list. Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 94 of 132\n 91\n offenders who are arrested in the act of attempted entry.\n\n Further, although federal government statistics fail to show the exact number of unlawfully present noncitizens who \nentered the U.S. illegally, there is documentation that of all arrests for immigration offenses during the year 2014, \n93% occurred in five federal districts, each positioned along the U.S.-Mexico border: the District of Arizona, the \nWestern District of Texas, the Southern District of Texas, the Southern District of California, and the District of New \nMexico. Mark Motivans, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Justice Statistics 2013-2014, March, 2017, 4-5,            \n\n The concept of \u201crelated\u201d government programs, as it pertains to the Spending Clause and, particularly, Byrne JAG \ngrants discussed below, is different.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 95 of 132\n 92\n XIII. Spending Clause and Separation of Powers\n Article I, Section 8, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the \u201cPower To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \nImposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United \nStates.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. Article I grants this power to Congress, and Congress alone. Nothing in Article \nII of the Constitution provides the Executive with any independent authority to spend, or withhold, federal funds that \nCongress has appropriated. Rather, the Executive is obligated to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3.\n Congress regularly appropriates money to be paid out to states and localities, and uses that financial leverage to \ninduce policy changes at the state and local level. In this way, \u201cCongress may, in the exercise of its spending \npower, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require \nthem to take.\u201d Coll. Sav. Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 686 (1999); \naccord Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 576 (2012). The Supreme Court has likened Spending \nClause legislation to a \u201ccontract\u201d whereby \u201cin return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally \nimposed conditions.\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).\n\n At the same time, Congress\u2019 power to condition receipt of federal funds is subject to a number of limitations: \n\u201cSpending Clause legislation must: (1) pursue the general welfare; (2) impose unambiguous conditions on states, \nso they can exercise choices knowingly and with awareness of the consequences; (3) impose conditions related to \nfederal interests in the program; and (4) not induce unconstitutional action.\u201d Koslow v. Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, 302 F.3d 161, 175 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-08, 210 (1987)). A \nCase 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 96 of 132\n 93\n spending condition can therefore transgress any of these four limitations, three of which we address here.\n A. Relatedness\n\n Despite courts\u2019 general unwillingness to invalidate grant conditions for lack of relatedness, the City launches its \nmajor Spending Clause attack by arguing that the Challenged Conditions are intended to further federal civil \nimmigration enforcement, and are therefore unrelated to a grant program intended to provide assistance to local \ncriminal law enforcement. Such an argument reflects the premise, fundamental to the City\u2019s position in this \nlitigation, that immigration enforcement and criminal justice are not sufficiently \u201crelated\u201d to allow conditions be \nplaced on Byrne JAG grants that would influence the City\u2019s law enforcement policies. Amici law professors echo \nthis view, and situate the imposition of these conditions in the context of the President\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s \nshared intent to crack down on illegal immigration\u2014and to defund sanctuary cities in particular (see ECF 50 (Brief \nof Administrative Law, Constitutional Law, and Immigration Law Scholars))\u2014especially after a federal court \nenjoined one section of an Executive Order that would have stripped sanctuary jurisdictions of all federal funding in \nApril 2017. See Cty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, supra.\n\n The Attorney General is quick to point out that the Supreme Court still has never \u201coverturned Spending Clause \nlegislation on relatedness grounds,\u201d Barbour v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d 1161, 1168 (D.C. \nCir. 2004), and emphasizes the ways in which federal law \u201ctie[s]\u2026together\u201d criminal justice and immigration \nenforcement. (Def. Opp. at 29). The Attorney General cites various laws and situations in which immigration law \nand law enforcement \u201cintersect\u201d\u2014such as the fact that conviction for certain criminal offenses renders a noncitizen \nremovable, see 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2), and federal law allows partnerships between state Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 97 of 132\n 94\n\n or local law enforcement and immigration authorities, see 8 U.S.C. 1357(g). The Attorney General thus asserts that \nthe conditions on Byrne grants easily survive the \u201cdiscernible relationship\u201d threshold set by the Third Circuit in \n\n\n\nKoslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, discussed below. 302 F.3d 161 (3d Cir. 2002). Removing criminal \naliens also serves local law enforcement purposes, in the Attorney General\u2019s view, because once removed, aliens \ncannot commit more crimes. The Attorney General further argues that the City implicitly concedes the existence of \nsome sort of relationship between law enforcement and immigration enforcement by contending that its refusal to \nenforce immigration law aggressively has led to better public safety outcomes and lower crime rates. The Court \ndoes not dispute these general arguments, but they do not answer all the issues.\n\n The Supreme Court has expressly declined to \u201cdefine the outer bounds of the \u2018germaneness\u2019 or \u2018relatedness\u2019 \nlimitation on the imposition of conditions under the spending power.\u201d South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 209 n.3 \n(1987). Dole concerned a challenge to a Congressional statute directing the Department of Transportation to \nwithhold a percentage of federal highway funds to states that allowed individuals under the age of 21 to purchase \nalcohol. South Dakota, which allowed 19-year-olds to purchase low-alcohol beer, asserted that the power to fix the \nstate\u2019s drinking age was its prerogative under \u00a72 of the Twenty-First Amendment. South Dakota evidently did not \npress the argument that the condition was \u201cunrelated to a national concern in the absence of the Twenty-first \nAmendment,\u201d and accordingly the Court\u2019s discussion of relatedness was relatively cursory: \u201cthe condition imposed \nby Congress is directly related to one of the main purposes for which highway funds are expended\u2014safe interstate \ntravel.\u201d Id. at 208. The majority further noted that a presidential commission on drunk driving had found that the \n\u201clack of uniformity\u201d in state drinking ages induced young people to drive to neighboring states Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 98 of 132\n 95\n with lower drinking ages; the requirement to raise the drinking age or else forgo federal highway funds was \ntherefore \u201creasonably calculated to address this particular impediment to a purpose for which the funds are \nexpended.\u201d Id. at 209. The majority thus saw no need to decide where to set the relevant boundary.\n The Third Circuit had occasion to draw that line in Koslow, a case both parties cite with approval, which established \nthe \u201cdiscernable relationship\u201d test. 302 F.3d 161. In Koslow, a worker at a Pennsylvania state prison had injured \nhimself on three occasions while carrying 80-pound bags of salt. After being given a choice of performing the full \nduties of his position or receiving workers\u2019 compensation, he stayed in his job. Some three years later, he was \ndismissed for not being able to perform the essential functions of his job. Koslow filed suit, alleging, among other \nthings, that the State had failed to provide a reasonable accommodation in violation of Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, which prohibited discrimination in all federally funded programs or activities on the basis of \ndisability, and that the State had waived Eleventh Amendment immunity by accepting federal funds. The prison in \nwhich Koslow had worked had received federal funds, and the state defendants argued that the Rehabilitation Act \nwas unconstitutional under the Spending Clause because the limitations on the Rehabilitation Act funds (non-\ndiscrimination) were too far afield from the purposes for which they were intended.\n The Third Circuit specifically rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that a plaintiff needed to identify a specific federal \ninterest in the funds received by the prison system. Koslow, 302 F.3d at 175. Rather, a litigant:\n\n need only identify a discernible relationship imposed by a Rehabilitation Act condition on a \u201cdepartment or agency\u201d \nand a federal interest in a program it funds. Through the Rehabilitation Act, Congress has expressed a clear \ninterest in eliminating disability-based discrimination in state departments or agencies. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 99 of 132\n 96\n That interest, which is undeniably significant and clearly reflected in the legislative history, flows with every dollar \nspent by a department or agency receiving federal funds. The waiver of the Commonwealth\u2019s immunity from \nRehabilitation Act claims by Department of Corrections employees furthers that interest directly.\n Id. at 175\u201376 (3d Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). The Third Circuit took care to emphasize that \u201cthe waiver of \nimmunity conditioned on receipt of Rehabilitation Act funds applies on an agency-by-agency, or a department-by-\ndepartment, basis\u201d which \u201chelp[ed] ensure the waiver accords with the \u201crelatedness\u201d requirement articulated in \nDole.\u201d Id. at 176. After analogizing to other anti-discrimination statutes that had survived Spending Clause \nchallenges, the court held the Rehabilitation Act constitutional.\n We have described, supra, the many relationships between immigration and criminal law and neither party disputes \nthat criminal law violations can trigger immigration law consequences. However, framing the Court\u2019s inquiry as \n\n\n\nwhether a discernable relationship exists between immigration law and law enforcement, as the Attorney General \nseeks to do, situates the discussion at much too general a level. The relevant question, under Koslow, is whether \nthis Court can \u201cidentify a discernible relationship\u201d between a grant condition on a department or agency and \u201ca \nfederal interest in a program\u201d funded by the Byrne grants. 302 F.3d at 175.\n Criminal justice is a very broad field with far-reaching impacts; it bears on public safety, individual freedom, the \nphysical and mental public health systems, the economic privatization of public institutions, and beyond. Criminal \nconvictions impact not only immigration law enforcement, but also the disbursement of local and federal benefits, \nvoting rights, access to housing, family law, and more. In short, there is a seemingly endless list of areas of the law \nwhich can be said to be \"related to\" criminal justice and the local enforcement of criminal laws; it is not automatic, \nhowever, that these relationships operate in both directions. For example, while\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 100 of 132\n 97\n criminal law bears enormously on voting rights, voting laws don\u2019t appear to have any impact on the criminal justice \nsystem.\n Criminal law is integral to immigration law, specifying classes of noncitizens for high risk of removal, dictating \nprocedures for detaining particular individuals pending removal proceedings, and defining who falls within the \nfederal government's priorities for immigration law enforcement. However, immigration law does not impact the \ncriminal justice system.\n\n Immigration law has nothing to do with the enforcement of local criminal laws. As the record has established, this is \nabsolutely the case in Philadelphia. As Commissioner Ross testified, the criminal laws of Philadelphia are uniformly \nenforced across the city, without regard to the immigration status, whether lawful or unlawful, of individual \nresidents, whether they come into contact with the criminal justice system as a witness, victim, or defendant. The \nCity even has policies in place designed to remove immigration considerations entirely from the calculus of criminal \nlaw enforcement, including instructing police officers not to inquire about the immigration status of residents. While \nfederal immigration law officials care deeply about local criminal law outcomes, it simply is not the case that local \ncriminal justice actors in Philadelphia care about federal immigration laws.\n\n This point is especially important in light of the framing of the Spending Clause relatedness inquiry, below. The \nimportant question is whether the conditions at issue relate to the federal interest in the particular program they are \nattached to. Accepting DOJ\u2019s argument about its interest, the most generous reading from its perspective is that it \nhas an interest in pursuing \"criminal justice\" broadly. As already discussed, the fact that immigration enforcement \ndepends on and is deeply impacted by criminal law enforcement does not mean that the pursuit of criminal justice in \nany way relies on the enforcement of immigration law. Realistically, it does not. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB \nDocument 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 101 of 132\n 98\n\n Further, as the City points out, the Byrne JAG statute is clearly designed for the purpose of enhancing local \ncriminal justice. When considered at this level, the argument that enforcement of federal immigration laws is related \nto this objective is unsustainable, particularly in light of Police Commissioner Ross's testimony. The federal interest \nin enforcing immigration laws falls outside of the scope of the Byrne JAG program.\n 1. Byrne JAG Program and the DOJ Conditions\n\n Thus, the more precise question in this case is whether a discernable relationship exists between the federal \ngovernment\u2019s interest in the Byrne JAG program and the Challenged Conditions. The parties again disagree on \nhow to describe the relevant federal interest. The City points to a section of the Byrne statute requiring state plans \nto \u201cdetail[] how grants received under this section will be used to improve the administration of the criminal justice \nsystem,\u201d which must be done in consultation with various local stakeholders. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(6) \n(emphasis added). It also cites 2005 legislative history, which asserted that the merger of Local Law Enforcement \nBlock Grants with the former Byrne Grant Program would \u201cgive State and local governments more flexibility to \nspend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution. H.R. REP. 109-233, \nat 89, reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1636, 1640. The Attorney General situates the federal interest in the \u201cfor \n\n\n\ncriminal justice\u201d language of 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10152(a)(1) to argue that the Byrne program possesses the \u201cbroad[]\u201d \nobjective of \u201csupport[ing] and strengthen[ing] law enforcement and criminal justice.\u201d (ECF 28 at 29).\n\n The Attorney General relies on language from a section of the Byrne statute which, however, makes clear that the \nCity has the better reading of the statute, especially as supplemented by legislative history. Section 10152(a)(1) \nestablishes that the Byrne program is a formula grant Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page \n102 of 132\n 99\n and provides applicant jurisdictions a broad menu of programs and purposes to which they might apply Byrne \nfunds:\n the Attorney General may, in accordance with the formula established under section 10156 of this title, make \ngrants to States and units of local government, for use by the State or unit of local government to provide additional \npersonnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for \ncriminal justice, including for any one or more of the following programs:\n (A) Law enforcement programs.\n (B) Prosecution and court programs.\n (C) Prevention and education programs.\n (D) Corrections and community corrections programs.\n (E) Drug treatment and enforcement programs.\n (F) Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.\n (G) Crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation).\n (H) Mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections programs, including behavioral programs \nand crisis intervention teams.\n 34 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10152 (a)(1).\n Thus, the best reading of the Byrne statute is that Congress intended to create a formula grant program that simply \nprovided fiscal assistance to states and localities for any of a wide variety of permissible purposes that the applicant \njurisdictions, having heard from various stakeholders, were entitled to select. Congress set up the Byrne program, \nand the \u201cfederal interest\u201d that Koslow requires this Court to evaluate for Spending Clause purposes is Congress\u2019s \nvery broadly stated interest as articulated in the Byrne statute, not the Attorney General\u2019s interest in public safety or \nimmigration enforcement, which is not mentioned in the statute. See Koslow, 302 F.3d at 175.\n Congress employed its spending power to create a grant program to provide money for \u201cadministration of the \ncriminal justice system,\u201d with the intent that states and municipalities use the money as they see fit. Any relationship \nconnecting this formula grant program, which\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 103 of 132\n 100\n provides wide latitude to states and municipalities, and the conditions of requiring jail access to federal immigration \nauthorities to interview alien inmates and 48 hours\u2019 advance notice to federal immigration authorities of a \nnoncitizen\u2019s release from custody, is therefore difficult to discern.\n\n 2. Certification Condition\n The Certification Condition presents a more difficult issue because Congress indicated its intent in the Byrne \nstatute to require \u201capplicant[s]\u201d to \u201ccomply with\u2026all other applicable Federal laws.\u201d See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10153(a)(5)(D).26 The Byrne statute differentiates \u201capplicant[s]\u201d from \u201cprograms to be funded\u201d in requiring\n (5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed by the chief executive officer of \nthe applicant (or by another officer of the applicant, if qualified under regulations promulgated by the Attorney \nGeneral), that--\n (A) the programs to be funded by the grant meet all the requirements of this part;\n (B) all the information contained in the application is correct;\n (C) there has been appropriate coordination with affected agencies; and\n (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\n 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5) (emphases added).\n\n\n\n Philadelphia is the \u201capplicant\u201d for purposes of this subsection. If the Court assumes for a moment that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1373 is indeed an applicable federal law, then the statute is best read as requiring compliance with Section 1373 by \nall city officials, regardless of function. Moreover, the text of Section 1373(a) bars cities like Philadelphia from \nimplementing policies that restrict sending or receiving \u201cinformation regarding the citizenship or immigration status, \nlawful or unlawful, of any individual.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(a) (emphases added). This statutory provision\u2014by\n\n 26 Whether the Certification Condition requires compliance with Section 1373 by the entire City or simply the \n\u201cprograms or activities\u201d receiving Byrne funds was the subject of considerable debate at oral argument. Counsel for \nthe Attorney General indicated that only \u201cprograms or activities\u201d receiving Byrne funds were subject to the \nCertification Condition, as spelled out in the \u201cspecial conditions\u201d attached to the Greenville award letter. (ECF 21-6 \nat &para; 53). The City pointed to various communications from the federal government, including a letter from the \nOffice of Justice Programs dated October 11, 2017 (ECF 28-1) suggesting that the whole City was subject to the \nCertification Condition.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 104 of 132\n 101\n its plain terms\u2014is in no way limited to aliens, criminal aliens, or even convicted criminals. Thus, conditioning \nfunding for local law enforcement on the compliance by, for example, Dr. Farley\u2019s health workers toward their law-\nabiding patients is the sort of overly \u201cattenuated or tangential relationship\u201d that arguably exceeds the relatedness \nrequirement of grant conditions under the Spending Clause. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 215 (1987) \n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); see also Koslow, 302 F.3d at 176 (sustaining Rehabilitation Act waiver of sovereign \nimmunity where it applied only to the agencies or departments actually receiving federal funds under the act).\n\n Although the Certification Condition appears to have some relationship with the JAG Program, this Court is mindful \nof the demanding threshold imposed by Dole and Koslow. For purposes of the present motion for preliminary \ninjunction, it suffices to say that the \u201crelatedness issue\u201d is a close question. However, it is clear that the City has \nestablished that it uses the Byrne JAG money for purposes much broader than the prosecution of criminals, and \nthat adherence to the Department of Justice conditions would conflict with its justifiable policies towards non-\ncriminal aliens.\n B. Lack of ambiguity\n\n In their briefs, both parties address their ambiguity arguments toward the issue of whether the Challenged \nConditions themselves provide unambiguous guidance to the City. The City asserts that the 48-hour advance \n\u201cNotice\u201d and jail \u201cAccess\u201d conditions give no guidance for situations where a suspect might be detained pending trial \nwith no release date, or where a detained inmate refused to speak to ICE. With respect to the Certification \nCondition, the problem, from the City\u2019s perspective, is more fundamental still: in light of shifting political winds, \n\u201cominous\u201d DOJ press releases, inconsistent guidance as to the scope of the Certification Condition, and lack of \ncase law on what types of policies actually violate Section 1373, the City was simply unsure Case 2:17-cv-03894-\nMMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 105 of 132\n 102\n what it was agreeing to.\n\n The Attorney General faults the City for proceeding to litigation before availing itself of the opportunity to consult \nwith the Department of Justice about any questions it might have, an opportunity it claims is afforded to grantees \n(see Greenville SC Award Letter, Pl. Mot. Ex. D). Moreover, the Attorney General considers all conditions \nunambiguous and fully spelled out in the documents awarding Byrne grants to local jurisdictions, such as the award \nletter issued to Greenville County, South Carolina. (See id.). Dismissing the City\u2019s \u201cnit-picking,\u201d the Attorney \nGeneral argues that the Access and Notice Conditions are not facially ambiguous; after all, a locality has no \nnotification obligations until DHS asks\u2014at which point it must respond \u201cas early as practicable\u201d\u2014and an inmate \ncould decide not to speak to an ICE officer once the officer was allowed access. Ignoring the Department of Justice \npress releases, which the City claims amount to \u201cmixed messages\u201d (Pl. Mot. at 40), the Attorney General cites only \nto prior guidance on compliance on Section 1373, which it claims is unambiguous.\n\n\n\n Neither party would dispute that \u201cfederal grant programs originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions \nexpressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public policy,\u201d Bennett v. Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Educ., 470 \nU.S. 656, 669 (1985), yet the emphasis on the Challenged Conditions somewhat obscures the issue, acknowledged \nby both counsel at oral argument, of the role of Congress itself, to which the spending power is exclusively \nconferred under Article I.\n Spending Clause ambiguity cases generally involve statutory construction, not interpretation of conditions imposed \nby an agency. In a typical case, the state assails the congressional statute itself for failing to unambiguously impose \nconditions on receipt of federal funds. See, e.g., Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 \n(2006);\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 106 of 132\n 103\n Pennhurst, 451 U.S. 1. This can occur whether or not the state is seeking to evade liability when sued by a private \nparty, or in turn seeks legal relief against the federal government. Compare Arlington Cent. 548 U.S. 291 and \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. 1 with Com. of Va., Dep\u2019t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc). Such \ncases, naturally, frame their discussion in terms of Congress\u2019 exercise of the purse strings under Article I:\n The legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State \nvoluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the \u201ccontract.\u201d There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a \nState is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it. Accordingly, if Congress intends \nto impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously. By insisting that Congress \nspeak with a clear voice, we enable the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \ntheir participation.\n Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17 (internal citations omitted) (holding that Section 6010 of the Developmentally Disabled \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act did not unambiguously condition receipt of federal funds on providing residents of \ndisabled home a right to \u201cappropriate treatment, services, and habilitation\u201d in \u201cthe setting that is least restrictive of \nthe person\u2019s personal liberty\u201d). At least one subsequent opinion has posited that this passage analogizes the grant \nand receipt of federal funds to offer and acceptance in the process of contract formation. Barnes v. Gorman, 536 \nU.S. 181, 186 (2002) (citing id.). When engaging in an inquiry regarding ambiguity, a court \u201cmust view\u201d a statute \n\u201cfrom the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept\u201d \nfederal funds. Arlington Cent., 548 U.S. at 296. \u201cIn other words,\u201d Arlington Central continued, a court must ask \nwhether a statute \u201cfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue.\u201d Id.\n\n With the introduction of a federal agency into the transaction, the analogy to offer and acceptance in a bilateral \ncontract is a less intuitively helpful guide: Was it Congress or the agency Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 \nFiled 11/15/17 Page 107 of 132\n 104\n making the offer? Did Congress authorize the agency to introduce terms and conditions, and under what \ncircumstances? Is Section 1373 a Congressionally mandated condition? What must be unambiguous? Specifically, \nif there is arguable lack of clarity both in the statute and in the agency guidance, what is a court\u2019s role?\n\n Com. of Va., Dep\u2019t of Educ. v. Riley held that the requisite clear notice must be found in the statute itself. 106 F.3d \n559 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (adopting original dissenting panel opinion of Luttig, J.). In Riley, the Department of \nEducation interpreted the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to require states to provide private \neducational services to disabled students who had been expelled for reasons unrelated to their disabilities. Because \nVirginia did not provide private educational services to this subset of students, the Department of Education sought \nto withhold funds; Virginia then argued that it was in compliance with the IDEA, and that the Department\u2019s \ninterpretation imposed conditions not required by the statute. The Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, sided with Virginia. \nPursuant to the then-operative text of the IDEA, the court then held that a state was required to \u201cassure[] all children \nwith disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1412(1). The majority began with basic \nconstitutional principles: \u201cin order for the States to be bound by a condition upon the receipt of federal monies, the \nCongress must have affirmatively imposed that condition in clear and unmistakable statutory terms.\u201d Riley, 106 F.3d \nat 563. It continued to the plain language of the statute itself: \u201cunder even ordinary standards of statutory \nconstruction,\u201d the majority held, the IDEA \u201cd[id] not impose, implicitly or otherwise, the condition for which the \n\n\n\nFederal Government argue[d].\u201d Id. The majority was cognizant of the federalism concerns underlying the dispute \nbetween a state and the federal government over public education, traditionally an area of local control. Id. at 566. \nRiley supports the City\u2019s legal position. The Attorney General\u2019s Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 108 of 132\n 105\n Supplemental Brief (ECF 70) unsuccessfully attempts to distinguish its factual relevance to this case, and it is likely \nthe Third Circuit would follow this decision.\n This Court therefore emphasizes the language of the statute authorizing Byrne JAG grants, employing traditional \ntools of statutory construction but remaining mindful of the federalism concerns at stake. Whether Congress \nunambiguously imposed the Challenged Conditions (or unambiguously authorized the Attorney General so to do) \nentails largely the same inquiry as whether it conferred authority upon the Attorney General to impose them, as \ndiscussed in preceding sections of this memorandum. At oral argument, Defendant relied on the same language in \nthe OJP statute allowing the AAG to \u201cplac[e] special conditions on all grants, and determ[e] priority purposes for \nformula grants,\u201d as well as the requirement that applicants certify compliance with \u201call other applicable Federal \nlaws\u201d to defend the constitutionality of the Challenged Conditions under the Spending Clause.\n\n Simply put, the Access and 48-hours Notice Conditions cannot have been unambiguously authorized by Congress \nif they were never statutorily authorized. Similarly, Congress\u2019s statutory authorization for the Certification \nCondition\u2014pursuant to the \u201call other applicable Federal laws\u201d language of 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D)\u2014is a \u201cclose \ncall,\u201d see infra, especially under Arlington Central\u2019s recipient-centric test. See 548 U.S. at 296. The much-debated \nphrase \u201call other applicable Federal laws\u201d is susceptible to a number of reasonable readings: on one hand it could \nsignify all federal laws related to grantmaking (as the City would have it), or on the other, all federal laws related to \nlaw enforcement, or even the entire corpus of federal law codified in the United States Code.27 This malleable \nlanguage does not provide the \u201cclear notice that would be\n 27 In support of its argument that the Certification Condition is unambiguous, the Attorney General cites prior DOJ \nguidance that notably punts on the scope of \u201call other applicable Federal laws\u201d:\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 109 of 132\n 106\n needed to attach such a condition to a State\u2019s receipt of\u2026funds.\u201d See id. at 300.\n\n Nonetheless, because the present motion is one for a preliminary injunction, this Court need not make a ruling on \nthe merits of the City\u2019s \u201cambiguity\u201d challenge. However, the Court concludes the City is likely to prevail on its \nargument that the Attorney General\u2019s decision to condition receipt of JAG funds on certifying compliance with 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1373 may be inconsistent with the requirement that all conditions on funds be unambiguously imposed by \nCongress. This concern is particularly prevalent here because of federalism concerns, given that \u201c[o]ur \nconstitutional structure leaves local criminal activity primarily to the States.\u201d Bond v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 2077, \n2083 (2014). See Riley, 106 F.3d at 566 (\u201cInsistence upon a clear, unambiguous statutory expression of \ncongressional intent to condition the States\u2019 receipt of federal funds in a particular manner is especially important \nwhere, as here, the claimed condition requires the surrender of one of . . . the powers or functions reserved to the \nStates by the Tenth Amendment.\u201d).\n C. Coercion and the Tenth Amendment\n The Tenth Amendment states a \u201ctruism\u201d that \u201c[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d United States v. Darby, \n312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941); U.S. Const. Am. 10.

States may wish to consult with their legal counsel if they have any \nquestions or concerns as to the scope of this requirement.\n\n\n\n (ECF 1-12, Office of Justice Programs Guidance Regarding Compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, at 3) (emphasis \nadded).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 110 of 132\n 107\n Constitution before the amendment.\u201d Darby, 312 U.S. at 124. Nonetheless, the Tenth Amendment embodies the \nprinciple of Federalism that pervades the Constitution. Thus, courts frequently cite to the Tenth Amendment as a \nplaceholder for Federalism concerns. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sibelius (\u201cNFIB\u201d)), 567 U.S. 519, 647 \n(2012) (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, JJ., dissenting) (\u201cWhat is absolutely clear, affirmed by the text of the 1789 \nConstitution, by the Tenth Amendment ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the 220 years since, is \nthat there are structural limits upon federal power.\u201d). More specifically, in the context of the Spending Clause, the \nTenth Amendment represents a prohibition against \u201cimpermissible compulsion\u201d or \u201ccommandeering,\u201d i.e., \u201cwhen \nstate participation in a federal spending program is coerced.\u201d NFIB, 567 U.S. at 677 (dissent). Among many cases, \nwe review several to guide this Court\u2019s Tenth Amendment analysis.\n 1. New York v. United States\n In New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of three \nprovisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (\u201cLLRWPAA\u201d), finding only two of \nthe three provisions consistent with \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s allocation of power to the Federal Government.\u201d Id. at 149. \nThe LLRWPAA required each state to be \u201cresponsible for providing, either by itself or in cooperation with other \nStates, for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste generated within the State.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A). \nTo encourage the states to comply with this statutory requirement, the LLRWPAA provided three types of \nincentives:\n 1. Monetary incentives in the form of surcharge fees paid to states who receive radioactive waste from other states;\n\n 2. Access incentives in the form of penalties for states which fail to indicate, within approximately one year of the \nAct\u2019s passage, an intent to develop a disposal facility or which fail to join a regional compact to develop a disposal \nfacility; and\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 111 of 132\n 108\n 3. A take title provision mandating that states which fail to provide, within approximately ten years of the Act\u2019s \npassage, for disposal of waste generated within its borders must take title to such waste upon notification by the \nowner of the waste.\n The Court\u2019s opinion distilled the central issue of the case to one sentence: \u201cThis litigation . . . concerns the \ncircumstances under which Congress may use the States as implements of regulation; that is, whether Congress \nmay direct or otherwise motivate the States to regulate in a particular field or a particular way.\u201d Id. at 161. The Court \nnoted that the division of power between state governments and the federal government changes in the context of \nCongressionally-imposed conditions on the receipt of federal funds, because state governments can simply refuse \nthe funds and thus avoid any drawbacks of compliance with the associated conditions. Id. at 168.\n Ultimately, the Court found the first two \u201cincentives\u201d to be valid exercises of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause powers. \nThen, the Court analyzed the third \u201cincentive\u201d under the Spending Clause, because it was an example of Congress \nplacing conditions \u201con the receipt of federal funds.\u201d Id. at 172. The Court found that the third condition violated the \nConstitution because it represented \u201c[a] choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatory techniques.\u201d Id. \nat 176 (declining to state whether the provision lay \u201coutside Congress\u2019s enumerated powers\u201d or \u201cinfring[ed] upon the \ncore of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment,\u201d but stating that either way, \u201cthe provision is \ninconsistent with the federal structure of our Government . . . .\u201d).\n\n 2. Printz v. United States\n\n In Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), the Supreme Court held that several provisions of the Brady \nHandgun Violence Prevention Act were unconstitutional because they \u201cpurport[ed] to direct state law enforcement \nofficers to participate, albeit only temporarily, in the administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme.\u201d Id. at \n904. The majority opinion, Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 112 of 132\n\n\n\n 109\n authored by Justice Scalia, explained that the \u201cenactments of the early Congresses, as far as we are aware, \ncontain no evidence of an assumption that the Federal Government may command the States\u2019 executive power in \nthe absence of a particularized constitutional authorization.\u201d Id. at 909. The Court also noted that the Constitution \nitself demonstrates the Founders\u2019 view that \u201ca healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal \nGovernment will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.\u201d Id. at 921 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 \nU.S. 452, 458 (1991). The Court cited various prior Supreme Court opinions that \u201cmade clear that the Federal \nGovernment may not compel the States to implement, by legislation or executive action, federal regulatory \nprograms.\u201d Id. at 925\u201326 (citing, among other cases, FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742 (1982), in which the Court \nconstrued several provisions of a federal statute requiring states only to \u201cconsider\u201d federal standards). In particular, \nthe Court found it improper for federal officials to \u201cforc[e] state governments to absorb the financial burden of \nimplementing a federal regulatory program\u201d or to put them \u201cin the position of taking the blame for its \nburdensomeness and for its defects.\u201d Printz, 521 U.S. at 930.\n 3. National Federation of Independent Business v. Sibelius\n In NFIB, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act (ACA). 567 U.S. at 519. As originally drafted, ACA provided substantial federal funds to states to expand \ntheir Medicaid programs, but if states chose not to accept the additional funds, they would not only forgo those \nfunds, but lose all existing federal funds as well.\n The plaintiff states challenged the statute as unduly coercive. Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of the Court, \nagreed. The plurality emphasized that decisions of the Court had \u201crepeatedly characterized ... Spending Clause \nlegislation as \u2018much in the nature of a contract.\u201d\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 113 of 132\n 110\n Id. at 576-77 (quoting Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186 (2002)). As such, states cannot freely accept funds \nwhere they are coerced into doing so by the lopsided terms of the grant. Id. at 577. After some discussion of \nFederalism principles, the plurality stated:\n We have upheld Congress\u2019s authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States\u2019 complying with restrictions on \nthe use of those funds, because that is the means by which Congress ensures that the funds are spent according to \nits view of the \u201cgeneral Welfare.\u201d Conditions that do not here govern the use of the funds, however, cannot be \njustified on that basis.\n Id. at 585.\n\n However, it was not only the \u201ccontractual\u201d concerns of Spending Clause that animated the Court\u2019s approach to the \nMedicaid expansion condition. All of the seven justices who agreed the Medicaid expansion condition, as written, \nwas unduly coercive detailed their concerns with federal legislation that compels states to take \u201cunpopular actions\u201d \nbecause \u201cstate officials [] will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the \nregulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision.\u201d Id. at 578 (Roberts, \nBreyer, Kagan, JJ.); id. at 678 (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, JJ.) (both citing New York, 505 U.S. at 169). \nEqually concerning to the dissenting justices (Ginsburg and Sotomayor) was the fact that state officials might also \n\u201cfavor such a departure from the constitutional plan, since uncertainty concerning responsibility may also permit \nthem to escape accountability.\u201d Id.28\n\n 4. City of New York v. United States\n\n In City of New York v. United States, 179 F.3d 29 (2d Cir. 1999), New York City lodged a facial challenge against \nSection 434 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\n 28 This Court notes that the Supreme Court has also decided Tenth Amendment challenges under the Commerce \nClause, which implicate similar Federalism concerns as Spending Clause cases. See, e.g., Reno v. Condon, 528 \nU.S. 141 (2000); F.E.R.C. v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742 (1982).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 114 of 132\n 111\n\n\n\n Reconciliation Act of 1996 and Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996, both of which, similar to Section 1373 at issue in the present litigation, \u201cprohibit[ed] state and local \ngovernments from limiting their employees in the voluntary provision of information about the immigration status of \naliens to [INS].\u201d Id. at 31. New York based its Tenth Amendment challenge on the conflict between those sections \nand City Executive Order No. 124, which prohibited city employees from transmitting information regarding the \nimmigration status of aliens to federal immigration authorities unless:\n (1) required by law;\n\n (2) consented to by the alien in writing; or\n (3) such alien was suspected of engaging in criminal activity.\n Id. at 31 n.1.\n The Second Circuit found that the challenged provisions did not violate the Tenth Amendment because the \nprovisions \u201cdo not directly compel states or localities to require or prohibit anything. Rather, they prohibit state and \nlocal governmental entities or officials only from directly restricting the voluntary exchange of immigration \ninformation with the INS.\u201d Id. at 35 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s central analysis focused on the need for \ncooperation between state and federal governments for their \u201cmutual benefit\u201d:\n\n The City's sovereignty argument asks us to turn the Tenth Amendment's shield against the federal government's \nusing state and local governments to enact and administer federal programs into a sword allowing states and \nlocalities to engage in passive resistance that frustrates federal programs. If Congress may not forbid states from \noutlawing even voluntary cooperation with federal programs by state and local officials, states will at times have the \npower to frustrate effectuation of some programs. Absent any cooperation at all from local officials, some federal \nprograms may fail or fall short of their goals unless federal officials resort to legal processes in every routine or \ntrivial matter, often a practical impossibility.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 115 of 132\n 112\n Id. at 35.\n\n Nonetheless, the Second Circuit stated that it might have decided the issue differently had the level of intrusion on \ncity policies been demonstrated more adequately. First, it noted that the Executive Order itself was the only policy \nproffered by New York as intrusive on its sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. Second, it pointed out that the \ncourt\u2019s inquiry was limited because it involved a facial challenge; thus, the challenge required New York to \ndemonstrate that no set of circumstances existed under which the Act would be valid. Third, the court found the \nExecutive Order too narrowly drawn to justify New York\u2019s concern that the challenged provisions prevented the City \nfrom providing essential municipal services and receiving reports of criminal activity from residents. Specifically, the \ncourt found the Executive Order protected immigration status as confidential only from federal immigration \nauthorities. Thus, the Executive Order did not operate to \u201cprevent the sharing of information with anyone outside the \nINS.\u201d Id. at 37. Because of this, the Executive Order appeared geared more towards \u201csingl[ing] out a particular \nfederal policy for non-cooperation [despite] allowing City employees to share freely the information in question with \nthe rest of the world.\u201d Id.\n\n However, had the City shown that \u201cthe information covered by the Executive Order might in fact be subject to other \nconfidentiality provisions that would prevent is dissemination generally[,] . . . the Executive Order might be viewed \nmore as an explanatory measure designed to reassure aliens that information they might impart was truly \nconfidential.\u201d Id. In the end, the Second Circuit specifically disclaimed the effect of its decision on any inquiry into \nwhether the challenged section \u201cwould survive a constitutional challenge in the context of generalized confidentiality \npolicies that are necessary to the performance of legitimate municipal functions and that include federal immigration \nstatus,\u201d stating explicitly, \u201cwe offer no opinion on that Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page \n116 of 132\n 113\n question.\u201d Id.\n 5. The Present Case\n\n\n\n Without specifically so holding, the Court concludes, relying on Galarza, that Philadelphia is likely to succeed on \nthe merits of its Tenth Amendment challenge to the Access, 48-hour Notice, and Certification conditions. As it \npertains to the Certification condition, this argument is somewhat distinct from that presented in City of Chicago v. \nSessions and City of New York v. U.S., in which Section 1373 itself was challenged on Tenth Amendment grounds. \nNo. CV-17-C-5720, 2017 WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2017); 179 F.3d 29 (2d Cir. 1999). This Court need not \nanalyze the City\u2019s Tenth Amendment claim in detail, as the Court will not rely on it in considering whether to grant a \npreliminary injunction.\n Nonetheless, it bears mention that, because the Access and Notice conditions impose affirmative obligations on \nPhiladelphia, with associated costs of complying with such conditions, they do implicate the Tenth Amendment and \nits built-in anti-commandeering principles.\n\n With respect to the Certification condition, this Court agrees with the Court in City of Chicago that Section 1373 \n(and in this case, compliance with it), \u201cposes a unique and novel constitutional question.\u201d 2017 WL 4081821, at *12. \nLiteral compliance with Section 1373 would inherently prevent Philadelphia from, among other things, disciplining \nan employee for choosing to spend her free time or work time assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration \nlaws. See id. (\u201cIf a state or local government cannot control the scope of its officials' employment by limiting the \nextent of their paid time spent cooperating with the INS, then Section 1373 may practically limit the ability of state \nand local governments to decline to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.\u201d). Therefore, this Court \ndeclines to rest a preliminary injunction on Tenth Amendment grounds, but notes that the effect of Section 1373 \ncompliance may be to\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 117 of 132\n 114\n \u201cthwart policymakers\u2019 ability to extricate their state or municipality from involvement in a federal program.\u201d Id.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 118 of 132\n 115\n XIV. Philadelphia Substantially Complies with Section 1373\n The doctrine of substantial compliance is a judicial tool designed to promote equitable relief. In cases where a party \nhas meaningfully performed as expected, despite noncompliance with minor, unimportant requirements, this \ndoctrine enables a court to excuse such imperfection and conclude that as a matter of fairness the party is entitled \nto the benefit she seeks. A finding of substantial compliance is warranted where a party has \u201ccomplied with the \nessential requirements, whether of a contract or of a statute.\u201d In re Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., 285 F.3d 522, 525 \nn. 3 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1428 (6th ed.1991)) (internal modifications omitted).\n A. Substantial Compliance Can Be Implied\n Several statutes\u2014including those implementing federal grant programs that condition receipt of federal aid on \ncompliance with particular conditions\u2014explicitly build in a standard of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in the terms of the \nstatute. See., e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12753, Penalties for Misuse of Funds (conditioning the grant of federal dollars to \nstates under the Home Investment Partnerships on substantial compliance with the entire statutory scheme and all \nconditions announced therein). External references to the Byrne JAG program actually impose a standard of \nsubstantial compliance with particular requirements in order for a state to maintain its full award. Under 34 U.S.C.A. \n\u00a7 20927, for example, \u201ca jurisdiction that fails, as determined by the Attorney General, to substantially implement \nthis subchapter [dealing with sex offender registration and notification] shall not receive 10 percent of the funds that \nwould otherwise be allocated for that fiscal year to the jurisdiction under [the Byrne JAG program].\u201d\n Courts have imposed the substantial compliance doctrine in evaluating some statutes that do not explicitly invoke \nit. The Third Circuit, for example, has read into the Social Security Act a\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 119 of 132\n 116\n broad application of the substantial compliance doctrine, despite \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d language appearing only \ndiscretely within one section of the overall statute. Shands v. Tull, 602 F.2d 1156, 1160 (3d Cir. 1979). The Court \nfocused on two provisions within the Act requiring less than perfect compliance with a federal regulation mandating \ndisbursement of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. One of those provisions threatened to cut off federal aid \n\n\n\nfor these programs upon \u201cfailure to comply Substantially,\u201d while the other permitted a four percent rate of error in \ndetermining eligibility.\u201d Id. The Court was persuaded that these two provisions \u201cshow an implied intent to hold the \nstates to a standard of substantial compliance and thus to make some allowance for the difficulties of administering \nan extensive bureaucracy.\u201d Id. As such, it required only substantial compliance with a specific regulation requiring \nstates to issue final administrative action within 90 days of a request for a hearing to review denial of a claim. Id. at \n1161.\n The First Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have both held that states need only be in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the \nterms of the federal statute setting forth minimum requirements for state wiretap procedures, in order to be \nlegitimate and to avoid preemption. United States v. Smith, 726 F.2d 852 (1st Cir. 1984) (en banc); Villa v. Maricopa \nCounty, 865 F.3d 1224 (9th Cir. 2017).\n\n The Ninth Circuit generally recognizes a limited doctrine of substantial compliance in the context of requirements \nimposed by federal law. Sawyer v. Sonoma County, 719 F.2d 1001 (9th Cir. 1983). The Ninth Circuit views it as \u201can \nequitable doctrine designed to avoid hardship in cases where the party does all that can reasonably be expected of \nhim.\u201d Id. at 1008. Specifically, substantial compliance may be enough only with respect to procedural regulatory \nrequirements, where \u201cthe essential statutory purposes have been fulfilled.\u201d Baccei v. U.S., 632 F.3d 1140 (9th Case \n2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 120 of 132\n 117\n Cir. 2011) (quoting Shotgun Delivery, Inc. v. United States, 269 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir. 2001)). In contrast, \u201cwhen \nthe requirement relates to the substance of the statute or where the essential purposes have not been fulfilled,\u201d \nstrict compliance is the standard. Id.\n The Court notes that the Ninth Circuit has also held that \u201c[a]s a general rule, a state that accepts federal funds with \nconditions attached must strictly comply with those conditions\u2014substantial compliance will not be good enough.\u201d \nCalifornia Alliance of Child and Family Services v. Allenby, 589 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Withrow v. \nConcannon, 942 F.2d 1385, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1991). But California Alliance dealt with the very clear and specific \ncondition under the Child Welfare Act that \u201cparticipating states \u2018shall\u2019 cover the listed costs.\u201d Id. at 1023. This stands \nin sharp contrast to the very general nature of Section 1373. Moreover, in California Alliance the Ninth Circuit \nconsidered accepting substantial rather than strict compliance given that a relevant statute indicated that \u201cthe \nfederal government is willing to accept \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 at least in some circumstances,\u201d and \u201cit makes \nsense that compliance cannot, as a practical matter, invariably be strict.\u201d Id. There are some requirements for which \nstrict compliance is appropriate, such as non-discrimination conditions. However, the factual history and latent \nambiguity, as discussed above, show that as to the Attorney General\u2019s conditions, strict compliance is impractical, \nparticularly in light of the generalized nature of the statute and DOJ\u2019s admittedly flexible expectations.\n B. Substantial Compliance Can Apply to Grant Conditions\n\n Substantial compliance is a broadly recognized feature of contract law, as articulated in Judge Cardozo\u2019s seminal \nopinion on the matter in Jacob & Youngs, Inc., v. Kent, 230 N.Y. 239 (Ct. App. N.Y. 1921). For example, one subset \nof contract cases in which substantial compliance has almost universally been applied is in determining whether an \ninsurance policyholder has Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 121 of 132\n 118\n properly changed the beneficiary of their policy. Pennsylvania law routinely follows this formula. Cipriani v. Sun Life \nIns. Co. of America, 757 F.2d 78, 81 (3d Cir. 1985) (\u201cPennsylvania courts will give effect to an insured\u2019s intention to \nchange the beneficiary on an insurance policy where, even in the absence of strict compliance with the policy \nprovisions, the insured has made every reasonable effort under the circumstances to comply with those \nprovisions.\u201d) (citing Provident Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Ehrlich, 508 F.2d 129, 132\u201333 (3d Cir.1975); Skamoricus \nv. Konagiskie, 177 A. 809 (Pa. 1935); Ruggeri v. Griffiths, 173 A. 396 (Pa. 1934); see also, Teachers Ins. And \nAnnuity Ass\u2019n of America v. Bernardo, 683 F.Supp.2d 344 (E.D. Pa 2010). Federal courts likewise recognize this \napplication of substantial compliance to the context of an attempt to change the beneficiary of an insurance policy, \nincluding under federal law. See, e.g., Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Adams, 30 F.3d 554, 563 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(applying the doctrine of substantial compliance to determine whether an ERISA life insurance policy holder has \nchanged the beneficiary of her plan, even though the plan provides for a very specific procedure to make such a \nmodification); Cooper v. United States, 340 F.2d 845, 848 (6th Cir. 1965). The Fourth Circuit held that this \n\n\n\napplication of the substantial compliance doctrine is legitimate because it \u201cwill not compromise any of the rights of \nor impose any additional obligations on plan administrators or sponsors,\u201d and not applying it would lead to \n\u201crelatively harsh results\u201d for policy holders. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Adams, 30 F.3d at 563. Importantly, the \nCourt noted that the doctrine is not in conflict with the statute, simply because the statute does not address the \nissue. Id.\n\n The application of the substantial compliance doctrine to contract law is important for our purposes, as the \nacceptance of federal grant money conditioned on compliance with specified conditions has, as discussed above, \nbeen analogized over and over to a state entering into a Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 \nmatters. Exercising its discretion, and noting the hesitancy to make firm decisions on some of the legal issues in \nthis case, but finding that it is likely the City will prevail on one and possibly more of its contentions, the Court will \napply the doctrine of substantial compliance and find that the City is in substantial compliance, as noted in the \nFindings of Fact, supra.\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 124 of 132\n 121\n XV. Irreparable Harm\n A. The Status Quo\n Although courts analyze four factors29 in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the underlying purpose \nof a preliminary injunction is to ensure that the parties do not change the underlying facts of a case in an \n\u201cirreparably harmful\u201d way before a court has the opportunity to decide a case on the merits.\n\n In fact, many courts have observed that that the purpose of the preliminary injunction is this preservation of the \nstatus quo. See, e.g., Acierno v. New Castle Cty., 40 F.3d 645, 647 (3d Cir. 1994) (\u201cA primary purpose of a \npreliminary injunction is maintenance of the status quo until a decision on the merits of a case is rendered.\u201d); accord \nHollon v. Mathis Independent School Dist., 491 F.2d 92 (5th Cir. 1974); Bath Industries, Inc. v. Blot, 427 F.2d 97 \n(7th Cir.). Due to the importance of maintaining the status quo, an injunction may not issue if it would disturb the \nstatus quo. See LaChemise Lacoste v. General Mills, Inc., 487 F.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir. 1973) (refusing to issue a \npreliminary injunction because it \u201cwould necessarily have gone beyond the maintenance of the status quo\u201d). This \nCourt finds that, given the long history of Philadelphia\u2019s reliance on the annual receipt of Byrne JAG grants, and the \nabsence of any evidence of abuse or misapplication, the preservation of the status quo is one substantial reason to \ngrant the City\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction.\n B. Philadelphia Has Demonstrated Irreparable Harm\n The Attorney General contends that Philadelphia cannot demonstrate it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary injunctive relief. More specifically, the Attorney\n\n 29 (1) Whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits; (2) Whether the movant \nwill be irreparably injured by denial of the relief; (3) whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater \nharm to the nonmoving party; and (4) whether granting the preliminary relief will be in the public interest. American \nCivil Liberties Union of New Jersey v. Black Horse Pike Regional Bd. of Educ., 84 F.3d 1471, 1477 n.2 (3d Cir. \n1996).\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 125 of 132\n 122\n\n General cites to National Federal, stating that the Supreme Court\u2019s Tenth Amendment \u201ccoerciveness\u201d analysis \nshows the City cannot demonstrate irreparable harm by virtue of \u201cabandoning its right to self-government.\u201d This \npoint somewhat conflates two areas of the law: the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d element of preliminary injunctions and the \nconstitutional threshold for Tenth Amendment \u201ccoerciveness.\u201d Nonetheless, because the city\u2019s potential Byrne \ngrant is only $1.6 million in FY 2017, it represents less than .1% of Philadelphia\u2019s overall annual budget. The worst \nthat could happen, according to the Attorney General, is that the DOJ moves forward on its Byrne awards and \nPhiladelphia is found ineligible for a tiny fraction of its budget.\n\n Philadelphia, on the other hand, notes that the $1.6 million represents far more than portrayed by the Attorney \nGeneral, who asserts that the $1.6 million is a very minor part of the overall City budget, or even the PPD\u2019s $600 \nmillion budget. However, the city shows approximately 97% of the PPD\u2019s budget is tied to wages and personnel \ncosts, which means the $1.6 million represents approximately 10% of the remaining PPD budget.\n\n With the additional funds, the City intends to bolster several criminal justice initiatives, including a dramatic \nexpansion in the availability of naloxone for its officers to revive civilians experiencing opioid overdose. Because the \nCity administered naloxone approximately 300 times last year, but opioid overdoses still accounted for 900 deaths \nin the City, Philadelphia seeks to use a portion of the Byrne funds to bolster its officers\u2019 ability to administer \n\n\n\nnaloxone in the field. Given the seriousness of the opioid crisis and its effects on the City, Philadelphia contends \nthat, \u201c[w]ithout hyperbole: These projects save lives.\u201d (Pl\u2019s Mot. at 5).\n\n Determining \u201cwhat may constitute irreparable harm in a particular case is, of course, dependent upon the particular \ncircumstances of the case.\u201d Oburn v. Shapp, 521 F.2d 142, 151 (3d Cir. 1975). The party moving for a preliminary \ninjunction \u201cmust demonstrate both a likelihood of Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 126 \nof 132\n 123\n success on the merits and the probability of irreparable harm if relief is not granted.\u201d Morton v. Beyer, 822 F.2d \n364, 367 (3d Cir. 1987). However, \u201c[e]stablishing a risk of irreparable harm is not enough. A plaintiff has the burden \nof proving a \u2018clear showing of immediate irreparable injury.\u2019\u201d ECRI v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 809 F.2d 223, 226 (3d Cir. \n1987) (quoting Continental Group, Inc. v. Amoco Chemical Corp., 614 F.2d 351, 359 (3d Cir. 1980).\n To demonstrate irreparable harm, the moving party may point to potential harm which cannot be redressed by a \nlegal or equitable remedy following trial. See Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797 (1989) \n(citing Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305 (1982) (\u201cThe Court has repeatedly held that the basis for \ninjunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.\u201d).\n\n The City has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is faced with a \u201cstark choice\u201d among the \nfollowing:\n (1) changing its policies to comply with the Jail Access, Advance Notification, and Certification conditions;\n\n (2) accepting the grant award knowing that the City may be later deemed out of compliance with the three \nconditions, thereby subjecting itself to debarment, administrating sanctions, and funding denials; or\n (3) forfeiting $1.6 million in funding.\n\n The first option would cause irreparable harm in light of this Court\u2019s finding that the conditions are likely \nunconstitutional, because changing the City\u2019s policies to conform to the Attorney General\u2019s conditions would \nconstitute a form of Constitutional harm. See Council of Alternative Political Parties v. Hooks, 121 F.3d 876, 883 (3d \nCir. 1997) (\u201cHaving concluded that requiring plaintiffs to file their petitions by April 10 likely violates their \nconstitutional rights, it clearly follows that denying them preliminary injunctive relief will cause them to be irreparably \ninjured.\u201d); accord County of Santa Clara v. Trump, No. 17-v-00485, 2017 WL 1459081, at *27\n\n Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 Page 127 of 132\n 124\n\n (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017) (plaintiff established a \u201cconstitutional injury\u201d and irreparable harm \u201cby being forced to \ncomply with an unconstitutional law or else face financial injury\u201d); See also City of El Cenizo v. State, 17-cv-404, \n2017 WL 3763098 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 30, 2017).\n\n The City has also demonstrated that the first option would lead to irreparable reputational harm.\n\n The second option would cause irreparable harm for the same reason. For example, this Court may eventually find \nat the merits stage that the Certification Condition is unconstitutional under the Spending Clause, and that the other \ntwo conditions were imposed outside the Attorney General\u2019s statutory authority. In this example, during the period \nbetween this opinion and the final decision of this case on the merits, the City would likely have been denied the \nfunds or later found out of compliance with the conditions at issue. This risk of injury for non-compliance is not \nspeculative: the DOJ\u2019s letter to Philadelphia on October 15, 2017 clearly stated that the DOJ considers the City to \nbe out of compliance with Section 1373. A finding of non-compliance from DOJ could cause debarment and \nsanctions, clear forms of irreparable injury.\n\n The third option, i.e., foregoing receipt of the funds to which Philadelphia may be entitled, would cause irreparable \nharm. Philadelphia is faced with a \u201cHobson\u2019s Choice\u201d between, on the one hand, complying with a law it credibly \nbelieves is unconstitutional, and on the other hand, foregoing funds it plans to use for life-saving projects. In City of \nChicago v. Sessions, the Court found that a similar \u201cHobson\u2019s Choice\u201d constituted irreparable harm, because it \n\n\n\nforced Chicago to decide between foregoing the \u201crelatively modest Byrne\u201d funds or submitting to a potentially \nunconstitutional law. 2017 WL 4081821, at *13 (citing Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374 (1992) \n(finding injunctive relief available where \u201crespondents were faced with a Hobson\u2019s Choice\u201d between acquiescing to \na law they credibly believed to be unconstitutional and Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed 11/15/17 \nimmigration law shows that the approaches of DOJ and the City have significant congruence, but also, departures \n\u2013 and each serves different functions. Immigration law is, of course, exclusively a federal concern; but criminal laws \nare federal, state, and local. Each sovereign has significant interests in enforcement, but cities, such as \nPhiladelphia, have concerns and issues that operate outside of both immigration law and criminal law.\n\n There is nothing inherently wrong or unusual with imposing conditions on the receipt of benefits. The operatic hero \nOrfeo was allowed to escape Hades with his deceased and beloved Eurydice, conditioned on his not looking at her, \nbut when he does, she dies; Mephistopheles grants Faust eternal knowledge and pleasure on the condition that \nFaust surrender his soul; and Salome, the title character demands the head of St. John the Baptist as a condition to \ndance for King Herod. However, in real life, the Courts, in interpreting the Constitution, and Congress in enacting \nlaws, as detailed at some length in this Memorandum, have interposed restrictions on the Executive\u2019s ability to \nimpose conditions on the transfer of benefits to local governments. Case 2:17-cv-03894-MMB Document 74 Filed \n11/15/17 Page 131 of 132\n 128\n\n Federalism is not an island floating in some distant ocean; there are many bridges, connecting federal, state and \nlocal governments. Some of these \u201cbridges\u201d are paved with money, some with conditions, and some with both. The \nByrne JAG grants are one of the latter. Principles of federalism allow a city to deal with local issues as it sees best. \nThe supremacy clause of the Constitution gives the federal government the final say \u2013 if, as, and when there is a \nconflict. In this case, given Philadelphia\u2019s unique approach to meshing the legitimate needs of the federal \ngovernment to remove criminal aliens with the City\u2019s promotion of health and safety, there is no conflict of any \nsignificance. For all these reasons, the Court finds Philadelphia can properly certify, as required by Section 1373, its \nsubstantial compliance with Byrne JAG conditions, and the Attorney General will be enjoined from denying the \nCity\u2019s Byrne JAG grant for FY 2017.\n An appropriate Order follows.30\n\n O:\\CIVIL 17\\17-3894 City v Sessions\\17cv3894 Memorandum re Motion for Prelim Inj.docx\n\n 30 The Order is entered with recognition that the City of Chicago injunction is presently in effect as to two of the \nChallenged Conditions. If this legal status changes, Plaintiff may apply for further relief.
