{"title": "Illegal workers snap up fake IDs", "body": "\nIllegal immigration in the Southwest is on the rise - three years after Congress halted the hiring of undocumented \nworkers, immigration officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe main culprit: readily available fake identification.\n\nOfficials have arrested 801,937 illegal immigrants on the Southwest border in the past 10 months, up 30 percent \nfrom the same period in the previous year, said Verne Jervis of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n''The word is out that it's easy to get work in the U.S. by buying the right fake documents from vendors on the \nborder area. It's become a cottage industry,'' said Richard Day, chief counsel for Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.\n\nSimpson co-sponsored a 1986 bill that made it illegal for employers to hire undocumented workers. The bill \nreduced the number of illegal immigrants until last May, when the trend began reversing, Jervis said.\n\nThe past three months have seen some of the highest increases in arrests, the INS said. December was up 58.3 \npercent; January, 39.6 percent; February, 57.3 percent.\n\nThe law cut the flow of illegal immigrants because they believed they could no longer get jobs in the USA, Day \nsaid.\n\nBut many, watching for weaknesses in the new law, found that fake documents could get them jobs, Day said.\n\n''If they get caught, it's no big deal. They get a bus ride back and come back the next night.''\n\nA common procedure is to use a fake Social Security card or birth certificate to get a legitimate driver's license.\n\nThe Bush administration is studying the document verification system to see how it can be improved, Day said.\n\nHe said the problem could be resolved by requiring immigrants to get a nationally recognized work authorization \ncard on counterfeit-resistant paper.\n\n''I'm not talking about an ID card that you have to carry around on the street. You would just use it when you're \nhired,'' Day said.\n"}
