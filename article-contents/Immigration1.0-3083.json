{"title": "RECALLING ST. PATRICK'S BRIGADE IRISH IMMIGRANT SOLDIERS FOUGHT FOR THE MEXICAN ARMY", "body": "\nIrish immigrant soldiers who deserted and fought for the enemy during the war with Mexico are revered south of \nthe border, honored in Ireland and all but forgotten in the United States.\n\nIt's time for this country to acknowledge the San Patricios existed, says Patrick Coggins, who is leading a crusade \nto dust off the history books.\n\nThe San Patricios (the St. Patrick's brigade) was the name of the unit the men formed in the Mexican Army. They \nfought well, maybe too well. Once back in American hands, 50 of them ended up at the end of a rope. Many others \nwere branded on the right cheek with a two-inch letter D -- for deserter.\n\nCoggins and some friends were to don San Patricio uniforms and march in San Francisco's St. Patrick's Day \nparade today. Last year the unit took first place.\n\nSome people objected to the heroic portrayal of the Irish soldiers when the 1995 documentary \"The San Patricios\" \nwas shown last year in San Antonio, said Coggins, who first heard of the San Patricios while working with Cesar \nChavez and the United Farm Workers in Delano 25 years ago,\n\nEvery year the San Patricios are remembered with a ceremony in Mexico City. There is also one in County Galway, \nIreland, birthplace of the brigade's commanding officer.\n"}
