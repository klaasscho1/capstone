{"title": "Managing Illegal Immigration", "body": "\nThe July 8 editorial \"Hounding Immigrants\"  said Prince William County's neighbors would be  harmed by a \ncrackdown on illegal  immigrants and asked: \"What would be accomplished by such a beggar-thy-neighbor policy?\" \nI think the answer is obvious -- neighboring counties will see the quality of life in Prince William improve and see \ntheir own problems with illegal immigration increase.\n\nThose counties will respond by passing similar measures, which will send illegal immigrants to other jurisdictions, \nwhich in turn will pass similar measures or suffer the consequences of more illegal immigration.\n\nAs a resident of Montgomery County, I will be watching the Prince William County housing market closely. My bet is \nthat quality of life will go up and that housing prices will follow.\n\nMICHAEL J. AMERY\n\nMontgomery Village\n\nIn his July 8 op-ed, \"Arizona's Border Burden,\"  about illegal immigration, David Broder wrote  that new state \nlegislation  \"requires every Arizona business to verify the legal status of each new employee. That's also a \nrequirement of long-established federal law, but the feds rarely enforce it.\"\n\nIf that requirement really exists under federal law, why isn't it enforced? The availability of jobs is a major part of the \nappeal for folks to enter this country, legally or illegally. If we discourage business owners from employing people \nwho are in this country illegally, that would have a significant impact on the problem. This also raises the question of \nthe viability of additional federal legislation: If the U.S. government does not enforce the current laws, why should \nwe think that new laws will have any greater effect against illegal immigration?\n\nCARL A.
