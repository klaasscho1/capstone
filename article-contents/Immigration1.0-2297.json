{"title": "In Israel, Help for Ethiopian Huddled Masses", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nWilliam Safire correctly points out the devastation occurring in the Ethiopian Israeli community because of \ninadequate educational opportunities (column, Sept. 9). But Ethiopian children have not been deliberately \n\"shunted\" by government policy to \"the worst schools in the poorest neighborhoods.\"\n\nMost Ethiopian immigrant families are poor, live in poor neighborhoods and send their children to underfinanced, \novercrowded neighborhood schools. These schools are disastrous for all children, but the Ethiopian youngsters \nfare worst because their parents usually lack any formal education of their own with which to enrich their children's \nlearning opportunities.\n\nMoreover, there are already channels through which \"outsiders can participate\" in immediate corrective measures. \nThe New York City-based North American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry, for example, sponsors assistance \nprograms, and the Washington-based New Israel Fund provides grants to nonprofit organizations in Israel.\n\nMr. Safire doesn't mention one of the most psychologically pressing problems affecting Ethiopian Israelis -- the \nmany divided families still waiting, five years after Operation Solomon, for family members left behind in Ethiopia. \nTheir long-delayed immigration causes as much anguish in Israel as in Addis Ababa.\n\nFinally, it is surely time to stop referring to, and thinking of, Ethiopian Israelis as \"black Jews.\" They are immigrants \nto Israel like any others, and their problems are not due to skin color but to poverty, lack of education and an \nenormous cultural and technological gap.\n\n \n\nMARK C.
