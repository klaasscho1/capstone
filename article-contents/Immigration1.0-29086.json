{"title": "Washington: NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014--Continued", "body": "\n United States Congress has issued the following proceedings and debate details:\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, last week I had the opportunity to see \n\nCharles Dickens' classic ``A Christmas Carol.'' As my colleagues know, \n\nthis is a morality tale that highlights the plight of the poor, the \n\nless fortunate, and the unemployed. In fact, when Charles Dickens began \n\nto work on ``A Christmas Carol,'' he was so upset with the plight of \n\nyouth and children working in the mines in England, he started out to \n\nwrite about that in a novel that evolved into a tale about Christmas, \n\n``A Christmas Carol.''\n\n As I watched ``A Christmas Carol'' with my wife in Ford's Theater \n\nabout a week ago, I was struck by the following line from the spirit of \n\nJacob Marley. Here is what he said:\n\n Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my \n\n business; charity, mercy, forbearance, benevolence, was all \n\n my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of \n\n water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.\n\n With that line, Dickens was advocating for those less fortunate and \n\nvoicing his support for economic equality. Those words are most \n\nappropriate today at this time of year.\n\n I come to the floor today with my friend, the Senator from Rhode \n\nIsland Jack Reed to share our concerns about the weak labor market, \n\nthose who have been unemployed for so long, and its impact on the \n\nNation's 11 million unemployed. Senator Reed and I are especially \n\n\nconcerned about those who have been without work for an extended period \n\nof time.\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n It has been 4 years since the end of the great recession, and while \n\nthe Nation's economy has been slow to recover, steadily adding jobs, a \n\nlarge section of society is still out of work. Of the Nation's 11 \n\nmillion unemployed, a little over 4 million of our friends and \n\nneighbors are considered long-term unemployed. That means they have \n\nbeen without work for 6 months or more.\n\n Most people who find themselves out of work are eligible to receive \n\nassistance from their State for 26 weeks, as they look for a new job. \n\nBut, for far too many, finding a new job in a sluggish economy has been \n\nextremely difficult. When State aid is exhausted, Federal emergency \n\nunemployment insurance kicks in and helps families to help make ends \n\nmeet. However, that safety net is now about to expire. It is about to \n\nexpire in just a couple of weeks.\n\n In fact, in less than 2 weeks, Federal emergency unemployment \n\ninsurance will run out. On December 28, 1.3 million people will lose \n\ntheir unemployment benefits. These are people who are obviously \n\nhurting. If they don't have a job, they would love to find a job, and \n\nif they have a job, they are trying to make ends meet. They are \n\nunderstandably discouraged, unsuccessful at finding work.\n\n We cannot cast them aside. We need to provide out-of-work Americans \n\nthe security they need while they continue to look for jobs. We need to \n\nhelp them look for work--clearly--and put food on the table for their \n\nfamilies.\n\n Extending the jobless aid to the long-time out-of-work must be a \n\npriority for this Congress. With the House already in recess, we will \n\nnot be able to extend emergency unemployment benefits before the end of \n\nthe year. But it is my hope that when Congress returns, we can \n\nretroactively extend benefits.\n\n At the same time, when we return next month, we need to explore long-\n\nterm unemployment solutions. We need to jump-start policies that will \n\ngrow our economy more rapidly and create new jobs. It has to be a dual \n\ntrack: Benefits for those unemployed but also assistance to find ways \n\nfor more people to get jobs.\n\n We all care deeply about this. I know no one who cares more deeply \n\nthan my good friend from Rhode Island Jack Reed. He has been working \n\ndiligently, looking at every possible solution to try to find a way to \n\nmake sure unemployment benefits are extended.\n\n That is why we are working together. This issue is under the \n\n\n\njurisdiction of the Finance Committee, but Jack has worked very hard to \n\nensure these Americans are not cast aside. Senator Reed and I will do \n\nall we can to try to find a solution.\n\n I tip my hat especially to the Senator from Rhode Island for all he \n\nhas done. He is a tireless advocate for a solution for those \n\nunemployed. Together, we will try, as Dickens said, to make the common \n\nwelfare our business.\n\n Thank you, Madam President.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n Mr. REED. Madam President, first let me thank Chairman Baucus for his \n\nvery kind words, but also salute the President of the United States for \n\nhis wisdom in announcing that he intends to appoint the Senator from \n\nMontana to be our next ambassador to the People's Republic of China. I \n\ncan't think of anyone whose integrity, intelligence, commitment to the \n\nNation, and patriotism would so well serve and be so beneficial to this \n\ncountry as continuing in his public efforts after his days in the \n\nSenate in the embassy in Beijing.\n\n I also thank the chairman because he has been an articulate and \n\neffective advocate for unemployment compensation benefits for hard-\n\nworking Americans who are without work through no fault of their own. \n\nThis economy has suffered a drastic contraction, beginning in 2007, \n\n2008, and 2009. We are seeing some improvements. During this period, \n\nthe chairman has been the key actor, the key force driving for extended \n\nbenefits.\n\n Chairman Baucus has been the driving force as well in the context of \n\ntrying to reform the program. He has implemented efforts such as work \n\nsharing, a proposal I brought to him, that is a smart way to do \n\nbusiness. It basically allows a company to retain their workers for \n\npart of the week and let them collect benefits for the rest of the \n\nweek, so they keep the workforce together. In Rhode Island, it has been \n\nextremely beneficial. It is now a nationwide program because of \n\nChairman Baucus.\n\n He is working very hard--as he indicated, we are working together--to \n\nensure that we do not see this cliff where 1.3 million Americans lose \n\ntheir benefits on December 28.\n\n Yesterday, I came to the floor to discuss some of the economics \n\nbehind the logic of extending these benefits. I believe the extensive \n\namount of economic research supports the very commonsense notion that I \n\nthink the vast majority of our colleagues share: That Americans want to \n\nwork. They are in an environment, however, where jobs are scarce. There \n\nare two workers for every job, and in some parts of the country that \n\nratio is even much worse.\n\n However, I hear other colleagues say: That might be true, but we have \n\n\n\nto fix this program because we have abuse and we have fraud. The \n\nchairman, in his efforts, has always demonstrated that we are committed \n\nto rooting out any type of fraud or abuse. In 2012, for example, we \n\nstrengthened the requirement that one has to search for work to qualify \n\nfor unemployment compensation. We also improved program integrity by \n\nhaving beneficiaries show up more frequently for in-person assessments \n\nto help them find a job quicker and ensure they receive the right \n\nbenefit amount based on their past work history.\n\n So we want the program to be efficient. We do not want the program to \n\nbe subject to abuse. That means that more people can benefit correctly \n\nand not abuse the system. So I am sure the chairman and I are quite \n\nwilling--I know I am, and I know he is too--to work hard if we need \n\nreforms. But we can't do that in 10 days. We can't do that. We need \n\nsome time.\n\n So I have joined together with Senator Heller to suggest a 3-month \n\nextension. That will allow us--and this is a bipartisan effort, and I \n\nthank the Senator from Nevada--to keep people from falling off the \n\nedge, literally.\n\n The average benefit in Rhode Island is about $350 a week. There are \n\nvery few people who are going to give up a job to collect about $350 a \n\nweek. By the way, that money is going right from the check to the local \n\ngrocery store, to pay for heat or to pay for rent. That is why CBO has \n\nestimated that if we don't extend unemployment benefits, we will see a \n\nsituation in which we lose approximately 200,000 jobs next year which \n\nwe could have otherwise had, and that we will see our economic GDP \n\ngrowth shrink by about 0.2 percent, because the demand generated by \n\nunemployment checks going out in the mail will be lost. It is one of \n\nthose programs that provides about $1.70, $1.60, for every dollar we \n\ninvest. So this is about good economics, not just, as Senator Baucus \n\nsaid so eloquently, about our commitment to something beyond ourselves, \n\nto the welfare and the good faith of our neighbors in the spirit of \n\nChristmas, the true spirit of this holiday.\n\n The other thing, too, is if we look at this argument: Well, we are \n\nnot going to extend the program because of abuse--we can look at a lot \n\nof programs; we can look at the crop insurance program, for example. I \n\ndon't hear many people saying: Oh, let's cut out that crop insurance \n\nprogram because of abuse. Just recently, this year, the Department of \n\nJustice prosecuted a very large, significant case of widespread tobacco \n\ncrop fraud spanning 6 years. A Federal district judge brought to \n\njustice an insurance agent and a farmer. Prison time was ordered, more \n\nthan $8 million of restitution had to be paid, but no one is standing \n\nup and saying: Let's cut crop insurance because of this case.\n\n Let's get realistic. We need to extend these benefits, and we need to \n\n\n\ndo it promptly because the 28th is just upon us.\n\n Shortly, I will make a unanimous consent request, but before that, I \n\nwish to recognize my colleague, Senator Stabenow. Then, I ask that at \n\n2:30, if she could yield the floor back to me so that I may make my \n\nrequest.\n\n With that, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, Federal emergency unemployment \n\nbenefits are going to expire on December 28 unless we do something to \n\nstop it.\n\n Right now, there are 11 million Americans out of work through no \n\nfault of their own.\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\n They are trying to find work, and they rely on unemployment insurance \n\nto help them keep food on the table and keep a roof over their heads \n\nand their families' heads, while they search for a new job.\n\n And now, over 1 million people who are trying to find work stand to \n\nlose their unemployment insurance on December 28 because Congress has \n\nnot acted.\n\n Let me repeat that: Just 3 days after Christmas, 1 million people \n\nwill lose a critical source of income while they look for work because \n\nof us.\n\n Letting Federal unemployment insurance expire would be devastating \n\nfor families all across the country.\n\n I have heard from many of my constituents in Michigan on just how bad \n\nthis will be, and how it will affect their families.\n\n There are stories throughout Michigan and across our country.\n\n It is astounding that Congress would even consider letting this \n\nexpire, given that unemployment rates in many States are higher today \n\nthan they were in 2008 when we passed this law.\n\n In June of 2008, when the President signed this law, the national \n\nunemployment rate was under 6 percent. Today, it is 7 percent.\n\n Even though we are seeing a number of great things happening in \n\nMichigan, we are still struggling to create enough jobs for everyone \n\nwho needs one.\n\n And because of that, Michigan just moved back into a position where, \n\nas a State with a high percentage of people out of work, Federal \n\nemergency unemployment benefits have been extended to 36 weeks.\n\n This means that people in Michigan who are trying to find a job get a \n\nfew more weeks to find something before they lose this critical \n\nlifeline.\n\n\n\n But not if we let it expire.\n\n The story is the same in many States across the country.\n\n Today, 46 out of the 50 states, including Michigan, have higher \n\nunemployment rates than they did when this law went into effect.\n\n While we are seeing some positive signs in the economic numbers, \n\nthere are still almost 11 million Americans out of work.\n\n That is far too many. There are three people who are looking for work \n\nfor every 1 job available.\n\n And if we don't act, if we don't extend this critical lifeline, then \n\nover 43,000 people in Michigan--and over 1 million longterm unemployed \n\npeople across the country--will face an uncertain future.\n\n We are six days from Christmas; six days from our children waking up \n\nand running to the Christmas tree to see what Santa brought them.\n\n And the question facing thousands of families in Michigan--facing \n\nRegina in Holland and Stephen in Dearborn--and over a million men and \n\nwomen across the country, is: Will there be anything under the tree on \n\nChristmas morning?\n\n Will there be a house to sleep in on Christmas Eve?\n\n Will there be food on the table tonight, or tomorrow night, or on \n\nChristmas night?\n\n These are people who are out of work through no fault of their own.\n\n People who have lost their jobs are already on the ropes.\n\n They have already seen cuts to unemployment insurance that have made \n\nit harder to make ends meet.\n\n And now Congress is threatening to pull the rug out from under them.\n\n These are people who want to work, who are trying to work, and just \n\nneed help getting by while they find a new job. Giving them the \n\nbenefits they earned isn't a ``disservice''--it is a lifeline.\n\n This is what little money families have to get by--and they spend it \n\nat the grocery store and to pay their bills.\n\n Without this help, they could lose their homes to foreclosure.\n\n At such a critical time in our economic recovery, we cannot afford \n\nanother wave of foreclosures.\n\n It is also important to note that this is unemployment insurance--\n\npeople earned it by working, and in order to qualify for this \n\nassistance, you must be actively looking for a job every week.\n\n Letting the Federal emergency unemployment benefits expire would hurt \n\nthese families and would send a ripple effect through the economy.\n\n Congress should be helping to create jobs, not pulling the rug out \n\nfrom under people looking for jobs.\n\n There is no reason for this to happen. We can pass a bill to extend \n\nthis critical help.\n\n\n\n In the past, both parties have always worked together to continue \n\nemergency unemployment insurance when the economy is struggling.\n\n This is not the time to pull the rug out from people looking for \n\nwork.\n\n I urge my colleagues to come together in a bipartisan way to extend \n\nunemployment insurance so our families--and the economy--do not suffer.\n\n Again, I thank Senator Reed who has been such a champion on this \n\nissue. I have been proud to partner with him on behalf of over a \n\nmillion people who are trying to find work and will lose their \n\nunemployment benefits three days after Christmas, on December 28. I \n\ncan't think of anything more devastating to families trying to put food \n\non the table and a roof over their heads.\n\n I also thank Senator Baucus for his leadership on this issue and \n\ncongratulate him on his new opportunity for the future.\n\n Specifically, let me read letters that I think tell it all from \n\npeople in Michigan.\n\n Regina from Holland writes:\n\n I am begging you to extend unemployment insurance. I have \n\n been unemployed since June. I am almost done with my first \n\n tier of unemployment. I have been trying to find work. I am \n\n 59 years old, and that does not help in finding a job.\n\n Madam President, let me say we have way too many women--we have way \n\ntoo many people who are in their 50s and in their 60s trying to find \n\nwork and having a very difficult time for a number of reasons.\n\n She goes on to say:\n\n If you don't pass extensions, my family will only have my \n\n husband's Social Security check coming in, and we'll lose our \n\n home. I am really scared we will not have this money coming \n\n in after December 28th, and I don't know what we will do.\n\n I also heard from Stephen in Dearborn who wrote me and said:\n\n This December 28 deadline directly affects me and my \n\n family. I have been unemployed for 6 months. I have been \n\n struggling to keep things afloat for my wife and my two young \n\n children.\n\n If these benefits cease at the end of the month, it will \n\n put us even closer to losing everything my wife and I have \n\n worked very hard for.\n\n The reality is, even though the economy is getting better, we still \n\nhave three people looking for every one job that is available. At one \n\ntime it was five people, so we have made some progress. But the truth \n\n\n\nis we still have a situation where way too many people in Michigan and \n\nacross the country--in fact, almost 11 million people are out of work, \n\nand we have three people fighting for every one job that is available.\n\n We also still have challenges as it relates to matching up the jobs \n\nwith the skills that people have. Not that people don't have skills, \n\nbut they are different than the jobs that are available. People going \n\nback to school, they want to work. We all want the dignity of financial \n\nindependence and work. But too many people are struggling in an economy \n\nthey did not create, a global economy they did not create.\n\n If we do not act--if we do not support Senator Reed's motion--over \n\n43,000 people in Michigan, over 1 million long-term unemployed people \n\nacross the country will find themselves in a devastating situation \n\nright after Christmas. It makes no sense. I urge my colleagues to join \n\ntogether and do what we have done with Republican Presidents, \n\nDemocratic Presidents, what we have done on a bipartisan basis over the \n\nyears; and that is to make sure we have a lifeline for people who are \n\nneeding temporary help while they look for work.\n\n I thank the Chair.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \n\nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 265, S. 1845, the \n\nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act; the bill be read a \n\nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \n\nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it is unfortunate that the Senate \n\nschedule is chock-full of pending cloture motions that are \n\ncontroversial or completely nonurgent nominations. So I\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\nwould ask the Senator to amend his consent request to say that the \n\npending cloture motions on executive nominations be withdrawn and that \n\nfollowing the disposition of the Defense bill, the Senate proceed to \n\nconsideration of S. 1845, the unemployment insurance extension, and \n\nthat the majority leader and the minority leader be recognized to offer \n\namendments in an alternating fashion so these important issues can be \n\nconsidered this week. I ask for that amended consent request.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n\n Mr. REED. I do not modify my request. I would insist on my request \n\nsince it is the only practical means of getting the measure passed.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n\n Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n\n Mr. REED. Madam President, I believe I have a few minutes left--2 \n\nminutes. So before Senator McCain takes the floor, let me make a few \n\nmore points that I think are critical.\n\n Last month, the economy did add jobs--203,000 jobs. But what we are \n\nseeing is the average length of unemployment is increasing. People are \n\nstill out of work now an average of 36 weeks. That is more than 20 \n\nweeks longer than prerecession levels, and it is longer than the 26 \n\nweeks of State unemployment insurance.\n\n That is why we are here asking for benefits. People now are averaging \n\na much longer time without finding work. This is not a situation where \n\nthey fall within the State program. They have to have these Federal \n\nbenefits, because it is harder and harder to find work.\n\n I would also suggest, too, that if you look at it another way, in \n\n2008, when President Bush started this emergency unemployment \n\ncompensation program, it took the average jobless American 5.6 months \n\nto find employment. Now, with the increased long-term unemployment, it \n\ntakes about 9 months.\n\n So again, this is a reason why these long-term extended benefits are \n\nabsolutely necessary. I would hope our colleagues would join myself and \n\nSenator Heller and Chairman Baucus and Senator Stabenow and others and \n\ncontinue to move aggressively forward and see if we can, in fact, \n\nextend the benefits so that many Americans can continue to have some \n\nassistance and some sustenance as they continue to look for work.\n\n With that, I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I just watched again what is going on \n\nhere on the floor of the Senate. Again there is a unanimous consent \n\nrequest to pass a major piece of legislation without an amendment, \n\nwithout debate, without the ability of those on this side of the aisle \n\nto even have an amendment considered and voted on, again completely \n\nshutting out this side of the aisle from the ability in any way to \n\neffect legislation.\n\n So now I am sure those on the other side of the aisle are going to go \n\nout and say: Oh, the Republicans, look at them, they will not even \n\nagree to an extension of unemployment insurance.\n\n Won't you let us have an amendment? Won't you let us at least have \n\ndebate and vote on an amendment? There are some of us who think this \n\nprogram can be improved to help those who are unemployed. But, no, the \n\nway the Senate runs today it is either take it or leave it.\n\n I will tell the Chair and I will tell my colleagues on the other side \n\nof the aisle, we are getting sick and tired of it. We are getting sick \n\nand tired of the dictatorial way the U.S. Senate is being run.\n\n The Senator from South Carolina and I are on the floor to talk about, \n\n\n\namong other things, the National Defense Authorization Act, the bill \n\nthat has to do with this Nation's defense. Are we going to be able to \n\nhave a single amendment? No. The bill has been out of the Senate Armed \n\nServices Committee since May.\n\n So we are not going to address the issue of sexual assaults, \n\nprotecting individual rights in light of revelations in NSA data \n\ncollection. I would say to my colleagues, the President had a \n\ncommission that just made some recommendations. Would it not be \n\nappropriate to take those commission recommendations, debate them here \n\non the floor of the Senate, and amend the bill so that some of these \n\nrecommendations by this commission could be enacted into law?\n\n Do we believe that the issue of surveillance, of NSA data collection, \n\nis not an issue that should be debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate? \n\nWe would be doing that--we would be debating, we would be amending, we \n\nwould be making it better, we would be protecting the privacy of \n\nAmericans' lives--if on this floor we were amending and debating the \n\nDefense authorization bill. But we are not. We are not.\n\n Are we going to talk about this incredible issue which has permeated \n\nso much debate, both in and outside of the Congress of the United \n\nStates, of sexual assaults in the military? No. Nope. We are not going \n\nto allow an amendment on the other side of the aisle by the Senator \n\nfrom New York, who has made it her major legislative effort. We are not \n\ngoing to hear from this side of the aisle, where the Senator from \n\nMissouri has made it her major issue. No, we are not going to debate \n\nit. We are not going to amend it.\n\n What about the issue of detainees? The Senator from South Carolina \n\nand I are not in complete agreement. I had looked forward to a debate \n\nwith him about how we dispose of the situation of detainees, each one \n\nof whom is costing a million and a half dollars per year for their \n\nincarceration.\n\n But, no, we are not going to do any of that today or tomorrow or next \n\nweek or next month or maybe even next year if the majority leader of \n\nthe Senate continues to run the Senate in such a way that we cannot \n\neven have debate and discussion.\n\n I will tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this is bad \n\nfor the U.S. Senate, but it is worse for the American people. We have \n\nan obligation to the American people to debate issues, to vote on them, \n\nto pass legislation that we think is the best outcome. There would be \n\nvotes I would lose, there would be votes I would win, but we are not \n\ngoing to have any votes.\n\n The galling thing about it is that the Defense bill passed through \n\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in May. So we went to June, July, \n\n\n\nAugust, September, October, November, and here we are finally maybe \n\ngoing out for the year and we are going to have an up-or-down vote--an \n\nup-or-down vote--on the Defense authorization bill. That is shameful. \n\nThat is a perversion of everything that the U.S. Senate was designed \n\nfor by our Founding Fathers, and there is no doubt about it.\n\n I came to the floor with my friend from South Carolina to talk about \n\nIran sanctions. But have no doubt--have no doubt--I tell my colleagues \n\non the other side of the aisle, you are doing a great disservice to the \n\nAmerican people, to the men and women who are serving this Nation, by \n\nnot even fully debating and amending and voting on those amendments on \n\nthis bill. You are doing a disservice to the men and women who are \n\nserving this Nation.\n\n So you should not be proud of this process we are going through. Some \n\ntime today or tomorrow, depending on how many hours go by, we will have \n\na vote, and I will vote to pass the bill. I will vote that way because \n\nI cannot do this to the American people, to the men and women who are \n\nserving. There are too many provisions in it that address bonuses, \n\nspecial duty, incentive pay, military construction, security--all kinds \n\nof issues that are obtained in this bill. So we cannot turn it down, \n\nbut we cannot make it a bill that the American people should be proud \n\nof. In fact, we should be embarrassed at the process we are engaged in.\n\n Frankly, I know the American people are not too interested or aware \n\nof the arcane promises of the U.S. Senate, but steps were taken early \n\nand not that long ago that have changed the entire U.S. Senate, and it \n\nhas changed it for the worse.\n\n I can assure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that it \n\nwill be very difficult--very, very difficult--for us to work with our \n\ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle on most any issue when we are \n\nbeing deprived of the fundamental rights of a U.S. Senator, and that is \n\nthe right to propose an amendment, debate, and have a vote, if that \n\nU.S. Senator wishes it.\n\n No longer are 45 Members on this side of the aisle allowed what \n\nshould be our right--not a privilege, our right--to amend this \n\nlegislation in order to\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nmake it better and make it a better and more effective way to defend \n\nthis Nation.\n\n I have been around this body for a long time. This may be one of the \n\nlowest points I have seen, particularly in light of the fact that the \n\nDefense authorization bill for 51 years has been brought to the floor \n\nof the Senate, it has been debated, it has been amended, sometimes for \n\nas long as 3 weeks, and now what are we going to do? Sometime tonight \n\n\n\nor tomorrow, at some hour, we are going to have the privilege of voting \n\nyea or nay on a bill that is vital to our Nation's security. \n\nDisgraceful.\n\n I see my colleague from South Carolina on the floor, and I ask \n\nunanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from South \n\nCarolina.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Iran Sanctions\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am sure my colleague and friend saw \n\nthe article in the Wall Street Journal this morning that says ``France \n\nDoubts Iran Ready for Nuclear Pact. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius \n\nQuestions Whether Tehran Is Willing to Abandon the Ability to Build an \n\nAtomic Bomb.''\n\n Really, in the first paragraph of this story--I would ask my \n\ncolleague--is the fundamental problem. There are many issues concerning \n\nthe Iranians lie, cheat for years and years about their continued \n\nprogress toward the acquisition of a nuclear weapon. But I would ask my \n\nfriend from South Carolina, isn't it really about the most important--\n\nlet me put it this way: The most important aspect of this whole issue \n\nof these negotiations is the right to enrich? In other words, will the \n\nIranians--haven't we already given over to them the right to continue \n\nto have the centrifugal spin and the enrichment process continue so \n\nthat at some point, sooner or later, they may be only the turn of a \n\nwrench away from a nuclear weapon?\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Senator McCain is absolutely right. The interim deal does \n\nnot dismantle the centrifuges. They are spinning as we talk. They \n\ndisconnect, not dismantle, some advanced centrifuges that have been \n\ninstalled.\n\n What people need to realize is that the Iranians, over the last \n\ndecade--particularly the last 3 years--have developed a very mature \n\nenrichment program: 18,000 centrifuges. They do not need 20-percent \n\nenriched uranium anymore for these new centrifuges to get to 90 \n\npercent, which would produce a uranium-based bomb; they can do it with \n\na 3\\1/2\\-percent stockpile.\n\n So I guess this is the basic question for us as a nation and the \n\nworld at large: Do you believe the Iranians when they say that they are \n\nnot trying to develop a nuclear weapon, that they are only trying to \n\ndevelop peaceful nuclear power? Do you believe them when they make that \n\nclaim given the reality of their enrichment program, their lying, and \n\ntheir cheating? If their goal is to enrich not for peaceful nuclear \n\npower purposes but to make a bomb, how do you get them to change their \n\n\n\ngoal?\n\n I think what Senator McCain is pointing out is very important. The \n\ninterim deal, like it or not, has legitimized enrichment in Iran. How \n\ndo you go from not dismantling the plutonium reactor--complete \n\ndismantling, shutting down and dismantling the centrifuges--and turning \n\nthe stockpile over to the international community after the interim \n\ndeal--how do you go from there to the end game? We are so far away from \n\nan acceptable outcome.\n\n I hope people understand what the French are saying. The French are \n\ntelling us they do not believe that the Iranian negotiators and the \n\nIranian regime are serious about abandoning an enrichment program that \n\ncould break out and produce a nuclear weapon.\n\n I appreciate Senator McCain's leadership on these issues. Syria, \n\nIran--you name it, he has been there.\n\n I would like to ask this question to Senator McCain: Does the Senator \n\nbelieve the Iranians when they say they are not trying to acquire a \n\nnuclear weapon? From the U.S.-Israel point of view, what would happen \n\nto our nations if they had that capability?\n\n Mr. McCAIN. May I say to my friend that one of the things that would \n\nhappen right away--I think it is well known; it is not a secret--is \n\nthat many nations in the region would then quickly acquire nuclear \n\nweapons. The wealthiest ones might just buy one from Pakistan. That is \n\nnot a secret.\n\n But could I ask my colleague this: So therefore we now have a period \n\nof 6 months which originally was stated as the end goal, that an \n\nagreement would be made and finalized and would be ready to be put into \n\neffect. But then we hear: Well, maybe it is going take more than 6 \n\nmonths.\n\n One, haven't we seen that movie before--extended and protected \n\nnegotiations, and then the centrifuges, as the Senator from South \n\nCarolina mentioned, continue to spin.\n\n Also, wouldn't it be appropriate for the Congress to say to the \n\nadministration--and, more importantly, to the Iranians--that after 6 \n\nmonths, my friends, the screws are going to tighten because if they \n\ncannot get an agreement in 6 months, then it would be appropriate for \n\nthere to be additional pressures that would then hopefully be \n\nincentives for them to reach a final agreement rather than the status \n\nquo, which most of us believe is not satisfactory under this 6-month \n\nperiod.\n\n Should there not be some sanctions that would kick in after a 6-month \n\nperiod, and then the Iranians would know that if they do not reach an \n\nagreement, then the sanctions will be more severe?\n\n\n\n Perhaps my colleague can explain to me why the Secretary of State and \n\nthe administration seem to be so opposed to us putting more pressure on \n\nthe whole process to be finalized. Six months seems to be a reasonable \n\nlength of time to get that done.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Well, the Senator is right. This interim agreement has \n\nnot been implemented yet. They have 6 months to reach a final agreement \n\nbut also an additional 6 months beyond that--a year, basically--to drag \n\nout these negotiations.\n\n The Senator asked the ultimate question. Does the Senator not believe \n\nsanctions are the only reason the Iranians are at the table?\n\n I compliment the administration for putting together an international \n\nregime to take the sanctions that Congress has passed--over their \n\nobjections, I might add--to really inflict pain on the Iranian regime--\n\nunfortunately, the people too. But that is the only reason they are at \n\nthe table.\n\n But here is the analysis, as I understand it. People in the \n\nadministration believe there is a moderate element and a hard-line \n\nelement. Iran is telling the United States and the P5+1: If you \n\nthreaten us with any more sanctions, we will walk away. We are not \n\ngoing to negotiate with a gun to our heads.\n\n Now, these are the people who have been using a lot of guns and have \n\nput a lot of guns to people's heads and actually pulled the trigger, \n\nkilled hundreds of soldiers in Iraq, and have created chaos and mayhem \n\nin Syria. They are one of the biggest supporters of state terrorism. \n\nBut that is an odd thing for them to say, when I believe the only \n\nreason they are at the table to begin with is because of sanctions.\n\n So my belief is that new sanctions tied to the end game--and this is \n\nwhat we have been working on in a bipartisan fashion. It is not just \n\nkeeping the sanctions alive for the next year; it is tying their relief \n\nto an outcome that we all want.\n\n I want a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear program. If they \n\nwant a peaceful nuclear power program, they can have it; just control \n\nthe fuel cycle. That has been my position.\n\n If they want an enrichment capability that has to be monitored by the \n\nU.N. and it is robust and the only reason they will not break out to \n\nget a nuclear weapon is because of U.N. inspectors, that is North \n\nKorea.\n\n The movie the Senator talked about is the movie called North Korea, \n\nwhere you would impose sanctions, you would relieve them, you would \n\ngive them money, you would give them food, you would reinstate \n\nsanctions, and you would have U.N. inspectors to control the progress. \n\nThe program was never dismantled.\n\n\n\n Don't repeat the mistakes in Iran that were repeated in North Korea. \n\nDismantle this program before it is too late.\n\n To the administration, we are trying to help, not hurt. I do not \n\nbelieve there is a moderate element when it comes to the Iranian \n\nnuclear power program. I think that is a facade. The new President is a \n\ncharming fellow on television, but he was a nuclear negotiator in 2004 \n\nand 2005 for the Iranian regime and openly bragged about how much \n\nadvancement they made during his time\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nnegotiating toward an enrichment program that could produce a bomb.\n\n So this idea that there are hard-liners and moderates when it comes \n\nto the Iranian nuclear program is a miscalculation. So we are working \n\non bipartisan sanctions, to continue them, and they can only be \n\nrelieved when we dismantle the enrichment program, when we dismantle \n\nthe plutonium reactor, the heavy water reactor that has nothing to do \n\nwith producing nuclear power for peaceful purposes, and remove the \n\nstockpile as the U.N. has recommended. The U.N. resolutions are in \n\nforce today, are on the books today. This agreement is to the left of \n\nthe U.N.\n\n So the reason we are pushing sanctions in a bipartisan fashion is we \n\nwant to avoid a conflict. The Iranian nuclear program has to be stopped \n\none way or the other--through diplomacy and sanctions or through force, \n\nunless--that is the option. I cannot imagine a world with Ayatollahs \n\nwith nukes. It would create a nuclear arms race. The Senator just got \n\nback from Saudi Arabia. Sunni Arab nations would want their own nuclear \n\nweapon, and we would be on the road to Armageddon. Israel--my God, how \n\ncould they sit on the sideline and watch a nuclear weapon be produced \n\nby people who threaten every day to wipe them off the map?\n\n We are hoping we can produce sanctions that would enable and enhance \n\nthe administration's opportunity to get a peaceful resolution. \n\nSanctions and diplomacy end the program in a peaceful way. This is our \n\nlast chance. If we get this wrong, history will judge us poorly. They \n\nare trying to get a nuclear weapon. They are hellbent. The only thing \n\nthat will stop them is pressure.\n\n I want to ask the Senator a question. Why are Japanese banks and \n\nother business entities rushing to do business with Iran when the \n\ninterim deal--relief and sanctions--do you believe that the \n\ninternational community is of the mindset that the sanctions are \n\nbreaking down, that they are trying to jump ahead of each other to do \n\nbusiness with Iran, and that if Congress passed a new round of \n\n\n\nsanctions, it would stop that breakout? Do you think that makes sense?\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Well, I think it might. I think this whole perception of \n\nthe United States around the world, of our weakness, whether it be \n\nmanifested in the Middle East with recent--I am sure my friend from \n\nSouth Carolina saw the comments of the former high-ranking member of \n\nthe Saudi Government. The Japanese are now starting to go their own way \n\nbecause they believe the American pivot is not reality. There are \n\nmanifestations of this perception of American weakness all over the \n\nworld. So I am not sure they believe we are serious here or most \n\nanyplace else.\n\n The Senator from South Carolina raises an excellent point. I seem to \n\nremember that during the days of the Cold War we used to look at the \n\nreviewing stand on the May Day Parade, and we would point out one guy \n\nand say: Well, he is a moderate. He is a soft-liner. Well, he is a \n\nhard-liner. You know, we hope that--fill in the blank--is going to \n\nreally have a beneficial effect and that the Russians are going to \n\nchange and blah, blah, blah. There was always this belief about hard-\n\nliners and soft-liners. We know now from history that was never the \n\ncase.\n\n So now we look at Iran. Oh, there are the hard-liners and the soft-\n\nliners. Doesn't that ignore the fundamental fact that there is one man \n\nwho governs Iran and makes all the decisions? That guy is the \n\nAyatollah. Now that Ahmadinejad, the hard-liner--and Rouhani, by the \n\nway, as the Senator from South Carolina mentioned, bragged and bragged \n\nabout how he deceived the Americans and the other countries when he was \n\nthe negotiator for Iran. Now he is the moderate. Now he is the good \n\nguy. So all this is fraud.\n\n But I guess the other point that I think really needs to be made that \n\nwe forget is this: In Syria and in Iran--this administration, this \n\nPresident, and this Secretary of State look at these countries as an \n\narms control issue. They look at Syria as an arms control issue while \n\nfrom helicopters they are dropping bombs that are killing and \n\nmassacring women and children, while they are committing the most \n\natrocious acts--on the one hand, the Secretary of State and his friend \n\nSergei Lavrov are removing chemical weapons from Syria while planeloads \n\nof weapons from Russia fly into Damascus, and they kill people. I am \n\nnot sure whether a mother in Syria can discriminate whether that child \n\nwas killed by a chemical weapon or by a conventional weapon.\n\n So here we have the Iranians committing acts of terror all over the \n\nworld, sending the Iranian Revolutionary Guard into Syria, training \n\nBashar Assad's troops in Iran and sending them back, sending in supply \n\nafter supply of weapons to kill Syrians, plots to kill even the Saudi \n\nArabia Ambassador here in Washington, DC. Yemen has tried to smuggle in \n\n\n\na whole boatload of weapons from Iran. The list goes on and on of their \n\nPersian ambitions throughout the Arab world and the world, but, by \n\ngolly, we trust them to sit down and negotiate with us seriously on the \n\nissue of nuclear weapons. This is the most narrow view of Iran that has \n\never happened in history.\n\n So I do not see how we can judge Iranian seriousness about really \n\nwanting to rein in and eliminate their progress toward nuclear weapons \n\nwithout considering their behavior throughout the world, particularly \n\nin the Middle East, which is one of aggression, terror, and outright \n\nmurder of people and destabilizing the entire region to the Iranian \n\nadvantage.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I think the point Senator McCain is making is dead-\n\non. Is it not true that our government has designated the Iranian \n\nregime--their government--as one of the largest state sponsors of \n\nterrorism in the world? Is that correct?\n\n Mr. McCAIN. True.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Now, here is the question. It is a good question. If they \n\nhad a nuclear weapon, would they be likely to end such activity or \n\nwould they be more effective in expanding it?\n\n Mr. McCAIN. May I interrupt? I forgot one aspect of Iranian behavior \n\nthat is the most egregious: their sponsorship of Hezbollah. There are \n\n5,000 Hezbollah from Lebanon, sponsored by Iran, who are killing \n\nSyrians as we speak at the bidding of the Ayatollah and maybe Rouhani, \n\nwho is supposed to be a moderate.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. I think what the Senator has just described--the litany \n\nof chaos and mayhem spread by the Iranian regime that he knows probably \n\nbetter than anyone because he spent so much time there--it is Hezbollah \n\nbut also Hamas. They are all in. The people who create the biggest \n\nupheaval for Israel are all in for their buddy Assad, the butcher of \n\nDamascus. Without Iran's support, one of the most evil people on the \n\nplanet would not have a chance.\n\n Doesn't the Senator believe we are in a proxy war between us and the \n\nIranians in Syria? That if we don't--and our actions towards whether we \n\nare going to use force or we are not going to use force, with Assad \n\nwinning--that our policies toward Syria are affecting the regime's \n\nbelief about what we may do about their nuclear program?\n\n One thing that might reset our resolve as a nation is for the \n\nCongress to impose additional sanctions so the Ayatollahs will not be \n\nconfused about our lack of will in Syria when it comes to their nuclear \n\nprogram. The bottom line is, after our debacle in Syria, doesn't the \n\nSenator think we have a problem with the Iranian regime of taking us \n\nseriously?\n\n\n\n The international community is now breaking the sanctions. If new \n\nsanctions were imposed in a bipartisan way, that is the best way to \n\nreset the debate.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. I would also point out, one, if we are looking for one \n\nbright spot, that we see countries in the gulf and the Middle East \n\naligning with Israel in a way that we have never seen before. Shouldn't \n\nwe listen to the Prime Minister of Israel, which is the first target of \n\nIran? It is the country about which the Iranians said, and have not \n\nrenounced, that it is their commitment to ``wiping Israel off the \n\nmap.'' Does the Senator think that maybe relations between ourselves \n\nand Israel are at the lowest ebb?\n\n Does the Senator think it is an accident when now the Saudis and \n\nleaders of other countries are outspoken in their derision of the \n\nUnited States for a lack of leadership in the Middle East?\n\n Finally, isn't it interesting that the Russians, for the first time \n\nsince 1973, when Anwar Sadat threw them out of Egypt, are now major \n\nplayers in the Middle East?\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. I think the whole Middle East is going in the wrong \n\ndirection at warp speed. Congress has some obligation to speak up, to \n\ndo something about it, and to try to help the administration when we \n\ncan.\n\n No. 1, a new round of sanctions, if we could muster bipartisan \n\nsupport, would send a great message to the Iranians: We don't see you \n\nthe same as we do Syria.\n\n There was a lot of confusion and differences in the body about what \n\nto do in Syria.\n\n The Senator has been right for 3 years on this whole topic, but we \n\nare where we are. So a new round of sanctions, bipartisanly passed, \n\nwould tell the Iranians that the American Congress and people look at \n\nthem differently than the problem in Syria.\n\n It would also be a statement in the international community: We are \n\nresolved to get this program dismantled by using sanctions. We are not \n\nbacking off, so stop this breakout.\n\n Finally to our friends, to the Israelis, to the Sunni Arab States, \n\nwouldn't it be welcome news to be tougher on Iran and to have the \n\nCongress reinforce the message to the Iranians that we are going to \n\nkeep in place sanctions until they dismantle their program? Wouldn't \n\nthat be some welcome news in a region that is absolutely desperate for \n\nsome good news from America?\n\n Mr. McCAIN. I think so.\n\n\n\n I thank my colleagues for their forbearance. I agree with the Senator \n\nfrom South Carolina.\n\n I think it is imperative for the Congress and our role in the U.S. \n\nGovernment that these sanctions be enacted. The administration has \n\nplenty of time to negotiate, but we want to be prepared for failure. \n\nThere is no reason not to make those preparations.\n\n I began our conversation with the comments of the foreign minister of \n\nFrance. That concern is shared by many of our friends and allies both \n\nin and out of the region.\n\n I note the presence of the Senator from Mississippi on the floor. I \n\nam sure he has some very important words that will be translated into \n\nEnglish.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n Mr. WICKER. It would be inconceivable for the senior Senator from \n\nArizona to say anything which I would find offensive or insulting, and \n\nI take no offense from his remarks.\n\n I wish to be recognized. We are in morning debate; are we in debate \n\non the pending question?\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture and the Senator is \n\nrecognized.\n\n Mr. WICKER. I understand that soon Senator Levin will come to the \n\nfloor, and perhaps there will be an exchange between Senator Cornyn and \n\nSenator Levin about a matter that may be coming to a vote sometime in \n\nthe next half hour, and that would be the motion to table the filling \n\nof the tree.\n\n I wish to speak for a moment or two about that. I think sometimes we \n\ntalk about these things in shorthand within the Senate, and perhaps our \n\nconstituents don't know what we are referring to when we say the \n\nmajority leader has come in and filled the tree.\n\n I know most Members understand this, but what that means is the \n\nmajority leader comes in and he offers all of the amendments that could \n\npossibly be ordered at one particular time and, therefore, doesn't give \n\nanyone else the opportunity to offer amendments. That has really been a \n\nproblem for us on the minority side.\n\n We have that situation now, and perhaps the motion that will soon be \n\nmade by Senator Cornyn will take care of that.\n\n But on this important Defense bill, which has been brought to the \n\nfloor in a shorthand manner, the majority leader has filled the tree, \n\nand there are five amendments offered.\n\n One of the amendments, amendment No. 2555 by Senator Reid of Nevada, \n\nsimply does this: Strike the words ``3 days'' and put ``4 days.''\n\n That is all the amendment does.\n\n\n\n Another amendment: Strike the words ``4 days'' and insert ``5 days.''\n\n That is all the amendment does.\n\n There is another amendment that says: The act shall be effective 3 \n\ndays after enactment.\n\n There is another amendment that helps fill the tree: Change the word \n\n``request'' to ``requested.''\n\n In other words, not substantive amendments, but amendments designed \n\nto simply fill up the parliamentary tree and prohibit Members on our \n\nside or other Members from offering a substantive motion that might \n\naffect the defense policy of the United States of America.\n\n I would simply point this out and reiterate what Senator Cornyn said \n\nearlier today. Since becoming majority leader, our current majority \n\nleader, Senator Reid of Nevada, has filled the tree 79 times--in other \n\nwords, offered all the amendments, prohibiting us from even getting a \n\nvote, getting a debate, on an idea that we might have.\n\n By contrast, his 6 predecessors combined filled the tree only 49 \n\ntimes; in other words 79 times by this majority leader and 40 times by \n\nthe other Democratic and Republican majority leaders.\n\n Senate majority leader Bill Frist filled the tree 15 times during his \n\n4 years. Democratic leader Tom Daschle filled the tree only once during \n\nhis 1\\1/2\\ years.\n\n Trent Lott was majority leader, and he did it 11 times in 5 years. \n\nGeorge Mitchell from Maine, a very distinguished majority leader, \n\nfilled the tree 3 times in 6 years; and Bob Dole, when he was majority \n\nleader, filled the tree 7 times in 3\\1/2\\ years.\n\n The point I am making--and then I will sit down--is that this \n\nmajority leader, in an unprecedented manner, has filled the tree over \n\nand over. Why? To prevent other Senators from having an opportunity, as \n\nrepresentatives of the 50 States, to offer ideas to improve bills and \n\nto get them on record on important issues.\n\n I would hope that we could have a parliamentary motion in just a few \n\nmoments to allow this tree to be taken down and to allow the elected \n\nrepresentatives of the 50 States to come before the President of the \n\nSenate and before the American people and offer different ideas.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. In a moment I will offer an amendment, and I know the \n\ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is here, but I \n\nwish to lay 5 minutes of groundwork.\n\n The majority leader was down here earlier today talking about all the \n\n``necessary votes'' that we have to have before everyone leaves town \n\nbefore the holidays. Of course, he was talking about a series of votes \n\n\n\non nominees that he himself has set up since he is, in essence, the \n\ntraffic cop for the Senate, and he gets to set the agenda unilaterally.\n\n We know that while the majority leader has set up this series of \n\nvotes on nominations--none of which are urgent and couldn't be done in \n\nJanuary, and all of which are controversial--the majority leader is \n\nrefusing to allow any vote on restoring pension benefits to the men and \n\nwomen of the U.S. Armed Services.\n\n As we have talked about repeatedly over the last couple of days, the \n\nrecent budget deal cuts their pension benefits by some $6 billion over \n\n10 years, and we have learned that this agreement slashes the pension \n\nbenefits of some of our wounded warriors, people who are medically \n\nretired.\n\n Senator Murray from Washington, the distinguished chairman of the \n\nSenate Budget Committee, has called this a technical error--a technical \n\nerror. She said it needs to be fixed, but we will do this next year.\n\n Merry Christmas to our wounded warriors whose pensions, by virtue of \n\nthe legislation that passed yesterday, have now been cut.\n\n What makes matters worse is they have been discriminated against. No \n\nother Federal employee's pension benefits were cut, only those \n\nuniformed military members' pensions.\n\n She calls it a technical error. I called it a mistake that needs to \n\nbe fixed--not next month, not next year, but right now, today.\n\n Why is it that the majority leader won't let us fix this right now. \n\nWhy is it that he is blocking a vote on the relevant amendment? Why \n\ndoes he want to keep our veterans and our active duty military, \n\nincluding our wounded warriors, in limbo during the Christmas holidays?\n\n Does he have a good reason for it? Is it really more important to \n\nconfirm some mid-level appointees than to\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nmake sure that our wounded combat veterans get the pensions that they \n\nhave earned?\n\n Is it really more important for the Democrats to jam us with \n\nnonessential, nonurgent nominees than to take care of the people who \n\nsacrificed so much for their country?\n\n One last question. Is it really more important to approve all of \n\nthese nominees than to honor the men and women who lost their lives in \n\na homegrown terrorist attack at Fort Hood, Texas, some 4 years ago at \n\nthe hands of MAJ Nidal Hasan, a radicalized major in the U.S. Army who \n\nshouted the words ``Allahu Akbar'' before he proceeded to mow down 13 \n\npeople, costing them their lives, and to injure 30 more soldiers and \n\nuniformed military who were injured that day.\n\n The majority seems to think of this group of nonurgent, and \n\n\n\ncontroversial mid-level nominees that we have to get this done. That is \n\nwhy he is jamming this through and not allowing us to amend this \n\nlegislation with a fix to the military pension or to allow us to honor \n\nthe victims at Fort Hood with the recognition and the benefits that \n\nthey so richly deserve.\n\n Unfortunately, like so much around here lately, it is politics all \n\nthe time, even if that means sleighting our wounded warriors and \n\nrefusing to honor 13 brave Americans who were killed by a terrorist \n\nattack at a U.S. Army base.\n\n I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending motion so that I may \n\noffer a motion to concur with amendment No. 2602, which is filed at the \n\ndesk.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Objection.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n The Senator from Michigan.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if the good Senator from Texas \n\nwould consent to my being allowed to speak for 5 minutes prior to the \n\nmotion to table, which I understand is going to be forthcoming?\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Responding to the distinguished Senator through the \n\nChair, I would be happy for him to take whatever time he wishes to make \n\ncomments now. Since he has made the objection, this would be a good \n\ntime to do so, if he wishes.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. I very much appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \n\nTexas.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Let me try in 5 minutes to encapsulate what is in the bill \n\nand why we are where we are.\n\n The bill includes numerous provisions, as the Presiding Officer \n\nknows, to sustain the compensation and quality of life of our service \n\nmen and women and their families--the quality of life they deserve as \n\nthey face the hardships that are imposed by continuing military \n\noperations around the world.\n\n In just a few of these provisions are 30 types of bonuses and special \n\npay, $25 million for supplemental impact aid to local education \n\nagencies with military dependent children, money to assist the \n\nDepartment of Defense in assisting veterans in their transition to \n\ncivilian life, provisions for the Special Operations Command at $9 \n\nbillion, $1 billion for counter-IED efforts, a provision to require the \n\nDepartment of Defense to streamline the Department of Defense \n\nmanagement headquarters at all levels by changing or reducing the size \n\nof staffs and eliminating tiers of management, cutting functions that \n\nprovide little or no added value, and a new land withdrawal provision \n\n\n\nthat the Marine Corps has been working so hard on at 29 Palms, CA. This \n\nis the No. 1 legislative priority of the Marine Corps. The Commandant \n\nexplained to us that the Marine Corps has spent 6 years analyzing and \n\npreparing for this expansion so the Corps can meet its minimum training \n\ncriteria.\n\n As General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told \n\nus a few weeks ago, the authorities in this Defense bill ``are critical \n\nto the Nation's defense and are urgently needed to ensure we keep faith \n\nwith the men and women, military and civilians, selflessly serving in \n\nour armed forces.''\n\n Relative to the question of amendments which has been raised, we \n\ntried when this bill came to the floor to get consent to have \n\namendments relate to the Defense authorization bill and we were unable \n\nto get that consent. We tried to get consent to adopt almost 40 cleared \n\namendments as a managers' package. We could not get consent to do that. \n\nWe asked to lock in 13 additional amendments for votes on both sides of \n\nthe aisle, but equally divided, without prejudice as to further \n\namendments that could be brought up but, again, there was objection.\n\n Now, at this point, here is where we are. With the House of \n\nRepresentatives having left for the year, the only way we are going to \n\nget a defense bill enacted is by passing the bill before us as it \n\nstands. If it is amended, the bill would have to go back to the House \n\nof Representatives and the result would be we would get nothing \n\nenacted, killing both amendments as well as the bill itself. It would \n\nput the Defense authorization bill in limbo.\n\n We have never done that. We have faced situations similar to this 2 \n\nyears of the prior 5. We have always managed to pass a National Defense \n\nAuthorization Act for 51 straight years. We followed the process in 2 \n\nof those last 5 years, which is not dissimilar to this process which we \n\nare following this year.\n\n Does that make this the best way to proceed? No. It is not the best \n\nway to proceed. But that is not the choice we face. Our troops and \n\ntheir families and our Nation's security deserve a defense bill. The \n\nbill before us is right for our troops, for their families, for our \n\nNation's security, and it was produced in a bipartisan manner. Senator \n\nInhofe, my ranking member, is here, and I think he will attest to the \n\nfact that we adopted dozens of amendments in our committee work on a \n\nbipartisan basis.\n\n This bill deserves a strong bipartisan vote of the Senate today, but \n\nto do that the motion to table, which I understand is about to be made, \n\nneeds to be defeated.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n\n\n Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. First, I want to thank Senator Levin and the Senator from \n\nOklahoma for their leadership and hard work on this legislation, and I \n\ncongratulate them on the great work they have done.\n\n But could I ask the Senator from Michigan, is this the first time in \n\n51 years that a defense authorization bill will be voted on without \n\ndebate or any amendment?\n\n Mr. LEVIN. There was debate and amendment on this bill the week \n\nbefore Thanksgiving. So it would not be----\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Excuse me, without extended debate and addressing the \n\nissues of sexual assault, NSA, detainees. Have any of those issues been \n\naddressed by debate and amendment on the floor of the Senate?\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Well, the sexual assault amendments which were pending, as \n\nmy good friend from Arizona knows, were debated. There are about 20-\n\nplus sexual assault amendments that are in the bill so it makes major \n\nadvances in that area.\n\n In terms of the two amendments that I think the Senator is referring \n\nto--the amendments of Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand--there \n\nwas about a day-long debate on those, and there was an effort to vote \n\non them. I think everybody wanted to vote on those two amendments, but \n\nthere was objection to it.\n\n In terms of what I believe the Senator is driving at, there was a \n\ntime--I think it was in 2011 or 2012--when a Defense authorization bill \n\nwas, in fact, adopted by unanimous consent. I think there was no debate \n\non the bill that was finally adopted.\n\n Having said that, I happen to agree this is not the ideal way to \n\nadopt a defense bill. I have said that over and over. And I have \n\npointed out the way in which we tried to at least get some amendments \n\nadopted, including about 30 that had been agreed to and had been \n\ncleared, but we couldn't even get those added.\n\n Now, with Senator Inhofe's help, we were able to get much of the \n\nmaterial in those amendments that were worked out between us and the \n\nHouse leaders so that they are in this bill; not all of the amendments \n\nthat had been cleared but many of them. But I happen to agree with my \n\nfriends, this is not the ideal way to proceed. But we are now where we \n\nare, and if we simply reopen this bill and do not adopt it the way it\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nis, it then has to go back to the House of Representatives, and then \n\nthere would not be a defense bill, with all of the then-problems that \n\nwould be created for our troops and their families. So this is the best \n\nwe can do, but it is not ideal.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Could I finally say to the Senator, I have never seen a \n\n\n\nprocess like this before. Maybe there have been some parallels, No. 1. \n\nNo. 2, here we are on December 19 of 2013 and we passed a bill through \n\nthe committee in May. So here we are, many months later, taking up a \n\nbill because the majority's priorities were obviously not to bring up \n\nthe Defense authorization bill until it was so late we are forced into \n\nthis cramped procedure.\n\n There is no doubt--and I thank the Senator and my distinguished \n\nchairman--that we haven't debated this bill. We haven't debated NSA. We \n\nhaven't debated this issue of sexual assaults, with two different \n\nopinions here, the sanctions, the detainee issue--all of those issues.\n\n I remember in the markup we said we will wait. It is so important, we \n\nwill wait and amend this on the floor. So I don't think we have done \n\nthe men and women who are serving in the military anything but a gross \n\ndisservice by, in December, having a bill rammed through the Senate, \n\nand that is because of a lack of priorities on the part of leadership. \n\nWe could have taken this bill to the floor of the Senate in June and we \n\ndidn't. What a shame.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know the distinguished ranking member \n\nof the Armed Services Committee is here. I would be glad to yield to \n\nhim, if I can retain the right to the floor. I think he has a few \n\ncomments he wanted to make in response to the chairman. If I can do \n\nthat, I would ask unanimous consent to do so.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me make a couple of comments here. \n\nOddly enough, I agree with everything the Senator from Arizona said, \n\nand the Senator from Texas. It is true. The process was terrible.\n\n I have been here--well, I guess between the House committee and this \n\ncommittee--for 22 years, and I don't think I have ever seen anything \n\nlike it. But the effort was there to have a bill early on. I know, in \n\nworking very closely with the chairman--and I have never had an \n\nopportunity to work that closely with someone in developing a bill, but \n\nwe did--that it was his desire to have a bill, and it is still his \n\ndesire to have a bill. The problem is we went through the option that \n\neveryone finds so offensive, and I find so offensive, and it has \n\nchanged the Senate. The evidence of that is what happened in this bill.\n\n We had people who wanted to have amendments. So what I did, I went on \n\na Thursday--I recall that--to a Republican lunch, and I went there with \n\n25 amendments and I said: Would you all agree to cut your amendment \n\nrequests, which were over 100, down to 25? If I can take that and show \n\nit to the other side, I will see if that is acceptable. They agreed to \n\n\n\nthat.\n\n I want to repeat that. The Republicans agreed to actually 25 \n\namendments. So I went to the other side and I could not get an \n\nagreement on the other side. So that effort was there.\n\n As far as the amendments are concerned, the chairman has said several \n\ntimes that we considered these amendments. We did. To be specific, 79 \n\namendments were put in this bill, of which over half were Republican \n\namendments. So we tried our best to put everything in there, and it got \n\ndown to the point of do we want a bill or do we not want a bill. So I \n\nwant to emphasize this is not on the merits of the bill.\n\n The bill is a good bill. My colleagues have heard us more than they \n\nwant to hear us talk about what all is in this bill. It is a good bill. \n\nI think it might be better than the bill we passed out, and maybe even \n\nthe House bill. But nonetheless, it is down to that or nothing. And it \n\nis for that reason I think we have to have the bill.\n\n But I agree we have to keep talking about how bad the process was to \n\nmake sure that it never happens again. We, as the minority, are \n\nentitled to have our amendments, the same as the other side, when they \n\nbecome a minority, are going to be entitled to have their amendments.\n\n With that, I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, to clarify, I believe the Defense \n\nauthorization bill will pass this evening. That is not in any doubt. \n\nThe problem is this isn't just about the process, this isn't just about \n\nminority rights in the Senate, but this is about people getting hurt. \n\nAnd the people I am talking about are our Active-Duty military whose \n\npensions have been cut by the vote we cast yesterday passing the budget \n\ndeal. All we want to do is fix that.\n\n There is bipartisan consensus this was a big mistake, and we could \n\npass that, if the majority leader would allow us, today; it would pass \n\nthrough the House, as I said yesterday, like a hot knife through \n\nbutter. Everyone agrees this was a mistake, and that is what the \n\nprocess is supposed to do, to fix this kind of error before it happens; \n\nand now that it has happened, to remedy it through an amendment. But \n\nthis is exactly what the majority leader is denying us the opportunity \n\nto do and why this is so important.\n\n I mention again, so it not be forgotten, the 12 Americans who were \n\nkilled at Fort Hood some 4 years ago by a domestic terrorist attack, \n\nalong with 30 others whose lives were changed forever when they were \n\nshot by MAJ Nidal Hasan, who had become radicalized by the same cleric \n\nwhom President Obama targeted on his kill list with a drone attack in \n\nYemen, and appropriately so. He was an agent of al-Qaida. To now call \n\nthis workplace violence and not to give us a chance to recognize the \n\n\n\nloss of lives in an act of war and to make sure these patriots get the \n\nbenefits they are entitled to is just wrong.\n\n So this is not just about the process, it is not just about minority \n\nrights, it is about real people getting hurt and our ability to fix \n\nthat today. That is being denied as a result of this process.\n\n I would conclude by saying the distinguished Senator from Arizona is \n\nexactly right. The average number of amendments since 1996 on the \n\nnational defense authorization bill is 138 amendments--138 amendments. \n\nThe average number of recorded votes, 11\\1/2\\. The average number of \n\ndays we are on the bill is 8.8. So this is a big, important, profoundly \n\nsignificant piece of legislation, yet it is being jammed through here \n\nin about 24 hours without any opportunity to offer amendments.\n\n Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it correct that no Senator \n\nis permitted to offer an amendment to the House-passed Defense bill \n\nwhile the majority leader's motion to concur with a further amendment \n\nis pending?\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Further parliamentary inquiry, Madam President. If a \n\nmotion to table the Reid amendment to concur with a further amendment \n\nis successful, would there be an opportunity to offer my amendment, No. \n\n2602, the Fort Hood Purple Heart bill?\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n Motion to Table the Motion to Concur\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in order to offer that amendment and \n\nothers that I believe would be in order and should be allowed to be \n\noffered, I move to table the pending Reid motion to concur with a \n\nfurther amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n The clerk will call the roll.\n\n The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n [Rollcall Vote No. 283 Leg.]\n\n YEAS--45\n\n Alexander\n\n Ayotte\n\n Barrasso\n\n Blunt\n\n Boozman\n\n Burr\n\n\n\n Chambliss\n\n Coats\n\n Coburn\n\n Cochran\n\n Collins\n\n Corker\n\n Cornyn\n\n Crapo\n\n Cruz\n\n Enzi\n\n Fischer\n\n Flake\n\n Graham\n\n Grassley\n\n Hatch\n\n Heller\n\n Hoeven\n\n Inhofe\n\n Isakson\n\n Johanns\n\n Johnson (WI)\n\n Kirk\n\n Lee\n\n McCain\n\n McConnell\n\n Moran\n\n Murkowski\n\n Paul\n\n Portman\n\n Risch\n\n Roberts\n\n Rubio\n\n Scott\n\n Sessions\n\n Shelby\n\n Thune\n\n Toomey\n\n Vitter\n\n Wicker\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\n NAYS--55\n\n Baldwin\n\n\n\n Baucus\n\n Begich\n\n Bennet\n\n Blumenthal\n\n Booker\n\n Boxer\n\n Brown\n\n Cantwell\n\n Cardin\n\n Carper\n\n Casey\n\n Coons\n\n Donnelly\n\n Durbin\n\n Feinstein\n\n Franken\n\n Gillibrand\n\n Hagan\n\n Harkin\n\n Heinrich\n\n Heitkamp\n\n Hirono\n\n Johnson (SD)\n\n Kaine\n\n King\n\n Klobuchar\n\n Landrieu\n\n Leahy\n\n Levin\n\n Manchin\n\n Markey\n\n McCaskill\n\n Menendez\n\n Merkley\n\n Mikulski\n\n Murphy\n\n Murray\n\n Nelson\n\n Pryor\n\n Reed\n\n Reid\n\n Rockefeller\n\n Sanders\n\n\n\n Schatz\n\n Schumer\n\n Shaheen\n\n Stabenow\n\n Tester\n\n Udall (CO)\n\n Udall (NM)\n\n Warner\n\n Warren\n\n Whitehouse\n\n Wyden\n\n The motion was rejected.\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \n\nmorning business.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Economic Recovery\n\n Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about some of the \n\nimportant work we can be doing to help strengthen our economic recovery \n\nand to get more Minnesotans and more Americans across the country into \n\njobs.\n\n During the government shutdown in October, I came to the floor to \n\ntalk about how the shutdown was preventing us from doing the work that \n\npeople sent us here to do. Every day we spent on the shutdown was a day \n\nwe weren't working together to create jobs and to rebuild the middle \n\nclass. The budget deal we passed this week is far from perfect, but it \n\nis my hope it will enable us to stop lurching from crisis to crisis and \n\nfocus on the work we were sent to do.\n\n This agreement means businesses will have the stability and certainty \n\nthey need to create jobs and strengthen our economy, and it allows us \n\nto focus on educating our kids, creating a 21st century workforce, and \n\nputting people back to work.\n\n As I said, this budget deal is far from perfect; it is a compromise \n\nand, as with any compromise, it has elements I like, elements I don't \n\n\n\nlike, and elements others like and don't like that may be different. In \n\naddition to providing some budgetary certainty for the next 2 years, \n\nthe budget deal undoes some of the extreme across-the-board cuts of the \n\nsequester that will enable us to make more of the critical investments \n\nwe need to make in education, research and development, and \n\ninfrastructure. We will make those investments while replacing the \n\nirrational cuts of the sequester with more responsible debt and deficit \n\nreduction. In fact, the bill ultimately reduces the debt by about $20 \n\nbillion more than under the previous budget that included the full \n\nsequester.\n\n At the same time, I am very troubled by the fact that the bill pays \n\nfor undoing some of the extreme, across-the-board cuts of the sequester \n\nin part by reducing some military pensions. That was something pushed \n\nfor by the lead Republican negotiator, and I am not happy about it. I \n\nbelieve there are cuts we can make to defense spending, but cutting \n\nmilitary pensions is not one of them. That is why I am cosponsoring a \n\nbill authored by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire that would \n\nreplace those cuts to military pensions by closing an indefensible and \n\nwasteful corporate tax loophole, and I hope we can get that done before \n\nthe cut to military pensions goes into effect.\n\n I am also very troubled that the budget deal does not include an \n\nextension of critical emergency unemployment insurance. Extending this \n\nunemployment insurance is one of the things we need to be doing for the \n\neconomy. Too many Americans remain unemployed, and those who have been \n\nunemployed the longest are facing the expiration of their unemployment \n\ninsurance when they need it the most. There are 65,000 workers in \n\nMinnesota and millions throughout our country who may need this \n\nextended unemployment insurance in 2014. These folks are struggling. \n\nThey are struggling to find jobs and to support their families.\n\n Not extending unemployment insurance will also put the brakes on our \n\neconomic recovery. In 2011, the CBO wrote that aid to the unemployed is \n\namong the policies with ``the largest effects on output and employment \n\nper dollar of budgetary cost.'' Without an extension the Council of \n\nEconomic Advisers estimates the economy will generate 240,000 fewer \n\njobs by the end of 2014. That is why I have been working to continue \n\nthe extension of unemployment insurance and I will keep pushing for the \n\nSenate to take up and pass an extension when we return in the new year.\n\n Another thing we should do to strengthen the economy and help working \n\nAmericans is to raise the minimum wage. We established a minimum wage \n\nbecause we believed that no one should work full-time, contributing to \n\nsociety, and live in poverty. Americans value work. We work more hours \n\non average than citizens in other developed countries. The minimum wage \n\n\n\nis supposed to help guarantee that if a person works hard and plays by \n\nthe rules, they at least will have a roof over their head and be able \n\nto put food on the table.\n\n This year marks 75 years with a Federal minimum wage. However, today, \n\nbecause the minimum wage is too low, it is not doing what it is \n\nsupposed to do. Today, a minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour or \n\nabout $15,000 per year falls below the poverty line, even though they \n\nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. Inflation has eroded the value \n\nof the minimum wage. If the minimum wage had simply kept pace with \n\ninflation since 1968--not raised in real terms but just kept pace with \n\ninflation--it would be at $10.75 an hour today. That is a wage that \n\nwould at least keep a family of three above the poverty line.\n\n What has happened to the minimum wage is part of a larger trend for \n\nAmerican workers. Over the past 50 years, American workers have \n\nincreased their productivity by 135 percent--a 135-percent increase. \n\nBut the value of their wages has not changed, and the real value of the \n\nminimum wage has dropped by 33 percent over that same time. Over just \n\nthe past few years, costs have climbed. Americans are paying more for \n\nelectricity, rent, auto repair, food, childcare, and many others \n\nthings. Yet most wages for workers have stagnated and the minimum wage \n\nhas fallen.\n\n That is why I think one of the most important ways we can boost our \n\neconomy and help workers and families is to increase the minimum wage. \n\nAmericans agree. Americans strongly favor boosting the Federal minimum \n\nwage to $10.10 an hour. In a recent survey, 63 percent supported \n\nraising the minimum wage to $10.10 from the current $7.25 rate. \n\nMoreover, the support for increasing the minimum wage is broad-based: \n\nThe rich, the poor, Republicans and Democrats all believe we should \n\nraise the minimum wage.\n\n Increasing the minimum wage will be good for Minnesota, and there is \n\na parallel effort at the State level to increase the State minimum \n\nwage. If we increase the Federal minimum wage to $10.10, it will affect \n\n462,000 Minnesota workers over 3 years. That is 18 percent of \n\nMinnesota's workforce. It will increase our State's GDP by $400 \n\nmillion. That is something we must fight for.\n\n Extending unemployment benefits and increasing the minimum wage are \n\ncrucial things we can be doing to support the American value that if \n\nyou work hard, you should be able to support yourself and your family.\n\n There is more we can be doing. I am part of the Manufacturing Jobs \n\nfor America initiative that several of my colleagues in the Senate, and \n\nheaded by the Presiding Officer, have undertaken. As part of that \n\ninitiative, I wish to speak about an issue I have spoken about on the \n\nfloor before--an issue I hear about from manufacturers all over \n\n\n\nMinnesota--the skills gap. What is the skills gap? Recent studies have \n\nshown that between one-third and one-half of manufacturers in my State \n\nof Minnesota have at least one job they can't fill because they can't \n\nfind a worker with the right skills to fill that job. That is the \n\nskills gap in Minnesota, but it is not just Minnesota. This is a \n\nnationwide phenomenon. As I roam this\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nfloor to talk to my colleagues, every one of them knows of this \n\nphenomenon in their State. A 2011 survey by Deloitte found that there \n\nwere 600,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide that were unfilled because \n\nof a skills shortage.\n\n It is not just manufacturers either. There is a skills gap in \n\ninformation technology, in health care, and in other sectors that have \n\njobs sitting there waiting for skilled workers to fill them. There are \n\nmore than 3 million jobs in this country that could be filled today if \n\nthere were workers who had the right skills. With too many Americans \n\nunemployed, we have to find a way to fill those jobs.\n\n The thing is we know how to solve this problem. We are taking steps \n\nto solve it in communities in Minnesota and around the country through \n\npartnerships between businesses and community and technical colleges \n\nthat are training up workers and getting them into high-demand jobs \n\nright away.\n\n Let me talk briefly about an innovative program to bridge the skills \n\ngap in Minnesota. I recently visited the Right Skills Now Program at \n\nthe Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis and the South Central \n\nCommunity and Technical College in Mankato. Those two institutions are \n\nworking on this together.\n\n At South Central I sat with about 8 to 10 manufacturers who had \n\nhelped fund and design their program that gives workers the skills they \n\nneed to operate a computer numerical control, or CNC, machine. They \n\ntold me that between 8 or 10 of them they had more than 50 job openings \n\nthey could fill that instant. At Dunwoody, their current placement rate \n\nfrom the Right Skills Now Program is 91 percent. You will have a hard \n\ntime finding a more effective program.\n\n Dunwoody likes to emphasize that its students often come into the \n\nprogram after having just been laid off or that they are the long-term \n\nunemployed we hear about. After going through the program, they are \n\nplacing 91 percent of them into good jobs in a growing industry here in \n\nthis country.\n\n They told me about a student who had a successful career as a massage \n\ntherapist. He was doing just fine until he began to experience pain \n\nfrom pre-arthritic symptoms. That spells trouble for a massage \n\n\n\ntherapist. So he researched technical programs and joined Right Skills \n\nNow, and after going through the program he relaunched his career as a \n\nmachinist.\n\n Careers are different from what they were a generation ago. Very few \n\npeople stay working in one job for one company for their entire life \n\nanymore. Whether it is because of changing life circumstances such as \n\nthe massage therapist turned machinist, or because of new technologies, \n\nmost workers have many different jobs over the course of their working \n\nlife now, and those jobs require many different skills. We need a \n\nworkforce development system that is agile enough to keep up with those \n\nchanging demands.\n\n That is essential not just so workers will be able to get the \n\ndifferent skills they need over the course of their working lives; it \n\nis also going to be one of the keys to the United States remaining \n\nglobally competitive. If our workers cannot adapt to the new industries \n\nthat are constantly forming, we will lose those jobs to our global \n\ncompetitors. There is no better way to anticipate and to react to these \n\nchanges than to connect businesses directly with our schools to get \n\nworkers exactly what they need.\n\n This is also about college affordability. I have talked before about \n\nErick Ajax, the CEO of EJ Ajax and Sons, a metal stamping and sheet \n\nmetal fabrication company in Fridley, MN, that was founded by Erick's \n\ngrandfather in 1945. Erick and other manufacturers partnered with \n\nHennepin Technical College in Hennepin County to set up M-Powered, a \n\nfast-track training program to get workers what they need for entry-\n\nlevel advanced manufacturing jobs.\n\n Erick gave me an example of one of his workers that I found exciting. \n\nThis is what excites me, and not because it is extraordinary; it is \n\nbecause it is something we can duplicate over and over in this country. \n\nWhen he hires employees from these business-technical college \n\npartnerships, the way he looks at it is that they are on a career \n\nladder that would otherwise not be available. He told me about one such \n\nhire, who was really good at his job. So Erick sent him back to school \n\nto get his associate's degree. The guy came back to work, continued to \n\nbe a star, and a few years later Erick paid for him to go to the \n\nUniversity of Minnesota, where he got his bachelor's degree. The guy is \n\nnow head of quality control for EJ Ajax, an incredibly high-skilled job \n\nat an advanced manufacturing company.\n\n Now, understand, this guy graduated from college with no debt--zero \n\ndebt--with a great job. When I think about college affordability, I \n\nthink about that story.\n\n As I have said, we have a skills gap problem in manufacturing and \n\n\n\nother industries, and we have these partnerships that are successfully \n\nworking to close that gap. So where do we come here in Congress? Well, \n\nI have gone around to Minnesota's community and technical colleges and \n\ntalked to businesses, I have had roundtables, and I have talked to \n\nnational experts in our State and from around the country, and the fact \n\nis we are not doing this fast enough. Sometimes these partnerships \n\ncould do a lot more, train up a lot more people, with some extra \n\nfunding--maybe to buy a really sophisticated machine or to hire an \n\ninstructor with very specialized skills.\n\n So what I am proposing is a competitive grant program in a bill \n\ncalled the Community College to Career Fund Act. Under this program, \n\nbusinesses and community colleges would apply for grants based on how \n\nmany jobs their partnership would create, what the value of those jobs \n\nwould be to those hired, to their company, to the community, and how \n\nmuch skin do the businesses have in the game or maybe how much the \n\ncommunity colleges and the businesses and the State have in the game.\n\n We have millions of open jobs that cannot be filled because of a \n\nskills shortage, and we know these partnerships are the most direct way \n\nto fill those jobs. We know that existing partnerships are not doing \n\nenough and cannot do enough, and they need more resources in order to \n\ntruly meet the need that exists. So that is exactly what my bill would \n\naddress.\n\n As we move forward with this budget deal, let's build on the progress \n\nit represents and set our sights a little higher. Let's support working \n\nfamilies and help people who are struggling to find a job in today's \n\nslowly recovering economy. Let's help students and young people who \n\nhave been held back by slow job growth get a foothold in the economy. \n\nLet's support partnerships between businesses and community and \n\ntechnical colleges to fill the jobs that are out there. Let's make this \n\ncoming year the year that Congress works for Americans and puts \n\nAmericans back to work.\n\n Thank you.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from \n\nMinnesota and tell him that I proudly cosponsor his legislation. I have \n\nhad visits throughout my State with community colleges and have watched \n\nthis work, where they literally bring employers and future employees \n\ntogether at a community college--an affordable community college--they \n\nget the very best training, really focused on the job opening, and when \n\nit is finished, they go right to work and they make a good salary.\n\n I tell you, I think this is the future. This is an excellent idea. I \n\nwas happy to support it. I have shamelessly stolen it and said it was \n\nmy idea in a few places, but I will confess to the Senator on the \n\n\n\nfloor----\n\n Mr. FRANKEN. It is an honor for me to acknowledge that the Senator \n\nhas stolen my idea.\n\n Mr. DURBIN. I want to tell him that I am going to admit this on the \n\nfloor and give him credit but be happy to join him in this effort.\n\n Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Senator. And in Illinois the Senator is free \n\nto say it is his idea.\n\n Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n The DREAM Act\n\n Mr. President, maybe we will be in session 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 \n\nhours, and then we are finished, the year 2013 comes to a close. The \n\nunfortunate thing from where I am standing is we have missed an \n\nopportunity. About 6\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\nmonths ago, we passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It had \n\nbeen 25 years in the making.\n\n We know our immigration system is broken. We know it is unfair. We \n\nknow people are suffering because of it. And we know we can do better. \n\nSo we came together and 68 of us voted on the floor of the Senate, \n\nabout 6 months ago, to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n I worked on that bill with seven colleagues--four Democrats, four \n\nRepublicans. We came up with a good bill, not a bill I agree with in \n\nall of its specifics, but one that I think is a good, fair compromise.\n\n We sent it to the House of Representatives. They have done nothing--\n\nnothing. They made some statements--some encouraging, some \n\ndiscouraging. The fact is, they never called this bill.\n\n Mr. President, 2014 is another opportunity for the House of \n\nRepresentatives to rise to this challenge, and I hope they will.\n\n There are many parts of that bill that are so essential--\n\nstrengthening our border, a very important issue to all Americans, \n\nparticularly on the other side of the aisle; a pathway to citizenship, \n\njust a matter of simple, elemental justice, which is a passion on our \n\nside of the aisle. We brought those two concepts together to make the \n\nbill work.\n\n But included in those concepts is an idea which I introduced into \n\nlegislation about 13 years ago. It was called the DREAM Act. It \n\nbasically said if you came to the United States as a child, were \n\nbrought here in undocumented status or overstayed a visa and were here \n\nundocumented, finished high school, had no serious criminal background, \n\nwe would give you a chance, a chance to earn your way to citizenship--\n\n\n\nlegality and citizenship.\n\n Last week, I visited a group on the Mall who were fighting for \n\nimmigration reform. Since the middle of November, these immigration, \n\nfaith, and labor leaders have been fasting, urging the House of \n\nRepresentatives to take up this responsibility and pass the immigration \n\nbill.\n\n Their commitment to fighting for immigration reform has inspired \n\npeople all across this Nation to join the movement and to tell stories \n\nabout families torn apart by the broken immigration law in America.\n\n We cannot ignore the injustice of this system and the suffering that \n\nmillions of people in our own country are living with.\n\n I want to urge Speaker Boehner to move forward on immigration reform \n\nin 2014. I understand there is a small, very vocal, very negative \n\nminority of his caucus that refuses to support any change in \n\nimmigration law. But that is nothing new. In our Nation of immigrants, \n\nthere has always been that force at work. In the time of Abraham \n\nLincoln's Presidency, they even had a political party. It was the Know-\n\nNothing Party. They opposed immigrants. They opposed Catholics. They \n\nwere virtually against everything. Lincoln campaigned against them, and \n\neventually they disappeared from the American political scene. But \n\ntheir sentiments can always be found at every point in our history.\n\n The one part of this immigration bill, as I mentioned earlier, that \n\nis near and dear to me is the DREAM Act. I fought to pass it for 12 \n\nyears. There were times when we called the DREAM Act on the floor of \n\nthe U.S. Senate, and I would look up in the gallery and it would be \n\nfilled with young people, men and women wearing graduation gowns and \n\nmortar boards, to remind people that they were undocumented, officially \n\nunwelcome in America, and yet their heart was here and their lives have \n\nbeen spent here and they were just asking for a chance to be part of \n\nour future. Some heartbreaking moments when the amendment was defeated \n\non the floor of the Senate and I met with them; some encouraging \n\nmoments when the comprehensive bill passed and included the strongest \n\nDREAM Act language that we have ever written.\n\n For most of their lives, these young people have been trapped in the \n\nshadows, fearing they could be deported at any moment and facing \n\nobstacles to developing their talents in this country. Isn't it ironic \n\nthat we have invested so much already in their lives--educating them, \n\ngiving them an opportunity to thrive in this Nation--and then, right at \n\nthat moment when they are ready to go to college or go into a job--we \n\ntell them: Leave. We do not want you. That is not right. It is not \n\n\n\nfair. It does not make any sense.\n\n Last year, President Obama did something that was significant. He \n\nannounced his administration would grant temporary legal status to \n\nthese immigrant students who grew up in the United States. This \n\nhistoric program is known as DACA. DACA stands for Deferred Action for \n\nChildhood Arrivals. It gave the DREAMers a chance to come out of the \n\nshadows and be part of America. In the last year, more than 567,000 \n\npeople have applied for this DACA status; 460,000 have received it.\n\n Later today or tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the nomination of \n\nAlejandro Mayorkas to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity, which I will support.\n\n As Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mr. \n\nMayorkas has been charged with implementing DACA, the President's \n\nExecutive order.\n\n It was a complicated job, but Mr. Mayorkas did it in an outstanding \n\nway.\n\n Earlier this week my colleague and friend Senator Grassley of Iowa \n\nspoke on the floor about Mr. Mayorkas and the DACA program. I wish to \n\ntake a moment to respond to some of the things he said in the \n\nCongressional Record.\n\n Senator Grassley initially questioned the legality of this DACA \n\nprogram. I want to be clear. DACA is entirely appropriate and legal. \n\nThroughout our history, our government has decided which persons should \n\nbe prosecuted and which ones would not be prosecuted based on law \n\nenforcement priority and available resources. Past administrations of \n\nboth political parties have stopped deportations of low-priority cases. \n\nCourts have long recognized their authority to do that.\n\n In a decision last year striking down Arizona's immigration laws, the \n\nCourt reaffirmed that the Federal Government has broad authority over \n\nwho is going to be deported. Republican-appointed Justice Anthony \n\nKennedy, who wrote the opinion, said: ``A principle feature of the \n\nremoval system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration \n\nofficials.''\n\n The President's action is not just legal, it is smart. It is \n\nrealistic. Today there are millions of undocumented immigrants in the \n\nUnited States. The government has to set priorities. Those with \n\ncriminal records, serious criminal records, should leave. They should \n\nbe deported--no excuses. Under the Obama administration's policy, that \n\nis a high priority. That is the way it should be.\n\n Senator Grassley also claimed on the floor that the immigration \n\nservice has not released adequate information about the DACA program. I \n\n\n\ndisagree with my colleague and friend. USCIS has been transparent about \n\nthis process, publishing data on its Web site showing the number of \n\napplicants who applied and those who have been accepted and rejected.\n\n For the past few years I have come to the floor of the Senate \n\nregularly to tell real-life stories of those DREAMers. I have done it \n\nover 50 times. We actually had a reunion of the DREAMers I have spoken \n\nof on the floor of the Senate. I want to take some time today to update \n\nthe story of one of those DREAMers.\n\n This is a photograph of two brothers, Carlos and Rafael. They are \n\nsiblings who were brought to the United States by their parents when \n\nthey were kids. Carlos grew up in suburban Chicago, graduated from \n\nPalatine High School, where he was an honors student. In high school \n\nCarlos was captain of the tennis team, a member of the varsity swim \n\nteam. He volunteered with Palatine's Physically Challenged Program, \n\nwhere every day he helped feed lunch to special needs students.\n\n Listen to what one of Carlos's high school teachers said about him:\n\n Carlos is the kind of person we want among us because he \n\n makes the community better. This is the kind of kid you want \n\n as a student, the kind of kid you want as a neighbor, the \n\n kind of kid you want as a friend to your child and, most \n\n germane to his present circumstance, the kind of person you \n\n want as an American.\n\n It is good news. Last week Carlos graduated from Loyola University in \n\nChicago, majoring in education. His lifelong dream was to be a teacher. \n\nIt almost did not come true. You see, last\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nyear Carlos and his brother Rafael were placed in deportation \n\nproceedings. They were going to be expelled from the United States. I \n\nasked the Obama administration to reconsider. They decided to suspend \n\nthe deportation. That was the right thing to do. After graduating from \n\nLoyola University, Carlos was offered a teaching position starting in \n\njust a few weeks. Carlos will be teaching at Schurz High School, a \n\nChicago public school on the northwest side. In addition to his \n\nteaching duties, Carlos will also be helping with the school's DREAMers \n\norganization and the tennis team, a sport he knew well from high \n\nschool.\n\n There is no question that we need the best and brightest to teach in \n\nour schools. We need people like Carlos who are committed to the next \n\ngeneration of tomorrow's leaders.\n\n Teach for America knows that great teachers can come from all walks \n\nof life, from graduating seniors in our Nation's most elite colleges, \n\n\n\nto former investment bankers and veterans. Last week Teach for America \n\nannounced that it plans to actively recruit DREAMers who have received \n\nDACA deferment, so more DREAMers like Carlos will be able to give back \n\nto the country they know. They will be in classrooms not only teaching \n\nthe important subjects, but with their very lives they will be teaching \n\nthe next generation of Americans what immigration has always meant to \n\nthis country.\n\n I ask my colleagues who stand on the floor critical of the \n\nadministration's deportation policies, would America be better off if \n\nCarlos had been deported last year? Would Chicago be better if this \n\nbright, idealistic young teacher was not headed to the classrooms in a \n\nfew weeks to try to help educate the next generation of leaders in this \n\ncountry? Of course not.\n\n To hear Carlos's story is to realize the benefits immigration reform \n\nwill bring to America. Imagine what is going to happen when 11 million \n\nundocumented immigrants have the opportunity to step out of the \n\nshadows, like these DREAMers, and contribute fully to America. Imagine \n\nwhat it will mean to them to no longer live in fear of a knock on the \n\ndoor, to be able to declare who they are, where they live, who is in \n\ntheir family, to be able to work without any fear, to be able to \n\ntravel, to go back to important family events in other countries and \n\nreturn to the United States.\n\n Legalization will unleash the earning potential of millions of \n\npeople. They will be able to pursue jobs that match their skills \n\ninstead of working in the underground economy.\n\n It is the right thing to do. It will make America stronger. I am \n\nconfident that wiser voices will prevail in the House of \n\nRepresentatives.\n\n Just the other day I had a conference call with Catholic bishops. \n\nThey have made this a special effort on their part to support \n\ncomprehensive immigration reform. They were from all over the United \n\nStates. In addition to their prayers, I asked them to reach out to \n\ntheir congregations, tell stories like Carlos's story and Rafael's \n\nstory, and tell people this is really very fundamental and basic when \n\nit comes to issues of justice.\n\n For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n Mr. President, I have come to the floor I cannot tell you how many \n\ntimes to talk about an industry in America--the for-profit college and \n\nuniversity industry. I have talked about the basics. Most people could \n\nnot tell you what for-profit colleges are or which ones are for-profit. \n\nWell, the major colleges--I will start at the top with the Apollo \n\n\n\nGroup, the University of Phoenix, and DeVry out of Illinois is second. \n\nKaplan, which was owned by the Washington Post, is third. There are a \n\nlot of other ones.\n\n What is interesting about these colleges and universities is they \n\ncould not exist without generous subsidies from the Federal Government. \n\nHere is what happens. They lure students into enrolling in their \n\nschools. The students, often because they are low income, qualify for \n\nPell grants and student loans. The Pell grants and student loans flow \n\nfrom the government through the student into the for-profit schools.\n\n It turns out there is a 90-10 rule. Imagine this. These for-profit \n\nschools cannot take more than 90 percent of their revenue from the \n\nFederal Government--90 percent. They are 10 percent away from being a \n\ntotal Federal agency. But they make amazing amounts of money, huge \n\namounts of money. They pay their CEOs millions of dollar because this \n\nis a very lucrative undertaking.\n\n But there are three things you should remember about for-profit \n\nschools--three numbers. You will know what the challenge is if you \n\nremember these three numbers:\n\n Twelve. Twelve percent of all the graduates of high school go to for-\n\nprofit schools.\n\n Twenty-five. Twenty-five percent of all the Federal aid for education \n\ngoes to these schools.\n\n Forty-seven. Forty-seven percent of all the student loan defaults are \n\nwith students who have enrolled in these for-profit schools.\n\n So 12 percent of the students, 25 percent of the Federal aid for \n\neducation, and 47 percent of the student loan defaults.\n\n Why are these students defaulting? There are several reasons. One \n\nreason is that the diplomas from these schools are not worth much. I \n\nwill tell a few stories in a moment. The other reason is that once the \n\nschool enrolls these students and brings in their student loans, they \n\nreally do not care that much as to whether they finish. It is not that \n\nimportant to them. The money has already flowed to the school. A third \n\nreason, of course, is that many of these students finish school, and \n\nwith their questionable or worthless diplomas, they cannot find jobs. \n\nWhat happens then? They cannot make their student loan payments.\n\n I will tell some specific stories when I talk about one of these for-\n\nprofit school operations. It is called Corinthian Colleges, which is a \n\npublicly traded corporation that owns for-profit schools in the United \n\nStates and Canada. It is now in the spotlight for engaging in \n\nmanipulative marketing and deceptive job-placement practices.\n\n Earlier this week, a Huffington Post article called attention to \n\nthese abuses. It was entitled ``How a For-Profit College Created Fake \n\nJobs to Get Taxpayer Money.'' The headline says the whole story. The \n\n\n\narticle reports that Corinthian has been encouraging the manipulation \n\nof job-placement rates to entice students to sign up for programs and \n\nto avoid the scrutiny of the government and the accreditors.\n\n Corinthian College subsidiaries--Everest College is one of them--have \n\nbeen criticized in the past for having high dropout rates and some of \n\nthe highest 3-year loan default rates in America even while its tuition \n\nrates are higher than community colleges or even flagship State schools \n\nfor an equivalent degree. In spite of the bad press, Corinthian \n\nColleges--such as Everest--have managed to come out on top, increasing \n\nenrollment, increasing profit margins, and increasing payments for \n\ntheir executives. It would appear these gains were at least in part due \n\nto the manipulative marketing practices and a corporate culture of \n\ndeceit toward its students.\n\n According to this article, Eric Parms enrolled in Everest College's \n\nheating, ventilation, and air-conditioning repair program in the summer \n\nof 2011. Eric had been laid off from his job. He was attracted to \n\nEverest because of the promise from its advertisements and recruiters \n\nthat their HVAC program would lead to a good job and a decent living. \n\nSo Eric picked up his family--his wife and two sons--and he moved from \n\nOhio to Georgia to enroll in this Corinthian school, the Everest \n\nCollege program. He was a good student. Eric received all A's, only \n\nmissing one class on the day his 7-year-old son was diagnosed with \n\nleukemia. After completing the 9-month program, Eric Parms was left \n\nwith a $17,000 student loan debt and could not find a job.\n\n What Eric did not know was Everest College was paying more than a \n\ndozen local employers what they called an on-boarding allowance of \n\n$2,000 a head to secure 30 days of employment for their graduates. \n\nThese were not real jobs; these were jobs which Corinthian Colleges--\n\nEverest College--were frankly bankrolling so it looked as if their \n\ngraduates were going to work. The money was purportedly a fee to help \n\npay for things such as training and uniforms. In reality, by paying \n\ncompanies to take graduates for temporary jobs, the Everest College was \n\nable to boost\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nits official job-placement rate unrealistically. This helped Everest \n\nCollege continue to fly under the radar of its accreditors.\n\n However, Corinthian paid companies for jobs without considering the \n\nlong-term effects on students. The fact that they would sign them up \n\nfor 30 days and then turn them loose really did not mean that much to \n\nCorinthian; they just had to show that they went to work at some point.\n\n Well, after he graduated Eric had to beg the school's career service \n\ncounselor to even set up interviews. Even then, he would arrive at \n\n\n\ninterviews supposedly set up for him, and the potential employers would \n\ntell him they had never heard of Everest College. Remember, Eric Parms \n\nwas on the hook for $17,000 in student loans for this course he took.\n\n Finally, Eric was set up by career services to work in a contract \n\nposition with ADG Enterprises laying electrical wires. After less than \n\n2 months on the job, he was laid off and cut off from career services \n\nfrom Everest. Everest had used him to get $17,000 in student loans and \n\nturned him loose without a job, without a future.\n\n In fact, managers discouraged career counselors at Everest from re-\n\nplacing people who had already been placed in a job. They were instead \n\nencouraged to send graduates to companies with high turnover rates, to \n\nprovide temporary positions just so they could show that their \n\ngraduates went to work even if it was just for a few days. The school \n\nhad effectively placed Eric in a short-term internship program. Once it \n\nwas over, there was no incentive for them to keep him. They turned him \n\nloose to vacate a space for another graduate and another $2,000 check. \n\nThen Everest would shuffle another graduate into the same position to \n\nartificially maintain that they were placing students in jobs. This was \n\nfraud--not just a fraud on the public, not just a fraud on the \n\nstudents, but a fraud on American taxpayers by Corinthian Colleges.\n\n Eric lost out on the deal--a $17,000 debt for a training degree he \n\ncould not use. To get a Georgia HVAC contractor license, he needed to \n\nhave significant work experience and references, and no one would hire \n\nhim because they did not take his degree from Everest--part of the \n\nCorinthian College system--seriously.\n\n The practice of paying employers to hire graduates from this Everest \n\ncampus ended in 2011, but it was not the only Corinthian school \n\nengaging in these practices. The California attorney general recently \n\nfiled suit against Corinthian for using fraudulent marketing, paying \n\ncompanies to temporarily hire graduates, and using other tactics to \n\nmeet accreditation standards and job-placement rates. These other \n\ntactics included paying temporary agencies to hire graduates for \n\ntemporary positions while basically counting a 1-day volunteer event \n\nfor dental assistant graduates as a job placement and, worse yet, \n\n``placing'' graduates at nonexistent businesses they created as part of \n\na class project to design business cards.\n\n It was a big game for Corinthian, and they got paid off handsomely by \n\nFederal taxpayers and these unsuspecting students.\n\n Corinthian has also outright misrepresented job placement rates to \n\nstudents by advertising numbers substantially higher than their actual \n\nrates. These deceptive practices give the illusion that this is a \n\nsuccessful undertaking. Go to Everest and get a job. It turns out that \n\nit is a charade.\n\n\n\n In addition to manipulation of job placement rates, recruiters for \n\nCorinthian colleges and schools withhold pertinent information from \n\nstudents to get them to enroll.\n\n Lindsay Ryan, another student at Everest College who contacted my \n\noffice, studied criminal justice online and was 12 weeks away from \n\ngraduation when she learned that Everest was not regionally accredited \n\nand that she wouldn't be able to find a job in her field in the State \n\nof Illinois.\n\n One would think that a college offering courses to people in Illinois \n\nwould have some obligation to tell them whether or not a degree or \n\ncertificate from that school could lead to a job in that State?\n\n In Lindsay's case it didn't.\n\n Do you know what Everest College suggested to Lindsay after she had \n\nbeen duped into this so-called education? They suggested she move to \n\nFlorida where she might be able to use an Everest College degree. That \n\nwasn't an option for Lindsay and her family.\n\n Now she sits, unemployed, supporting three children, her husband, and \n\na $24,000 student loan debt to this Corinthian college, Everest \n\nCollege, for a worthless degree.\n\n Over the past decade Corinthian colleges have received from the \n\nFederal Government nearly $10 billion in student aid--$10 billion. That \n\nmakes up more than 80 percent of the total revenue of this college. \n\nThese schools, these for-profit schools, are sucking on the Federal \n\nTreasury to come up with billions of dollars to get rich at the expense \n\nof taxpayers and these poor exploited students.\n\n Corinthian grew during our recession, reaching a peak enrollment of \n\n93,000 students, doubling revenue up to $1.7 billion in 2011. This is \n\nin part due to a persuasive but deceptive marketing plan promising a \n\nbetter career to people such as Eric and Lindsay who were looking for a \n\nway out during difficult times.\n\n Toya Smith, a former Everest career counselor who was interviewed by \n\nHuffington Post, recognized that for-profit schools burden students \n\nwith large debts, a questionable degree, and poor job prospects--while \n\nthe company was profiting on Federal dollars.\n\n She said: ``You're selling a dream to a student that you know, in \n\nreality, they are not ever going to realize.''\n\n Did I mention Toya was a former counselor at Everest? She told the \n\ntruth.\n\n How many more times will Corinthian end up in the news for deplorable \n\nstories such as these? I have asked the CEO of Corinthian to explain \n\nthese practices. His name is Massimino. He was paid more than $3 \n\nmillion in total compensation the last year that was reported by this \n\ncorporation. I have asked him not to engage in this conduct again.\n\n\n\n I have also written to Everest College's national accreditors, the \n\nAccrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools and the \n\nAccrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, asking what \n\nsteps they are going to take to sanction Everest for these egregious \n\nabuses of the public trust.\n\n Finally, I have asked the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to \n\nlook into these allegations and to use whatever authorities the \n\nDepartment may have to hold Everest and its parent company, Corinthian, \n\naccountable.\n\n If no authorities exist, I have asked him to work with me in Congress \n\nto give the Department the ability to respond more aggressively to \n\nabuses such as the ones I have outlined for Corinthian.\n\n It is time to put an end to the corporate culture of deception and \n\ndata manipulation that pervades the for-profit school industry. They \n\nare wasting taxpayers' dollars. They are abusing students and their \n\nfamilies. We in Congress are not doing what we should.\n\n We have to protect these students and their families. We have to \n\nprotect America's taxpayers from for-profit schools that are taking \n\nadvantage of the law.\n\n I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \n\ncall be rescinded.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \n\nmorning business.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Tribute to Paul Yates\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Merry Christmas to the Presiding Officer and to all \n\nthose who might be watching C-SPAN.\n\n We are getting close to the big holiday, and it is a time when I come \n\nto the well to pay tribute to a great newsman in Georgia who is \n\nretiring after 40 years in television on the Georgia beat: Paul Yates, \n\nwith WAGA-TV, Fox 5, in Atlanta. He has served for 35 consecutive years \n\nat the same station.\n\n In fact, when I ran for Governor in Georgia in 1990 he covered that \n\nrace. He has covered all of my Senate races, and he covered all of my \n\nlegislative races. When we were in the legislature\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n\n\nand in session, he covered every day of the Georgia legislature and has \n\nfor over three decades.\n\n He has made a tremendous contribution to our State and the level, \n\nquality, and respect for the very best that journalism can expect. As \n\nPaul Yates retires from his service after years of service to the \n\npeople of Georgia at WAGA-TV, and as one who he has covered--both good \n\nand bad--I wish to pay tribute to a great journalist, a great friend, \n\nand a man who has done a great service to the people of my State of \n\nGeorgia.\n\n I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \n\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \n\nordered.\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first comment about the National \n\nDefense Authorization Act. It is an important bill for us to pass, and \n\nI wish to thank Senator Levin and Senator Inhofe for the manner in \n\nwhich they worked on this legislation, bringing it together in the \n\ncommittee. It was a bipartisan bill. As it came to the floor it \n\nmaintained that focus on helping our troops and helping preserve our \n\nnational security. As we were starting to consider amendments, I think \n\nsome cooperation was there. Unfortunately, we lost track of being able \n\nto consider amendments in a somewhat normal course.\n\n But the bill before us represents a bipartisan effort to make sure we \n\nprovide the men and women who are defending our Nation the tools they \n\nneed in order to carry out their mission, and we give them the support \n\nthey deserve for serving their country. So this bill is a critically \n\nimportant bill, and I am glad that with the earlier vote, we are on \n\ntrack to send this to the President for his signature before the end of \n\nthe year. It is very important. The bill provides many important \n\nprovisions for the health care of our troops, many important provisions \n\nfor their compensation, and it is important we get that done before \n\nJanuary 1.\n\n The bill also provides the tools they need and the direction they \n\nneed in terms of foreign policy in our military.\n\n I wish to thank the committee. Several of the suggestions I made \n\nduring the committee process were incorporated in the bill that came to \n\nthe floor. I have the honor of chairing the East Asian and Pacific \n\nAffairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \n\nserving with the distinguished Presiding Officer who also serves on \n\nthat subcommittee. In that capacity we worked with the committee to \n\n\n\ndeal with some of the issues in that region, provisions dealing with \n\nthe health care of our military personnel and many of the other issues. \n\nI am glad to see the committee did incorporate some of the concerns \n\nthat had been expressed.\n\n Two specific amendments I had noted during the amendment process have \n\nbeen incorporated in the bill that is before us. One deals with health \n\ncare and the other deals with parity between our civilian workforce for \n\nthe Department of Defense and our contract workforce. I appreciate that \n\nthose two amendments have been incorporated into the bill we have \n\nbefore us.\n\n Similar to many of my colleagues who have come to the floor, I am \n\ndisappointed. On any bill that comes forward that is a bipartisan bill \n\nthere are compromises and there will always be disappointments about \n\nnot being exactly everything you want it to be.\n\n That is understandable. What is very disappointing is that we didn't \n\nhave a chance to offer many amendments that are not controversial. The \n\nonly way an amendment could get on after it came through the committee \n\nwas through a clearing process, and I think there are many other \n\namendments that could have gotten into this bill that would have been \n\nimportant, but I will look for other opportunities.\n\n I had three amendments that I will mention now that I will look for \n\nother opportunities to advance. One comes directly out of the \n\nsubcommittee I chair, and that deals with maritime security issues in \n\nthe China seas. That is a powder keg, where China most recently took \n\nsteps in regard to airspace that only made that situation even more \n\ntense. The maintaining of maritime security is critically important to \n\nthe United States. It is the major shipping lane for commerce not only \n\nin that region but globally, and it is an area that could bring about \n\nunfortunate conflicts between many countries in that region which could \n\nmushroom into active situations. So maritime security is a very \n\nimportant issue, and the United States has taken a very active position \n\non that to say: Look. These matters have to be talked about directly by \n\nthe countries involved in a peaceful manner, not in an intimidating \n\nmanner. The amendment I offered would have furthered the Senate in \n\nsupporting that position.\n\n I was also disappointed not to be able to offer an amendment which \n\ndealt with the accountability particularly of Assad in Syria but also \n\nof those who have committed war crimes in Syria. The Presiding Officer \n\nknows of the testimony we have had in regard to the gross violation of \n\nhuman rights by government officials in Syria and the numbers of people \n\nwho have been killed and have suffered as a result.\n\n The War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague should have the ability to deal \n\nwith these types of issues, and the amendment I offered asked that the \n\n\n\nUnited States work for full accountability for those who have violated \n\ninternational standards in regard to war crimes.\n\n A third amendment I had offered that did not get in because of \n\nreasons I just mentioned was an effort that many are working on to form \n\na partnership between the United States and Vietnam in regard to \n\neducation programs--higher education. We have a way to do that. Senator \n\nMcCain was very helpful to me in trying to advance this, and we will \n\nlook for another opportunity to get that done because I think it is \n\ncritically important.\n\n Many of us understand we have to improve the relationship between the \n\nUnited States and Vietnam, but Vietnam needs to deal with its human \n\nrights violations. It needs to deal with its good governance. One way \n\nwe can help this is by dealing with institutions that promote \n\ndemocracy, and that is, of course, higher education.\n\n So while I am looking forward, with regard to all those areas, to \n\nfinding other vehicles where we can deal with the issues we were not \n\nable to deal with through the amendment process, I would ask our \n\ncolleagues to get this bill to the President so he can sign it before \n\nthe end of this year.\n\n Thanking Elise Mellinger\n\n Mr. President, I would also like to make a few comments about Elise \n\nMellinger. As I mentioned earlier, Elise is a Pearson Foreign Service \n\nofficer fellow. Let me explain what that means. She is an experienced \n\nmember of the Department of State's Foreign Service. She served in \n\nIndia, Indonesia, and Singapore. She is a person who has served our \n\ncountry for many years, and she is a career diplomat at the State \n\nDepartment.\n\n For the past year, she has been assigned to my Senate office and has \n\nacted as a valuable member of my staff. That helps our career diplomats \n\nunderstand the congressional process better, but it also gives us the \n\nopportunity to have an experienced individual who truly understands the \n\nworkings of diplomacy to be in our offices and help us carry out our \n\nresponsibilities.\n\n In Elise's case, that was particularly helpful to me because at the \n\nbeginning of this year I took on the new responsibility as the chair of \n\nthe East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee. Throughout my career \n\nin Congress, I have spent a lot of time in Europe. I have chaired the \n\nU.S. Helsinki Commission, and I have traveled extensively to Europe, \n\nbut it was a new venture for me to chair the East Asian and Pacific \n\nAffairs Subcommittee. Elise Mellinger brought me the expertise so we \n\ncould--the Senate and the Committee on Senate Foreign Relations--carry \n\n\n\nout our responsibility in regard to congressional oversight and \n\ninitiatives in regard to that region of the world.\n\n As a result of her hard work, we were able to have numerous hearings \n\nin 2013 on the rebalance to the Asia initiative President Obama brought \n\nforward, and to talk about many of the issues in that region of the \n\nworld, from the maritime security issues I have already\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\ntalked about to environmental issues, to dealing with North Korea, a \n\nhuge problem with not only their nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, \n\nwhich is unacceptable, but the human rights violations in that country \n\nand how the people are being treated as far as economic growth, and the \n\nlist goes on and on.\n\n Vietnam is a major country of interest. We have been able to be \n\ninvolved in that. We had a hearing on the typhoon in the Philippines \n\nthat Elise Mellinger was critically important in helping us put \n\ntogether in a matter of days so we could become knowledgeable as to \n\nwhat was happening with one of our allies in that region--the \n\nPhilippines--and what we could do and what the international community \n\nand the private sector could do in order to help the people of the \n\nPhilippines. I traveled to that region, and Elise Mellinger was \n\nextremely important in preparing me for that trip.\n\n So I just wanted to share with my colleagues this program we have, \n\nwhere we have executive employees, career diplomats who come and work \n\nin our offices so we can work together and advance foreign policy in \n\nthe United States. There should not be a difference between the \n\nexecutive and legislative branches in regard to our objective with \n\nforeign policy. Of course, we have oversight; of course, we have \n\nseparation of powers; and for the entire year Elise Mellinger was in my \n\noffice she was a 100-percent loyal person among our staff to carry out \n\nthat responsibility. As I said to her earlier, I hope it does not \n\naffect her career when she goes back to the State Department, and I \n\nknow it will not.\n\n I was very fortunate, indeed the Senate and I believe the American \n\npeople were very fortunate, that Elise spent the year in service to her \n\ncountry through the Senate. She will be leaving very shortly, at the \n\nend of this month. So I wish to thank her, her family, her husband, \n\nElliott Wu and her daughter, Eitana Wu for sharing Elise Mellinger with \n\nus. We wish her well. We are going to miss her. She is going on to \n\nreturn to the Canadian desk within the State Department before she \n\naccepts her next mission that will most likely be outside the United \n\nStates.\n\n On behalf of all my colleagues in the Senate, I want to express my \n\n\n\nthanks and appreciation to Elise Mellinger.\n\n With that, I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week the Senate is considering a \n\ncouple of fairly big items. We had a vote earlier this week on a budget \n\nproposal to fund the government for the next couple of years, and we \n\nalso are going to be voting on a defense authorization bill that is \n\nvery important to America's national security interests.\n\n As we brought this legislation to the floor, there has been something \n\nconspicuously and noticeably absent; that is, open debate--something \n\nthat used to be taken for granted in the Senate, a right that was \n\naccorded to Senators.\n\n The nice thing about getting to the Senate, when you come from the \n\nHouse of Representatives, is that when you get to the Senate, one \n\nperson can actually have the opportunity to get amendments voted on and \n\nhave those amendments debated. In the House of Representatives, those \n\nof us who have served there, know there is a rules committee, and the \n\nrules committee decides what comes to the floor, what amendments are \n\nmade in order, and how much time is allowed for debate on each \n\namendment. It is a very structured process.\n\n What the Founders conceived for the Senate was something different. \n\nThey wanted us to have an opportunity to openly debate the big issues \n\nof the day. And there are no bigger issues, I would argue, than the \n\nbudget proposal which will fund the government for the next 2 years and \n\nspend literally billions and trillions of dollars of the American \n\npeople's tax money; and the Defense authorization bill, which will \n\nauthorize in this case over half a trillion dollars of spending of the \n\nAmerican taxpayers' money.\n\n So these are big, consequential pieces of legislation brought to the \n\nfloor of the Senate but not open to the debate, not open to the \n\namendment process.\n\n We just heard the Senator from Maryland talk about amendments which, \n\nif he had the chance to offer, he would have offered. That applies to a \n\nlot of us.\n\n The Defense bill, when it comes to the floor here, will have probably \n\ngone through a fairly good vetting process. I served on the Armed \n\nServices Committee for 6 years. I think they did then and do now a good \n\njob of prioritizing when they come to the floor. But we have to \n\nremember, there are only probably 25 or so members of the Armed \n\nServices Committee, which means there are 75 Senators who haven't had \n\nan opportunity to have their voices heard on such a big piece of \n\nlegislation.\n\n The same thing with the budget. The budget conference really \n\n\n\nconsisted of a couple people. In fact, I am told by conferees who were \n\nmembers of the Budget Committee and were supposed to be members of that \n\nconference, they really didn't vote on it. There was no vote on it when \n\nit left the conference. It was negotiated by a couple of people and \n\nbrought to the floor to be voted on--something that is pretty darned \n\nimportant to the future of this country but not open to amendment, no \n\nopportunity for Senators here to have the opportunity to improve upon. \n\nPerhaps we could improve upon it; maybe we couldn't. But we at least \n\nshould have had the opportunity to bring issues to the forefront that \n\nrightly should be debated when we are talking about something like a 2-\n\nyear budget and a defense bill which spends enormous amounts of the \n\nAmerican people's tax dollars.\n\n So no debate. Shut down here in the Senate by the majority leader. \n\nWhy? I guess because it is really critically important we get to some \n\nof these nominations that need to be voted on--voted on before the \n\nChristmas holiday. Why? Well, because, Lord knows, we couldn't vote on \n\nthem next year. I guess we can vote on them next year. Now that the \n\nmajority has broken the rules here in the Senate, changed the rules, \n\nthey can approve those with 51 votes.\n\n So I don't know what the big sense of urgency is on these nominations \n\nthat would prevent us from having a full and open debate on something \n\nas consequential as the Defense authorization bill or the budget just \n\nbeing voted on here in the Senate. I don't know why these nominations \n\nwould take precedence over that.\n\n It seems to me that if there was any sense of urgency attached to \n\nthis, most Members on both sides I think would acknowledge that we need \n\nto do that. But clearly these are all nominees who could be voted on \n\nnext year, and now approved with 51 votes, thanks to the majority \n\nbreaking the rules in the Senate and making it possible to approve \n\nnominees with 51 votes.\n\n So the very notion, as the majority leader came out here and said \n\nrepeatedly now, that we would be here next week on one of the most \n\nimportant Christian holidays of the year voting on nominees that can be \n\nvoted on a week later after the first of the year when Congress comes \n\nback into session--it seems to me to be really sort of stunning in \n\nterms of its audacity.\n\n I think the American people would conclude the same thing; that we \n\nwould take a defense authorization bill, that we would take a huge \n\nbudget bill and actually sort of just try and sweep them under the \n\ncarpet, fill the tree so we don't have an opportunity to debate \n\namendments or vote on amendments, but then have to rush to get these \n\nnominations through, nominations which can be considered early next \n\nyear and approved now with a 51-vote majority.\n\n\n\n So think about that. We have had these threats here on the floor. The \n\nmajority leader has come to the floor and said: We are going to be here \n\nChristmas Eve because we have got to do these nominations. Yet we don't \n\nhave any time to do the important work, such as having a chance to \n\ndebate and vote on amendments to bills such as the Defense \n\nauthorization bill.\n\n So that is where we are. Again, I think it is pretty stunning that \n\nthis is what the Senate has deteriorated into. And it is regrettable. \n\nBut hopefully--hopefully--at some point people will come to their \n\nsenses that: Yes, this is an important week next week for a lot of \n\npeople around this country; that perhaps being able to do the \n\nnominations a week later, after the first of the year, when they can be \n\napproved with 51 votes, that might make sense and might be a reasonable \n\napproach to take with all this.\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\n I hope most Members here, like most Americans, next week at least \n\nhave an opportunity to celebrate the Christmas holiday with their \n\nfamilies. And as they do, a lot of Americans will use that opportunity \n\nto reflect upon the past year. In many cases that will mean life \n\nchanges which occurred in the last year. For many Americans it might be \n\na marriage in the family, it might be a graduation, events that we \n\ncelebrate. It might be something we look on with reflection and mourn \n\nthe loss of a loved one. But this is a time when normally people around \n\nthis country reflect on significant changes in their lives in the last \n\nyear and start thinking in anticipation about what the next year might \n\nbring.\n\n Some things people can't control in their lives. Some changes people \n\ndon't like and they can do nothing to control. And as they start \n\nthinking about last year and start thinking about next year, for a lot \n\nof people it is going to be the impact that ObamaCare is going to have \n\non their lives. People are thinking about the fact that they have these \n\nskyrocketing premiums that are now coupled with these outrageous \n\ndeductibles. The sticker shock is forcing millions of Americans to pay \n\nmore for health care.\n\n President Obama promised the American people:\n\n ObamaCare will cut costs and make coverage more affordable \n\n for families and small businesses.\n\n Well, the reality is that family premiums have already skyrocketed \n\nsince ObamaCare became law. American approval of this law is now in the \n\n\n\ntank.\n\n According to a recent CBS/New York Times poll:\n\n Most uninsured (57 percent) think the cost of their health \n\n care will increase, and just 23 percent expect the quality to \n\n get better.\n\n Think about that. Fifty-seven percent of the people who have no \n\ninsurance--people who are uninsured--think the cost of their health \n\ncare is going to increase. And a majority in that same poll are opposed \n\nto the health care plan. Those are people who don't have health care \n\ninsurance today, and a majority of them are opposed to this plan.\n\n For many Americans, the holiday season is going to be filled with \n\nangst and uncertainty as they look at facing a coverage gap on January \n\n1. More than 10,000 Iowans were told by healthcare.gov that they should \n\nqualify for Federal health coverage, but Federal officials have not yet \n\nsent complete information on those people to State administrators, who \n\nare supposed to then review the applications and enroll people in the \n\nprogram.\n\n My colleague from Iowa Senator Grassley is on the floor. Constituents \n\nhe represents are going to be filled with a lot of uncertainty as they \n\nface the future. According to the Des Moines Register, Percy Smith of \n\nDes Moines is concerned about a coverage gap:\n\n I'm losing my optimism, because we're getting close to \n\n January, and I don't know if I'm going to be covered or not.\n\n But this problem will affect more than Iowans. According to the \n\nWashington Post:\n\n Those facing a potential coverage gap include an estimated \n\n 15 million people.\n\n The law's insurance cancellations mixed with the Web site's \n\n problems might leave some people who have coverage now \n\n uninsured in the new year. These are Obamacare's biggest \n\n losers.\n\n Today, George Will has an article in the Washington Post that \n\nexplores this administration's abuse of executive discretion. The \n\narticle effectively summarizes the exact abuses of executive power that \n\nmy colleagues and I have been vocally opposed to.\n\n Under this administration, if they don't like what the law says, even \n\nif they wrote that law, they simply ignore it. Example after example \n\n\n\nexists of how this President believes he is above the law. Look no \n\nfurther than their delay of the employer mandate or their rewrite of \n\nthe laws governing the work requirements as a condition of receiving \n\nwelfare. As Mr. Will says in his article:\n\n In 1998, the Supreme Court held that ``there is no \n\n provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president \n\n to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.''\n\n Yet, as Mr. Will further points out, this President often claims:\n\n . . . he can't wait for our system of separated powers to \n\n ratify his policy preferences.\n\n Unfortunately, that is not how our country was founded and not what \n\nour forefathers established in our system of governance.\n\n As the Federalist Paper No. 47, authored by James Madison, says:\n\n The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n\n judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \n\n and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \n\n justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n The American people are wising up to this abuse of power, and I \n\nbelieve this President must respect the rule of law, despite his clear \n\nself-interest to act otherwise.\n\n I believe it is only a matter of time before the President continues \n\nto abuse executive discretion to correct problems with his law. Instead \n\nof being forthcoming with the American people and Congress and \n\nexplaining why parts of this law won't work, he relies on his \n\nadministrative agencies to issue 11-hour blog posts or leaks to the \n\nmedia to announce delays in portions of his signature law.\n\n Another way this administration is trying to fix problems is to put \n\nthe burden of fixing problems on others. Last month the President tried \n\nto fix the problem of cancelled plans by kicking the can to State \n\ninsurance regulators to determine whether, in 48 days from the date of \n\nhis announcement in November, they can change their State insurance \n\nregulation policies quickly enough to permit plans to continue to offer \n\nthose plans available in 2013 and 2014. He expected State insurance \n\ncommissioners to bail him out to allow Americans to keep the plans they \n\nwere promised they could keep. He is also expecting insurance companies \n\nto bail the administration out of problems as well.\n\n The insurance industry will now extend the deadline until January 10 \n\nfor Americans to pay for coverage that starts on New Year's Day. This \n\n\n\ndoesn't fix the problem of coverage gaps, but it is a convenient \n\ntalking point for the administration.\n\n While 2013 was filled with one unbroken ObamaCare promise after \n\nanother, the President's inability to follow through on making coverage \n\nmore affordable for families and small businesses was one of the \n\nbiggest. In a rare moment of candor, Secretary Sebelius was forced to \n\nadmit:\n\n [t]here are some individuals who may be looking at \n\n increases [in health care costs].\n\n A recent Associated Press/GfK poll confirms that more than ``some'' \n\nindividuals will be facing sticker shock thanks to ObamaCare: Sixty-\n\nnine percent say their premiums will be going up, while 59 percent say \n\nannual deductibles or copayments are increasing.\n\n A separate poll by the Washington Post and ABC found that just 5 \n\npercent of Americans believe that ObamaCare will actually reduce their \n\nhealth care costs.\n\n The reality for many Americans is that dramatically higher premiums, \n\ndeductibles, and copayments mean they are going to have less money in \n\ntheir wallets to spend on rent, pay for college, or to invest in a \n\nsmall business.\n\n As a result, 67 percent of respondents in a recent Fox News poll say \n\nObamaCare should be delayed and 53 percent of respondents would vote to \n\nrepeal the law.\n\n This holiday season Democrats should give the American people what \n\nthey were promised all along: lower costs, while keeping the doctor and \n\nplan they have and like.\n\n As we begin 2014, this President and administration should commit to \n\nabandoning their power grabs and complete disregard for the rule of \n\nlaw. This law was passed, hurriedly rushed through here on a partisan \n\nvote. Not a single Republican Senator here voted for it. We are now \n\nseeing the effects of that: one-party rule, one party running roughshod \n\nover the other to try to get something enacted into law--which now, as \n\nthe American people are finding out, they are the ones impacted.\n\n We are seeing all the adverse, harmful impacts which come with it: \n\nhigher premiums, cancelled coverage, lower take-home pay, higher \n\ndeductibles, and a less promising future for the American people. We \n\ncan and we should do better.\n\n I hope that as Americans this Christmas season reflect on the past \n\nand think to the future, we will resolve to do what is necessary to \n\ngive them a brighter future by putting in place policies which will \n\ngrow the economy,\n\n\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\ncreate jobs, increase the take-home pay of middle-class Americans, \n\nrather than give them another gut punch which makes it that much harder \n\nfor them to provide for themselves and their families.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for two purposes. No. 1, to \n\ndiscuss the National Defense Authorization Act and the fact that we \n\ncannot offer amendments to it and the process that has deteriorated in \n\nthe Senate for deliberation. Second, I will speak very shortly about \n\nthe nomination of Mayorkas, one of the first nominees we will be voting \n\non this week.\n\n The Senate is poised to vote on a final National Defense \n\nAuthorization Act after considering only two amendments. The Senate has \n\nnot been functioning like it should for some time, and the way that the \n\nNational Defense Authorization Act has been handled is one example. I \n\nhave served in the majority and the minority, with Democratic \n\nPresidents and Republican Presidents. So I have seen it operate from \n\nevery perspective. What is unique about the Senate is that the rules as \n\nwell as the traditions force Senators to work together. That leads \n\nSenators to understand where the other side is coming from, resulting \n\nin mutual respect and scrutiny.\n\n I hear from a lot of Iowans who are upset at the tone they hear in \n\nWashington and the lack of bipartisanship. I have often said that the \n\nSenate functions best when no party has more than about 55 seats. If \n\nyou have much more than that, there is less of a tendency to want to \n\nwork in a bipartisan fashion. That was true for most of my time in the \n\nSenate but not now. Despite a current margin of just 5 seats in the \n\nSenate, there has been very little bipartisan cooperation. I suppose \n\nsome Democratic Senators really believe it when they say that this is \n\nall Republicans' fault. I think anyone who remembers how the Senate \n\nused to operate and has paid attention to how the current majority \n\nleadership has been running things in fact knows better.\n\n In fairness, quite a few Members of the Senate do not remember how \n\nthe Senate is supposed to operate because it has been dysfunctional \n\never since they were elected. Some Senators previously served in the \n\nHouse of Representatives, where the majority party controls everything \n\nthat happens. In the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee sets \n\nout the terms of debate for each bill. If you want to offer an \n\namendment in the House you have to go, hat in hand, to the Rules \n\nCommittee and say: Mother, may I. If the House leadership does not like \n\nyour amendment, frankly, you are out of luck.\n\n If that sounds familiar, that is because it is how the current Senate \n\n\n\nleadership has been running things lately here in the Senate. We have \n\nseen an absolutely unprecedented use--or I should say abuse--of cloture \n\nmotions paired with a tactic called filling the tree to block \n\namendments from being considered.\n\n That not only affects the minority party, but Democratic Senators are \n\naffected as well. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the \n\naisle: How many times have you had an amendment you wanted to offer, \n\nthat was important to your State, but you could not do it because \n\namendments were blocked? The Senate majority leader has effectively \n\nbecome a one-man version of the House Rules Committee, dictating what \n\namendments will be debated and which ones will never see the light of \n\nday. This strips the ability of individual Senators to effectively \n\nrepresent their States, regardless of party.\n\n It also virtually guarantees that any legislation the Senate votes on \n\nwill be more partisan in nature. I would ask my colleagues across the \n\naisle: Isn't your first responsibility to the people of your State, not \n\nto party leadership? Are you really content to cede to your party \n\nleader the trust and responsibility placed in you by the voters of your \n\nState? How much longer can you go along with this proposition?\n\n The people of Iowa sent me to the Senate to represent them, not \n\nsimply vote up or down on a purely partisan agenda dictated by the \n\nmajority leader. Everyone complains about the lack of bipartisanship \n\nthese days, but there is no opportunity for individual Senators to work \n\nacross the aisle when legislation is drafted on a partisan basis and \n\namendments are blocked. Bipartisanship requires giving individual \n\nSenators a voice regardless of party. When Senators are only allowed to \n\nvote on items that are preapproved by the majority leader, those \n\nSenators lose the ability to effectively represent their State and, in \n\nthe end, become mere tools of party leadership. It is no wonder \n\nAmericans are so cynical about government right now.\n\n In the last decade, when I was chairman of the Finance Committee and \n\nRepublicans controlled the Senate, we wanted to actually get things \n\ndone. In order for that to happen, we knew that we had to accommodate \n\nthe minority. We had to have patience, humility, and respect for the \n\nminority--attributes that do not exist on the other side anymore. We \n\nhad some major bipartisan accomplishments, from the largest tax cut in \n\nhistory to a Medicare prescription drug program to numerous trade \n\nagreements. Those kinds of major bills do not happen anymore.\n\n The Senate rules provide that any Senator may offer an amendment \n\nregardless of party affiliation. Each Senator represents hundreds of \n\nthousands or millions of Americans, and each has an individual right to \n\noffer amendments for consideration. The principle here is not about \n\npolitical parties having their say but duly elected Senators \n\n\n\nparticipating in the legislative process, as imagined by the \n\nConstitution. Again, as part of our duty to represent the citizens of \n\nour respective States, each Senator has an individual right to offer \n\namendments. This right cannot be outsourced to party leadership.\n\n The longstanding tradition of the Senate is that Members of the \n\nminority party, as well as rank-and-file Members of the majority party \n\nhave an opportunity to offer amendments for a vote in the Senate. That \n\nhas historically been the case with the annual National Defense \n\nAuthorization Act, the very bill that we are debating now. But not this \n\nyear. It typically takes a couple of weeks to consider the National \n\nDefense Authorization Act. This year the majority party leadership \n\nchose to wait until a week before the scheduled Thanksgiving recess to \n\nbring it up, leaving little time for the customary open debate and \n\namendment process.\n\n Once the Defense bill was brought up, rather than promptly starting \n\nto process amendments, the majority leader immediately blocked \n\namendments so that he could control what came up for a vote. Obviously, \n\nthe Senate ground to a halt, wasting time that we did not have when we \n\ncould have been considering amendments from both sides of the aisle.\n\n This process, as everyone here in the Senate knows, is called filling \n\nthe tree, where the majority leader offers blocker amendments that \n\nblock any other Senator from offering their own amendment unless the \n\nmajority leader agreed to set aside his blocker amendment so other \n\namendments can be offered.\n\n Filling the tree does not appear anywhere in the Senate rules. It is \n\nbased upon combining two precedents, the precedent that the majority \n\nleader has the first right of recognition by the Presiding Officer and \n\nthe precedent that only one first-degree and one second-degree \n\namendment can be pending at any one time. Basically, the majority \n\nleader abuses his prerogative to cut in line and offer an amendment \n\nthat does nothing more than simply change the enacting date by 1 day, \n\nfor instance. That then blocks any other Senator from exercising his \n\nright to offer an amendment.\n\n This so-called filling-the-tree tactic used to be relatively rare, \n\nbut it has become routine under current leadership. This way the \n\nDemocratic leadership can prevent other Senators from offering \n\namendments that they do not want to have to vote on. Then, with \n\namendments blocked, the majority leader makes a motion to bring debate \n\nto a close. Around here that is called cloture. When cloture is \n\ninvoked, it sets up a limited time before a final vote must take place. \n\nBy keeping amendments blocked while running out the clock, the majority \n\nleader can force a final vote on a bill without having to consider any \n\namendments other than amendments that the majority leader might \n\n\n\napprove.\n\n It should not be a surprise to anyone that Members of the minority \n\nparty\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nwho wish to offer amendments will vote against a motion to end debate \n\nuntil their amendments have been considered. When Republicans vote \n\nagainst the Democratic leader's motion to end debate, we are accused of \n\nlaunching a filibuster. In other words, unless we give up our right to \n\nparticipate fully in the legislative process, the other side says that \n\nwe are filibustering.\n\n Does that really count as a filibuster? No. The nonpartisan \n\nCongressional Research Service answers this question, and has a very \n\nhelpful report on cloture motions and filibusters that make this point \n\nvery clear. The CRS report is entitled, ``Cloture Attempts on \n\nNominations: Data and Historical Development,'' by Richard S. Beth. It \n\ncontained an entire section called ``Cloture Motions Do Not Correspond \n\nWith Filibusters.'' It starts out:\n\n Although cloture affords the Senate a means for overcoming \n\n a filibuster, it is erroneous to assume that cases in which \n\n cloture was sought are always the same as those in which a \n\n filibuster occurs. Filibusters may occur without cloture \n\n being sought, and cloture may be sought when no filibuster is \n\n taking place. The reason is, cloture is sought by supporters \n\n of matters, whereas filibusters are conducted by its \n\n opponents.\n\n It then goes on to explain various scenarios to illustrate this \n\npoint. Several Members of the majority have made a point of trying to \n\nconfuse cloture motions with filibusters. We hear constantly that there \n\nhave been an unprecedented number of Republican filibusters. They often \n\npoint to a chart that purports to tally the number of filibusters and \n\nsay that this is evidence of abuse of the Senate rules by the minority. \n\nThe number they quote is the number of cloture motions, not the number \n\nof filibusters. It is true that there have been a record number of \n\ncloture motions, and I also agree that the number amounts to an \n\negregious abuse of Senate rules, but, again, there is a very \n\nsignificant difference: Cloture motions do not correspond with \n\nfilibusters. Cloture motions are filed by the majority party \n\nleadership, not by the minority party. This abuse of cloture is a major \n\ncause of the Senate's current dysfunction.\n\n Again, this abuse of cloture, often combined with the blocking of \n\namendment also prevents all Senators from doing what they were sent \n\n\n\nhere to do, not just Members of the minority party.\n\n It has gotten even worse. Even where the majority leader has decided \n\nhe is going to be open to amendments, he has created out of whole cloth \n\nnew restrictions to limit Senators' rights. First, he normally only \n\nopens the amendment process if there is an agreement to limit \n\namendments. This is usually only a handful or so. Then he has magically \n\ndetermined that only germane or relevant amendments can be considered.\n\n Of course, nowhere do the Senate rules require this, other than \n\npostcloture. Senators elected in the last few years appear to be \n\nignorant of that fact. You will hear some Senators here argue against \n\nan amendment saying it is nongermane or nonrelevant. They have totally \n\nfallen for the creative rulemaking of the majority leader, thus giving \n\nup one of their rights as a Senator with which to represent their \n\nState. I cannot count on how many nongermane or nonrelevant amendments \n\nI had to allow votes on when I processed bills when Republicans were in \n\nthe majority. They were usually tough political votes, but we took them \n\nbecause we wanted to get things done. We wanted the Senate to function.\n\n You do not see that nowadays. The current majority leader avoids \n\ntough votes at all costs and that is why we don't get much done around \n\nhere. The American people sent us here to represent them. That means \n\nvoting, not avoiding tough votes.\n\n We sometimes hear this is a question of majority rule versus minority \n\nobstruction. Again, that ignores that each Senator is elected to \n\nrepresent their State, not simply to be an agent of the other party. \n\nWhile the majority of Senators may be from one party, they represent \n\nvery different States, and the agenda of the majority leader will not \n\nalways be consistent with the interest of their States.\n\n When one individual, the Senate majority leader, controls what comes \n\nup for a vote, that is not majority rule. In fact, there are policies \n\nthat have majority support in the Senate that have been denied a vote.\n\n What happened during Senate debate on the budget resolution this year \n\nseems to prove that point. The special rules of the budget resolution \n\nlimit debate so it can't be filibustered but allow for an unlimited \n\nnumber of amendments.\n\n A Republican amendment to support repealing the tax on lifesaving \n\nmedical devices in President Obama's health care law passed by an \n\noverwhelming 79-to-20 vote, with more than half of the Democrats voting \n\nwith the Republicans rather than with their party leader.\n\n A Republican amendment supported the approval of the Keystone XL \n\nPipeline to bring oil from Canada and passed 62 to 37.\n\n Those are two examples, because votes such as these that split the \n\nDemocrats and hand a win to the Republicans are exactly what the \n\n\n\nmajority leader has been trying to avoid by blocking amendments.\n\n That is why the Senate didn't take up a budget resolution for more \n\nthan 3 years. Still, the budget resolution isn't a law, so unless \n\nlegislation on those issues is allowed to come up for a vote, nothing \n\nwill happen despite the support of the vast majority of the Senate as \n\ndemonstrated by those two rollcall votes I just mentioned.\n\n As a case in point, now we are on the National Defense Authorization \n\nAct, and one of the amendments the majority leader blocked would have \n\nimposed sanctions on the Iranian regime. Everyone knew this amendment \n\nenjoyed broad bipartisan support and would have passed easily had a \n\nvote been allowed to take place. It had majority support. But the \n\nSenate was not allowed to work its will.\n\n Why? The Iran sanctions amendment was blocked because the President \n\nopposed it and it would have been a tough vote that divided the \n\nmajority party. Is that a valid reason for shutting down the \n\ntraditional open amendment process for the Defense bill? I don't think \n\nso.\n\n Until we put an end to the abuse of cloture and the blocking of \n\namendments, the Senate cannot function properly and the American people \n\nwill continue to lack representation that they are entitled to.\n\n Mayorkas Nomination\n\n As I said, I have a few short remarks on the Mayorkas nomination. I \n\nspoke at great length on this yesterday and I won't speak at great \n\nlength today, but I have concern with Mr. Mayorkas' nomination, so I \n\nhave additional information today for my colleagues.\n\n Today the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity released an embargoed version of its audit of the EB-5 \n\nimmigrant investor visa program. The report states that the U.S. \n\nCitizenship and Immigration Service has difficulty ensuring the \n\nintegrity of the program and does not always ensure that regional \n\ncenters meet all eligibility requirements.\n\n Specifically, the report said:\n\n U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service did not always \n\n enforce its own regulations and procedures to assist with \n\n managing the regional center program.\n\n Another quote:\n\n Until improvements are made, U.S. Citizenship and \n\n Immigration Service is unable to prevent fraud and national \n\n security threats . . .\n\n\n\n Another quote:\n\n [I]t cannot report the results of the program accurately or \n\n ensure the EB-5 program is benefiting the U.S. economy and \n\n creating jobs for U.S. citizens as created by Congress.\n\n We understand Mr. Mayorkas is in charge of these programs. The IG \n\nsaid the agency needed to improve coordination and rely on the \n\nexpertise of other agencies.\n\n The IG had several recommendations for the U.S. Citizenship and \n\nImmigration Service that, frankly, should have been in place before \n\nnow, if the Director was doing his job. In his comments on the draft \n\nreport, Mr. Mayorkas claimed that he was already addressing the issues \n\nthe inspector general raised. He said his agency had ``dramatically \n\nenhanced collaboration with key government partners,'' meaning he was \n\ncooperating with the FBI.\n\n He also wrote that when his agency has concerns with EB-5 cases, it \n\ndoesn't decide the cases until it has ``fully coordinated its approach \n\nwith enforcement and intelligence partners.''\n\n I have seen examples of this so-called coordination that Mr. Mayorkas \n\ntalks\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\nabout. But, again, his words don't comport with the actual practice.\n\n When Homeland Security's law enforcement database, TECS, has a hit on \n\nsomeone applying for a regional center, the Citizenship and Immigration \n\nService sends an email to the law enforcement agency that put the \n\nrecord in. But the problem is that the Citizenship and Immigration \n\nService isn't waiting for law enforcement to make an investigation. In \n\nfact, information has come to my attention that CIS employees are told \n\nto move forward if law enforcement doesn't respond within 5 days. That \n\nis just 5 days to find out what sensitive security or fraud information \n\ncaused that person to be flagged. If law enforcement doesn't get back \n\nto the Citizenship and Immigration Service soon enough, then that \n\nagency goes ahead and the person's application is approved.\n\n That is not coordination. That coordination is a sham. That should be \n\nsimply unacceptable to any of us who are concerned about the national \n\nsecurity of our country. It is not the sort of way to run a program \n\nwith national security vulnerabilities. Everybody should wait until law \n\nenforcement responds. We need to know who is coming into this country \n\n\n\nand not, and particularly when they are involved in a program where you \n\nbuy your way into the country by buying a visa because you are supposed \n\nto be investing in this country and creating jobs in this country. But \n\nfor some people who may want to get into this country for ulterior \n\nmotives, they may violate our national security; they don't care about \n\ncreating jobs. But if it gets them inside the country, they get here. \n\nSo we have to know whether they are a threat to our national security.\n\n The only reason the Citizenship and Immigration Service even does \n\ncheck on regional centers at all is because of a push within that \n\nagency that Mr. Mayorkas and his management resisted. Now they are \n\ntrying to take credit for it.\n\n More important is what his agency has not done. They refused to kick \n\nout regional centers that invite national security problems. Mr. \n\nMayorkas claims he doesn't have statutory authority, but the inspector \n\ngeneral audit recommended that Mr. Mayorkas should make clear on his \n\nown that fraud and national security concerns are a reason for regional \n\ncenters to be kicked out of the program.\n\n The bottom line is Mr. Mayorkas has not taken the steps that were \n\nwithin his power to guard against security vulnerabilities in the EB-5 \n\nprogram. The inspector general's audit report concludes:\n\n Currently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service cannot \n\n administer and manage the EB-5 regional centers program \n\n effectively.\n\n Mr. Mayorkas has had ample notice of these problems for years. He has \n\nfailed to take adequate action.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \n\nmorning business.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Unemployment Benefits\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, at the end of this year, 1.3 million \n\nAmericans will be cut off from their Federal unemployment benefits. At \n\nthe hardest time of the year, 1.3 million people will lose the lifeline \n\nthey have relied on to support their families while they struggle to \n\nfind jobs in this challenging economic climate.\n\n Unfortunately, for 170,000 North Carolinians, this has already been a \n\nreality. Earlier this year, the North Carolina General Assembly slashed \n\nunemployment benefits, making North Carolina the only State in the \n\nNation to actually stop receiving Federal emergency unemployment \n\ninsurance--the only State in the Nation. This irresponsible and cold-\n\n\n\nhearted action by the general assembly has been devastating to the \n\nthousands of individuals and families across my State who are already \n\nstruggling to make ends meet.\n\n Sydney Houston is one of 170,000 jobless North Carolinians who would \n\nhave received Federal unemployment benefits were it not for this new \n\nState law. A month after the law was enacted and Sydney no longer had \n\nher benefits, she told a North Carolina TV station that she was ironing \n\nher clothes in preparation for a job interview when her electricity was \n\ncut off because she couldn't pay her bills. ``It's been excruciating,'' \n\nshe said, adding that she feared her landlord knocking on her door to \n\nevict her at any moment.\n\n People have to understand that these extended Federal unemployment \n\ninsurance benefits help these families pay for their rent, pay for \n\ntheir food, and pay for their electricity, just as in Sydney's case.\n\n I also received a letter from Sherrie Harmon, another North Carolina \n\nwoman. Let me tell my colleagues what she said. Her letter stated:\n\n I have lived in North Carolina my entire life and I've felt \n\n proud of my State. This has changed drastically.\n\n Sherrie was laid off from her job at a law firm and her husband Rick \n\nlost his job a month later. Sherrie was drawing unemployment while \n\nsearching for work and attending classes at Central Piedmont Community \n\nCollege in Charlotte. She was in her third semester of school when she \n\nfound out that her unemployment would end.\n\n She said:\n\n We are at risk of losing everything we've worked for in the \n\n 24 years we've been married. I am completely lost.\n\n We have heard so many stories such as these from Sydneys and Sherries \n\nacross North Carolina.\n\n What is more, North Carolina tax dollars are going to unemployed \n\nworkers in every other State across the Nation except for North \n\nCarolina. Our citizens are paying their Federal taxpayer dollars for \n\nFederal unemployment benefits to 49 other States, even though our \n\ncitizens cannot rely on the same safety net. This is not only unfair, \n\nit is hurting my State, which continues to have one of the highest \n\nunemployment rates in the country at 8 percent, with some of the rural \n\ncounties in North Carolina as high as 14.5 percent.\n\n As the Senate considers an extension of the emergency insurance \n\nprogram, I believe it is crucial to right the wrong that has been done \n\nto North Carolinians through no fault of their own. For this reason, I \n\ncome to the floor today to express my thanks to my colleagues, \n\n\n\nespecially Majority Leader Reid, Senator Max Baucus, and Senator Jack \n\nReed, for working with me to ensure that North Carolina's needs will be \n\naddressed as we work to extend unemployment insurance benefits into \n\n2014.\n\n I also urge my colleagues not to leave their constituents to the same \n\nfate as the citizens of my State, and to swiftly pass the Emergency \n\nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act. This bipartisan legislation, \n\nintroduced by Senators Jack Reed and Dean Heller, would extend Federal \n\nunemployment insurance benefits, and it would restore North Carolina's \n\neligibility to participate in the program.\n\n We must continue to work on bipartisan policies that will boost job \n\ncreation and get Americans back into our workforce. We need educational \n\ninstitutions, local employers, and job training centers to join forces \n\nto ensure that unemployed workers are being trained for the job \n\nopportunities that are available right now.\n\n I have a bill called the America Works Act that would do just that. \n\nIt would close the skills gap that has been plaguing our country and it \n\nwould take the guessing game out of hiring. The America Works Act would \n\nensure that community colleges and job training programs develop \n\ncurricula that will lead to portable, industry-recognized credentials \n\nthat will help train our unemployed workers so they would be \n\noutstanding applicants for jobs that are available in their local \n\ncommunities right now.\n\n In the meantime, as the unemployed struggle to get by while they look \n\nfor jobs, we should not cut them off from the safety net that has \n\nserved as their last lifeline for taking care of their families and \n\nputting food on the table. We should make certain that the unemployed \n\nin North Carolina have that same opportunity once again in spite of the \n\naction taken by the North Carolina General Assembly.\n\n I am glad to be joining my colleagues in pushing to extend the \n\nunemployment insurance for both North Carolinians and people across our \n\ncountry. There is no reason to wait any longer to pass this critical \n\nlegislation.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank \n\nSenators Levin and Inhofe and the Committee on Armed Services for their \n\nvery hard work on the Department of Defense authorization bill. \n\nUnfortunately, I must vote against it, and I want to take this \n\nopportunity to explain why I am voting no and to express my very \n\nserious concerns about our Nation's bloated military budget, \n\n\n\nparticularly in light of the many unmet needs we face as a nation.\n\n At a time when the United States has a $17.2 trillion national debt \n\nand when we spend almost as much on defense as the rest of the world \n\ncombined, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look at the \n\nwaste, at the cost overruns, and at the financial mismanagement that \n\nhave plagued the Department of Defense for decades.\n\n As a point of comparison, the International Institute for Strategic \n\nStudies estimates total global military spending in 2012 at $1.583 \n\ntrillion. The U.S. portion of that spending is over 40 percent--$645 \n\nbillion. In other words, the United States is spending almost as much \n\nas the rest of the world combined on defense. We are spending about \n\n$645 billion. China spends $102 billion. The United Kingdom spends $64 \n\nbillion. Russia spends $59 billion. Other countries spend less.\n\n According to the Washington Post:\n\n Since 2001, the base defense budget has soared from $287 \n\n billion to $530 billion--and that's before accounting for the \n\n primary costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\n In addition to the trillions spent on the war in Iraq and what seems \n\nto be a never-ending war in Afghanistan, the Department of Defense \n\nconsistently engages in wasteful, inefficient, and often fraudulent \n\nspending.\n\n At my request several years ago the Department of Defense issued a \n\nreport detailing the breadth of fraud that exists within the Pentagon--\n\nthe simple issue of massive fraud. The report showed that the Pentagon \n\npaid over $573 billion during the past 10 years to more than 300 \n\ncontractors involved in civil fraud cases that resulted in judgments of \n\nmore than $1 million--$398 billion of which was awarded after \n\nsettlement or judgment for fraud. When awards to parent companies are \n\ncounted, the Pentagon paid more than $1.1 trillion during the past 10 \n\nyears just to the 37 top companies engaged in fraud. The bottom line is \n\nthat almost every major defense contractor in this country has in one \n\nway or another been involved in fraudulent dealings with the taxpayers \n\nof this country and the Department of Defense.\n\n Further, above and beyond fraud, the waste at the Pentagon is \n\nrampant, and we can go on for many hours just documenting the waste, \n\nbut let me give just a few--a few--of the kinds of waste that the \n\nPentagon regularly engages in. These are just a very few examples.\n\n In July 2013 the Pentagon decided to build a 64,000-square-foot \n\ncommand headquarters for the U.S. military in Afghanistan that will not \n\nbe utilized or even occupied. Even though the $34 million project was \n\ndeemed unwanted by military commanders 3 years ago, the military still \n\nmoved ahead with construction. That is one example.\n\n\n\n Another example. According to a report released by the Department of \n\nDefense inspector general this year, the Pentagon has been paying \n\ncontractor Boeing more than $3,357 for a piece of hardware they could \n\nhave purchased from their own hardware store, the Defense Logistics \n\nAgency, for $15.42. It seems to me it would be a pretty good deal to \n\nget a product for $15 that you are paying over $3,000 for, but that is \n\nthe way the Pentagon runs.\n\n Furthermore, another issue, the July 2013 Special Inspector General \n\nfor Afghanistan Reconstruction report includes the purchase of over \n\n$771 million worth of aircraft that the Afghans will be unable to \n\noperate and maintain. The Afghan Special Mission Wing has only one-\n\nquarter of the personnel needed to maintain and operate the fleet, and \n\nthere are no existing DOD plans to reach full strength. The Pentagon is \n\nmoving forward with purchases. Most of that money--$553 million--has \n\nbeen awarded to a Russian company that also sells weapons to Syria.\n\n These are just a few examples. Needless to say, there are many more.\n\n A recent article in Mother Jones has some interesting numbers about \n\nour military spending. According to the article, 70 percent of the \n\nvalue of the Federal Government's $1.8 trillion in property, land, and \n\nequipment belongs to the Pentagon. The American people will no doubt be \n\ninterested in understanding that the Pentagon operates more than 170 \n\ngolf courses worldwide.\n\n At a time when we now spend almost as much as the rest of the world \n\ncombined on defense, we can make judicious cuts in our Armed Forces \n\nwithout compromising our military capability. I think everybody in the \n\nCongress believes and understands that we need a strong defense--no \n\ndebate about that--but we do not need a defense budget that is bloated, \n\nthat is wasteful, and that has in it many areas of fraud.\n\n In this respect, I hope my Republican colleagues and, in fact, all of \n\nmy colleagues remember what former President Dwight Eisenhower, a good \n\nRepublican, said on April 16, 1953, just as he was leaving office. What \n\nhe said then was profound, and it is as true today as when he said it \n\n60 years ago. This is what he said:\n\n Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every \n\n rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who \n\n hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not \n\n clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It \n\n is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its \n\n scientists, the hopes of its children. . . . This is not a \n\n way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of \n\n threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\n\n I would ask all of my colleagues to remember what Eisenhower said and \n\nunderstand that today, when we have this bloated and huge military \n\n\n\nbudget, there are people who are talking about massive cuts in food \n\nstamps, massive cuts in education, massive cuts in affordable housing, \n\ncuts in Social Security, cuts in Medicare, cuts in Medicaid. I would \n\nargue very strongly that before we cut from the elderly and the \n\nchildren and the sick and the poor, maybe we take a hard look at this \n\nbloated military budget.\n\n That is my view, but let me mention what the Cato Institute has to \n\nsay--not Bernie Sanders but the Cato Institute, one of the most \n\nconservative organizations in this country. Here is what the Cato \n\nInstitute said on May 3, 2013. By the way, as I think most people know, \n\nmy views are as far apart as possible from the Cato Institute on most \n\nissues. This is what the Cato Institute said. Some of my conservative \n\nRepublican friends might want to pay attention to this quote:\n\n U.S. military spending is far too excessive for legitimate \n\n defense needs. . . . After sequestration we will still spend \n\n more [on defense], against much less severe threats, than at \n\n the peak of the Cold War. . . . The U.S. now accounts for 44 \n\n percent of all global military spending. Put another way, the \n\n U.S. spends nearly as much on the military as the rest of the \n\n world combined. . . . Twenty percent of the U.S. federal \n\n budget is devoted to military spending, while the average--\n\n And this is an important point made by Cato--\n\n for our NATO allies is a mere 3.6 percent. Five percent of \n\n U.S. annual GDP is allocated to the military, but for the \n\n NATO countries, Japan and China, it is well below 2 percent. \n\n . . . Today the amount Washington spends on the military each \n\n year is $2,300 a person in the U.S. The comparable obligation \n\n for the average NATO country is $503 a person. For China it \n\n is less than $200 a person.\n\n That is not Bernie Sanders; that is the Cato Institute.\n\n The situation is so absurd that the Pentagon is unable to even \n\naccount for how it spends its money. Earlier this year the Government \n\nAccountability Office cited its inability--that is, the GAO's ability--\n\nto audit the Pentagon. They wrote that they were unable to do a \n\ncomprehensive financial analysis due to ``serious financial management \n\nproblems at the Department of Defense that made its financial \n\nstatements unauditable.'' That is from the Government Accountability \n\nOffice. So we are voting for a budget that the GAO says they cannot \n\neven audit--for the most expensive agency in government.\n\n Let me now quote from an article that appeared in the Washington Post \n\non August 29, 2013. The defense budget--a purposefully opaque \n\n\n\ndocument--includes what is known as the black budget. The information I \n\nam providing here comes from the Washington post--$52.6 billion that \n\nfunds the CIA, NSA, and other secret intelligence agencies. The CIA, \n\nNSA, and National Reconnaissance Office receive more than 68 percent of \n\nthe black budget, with the NSA receiving $10.8 billion annually. At a \n\ntime when the NSA has\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nbeen engaging in what I consider to be unconstitutional activities--the \n\nwidespread collection of American citizens' data--I think we can find \n\nthe ability to make some cuts in what they are doing.\n\n I support a strong defense for our country and a robust National \n\nGuard and Reserve that can meet our domestic and foreign challenges. \n\nThe National Guard provides a well-trained, disciplined, and \n\noperationally ready force for a fraction of the cost that Active-Duty \n\nsoldiers require. The Reserve Forces do not require nearly the same \n\nlevel of overhead in terms of full-time employment and infrastructure \n\ncosts. So as we move forward trying to develop how we have a cost-\n\neffective defense, I think we should put a great deal of emphasis on \n\nour National Guard and on the Reserve.\n\n Let me conclude by saying in America today our middle class is \n\nstruggling. We have more people living in poverty than at any time in \n\nthe history of our country. Real unemployment is over 13 percent; youth \n\nunemployment, 20 percent; African-American youth unemployment, close to \n\n40 percent\n\n We have an infrastructure which is crumbling. We have large numbers \n\nof young people graduating from college deeply in debt. We have others \n\nwho cannot even afford to go to college because of the high cost of \n\ncollege. In other words, this country faces monumental problems. On top \n\nof that, we have a $17.2 trillion national debt.\n\n It would seem to me that it is important we get our priorities \n\nstraight. One of the priorities we should be getting straight is that \n\nwe cannot give the Department of Defense all they want. It is time to \n\ntake a very hard look at that budget in a way we have not done up to \n\nthis point.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \n\nfrom Massachusetts be recognized for 5 minutes and that I follow with \n\nmy comments until I complete them.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n This final couple of days that we are going to be in session are very \n\nimportant because they are the days preceding the expiration of the \n\nwind energy tax break. It expires on December 31. There are energy \n\nefficiency tax breaks that expire on December 31.\n\n This is unfortunate, because these are industries that are rapidly \n\ngrowing. But let's take note here. If you are the oil industry or other \n\nolder fossil fuel industries, your tax breaks are not expiring on \n\nDecember 31. For the wind industry, for the renewable energy industry, \n\nwe have to come back out here every year and try to get those tax \n\nbreaks renewed. Each year as we reach this December 31 date, we talk \n\nabout a Congress adjourning without completing it, sending total \n\ncorporate unpredictability out into the marketplace, knowing that we \n\nneed to have a robust, competitive marketplace.\n\n Honestly, Adam Smith is spinning in his grave as he watches a Senate \n\nadjourn without continuing the tax breaks for wind, as the tax breaks \n\nfor all of its competitive industries continue on year after year. They \n\nare permanent tax breaks. Actually, Adam Smith is spinning in his grave \n\nso rapidly that he would qualify for a permanent tax break, because he \n\nwould be generating so much energy, wondering how can you have such \n\ninconsistency? How can you have one source of energy have to come in \n\nalmost like a mendicant each year begging, and then having the year \n\nexpire, after having added 13,000 megawatts of new electricity to the \n\ngrid last year, knowing that the entire nuclear industry only added \n\n100,000 in 60 years?\n\n Here we are again. Those tax breaks are going to expire. We are going \n\nto leave here. We could not get unanimous consent in order to take them \n\nup here today to extend those tax breaks. Once again, the energy \n\nsources of the future, the innovative new energy sources, pay the \n\nprice. They are not allowed to be given permanent status or, as we \n\nleave here, any status at all as of the end of this year.\n\n Young people in our country, the green energy generation, looked and \n\nthey asked: Well, why can't we have our era's energy technologies given \n\npermanent tax breaks or at least year to year before you go home? Why \n\ncan't you have that kind of a debate out there? Why is there a debate \n\nat all, to be honest with you, given the fact that there is $7 billion \n\na year that is going to be given to the oil industry, a permanent tax \n\nbreak?\n\n We are not looking for that for wind. We are looking at much smaller \n\namounts of tax benefits. So from my perspective, I look at the warming \n\nplanet, I look at the Chinese and others who are targeting wind \n\nsources. I was in China in 2009. We rode by a wind factory with wind \n\nturbines, hundreds of them. They were all, in a lot of ways, pointing \n\n\n\nright at the American economy, in the same way that those Cuban \n\nmissiles were pointing at our country in 1962--pointing right at us, a \n\nthreat to us. But in the 21st century, it is a threat to our economy \n\nbecause we are not investing in these new technologies in the way we \n\ncontinue to invest in the old.\n\n The least it could be and should be is a level playing field. Let's \n\nsee who wins. Let's let capitalism work. Let's have this true Darwinian \n\nparanoia-inducing capitalism that allows for winners to be selected \n\nbased upon the same kind of tax breaks for everyone. If that is the \n\ncase, I think everyone would be happy. But that is not the way it is \n\ngoing to be this year. That is not the way it is most years.\n\n Permanent tax breaks for the older technologies, and the kind of \n\nhalting, questioning, capitalism-killing, corporate-questioning tax \n\nbreaks for the nascent but growing and vibrant new technologies that \n\nthe Chinese and the Germans and the Danes and others see as their job-\n\ncreating sectors in their economy.\n\n I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for this opportunity.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n Mayorkas Nomination\n\n Mr. COBURN. Madam President, to comment on my colleague from \n\nMassachusetts, he is correct that the tax credits for wind energy are \n\nexpiring, but he is incorrect in his ascertainment that all tax credits \n\nare the same. The tax credits in the oil and gas industry are deferred \n\ntax payments, and the $7 billion they collect this year, in terms of \n\ndeferred payments, in terms of intangible drilling costs, will, in \n\nfact, be made up for with $7 billion of payments from 10 years ago. So \n\nthe net-net is zero, whereas the wind industry has a tax credit which \n\nthe American consumer subsidizes to the tune of a significant amount, \n\nthe value of the electricity that we get there. So it is viable--if we \n\nwere to put the wind energy tax credit the same as we have in the oil \n\nand gas industry, I would happily support it, where it was a delayed \n\ncapture of later revenues flowing back to the Treasury. But that is not \n\nwhat we want. We want to give a refundable tax credit directly to wind \n\nenergy. It is not the same. The apples are not the same.\n\n I came to the floor this evening regrettably having to come and make \n\nthis statement I am making. In the last month we have seen a lot of \n\nthings happen in the Senate, which have led to other things happening \n\nin the Senate. I do not think anybody is happy about it. But today, the \n\nleader is taking the unprecedented step--I say that underlining the \n\nword unprecedented--of having the Senate vote on a nominee who is \n\n\n\ncurrently under active investigation.\n\n I have no premonitions or knowledge about the specific facts of that \n\ninvestigation. But what I do know, in checking with the Senate \n\nhistorian, the Senate library, and from the history of the Senate, is \n\nthat it has never been done before. It has never been done. So my \n\nreason in coming to the floor is, No. 1, to defend my position and what \n\nshould be the position of the Senate, and to make the case to my \n\ncolleagues that we are doing a disservice both to this nominee and to \n\nthe position he will fill.\n\n By all letters of recommendation, Alejandro Mayorkas is an honorable \n\nman. President Obama is nominating him to be Deputy Secretary at the \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security. Under the new Senate rules, the \n\nminority has essentially no right to stop the majority from forcing \n\nthrough a nominee who possibly, just possibly, may be unfit for office \n\non the basis of this investigation. Nobody is saying he is.\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\nThey are not saying no. They are saying wait. This is, in fact, the \n\nvery act the Republicans were afraid of when Leader Reid facilitated \n\nthe change in the Senate rules by breaking the Senate rules.\n\n The Senate is going to cast this vote without knowledge, full \n\nknowledge, of advice and consent on his fitness for his position. We \n\ncan do nothing to stop that. We realize that.\n\n The precedent we are talking about is historic. Holding this vote in \n\nlight of an active investigation into serious relevant allegations of \n\nmisconduct by any nominee appears to be virtually without any precedent \n\nin this body. We searched extensively for any precedent, for the \n\ndecision to hold a vote on this nomination.\n\n The Congressional Research Service studied this. It has never \n\nhappened before. Never. In fact, they discovered the opposite. The \n\nSenate has established a history and followed a practice that should \n\nlead us to postpone consideration of any nominee under investigation. \n\nHere are some examples they found.\n\n In January of 2005, President George Bush nominated Ken Tomlinson to \n\nbe Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. An active inspector \n\ngeneral's investigation into allegations of unethical behavior by Mr. \n\nTomlinson led the Senate panel to delay action on the nomination for \n\nover 18 months. He was never confirmed.\n\n Later that same year, President Bush nominated Roland Arnall to the \n\npost of U.S. Ambassador to The Netherlands. At the time Mr. Arnall's \n\nfirm was being investigated by regulators in 30 States for predatory \n\nlending. Then-Foreign Relations Committee chairman Republican Senator \n\nRichard Lugar consented to a request by Democrats that October to delay \n\n\n\nvoting on the nominee because of the investigations. Senator Joseph \n\nBiden spoke out in favor of the delay, as did Senator Paul Sarbanes, \n\nwho cited longstanding precedent for delaying a vote until the nominee \n\nwas ``clear.'' Mr. Arnall was eventually voted out of committee, after \n\nRepublicans concluded the investigation did not target the nominee \n\npersonally, but he was not confirmed by the full Senate until the \n\nfollowing February, 7 months after he was nominated, when his company \n\nagreed to end the investigations by settling the cases against him.\n\n My friend President Obama, who nominated Mr. Mayorkas, was a member \n\nof the Foreign Relations Committee at that time. Then he seemed to \n\nagree that nominees facing investigations should not receive a vote. A \n\n2006 LA Times story on Mr. Arnall's confirmation quoted then-Senator \n\nObama's spokesman as saying: Because a settlement has been reached, \n\nSenator Obama will not seek to block his nomination.\n\n A vote on another Bush nominee, Lester Crawford, was delayed for 2 \n\nmonths in 2005 while the inspector general of the Food and Drug \n\nAdministration probed claims, allegations, that Mr. Crawford had an \n\naffair with a coworker and gave her preferential treatment. Once again, \n\nthe OIG's review was complete. The OIG concluded that the allegations \n\ncould not be substantiated, and the HELP Committee voted to confirm \n\nhim.\n\n In 2004, the Senate Banking Committee did not schedule a vote on \n\nAlphonso Jackson to serve as Chairman of the Department of Housing and \n\nUrban Development until the HUD inspector general determined Mr. \n\nJackson had not violated the Department's workplace violence policies \n\nas subordinates had alleged.\n\n All of this advises us strongly to delay a vote on Mr. Mayorkas until \n\nthe OIG investigation into his alleged actions is concluded. I would \n\nsuggest that we should learn from history and not move forward with \n\nthis nomination. If it was true for the Senate then, and if it was true \n\nfor Senator Biden, if it was true for Senator Obama, if it was true for \n\ntheir colleagues and many Senators who maintain this precedent until \n\ntoday, it should be true for us now.\n\n Last week, when Mr. Mayorkas was considered by the Homeland Security \n\nand Governmental Affairs Committee, my chairman justified moving \n\nforward with the nomination by asserting that the DHS OIG had not \n\nidentified any criminal wrongdoing by Mr. Mayorkas. At present, the DHS \n\nOIG is only considering allegations of conflicts of interest, misuse of \n\nposition, mismanagement, and appearance of impropriety. In none of \n\nthose situations I identified were the nominees under criminal \n\ninvestigation. Yet the Senate delayed its vote until each investigation \n\nwas finished. Since the DHS OIG has not completed its investigation, we \n\ndo not know if there will ultimately be any criminal findings. I doubt \n\n\n\nthat there will.\n\n We do know, based on the precedent that I cited, an investigation \n\ninto any potential wrongdoing, whether criminal or not, is enough for \n\nthe Senate to delay a vote on an important nominee, or at least it used \n\nto be.\n\n Of course, the Senate recently changed. The majority leader exercised \n\nthe so-called nuclear option, changing the rules by breaking the rules, \n\ngranting my colleagues the new power to push administration nominees \n\nthrough the confirmation process with a simple majority.\n\n The leader is attempting to use this new power to push through scores \n\nof nominees in the last few days this session. But scrutiny and \n\njudgment should not be diminished in a partisan rush to get one's way. \n\nForget the rest of the nominees; this is one where an open \n\ninvestigation is currently underway. With this nominee before us, Mr. \n\nMayorkas might do well to wait for all the facts.\n\n As we all know, the DHS OIG is also currently under investigation. \n\nThis office is reviewing the leader who recently resigned. They are \n\nreviewing allegations of conflict of interest, misuse of position, \n\nmismanagement of EB-5 investor visa program, and an appearance of \n\nimpropriety. They are all serious concerns. I hope they aren't true, \n\nbut right now we don't have all of the facts.\n\n While I understand OIG is not currently aware of any criminal \n\nactivity, since the investigation is still open and several interviews \n\nremain, that could possibly change.\n\n As I understand, however, the OIG plans to complete its investigation \n\nand release its findings in a few short months. Until then, we won't \n\nknow what is only an allegation and what will be proven by evidence and \n\nfacts.\n\n Most concerning to me is the fact that the White House failed to \n\nalert me or the committee chairman to the fact that Mr. Mayorkas was \n\nunder investigation, which they had an obligation to do. In fact, the \n\nletter from White House counsel conveniently doesn't confirm or deny \n\nwhether the President was aware Mr. Mayorkas was even under \n\ninvestigation. It is unclear to me why Chairman Carper wasn't troubled \n\nby the White House being less than honest with him about a nominee he \n\nwas expected to fast track for nomination.\n\n I have spoken to a number of whistleblowers within DHS who have \n\nconcerns about Mr. Mayorkas' fitness for position. These whistleblowers \n\nhave made serious allegations about how Mr. Mayorkas has overseen and \n\ninfluenced the EB-5 program. They are only allegations, but they do \n\nraise questions. They raise questions about his allegiance to DHS's \n\ncore mission to prevent terrorism and enhance security.\n\n\n\n A number of the allegations extend well beyond the EB-5 program and \n\nraise concerns about the fitness for the No. 2 position in DHS. They \n\ninclude the following: attempts by Mr. Mayorkas to obstruct the \n\ninvestigations by Congress; allegations of preventing program integrity \n\nmeasures requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; intimidation \n\nof employees who questioned agency policies; susceptibility to \n\npolitical influence; failing to properly enforce program integrity \n\nmechanisms, resulting in potential threats to national security.\n\n Whistleblowers who spoke to the Wall Street Journal said that Mr. \n\nMayorkas fast-tracked approvals of certain EB-5 applications over \n\nobjections regarding the suspicious source of funds to rebuild the \n\ncasino in Las Vegas which, in fact, was noted in a recent article by \n\nthe Washington Times.\n\n I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article by \n\nthe Wall Street Journal.\n\n There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \n\nthe Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\n [From the Washington Times, Dec. 10, 2013]\n\n Vegas Rules: Harry Reid Pushed Feds To Change Ruling for Casino's Big-\n\n Money Foreigners\n\n (By John Solomon and David Sherfinski)\n\n The Obama administration overruled career Homeland Security \n\n officials and expedited visa applications for about two dozen \n\n foreign investors for a politically connected Las Vegas \n\n casino hotel after repeated pressure from Senate Majority \n\n Leader Harry Reid and his staff, according to internal \n\n government documents obtained by The Washington Times.\n\n The move to overturn what is normally a non-appealable visa \n\n decision came despite concerns about ``suspicious financial \n\n activity'' involving some of the visa applicants from Asia, \n\n and it ultimately benefited several companies whose \n\n executives have donated heavily in recent years to Democrats, \n\n the documents show. It also ensnared Mr. Obama's current \n\n nominee to be the No. 2 Homeland Security official, Alejandro \n\n ``Ali'' Mayorkas, whose appointment is to be reviewed by the \n\n Senate on Wednesday.\n\n The intervention from Mr. Reid's staff was so intense at \n\n one point a year ago that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n\n Services (USCIS) official reported that it prompted a phone \n\n\n\n shouting match, turning a normally bureaucratic review \n\n process inside the Homeland Security Department into a \n\n politically charged drama that worried career officials.\n\n ``This one is going to be a major headache for us all \n\n because Sen. Reid's office/staff is pushing hard and I just \n\n had a long yelling match on the phone,'' USCIS Legislative \n\n Affairs official Miguel ``Mike'' Rodriguez warned in a Dec. \n\n 5, 2012, email to Homeland Security Department officials.\n\n The emails, obtained by The Times from government officials \n\n concerned that the EB-5 investor visa program has become too \n\n politicized, detail how the SLS Hotel, formerly known as the \n\n Sahara Casino, tried to jump to the head of the line for its \n\n request for about two dozen visas for Asian investors willing \n\n to help it fund a major renovation of the storied property on \n\n the Las Vegas Strip.\n\n Despite early pressure from Mr. Reid's staff, career \n\n officials inside the Department of Homeland Security \n\n initially turned down the SLS Hotel on the grounds that it \n\n failed to meet the criteria for expedited review. The \n\n decision dated Dec. 17, 2012, stated flatly that ``there is \n\n no appeal or reconsideration of this decision.''\n\n But that simply prompted Mr. Reid to personally reach out \n\n to the top official at USCIS, Alejandro ``Ali'' Mayorkas, \n\n setting into motion a process that consumed top political \n\n officials inside the Homeland Security and Commerce \n\n departments and ultimately resulted in a ruling that granted \n\n expedited status to the hotel over the objections of career \n\n officials.\n\n ``Ali had a call with Sen. Reid on these I-526 cases on \n\n Tuesday of this week,'' Mr.-Rodriguez wrote top officials on \n\n Jan. 11. ``While no guarantees were made on the call, Ali did \n\n promise the Senator that USCIS would take a `fresh look' at \n\n the expedited request.''\n\n Government officials did a lot more than give a fresh \n\n look--forwarding from Mr. Reid's office the names of people \n\n involved with the hotel project that could help the federal \n\n agency change its mind on the expedited status request. Mr. \n\n Reid's staff repeatedly made the case that the hotel would \n\n lose its potential funding for its renovation if Homeland \n\n Security's USCIS didn't expedite the visas.\n\n ``As you can imagine this project is pretty important to \n\n Southern Nevada. It will probably be the only `new' property \n\n opening up on the Strip for some time, and if their $300 \n\n\n\n million senior lending facility from JP Morgan Chase expires \n\n because these visas aren't processed expeditiously, it will \n\n be a huge setback for the project and the 8,600 jobs \n\n associated with it,'' Michael Vannozzi, then a top aide to \n\n Mr. Reid, wrote Homeland Security officials at one point.\n\n The hotel needed the foreign investors' visas to be \n\n approved so that their money could be brought into the \n\n country and paired with the JP Morgan financing to underwrite \n\n the renovation of the hotel, the documents stated.\n\n Within a few short weeks of Mr. Reid's personal \n\n intervention, the decision not to expedite the visas was \n\n reversed, allowing the hotel to secure major funding from JP \n\n Morgan Chase.\n\n ``Applications approved for expedited processing move to \n\n the front of the processing queue but otherwise go through \n\n the same robust eligibility and security review utilized for \n\n all EB-5 decisions,'' the spokesman said.\n\n A spokeswoman for Mr. Reid said the senator ``has supported \n\n and will support the SLS Las Vegas in any way he can.''\n\n ``Sen. Reid believes it is his job to do all he can to \n\n promote economic growth and development in the state, and he \n\n makes no apologies for helping to bring jobs to Nevada,'' \n\n spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said.\n\n Hotel officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n The emergence of the documents comes at a sensitive time \n\n for the Obama administration and Mr. Mayorkas, whose \n\n nomination to be deputy secretary of DHS is being considered \n\n Wednesday by a Senate committee.\n\n Mr. Mayorkas and his agency are already under investigation \n\n for visa application decisions made involving an electric car \n\n company associated with Terry McAuliffe, a longtime \n\n Democratic fundraiser and now the governor-elect of Virginia.\n\n Officials say the EB-5 program, created by Congress in \n\n 1990, is designed to attract investors willing to risk \n\n capital in ventures that will create jobs in the United \n\n States. Would-be entrepreneurs who invest at least $500,000 \n\n in a new U.S. business can apply.\n\n The citizenship services agency says the goal of the \n\n program is to ``stimulate the U.S. economy through job \n\n creation and capital investment by foreign investors.''\n\n Almost all foreign investments in the EB-5 program are \n\n channeled through special companies called ``regional \n\n centers.'' Once their business plan is approved by \n\n\n\n immigration officials, the companies bundle investments into \n\n qualifying new businesses. Investors then can apply for an \n\n EB-5 visa, and, if approved, can claim a conditional green \n\n card immediately upon entry to the United States. After two \n\n years, the conditions are removed if the investment has \n\n created the jobs or looks likely to.\n\n The emails referencing Mr. Reid's intervention could \n\n increase concerns that the worker visa program has been \n\n exploited by political pressures.\n\n ``It's not one party's monopoly, but it's kind of \n\n inherently worrisome,'' said David North, a policy analyst at \n\n the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates \n\n for less immigration into the U.S. ``There certainly are \n\n political pressures to cut short the review process.''\n\n Executives for the two main companies involved in the hotel \n\n project have donated more than $127,000 to political causes \n\n over the last three elections, mostly to Democrats, Federal \n\n Election Commission records show.\n\n Sen. Dean Heller, Nevada Republican, wrote a letter on the \n\n matter to USCIS California Service Center on December 19, \n\n 2012.\n\n ``I strongly encourage you to consider this request and the \n\n impact the project will have on Nevada's economy,'' he wrote, \n\n under the assumption that the petitions were still being \n\n processed. ``Time is of the essence and advancing Nevada's \n\n economy would be strongly supported by this project.''\n\n Mr. Heller's office said there were no subsequent \n\n conversations with USCIS or DHS.\n\n According to the plan, the project is estimated to create \n\n 8,600 jobs.\n\n Peter Joseph, executive director of the Association to \n\n Invest in the USA (IIUSA), a membership organization \n\n representing 107 federally designated EB-5 Regional Centers \n\n across the country, pointed out that USCIS is dealing with a \n\n backlog of about 7,000 applications--proof that they're \n\n employing careful scrutiny.\n\n ``Based on the backlog, they clearly take it seriously, and \n\n rightfully so,'' he said. ``I think that the data tells the \n\n story--that this is a program that is being administered \n\n carefully with the appropriate in-house expertise.''\n\n DHS declined to say which specific cases had been \n\n expedited. It is not clear whether the applications flagged \n\n\n\n for security reasons were ultimately approved, but USCIS said \n\n in a statement that the agency ``takes seriously our \n\n responsibility to safeguard national security and public \n\n safety while deciding requests for immigration benefits.''\n\n ``USCIS subjects all benefit requests to a background check \n\n process which includes coordinating with law enforcement \n\n agencies where applicable,'' the statement reads. ``USCIS \n\n does not proceed to a final decision regarding any benefit \n\n requests until concerns identified during the background \n\n check process are sufficiently resolved.''\n\n The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in February that SBE \n\n Entertainment was indeed able to secure the last piece of the \n\n $415 million in financing that they were seeking.\n\n SBE Chief Executive Officer Sam Nazarian said the money \n\n raised through the EB-5 funding was ``far above'' what had \n\n been expected and would allow SBE to pay down its senior note \n\n on the property, the paper reported. The terms of the project \n\n required $115 million in EB-5 capital.\n\n The project was apparently struggling to secure that last \n\n bit of funding. Adam Horowitz of Lever Capital Partners wrote \n\n to the managing director of Stockbridge Real Estate Funds, \n\n which was working on the project, on January 24 saying they \n\n had reached out to more than 70 national and international \n\n investors/lenders, and all but one said their lack of \n\n knowledge of the EB-5 program would prevent them from \n\n providing capital for the project.\n\n ``Brevet Capital, a New York City based private equity \n\n fund, was the one lender that showed interest since they had \n\n been spending time working on such projects,'' Mr. Horowitz \n\n wrote. ``Their one hurdle was that there needed to be at \n\n least one (1) I-526 petition approval. Since that approval \n\n has not been granted they have currently withdrawn from \n\n discussions.''\n\n Mr. COBURN. I understand that some of my colleagues on the other side \n\nare frustrated that whistleblowers have not come forward to speak to \n\nthem. To be clear, I have communicated this request to the \n\nwhistleblowers and have invited those whistleblowers who have spoken to \n\ncome to my office to speak to the majority, twice. But they have told \n\nme that they have the fear they will face retribution if their \n\nidentities become known and that they will lose their jobs. Putting \n\nmyself in their shoes, I can't blame them. I cannot provide them with \n\n\n\nprotection.\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n They have also heard Members of this Senate dismiss their serious \n\nallegations. For example, the Senator from Delaware referred to the \n\nwhistleblower allegations as rumor and innuendo. If you were an \n\nofficial who had come forward with serious concerns about improper \n\nbehavior, potentially putting your livelihood at risk, would you feel \n\ncomfortable speaking with somebody who has already dismissed your \n\nallegations as rumor and innuendo?\n\n So we will leave it to the inspector general's office to consider \n\nwhistleblower allegations and all of the evidence to determine whether \n\nany inappropriate or criminal activity took place. Again, we will know \n\nthat judgment in a short 2 months.\n\n However, we do have other information that raises serious concerns \n\nabout this nomination. The committee's business meeting last week to \n\nconsider Mr. Mayorkas is a perfect example of why the Senate should \n\nwait for the OIG's investigation to be completed. At that meeting the \n\nchairman gave a lengthy opening statement that made a number of \n\nconcerning and inaccurate statements which served to denigrate the 650 \n\nemployees at the Office of Inspector General at Homeland Security.\n\n The office deserves some criticism, that is for sure, as our \n\nSubcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight has determined. \n\nRather than rely on their insights, he came up with some of his own. \n\nThere are actual misstatements of fact, and they only serve to further \n\nobscure a complicated and difficult situation.\n\n For example, the chairman claimed that 3 days before the confirmation \n\nhearing on July 25, information about the OIG investigation was leaked \n\nto Congress and the media in a highly irregular manner.\n\n As he knows, and his own committee record should indicate, the \n\nexistence of the investigation was not leaked to Congress in a highly \n\nirregular manner, it was emailed to his staff, as well as mine, as an \n\nofficial communication by the DHS OIG congressional liaison office. If \n\nthere was anything irregular about the situation, it was that the White \n\nHouse had not already confirmed there was an investigation ongoing. We \n\nhad a right to that information, and it had been improperly kept from \n\nus.\n\n In the face of the White House's inappropriate omission, the OIG \n\nchose to inform us. I am sure it was a hard choice, but I believe it \n\nwas the right one. If they had not done so, we would not have known of \n\nthe investigation of the sort which the Senate, in normal times, would \n\nhave given great weight to and not moved forward on.\n\n As DHS often tells us: If you see something, say something.\n\n\n\n The chairman also repeatedly faulted the OIG for refraining from \n\ninterviewing Mr. Mayorkas until the end of its investigation. This \n\nappears to be a criticism borne from a lack of experience and knowledge \n\nof the investigative process.\n\n Quoting:\n\n To my amazement, Director Mayorkas has never been contacted \n\n about this EB-5 investigation.\n\n Later he said:\n\n I cannot understand why they [OIG] have not talked to Mr. \n\n Mayorkas.\n\n It is common practice to investigate the central figure in an \n\ninvestigation closer to the end of an investigation after evidence has \n\nbeen reviewed and collected. There are many reasons for this practice. \n\nOne is that you do not know what to ask the subject until you have \n\ngathered all the information you can about his or her alleged \n\nmisconduct. Another is that it minimizes the impact of the \n\ninvestigation on the subject, which can be an understandable concern \n\nwhen investigating a busy top official such as our present nominee. \n\nEarly meetings can result in having to hold several interviews with the \n\nsame official, asking questions about topics or allegations which could \n\neventually be dismissed without their testimony by not identifying \n\nexculpatory evidence beforehand.\n\n While the scheduling for this interview was upsetting to the \n\nchairman, it should not be to Mr. Mayorkas. He is a seasoned prosecutor \n\nand familiar with the process of the investigations, and he knows what \n\nto expect.\n\n The chairman also claimed at the committee vote that the OIG has \n\nrepeatedly given him deadlines and had missed them. The chairman \n\ninferred that we could not trust their word on when this investigation \n\ncould be completed.\n\n Specifically he said: ``I was . . . informed that the investigation \n\nwas likely to conclude in October.''\n\n Later he claimed: ``We have no guarantee this investigation will \n\nsimply not drag on and on . . . it has already slipped several times.''\n\n Later he added:\n\n Each time we get an estimated timeline for completion, the \n\n date slips. First we were told October, then perhaps \n\n December. And as of last week, the IG said there were at \n\n least several months of work remaining.\n\n None of this is true. According to my office records of the \n\n\n\nconversations with the inspector general, we have no record or \n\nrecollection that the inspector general ever promised a date certain of \n\ncompletion in October. Neither do we have any record indicating the IG \n\nsuggested December. Unless the IG communicated to the chairman these \n\ndeadlines in the private conversations which he arranged without my \n\nknowledge or involvement, these statements appear to be simply false.\n\n I would also say I cannot imagine the chairman or staff would engage \n\nin a private conversation with the inspector general regarding a \n\nsensitive investigation into a political official. Such conversation \n\nwould be a breach not only of our practices but could raise ethical \n\nconcerns of exerting undue influence upon an official proceeding.\n\n I urge him to correct the Record or show us in detail the \n\nconversations where the IG made these points and promises.\n\n The chairman also stated this fact, and news outlets erroneously \n\nreported this inaccurate claim, that the investigation was being \n\nhandled by only one investigator and two assistants.\n\n His quote was: ``We learned that there is one investigator \n\nassigned,'' he claimed, ``one investigator and two research \n\nassistants.''\n\n This is not true. The OIG has told our staff the case has a lead \n\ninvestigator--and that is true, an absolute common practice for \n\ninvestigations and most investigative and sensitive endeavors--but they \n\nwere further told that the OIG had a rotating team of investigators, \n\nexperts, research assistants, and staff help on various aspects of the \n\ninvestigation. This is a common practice, assigning leads to individual \n\ninvestigations but sharing a larger pool of assistant investigative \n\nresources. It is followed, to a great extent, by our own Permanent \n\nSubcommittee on Investigations. I don't understand why the chairman's \n\ncharacterization would stray so far from the facts established in \n\nconversations involving both our staffs or from common sense.\n\n I am also disappointed that it characterized the investigation as \n\nhaving a ``lack of progress,'' which was ``unacceptable'' and ``unfair, \n\nnot just to Mr. Mayorkas but to a Department full of people who need \n\nleadership, and to a nation that is counting on the Department to help \n\nprotect them.''\n\n The truth is it is not uncommon for investigations of senior \n\nofficials to last a year or longer and is not a matter which should be \n\nrushed by anyone, certainly not the chairman of the authorizing \n\ncommittee.\n\n This is the kind of rhetoric which causes concern in some quarters \n\nthat the chairman and others are applying inappropriate pressure on an \n\nagency's internal processes and deliberation. Political pressure is \n\nsimply not helpful to anyone. In fact, it can actually hinder the \n\n\n\ninvestigation and weaken public acceptance for the findings, \n\nparticularly if they exonerate Mr. Mayorkas. People may allege, as they \n\nhave already, that the Office of Inspector General waters down and \n\nweakens its finding in response to political pressures such as this.\n\n If the OIG investigation results in a clean bill of health for Mr. \n\nMayorkas, how many Americans, how many DHS employees, will wonder if \n\nthe chairman's repeated disparaging remarks were indicative of a \n\npolitical pressure applied which improperly swayed the results? No one \n\nis served by his comments. What is more, they are not a reflection of \n\nthe shared concern he voiced with me in our joint correspondence to the \n\ninspector general. I simply do not understand why he would intervene in \n\nsuch a vocal, public way, which could cast doubt and suspicion on the \n\nresults of the investigation.\n\n The other thing about this vote is it is unfair to Mr. Mayorkas. I \n\nhave\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\ntalked a lot about process and the need to know the findings of the DHS \n\nOIG report before we vote on Mr. Mayorkas. But no one seems to \n\nunderstand just how unfair this vote is to the nominee. By pushing his \n\nnomination through both the committee and the full Senate, Senator \n\nCarper and Leader Reid have denied Mr. Mayorkas a chance to win \n\nbipartisan support.\n\n I have only voted against one nominee who has come through our \n\ncommittee, only 1 out of 20. I would like to be able to vote for Mr. \n\nMayorkas if, in fact, OIG shows him a clean bill. The reason it is sad \n\nthat he can't win bipartisan support is that under the new Senate rules \n\nit is possible for my colleagues to confirm him without a single \n\nRepublican vote. When they do that, they will be delivering to the \n\nDepartment a nominee who arrives with only his party's support, and he \n\nwill be trailed by a cloud of doubt and discontent.\n\n The allegations against Mr. Mayorkas relate mainly to his management \n\nof the EB-5 immigrant visa program in his role as Director of the U.S. \n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services. As I understand it, the \n\ninvestigation into Mr. Mayorkas began in an unconventional way by one \n\nperson speaking out after their heavily documented concerns were \n\ndismissed. To me, this only adds validity to the allegations.\n\n In the course of its investigation, the DHS OIG discovered other \n\nallegations of impropriety, including conflicts of interest, misuse of \n\nposition, mismanagement, and the appearance of impropriety. Those \n\nallegations could speak to a candidate's fitness for public service, \n\nespecially if he is not fully cleared to help lead the Department of \n\n\n\nHomeland Security. It is wholly unreasonable to ask Senators to endorse \n\nthe nominee's fitness for service until those questions are answered.\n\n In an attempt to discredit the investigation, some people have cited \n\nthe problems plaguing leadership in the DHS OIG office, the inspector \n\ngeneral in particular. In fact, the Financial and Contracting Oversight \n\nSubcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n\nAffairs is currently conducting and will release soon their bipartisan \n\ninvestigation into a number of allegations.\n\n While I agree those allegations surrounding OIG leadership are \n\ntroubling, the problems of one person do not invalidate the work done \n\nby an office of over 650 people. OIG work in every agency should be \n\ntaken seriously.\n\n In January of this year, Senator Carper joined me and members of the \n\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in sending a \n\nletter to President Obama urging him to fill the vacant inspector \n\ngeneral positions at a number of key agencies, including DHS. In that \n\nletter, we said, ``Inspectors general are an essential component of \n\ngovernment oversight.'' We do a disservice to that statement when we \n\npreclude the opportunity to, at a minimum, review the work done by the \n\nDHS OIG, draw our own conclusions, and then vote accordingly without \n\nall the facts before us.\n\n Even more concerning, by denigrating the open DHS OIG investigation, \n\nthe Senate is sending a message to other OIGs that their investigations \n\ndon't matter. Obviously, that is incredibly significant given our \n\ndependence on these watchdogs to oversee the huge government agencies \n\nand bureaucracies created by this body. We must respect and support the \n\nwork done by inspectors general. In my opinion, the damage being done \n\nto the DHS OIG and the respect of IGs throughout the government by \n\nholding this vote is far worse than any damage done by the office's \n\ncurrent leadership.\n\n The results of this investigation are not the only unknown regarding \n\nMr. Mayorkas's service as Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n\nServices. Despite a number of concerns regarding national security and \n\ncriminal vulnerabilities in the EB-5 program, we know the program \n\nexpanded drastically under the nominee's hand and we have not yet seen \n\nevidence that he pursued significant regulatory changes to address the \n\nweaknesses that were known.\n\n Two months ago I personally asked DHS and other agencies for an \n\nanswer on how the administration is dealing with the concerns, and I \n\nhave received no response as of yet. These include an October 18 letter \n\nin which I requested information from Acting Secretary Rand Beers on \n\nEB-5 national security concerns identified by the agency itself in a \n\ndraft report. I received no response.\n\n\n\n The same day, I also asked Acting ICE Director John Sandweg for the \n\nsame information. I received no response.\n\n I also requested information from National Security Adviser Susan \n\nRice regarding known national security concerns created by the EB-5 \n\nprogram. To date, I have received no response.\n\n Just last month, on November 1, Senator Grassley and I requested \n\ninformation from Acting Secretary Beers on how the agency is addressing \n\nthe known national security concerns with EB-5.

If you have any questions \n\n regarding this letter, please contact Tristan Leavitt of \n\n Ranking Member Grassley's staff or Keith Ashdown of Ranking \n\n Member Coburn's staff.\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Charles E. Grassley,\n\n Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n\n Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n\n\n\n Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n\n Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate.\n\n Mr. COBURN. Given that we are considering promoting Director Mayorkas \n\nto be second-in-command at DHS, it is appropriate that we consider how \n\nhe managed this program and whether he addressed criminal and national \n\nsecurity concerns, including exploitation of the EB-5 regional center \n\nprogram by terrorists, spies, and other threatening actors. These \n\nweaknesses were apparently the subject of repeated examinations by the \n\nadministration.\n\n I have repeatedly pressed the administration for more information \n\nregarding the weaknesses in the EB-5 program under Director Mayorkas \n\nand what actions it has taken to remedy those weaknesses. The chairman \n\nhas declined to join in this inquiry. Why is that? Why would the \n\nchairman decline to join in finding out the truth? I have not received \n\ndocuments or any of the information I have requested.\n\n At the same time there is no public record of steps Director Mayorkas \n\nhas taken to address EB-5 concerns. For example, to date, USCIS has \n\nfailed to promulgate any regulations shutting down regional centers \n\nbeing exploited by criminals or terrorists. This raises serious \n\nconcerns with me.\n\n When Congress created the EB-5 program in 1990, the goal was to \n\nstimulate\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\nthe U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign \n\ninvestors. To that end, the original program--called the basic \n\nimmigrant investor program--required immigrant investors to invest $1 \n\nmillion in a commercial enterprise that would create or preserve at \n\nleast 10 jobs. The investor was initially granted conditional permanent \n\nresidency, but after 2 years and proving the creation of 10 jobs, they \n\nwere eligible to become a permanent resident.\n\n In 1992 Congress authorized a second EB-5 pilot program allowing \n\nimmigrants to pool investments through DHS-approved regional centers. \n\nIn seeking approval from DHS, the regional center submits a proposal to \n\nDHS detailing how it plans to promote economic growth in that region. \n\nBy investing in a regional center, immigrant investors can take \n\nadvantage of relaxed job standards to measure both direct and indirect \n\njob creation. While direct jobs are actual identifiable jobs for \n\nqualified employees, indirect jobs are considered those created \n\ncollaterally by the investment.\n\n While the regional center program was set to expire at the end of \n\n2012, last September it was reauthorized for 3 more years. Despite \n\nknown national security concerns, no changes were made to the program \n\n\n\nby the Judiciary Committee.\n\n In total, over 25,000 people are currently in the United States \n\nthrough the EB-5 program. Since its inception, the EB-5 program has \n\nbeen plagued with wide-ranging problems. Mr. Mayorkas took over this \n\nprogram in 2009. There has been a notable expansion of the program \n\nsince he took it over. It now sees $3.3 billion passed from foreign \n\ninvestors in exchange for visas to reside in our country. Yet the \n\nserious security weaknesses have persisted, as well as alarm among \n\nsenior officials. These problems include the agency failing to \n\ndetermine if the program is meeting its basic goal of creating 10 jobs \n\nper investment and defrauding would-be immigrants with breaches of \n\nnational security with suspected terrorists using the program to enter \n\nthe United States.\n\n In 2012 the national security staff coordinated a review of the EB-5 \n\nregional center program by five agencies focused on vulnerabilities \n\nrelating to the financial flows and securities offerings that routinely \n\naccompany the investment component of the EB-5 program. That draft \n\nreport raised major concerns with the investments being made by EB-5 \n\ninvestors. For example, the investigation found one regional center \n\nfiled false documentation in an attempt to support the creation of \n\njobs. The same report also noted investments being made to a business \n\nthat never existed and could never exist, headed by an individual using \n\na pseudonym due to a criminal record of importing counterfeit products \n\ninto this country.\n\n The draft review noted the high risk that EB-5 program participants \n\nmay attempt to use the program as a tool or a channel for money \n\nlaundering, tax evasion, or other illicit financial activity. This type \n\nof activity was aided by the fact that known criminals are not \n\nstatutorily prohibited from owning, managing, or recruiting regional \n\ncenters. We just reauthorized that.\n\n This national security staff draft review also references another \n\ninteragency review looking at the national security threats associated \n\nwith the EB-5 program, stating that the vulnerabilities relating to \n\npossible infiltration by terrorist groups or foreign operatives are \n\nalso before the NSS and are being addressed by the interagency task \n\nforce.\n\n Understanding we have only seen a draft of the national security \n\nstaff's forensic audit and have not seen information about the \n\ninteragency review of possible infiltration by terrorist groups or \n\nforeign operatives, I wrote to Susan Rice, the National Security \n\nAdviser, on October 18 requesting that information. She has not \n\naddressed any concerns. She has not answered our letter.\n\n The Department of Homeland Security also conducted its own internal \n\n\n\nassessment of the EB-5 regional center program, examining criminal and \n\nnational security vulnerabilities. In response to an apparent tasking \n\nfrom DHS Secretary, ICE prepared a review of the program. Here are the \n\nvulnerabilities they noted and identified: export of sensitive \n\ntechnology, economic espionage; use by foreign government agents, \n\nespionage; use by terrorists; investment fraud by regional centers; \n\ninvestment fraud by investors in this country; fraud conspiracies by \n\ninvestors and regional centers; illicit finance and money laundering.\n\n The agency's own draft analysis makes clear that the EB-5 regional \n\ncenter program can be exploited by terrorists, criminals, and foreign \n\noperatives. Further, it identified regional centers as a means for \n\nfacilitating espionage at the highest levels by foreign governments. To \n\nthat end, the review by ICE proposed that the regional center program \n\nbe sunset--be done away with--because there can be no safeguards that \n\ncan be put in place that will ensure the integrity of the regional \n\ncenter model.\n\n As I stated before, I sought more information about DHS and ICE's \n\ninternal review of the EB-5 program. I wrote to Acting Secretary Beers \n\non October 18 requesting information about the findings of this review \n\nand what actions were taken in response. I have not yet received a \n\nresponse to my inquiry.\n\n Recently, we received a draft DHS OIG EB-5 regional center audit. It \n\nis my understanding that we are soon to get this final report. In the \n\ndraft, it includes the following statement: USCIS--under Secretary \n\nMayorkas--fails to ensure regional centers meet all program \n\nrequirements. USCIS--under the nominee, Mr. Mayorkas--inconsistently \n\napplies program regulations and policies. USCIS doesn't always properly \n\ndocument decisions and responses, giving the appearance the program is \n\nvulnerable to inappropriate influence.\n\n This is all under the guise of a nominee whom we will vote on late \n\ntonight.\n\n Since the program is so poorly run by USCIS, the draft DHS OIG \n\ndetermined USCIS is limited in its ability to prevent fraud or national \n\nsecurity threats that could harm the United States, nor could the \n\nagency see where the EB-5 program was improving the U.S. economy and \n\ncreating jobs for U.S. citizens, as intended by Congress. This draft \n\nreport also outlines a number of recommended actions for the Director.\n\n Last week Senator Carper asserted it was Congress's fault that the \n\nEB-5 program was susceptible to fraud and national security threats \n\nbecause it hadn't provided the proper statutory authority and that new \n\nstatutory authority which was included in S. 744, the immigration bill, \n\nwould have solved the problem. But the draft DHS OIG report makes clear \n\n\n\nthat under its existing authority, the agency has the ability to issue \n\nregulations to deny and even terminate regional centers identified as \n\nfraudulent or national security risks but has failed to do so.\n\n They also recommended that the Director provide USCIS with the \n\nauthority to deny and terminate EB-5 regional center participants at \n\nany phase of the process when known connections to national security or \n\nfraud risks are identified; that they should make explicit that fraud \n\nand national security concerns can constitute a cause for revocation; \n\nthat he should give USCIS the authority to verify that foreign funds \n\nwere invested in companies that create U.S. jobs and to ensure \n\nrequirements for the EB-5 regional center program are applied \n\nconsistently to all participants. None of these recommendations request \n\nany additional congressional authority; therefore, it is at least \n\narguable that the action could have been taken by Director Mayorkas to \n\nprevent national security vulnerabilities in the EB-5 program. That \n\nhasn't happened.\n\n The draft report also recommends that other corrective action should \n\nbe taken by Director Mayorkas as well.\n\n Since USCIS failed to properly apply its existing EB-5 policies and \n\nprocedures, DHS OIG recommended developing a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding with the Departments of Commerce, Labor, and the SEC ``to \n\nprovide expertise and involvement in the adjudication of applications \n\nand petitions for the EB-5 regional center program.''\n\n A third recommendation in the draft report related to the failure of \n\nthe agency to maintain any metric as to whether the program was \n\nactually achieving its intended purpose. The DHS OIG asserted that \n\nDirector Mayorkas should ``conduct comprehensive reviews to determine \n\nhow EB-5 funds have actually stimulated growth in the U.S. economy in \n\naccordance\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nwith the intent of the program.'' That hasn't been done.\n\n Finally, the draft report directs Mr. Mayorkas to ``ensure quality \n\nassurance steps to promote program integrity and ensure that Regional \n\nCenters comply with the Code of Federal Regulations.'' The implication \n\nthere is that they don't.\n\n All of these recommendations raise serious concerns about the way \n\nDirector Mayorkas was overseeing the EB-5 program and, in turn, should \n\nbe considered as a qualifying factor to determining his fitness to be \n\nsecond in command in charge at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n To summarize, we know the national security staff and the Department \n\nof Homeland Security conducted reviews of the investor visa programs \n\nMr. Mayorkas has been overseeing since 2009. These reviews found that \n\n\n\nthe program created a danger to national security--including the threat \n\nof exploitation by spies, criminals, and other national security \n\nthreats. I and others have asked for more information about the \n\npotential national security vulnerabilities in the EB-5 regional center \n\nprogram, and we have received no answers.\n\n What we do know is that Director Mayorkas dramatically expanded a \n\nprogram that the administration and even DHS itself apparently believes \n\nto be a threat to national security. And according to a draft report by \n\nthe inspector general, he did not take all of the actions which he \n\nshould have taken and which were at his disposal to fix these \n\nvulnerabilities and to make sure this visa program wasn't bringing \n\nspies, terrorists, or other terror threats into the country.\n\n Finally, I would say this vote is not fair to the Department of \n\nHomeland Security. DHS is the agency we trust to secure our borders, \n\nmake our skies safe, and to help our Nation protect us from terrorism. \n\nWe know the Department has faced many challenges and has often \n\nstruggled to execute its responsibilities over the past 10 years since \n\nits inception. And DHS has some of the lowest morale in the government.\n\n This week the Senate voted with strong bipartisan support to approve \n\nJeh Johnson's nomination to be Secretary of the DHS. I was proud to \n\nsupport his nomination. He is the kind of leader DHS needs to help it \n\naddress its many challenges and to fulfill its mission of making our \n\nNation safe. He needs a strong second-in-command in whom he and all \n\nemployees can have full confidence.\n\n It is this body's job to vet those leaders and ensure they are beyond \n\nreproach. With the cloud of this investigation and with many of our \n\nunanswered questions about Director Mayorkas's tenure as the Director \n\nof USCIS, we do not have full confidence that he should be in second \n\ncommand at DHS.\n\n By voting on him now, this body is sending the wrong message to all \n\nDHS employees. Right now, we cannot--let me repeat--we cannot determine \n\nwhether Mr. Mayorkas is fit or unfit for this important position.\n\n Finally, I would say this vote is not fair to the American people in \n\nconfirming a nominee for such an important position who has not been \n\nproperly vetted. The American public depends on us to fulfill our \n\nconstitutional mandate to properly advise the President on certain \n\nexecutive branch nominees. Here, we are not doing that. We are not \n\ndoing that. In fact, we are voting to install a nominee who could be \n\nseen as unfit to serve in the No. 2 position at DHS. Now, he may be \n\nfit, but this agency is tasked with protecting our country from \n\nterrorists. It is our responsibility to guarantee to the American \n\npublic that the leaders at DHS are beyond reproach.\n\n In this vote, Leader Reid is not only ignoring the rights of the \n\n\n\nminority but the longstanding precedent of the Senate. He is ignoring \n\nhistory, and he is inviting us all to do the same. But history has a \n\ndifficult way of teaching its lessons. It was long the purpose of the \n\nSenate's procedures to remember these lessons so the country does not \n\nhave to suffer such lessons again and again.\n\n My final comments are these: Those who are going to vote for Mr. \n\nMayorkas do so at the risk of not knowing what the investigation shows. \n\nThey also do so at the risk of obviating the oath they swore when they \n\ncame to this body: to fairly and appropriately evaluate their decisions \n\nabout advice and consent.\n\n My hope is that Mr. Mayorkas is cleared. But, unfortunately, he won't \n\nhave my vote and that of several of my colleagues because we don't have \n\nthe information with which to make that judgment.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will first acknowledge that at 11:15 \n\ntonight we are going to be voting on the National Defense Authorization \n\nAct. It is a must-pass bill, one which has passed prior to December 31 \n\nevery year for the last 53 years. So it is very significant, and I \n\nthink people are tired of hearing about it because they recognize the \n\nsignificance and the fact that it has to be done. So I am not going to \n\nsay anything about that.\n\n I originally came down to talk about the problems we are having in my \n\nState of Oklahoma. I have a long list of people from all throughout the \n\nState who have talked about their insurance being cancelled, the \n\nincrease in the deductibles and the cost of insurance, and about the \n\ncrisis we are facing in the State of Oklahoma with ObamaCare.\n\n Madam President, I will mention one thing which has been overlooked \n\nin this debate and which I have mentioned once before but a lot of \n\npeople have not recognized, and this has come from the leaders on the \n\nDemocrat side, including the President of the United States; that is, \n\nthe ultimate goal of ObamaCare would be a single-payer system. A \n\nsingle-payer system is socialized medicine.\n\n It is kind of interesting. I remember when we had Hillary health care \n\nback in the early 1990s, and we asked the question, if it doesn't work \n\nin Denmark, it doesn't work in Sweden, it doesn't work in Canada, it \n\ndoesn't work in the U.K., why would it work here? They never said it, \n\nbut they were thinking: If I were running it, it would work here. So \n\nthat is the ultimate goal.\n\n I will share a personal experience, and then I will yield to the rest \n\nof the Members who wish to talk about their States.\n\n I had a personal experience 2 months ago. I went in for a \n\ncolonoscopy, just a routine thing. After checking me and going through, \n\n\n\nthey said: I have good news and bad news.\n\n I said: All right. What is it?\n\n The good news is your colon is fine. The bad news is you are about to \n\ndie because you have 100 percent obstruction in two valves, 90 percent \n\nin two arteries and 75 percent in the other arteries.\n\n So I had as an emergency four bypasses at that moment.\n\n I say that because if I had been in the U.K., at my age there would \n\nbe a mandatory 6-month waiting period and I wouldn't be standing here \n\ntoday. If I had been in Canada, it is like 2 years. And I have heard \n\nour good friends, the doctors who are Members of the Senate, such as \n\nSenator Barrasso, talking about what is happening in these other \n\ncountries.\n\n A few minutes ago I was visiting with Jackie Davidson, who is \n\nscheduled for open heart surgery on Monday. I was talking about, quite \n\nfrankly, how it was much easier than I thought it was going to be. And \n\nthe same thing happened with my wife.\n\n But the point is that if you are in these countries, at a certain age \n\nit doesn't work. You are denied the opportunity to have surgery. So \n\nthat needs to be in the back of our minds as we talk about the current \n\nproblems we are having with ObamaCare and what the ultimate goal is.\n\n Lastly, I will say I have been contacted by two of my good friends \n\nwho are members of Parliament in the U.K., and they asked me this \n\nquestion: Why is it you and your country are now trying to adopt \n\nsomething that we are trying to get away from over here in the U.K.?\n\n So let's keep in mind there is one big overriding problem that, if we \n\ncave in now, we will be reaching.\n\n With that, I yield to my colleagues who wish to speak.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, a number of my colleagues have come down \n\nhere, and we have done so on a number of occasions because most of us\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\nare getting emails and phone calls and letters in our offices of real-\n\nworld, real-life experiences that people are having with ObamaCare. It \n\nis a reminder that the things we do here have real-world impacts across \n\nthe country.\n\n As someone who represents the State of South Dakota, I came down here \n\nand shared a number of stories of constituents of mine who have been \n\nadversely impacted in the form of higher premiums, canceled coverages, \n\nhigher deductibles--all doing great economic harm to the people in our \n\nrespective States.\n\n I will quickly share a note I received from a constituent in Rapid \n\nCity, SD.\n\n\n\n As my Congressional representative, you need to know how \n\n ObamaCare is harming my life and health care. My insurance \n\n company cancelled my policy. I am currently paying over $800 \n\n a month for a family of 4. To upgrade my policy I will be \n\n over $900 a month. If I sign up for ObamaCare, I would be \n\n paying over $2500 a month. I cannot think of any way this is \n\n considered affordable health care!\n\n This is just another of many examples that I have from my State of \n\nSouth Dakota and that my colleagues have to point out how this is \n\nflawed and the economic harm it is doing to the American people and why \n\nit is so important that we here in the Senate take steps to change it \n\nand do it soon, before it is too late.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, like the Senator from \n\nSouth Dakota, our office continues to get emails and phone calls and \n\ncontacts from our constituents.\n\n Tonight I would like to read an email received from David and Shannon \n\nMcKichan. They write:\n\n I am trying to contact you with very little left to do. My \n\n wife and I as of today received a notice that our health \n\n policy is going up from 389.00 per month to 1177.00 per \n\n month.\n\n That is a more than 200 percent increase.\n\n This is for the same level we have, which is an HSA policy, \n\n 5000.00 max out of pocket per year. This policy works for us \n\n as we are both self-employed small business owners. We have \n\n been hammered during the economic downturn and this is the \n\n straw that breaks the camel's back. We feel that our \n\n government is attacking us and we have nowhere to turn. We \n\n are both in our mid 50's and if things stay the same will be \n\n without health insurance. I have always provided for my own \n\n needs but this is making things impossible.\n\n Please advise what we are to do. Please fight for us and \n\n know we do not have a voice without you. I was a city council \n\n representative for 15 years and always fought for the working \n\n man but I now know that it is becoming a losing battle.\n\n This is just one example. Last week we were on the floor, and I read \n\na number of emails saying the same things:\n\n You need to understand how cheated we feel.\n\n This is not right.\n\n\n\n I cannot afford this.\n\n Why are we being forced to change to a plan that has \n\n benefits we don't need?\n\n Please help.\n\n Sir, I'm begging for your help.\n\n I'm feeling very upset & stressed.\n\n This is unfair and hurting working families.\n\n This law is hurting us, be our voice.\n\n We need your help.\n\n I guess we are the collateral damage?\n\n Why are they trying to destroy us in the process?\n\n We are scared.\n\n We are hearing the voice of the American people. We are hearing the \n\nvoice of Wisconsinites. The Senate must hear the voice of the American \n\npeople and act. The sooner the better.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, like my colleagues, and as I have done \n\nseveral times before, I come to the floor to share the voice of one of \n\nmany Iowans who have contacted me over the sticker shock that they are \n\nexperiencing under the Affordable Care Act. This time I quote a \n\nconstituent from Sioux County, IA, northwest Iowa. That constituent \n\nwrites:\n\n I am a pastor in rural Iowa and early this past summer, \n\n trusting naively in the integrity of our President's repeated \n\n promise that ``If you like your health insurance you can keep \n\n it. Period[,]'' I made a change in my policy, moving to a \n\n higher deductible to save the church money. Now I have been \n\n informed that because of that change, my policy is no longer \n\n grandfathered and therefore I will be forced out of it in a \n\n year and compelled to purchase a much more expense \n\n (un)Affordable Care Act-compliant policy.\n\n I am young, male, healthy, and will not qualify for any \n\n subsidy. In effect, because of legislation Democrats \n\n supported, my government is kicking me off from health \n\n coverage that I carefully researched, chose and like a lot--\n\n and is forcing me to buy coverage that I do not need at a \n\n price I scarcely can afford.\n\n And the Government has the audacity to resort to Orwellian \n\n doublespeak and call such a draconian policy the ``Affordable \n\n Care Act.''\n\n Please convey to your Democratic colleagues that I grew up \n\n\n\n on a dairy farm and now pastor a church of farmers. I am the \n\n epitome of middle class America that they claim to champion.\n\n This bill is unjust. It is based on lies to Americans like \n\n myself. It hurts real people, including the church I serve.\n\n I have done my job. I have shared this constituent's message with my \n\ncolleagues as he asked me to do. I hope they were listening.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues here on the floor \n\nto hear them tell stories that we are hearing from our constituents at \n\nhome. I saw the newspaper from the State of the Presiding Officer, the \n\nNew York Times, front-page story, ``Uninsured Skeptical of Health Care \n\nLaw in Poll.''\n\n This whole law was passed to try to deal with issues of the \n\nuninsured. This article on the front page of today's New York Times \n\nsays 53 percent of the uninsured disapprove of the law.\n\n Then they go through some of the numbers and it looks as though for \n\nthe same number of people who think they will be helped, an equal \n\nnumber of people who are uninsured think they will actually be hurt by \n\nthis law.\n\n Another headline, Wall Street Journal, ``Errors Continue to Plague \n\nHealth Site.'' But the health care Web site is just the tip of the \n\niceberg. Sure, there have been Web site failures, but the thing that is \n\nhurting Americans all around the country is the higher premiums the \n\nSenator from Iowa talked about, the canceled coverage the Senator from \n\nIowa talked about, people who cannot keep their doctor in spite of the \n\nPresident's promise, fraud and identity theft, and higher copays and \n\ndeductibles which we now know are actually going to be higher, after \n\nthe law has been passed, specifically for the bronze policies, than \n\nthey were all last year until the law came into effect.\n\n I would like to share a letter from a woman in Carbon County, WY, who \n\nwrites about the harmful effect of the health care law for her life and \n\nfor her health care.\n\n She says:\n\n I currently have health insurance through my husband's \n\n employer, but the reality is that the current health \n\n insurance that we have may not be available much longer. This \n\n is scary to me, since I recently did some insurance shopping \n\n\n\n for my mother.\n\n She said her mother is 63 years old and in good health. She said:\n\n I was only able to get two quotes. The cheapest quote was \n\n for $756 a month with a $6,000 deductible.\n\n So we see higher premiums and we see higher copays and deductibles.\n\n The prescription deductible for that particular plan was \n\n $500, and then the copay for prescriptions was still around \n\n $35. The other quote seemed like a better plan and had better \n\n co-pay on prescriptions, but that premium was $985 a month. \n\n And that is also with a $6,000 deductible. What the heck. Who \n\n can afford these kind of premiums? That is more than most \n\n mortgage payments.\n\n Yet the President of the United States said if you like your \n\ncoverage, you can keep your coverage; if you like your doctor, you can \n\nkeep your doctor.\n\n I went on national TV, talked with Bill Clinton a few days before the \n\nWeb site was opened, and he said it will be easier to use than Amazon, \n\ncheaper than your cell phone bill, and if you like your doctor, you can \n\nkeep your doctor.\n\n It is fascinating, the President was so clueless about his own law \n\nand here we are today, people suffering all around the country, and the \n\nPresident doing nothing about it.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n Mr. BURR. Madam President, I came to the floor last week and for 45 \n\nminutes I pulled this file out of my desk. It was my notes that I \n\ntalked about in 2009 about the Affordable Care Act before it became \n\nlaw. I talked about the increases that were projected in premiums and \n\ndeductibles. I talked about the networks that were changed, the doctors \n\nthat would not be available.\n\n I was not a prophet. I was reporting what people such as the Chief \n\nActuary\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\nat CMS were saying at the time. Hospitals were going to close, doctors \n\nwere not going to take patients under the new plan. More important, the \n\npremiums and deductibles were going to become unaffordable, not \n\naffordable. I am tonight going to read a letter from Donna Hulcher from \n\nClemmons, NC, right in the middle of the State.\n\n\n\n We own a small automotive repair shop and have had \n\n continuous health insurance coverage our entire life, either \n\n through our company or for the past several years on the \n\n individual market. We learned that our high deductible plan \n\n with an HSA was not grandfathered into the Affordable Care \n\n Act about 4 months ago. Of course at that time, no pricing \n\n was available. We were paying 679.00 per month, and felt that \n\n we were protected from catastrophic sickness/injury, and we \n\n liked the flexibility the HSA provided in meeting our other \n\n expenses like dental and optical. We checked with Blue Cross \n\n once the cost for the new silver plans they are mapping us to \n\n was available, and it is going to cost 1379 per month. What a \n\n shock to the system and I am not at all sure it has as much \n\n coverage as what we are losing. I am pretty much a deer in \n\n the headlights, not knowing where we are going to turn, \n\n afraid to get onto the ACA website and give my information \n\n because I don't trust its security. It is totally foreign to \n\n me to apply for government subsidies for something we have \n\n always paid for and never depended on the government to help \n\n us. This goes against everything we believe in as being hard \n\n working, independent people. There are problems with health \n\n care and with costs, no doubt but this is not making it more \n\n affordable and from what I am hearing, doctors are retiring \n\n early or not taking this new policy. I feel like I am \n\n spinning the wheels of my brain trying to find out what is \n\n the right way to go. This has pulled the rug from under our \n\n family!\n\n We are now within 3 days of what was the cutoff. We have now extended \n\nthe enrollment period to the end of March. But insurers are required, \n\nApril 1 to April 27 of 2014, to submit their pricing for 2015. I have \n\nheard the folks talk about this is only about 8 percent of the American \n\npeople that this applies to in 2014. In 2015 it is all of the American \n\npeople. It is big business, it is small business.\n\n You know what is going to happen when they price this product with no \n\nexperience of the risk pool this year. Prices are going to go up. \n\nDeductibles are going to go up. If you think it is unaffordable this \n\nyear, wait until you see what hits the 90 percent of the American \n\npeople in 2015.\n\n It is time for us to change this. It is time for us to fix it. It is \n\ntime for us to get an affordable health care policy in place in this \n\ncountry.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, as a result of ObamaCare, millions will \n\nbe forced to use money that they would have used to pay rent, help \n\ntheir children attend college, or invest in a business. Instead, they \n\nare going to have to use that money to pay for higher premiums and \n\nskyrocketing deductibles. Here is one such example from Huntsville, AR, \n\nwhich is in a congressional district which I used to represent when I \n\nwas in the House. This constituent writes about how he and his family \n\nmust have to take drastic steps to be able to afford the cost of \n\nObamaCare, not the least of which includes returning to work after \n\nretiring last year. The email reads:\n\n I have never before contacted a Senator until today. Sir, I \n\n am outraged about the ObamaCare issue and the Affordable Care \n\n Act. Because of recent developments over the affordable \n\n health care act, and the obvious problematic issues related \n\n to its operation, policy and implementation, we are selling \n\n two of our vehicles to save money.\n\n This is due to the direct impact of this legislation and \n\n due to the broken promises of President Barack Obama that \n\n have been repeated over and over to us for 3 years.\n\n We are also canceling our cable TV, and will save about \n\n $1,500 per year. We are cutting back on Internet, switching \n\n to save another $1,000 per year. We are Christmas shopping in \n\n January. Our purchase of a new vehicle is now delayed for \n\n another 3 years. Our planned vacation trips for 2014 and \n\n beyond are being pared back.\n\n This is the No. 1 issue I am hearing from Arkansans, the high cost, \n\nin some cases the unaffordable cost, of ObamaCare.\n\n It is interesting, as we hear other Members of the Senate come and \n\nread the same types of emails, the same types of letters that they are \n\ngetting, they all have the same thing--they are put in positions that \n\nare simply untenable. They simply do not have the money to afford the \n\nso-called new insurance that they needed as their old insurance was \n\ndropped from them.\n\n We need health care reform, but ObamaCare certainly is not the \n\nanswer. We need to transition the employer-based private insurance \n\nmarket toward one that allows for flexibility, choice, portability, and \n\nfairness. Let's allow small business owners to pool together to \n\npurchase group insurance, introduce portability into the market. These \n\nare things that we need to do, and continue--some of these things are \n\nactually in the Affordable Care Act. Yet the reality is we can do that \n\n\n\nwithout $1 trillion of increased taxes, and rapidly, because of the way \n\nthat the business community is responding, making us a nation of part-\n\ntime employees.\n\n We need to allow individuals to purchase insurance across State \n\nlines. We need to expand health savings accounts and flexible savings \n\naccounts. These are free market reforms that would drive down costs.\n\n The problem that we had prior to introducing the Affordable Care Act \n\nwas affordability. What has happened is, instead of driving down costs, \n\nwe have driven up costs dramatically because of the way the bill was \n\nstructured.\n\n We also need medical malpractice reform. I am an optometrist by \n\ntraining. I can tell you in the course of taking care of patients that \n\nthere are people all over the country who have to do things that are \n\nabove and beyond, sometimes, the things they believe they need to do in \n\norder to protect themselves. As a result, there are no ifs, ands, or \n\nbuts, that definitely drives costs.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I had not anticipated coming to the \n\nfloor tonight to talk about health care in this country, but I feel \n\ncompelled to do so after listening to a number of our colleagues share \n\nwith us letters and messages from folks whose lives have been adversely \n\naffected apparently because of changes made in the coverage of their \n\nhealth care through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n I regret any of the consequences that have been shared with us here \n\nthis evening. My hope is that we will find ways over the next coming \n\nweeks and months to address the kinds of concerns that have been \n\nraised.\n\n I just wish I heard some of that concern in past years as we prepared \n\nto take up the Affordable Care Act. As a member of the Finance \n\nCommittee, I wish I heard those kinds of concerns about the tens of \n\nmillions of people in this country who really don't have any health \n\ncare coverage tonight--some 40 million. For a lot of them, this health \n\ncare is a chance for them to go to the emergency room of a hospital. \n\nWhen they get really sick, they can be admitted to the hospital and get \n\nthe care they need. Without health care coverage, it is hugely \n\nexpensive ultimately for the rest of us because we pay for it. Where is \n\nthe outcry on behalf of those tens of millions of people?\n\n Where was the outcry 4 years ago when we had several million people \n\nwho signed up for the Medicare prescription drug program and found that \n\nwhen their purchases of prescription medicines reached a certain \n\nlevel--$3,000 or $4,000 a year--instead of Medicare paying 75 percent \n\nof the cost for their medicines beyond that in a year, Medicare paid \n\n\n\nnothing, which is known as the doughnut hole? A lot of people fell into \n\nit--a lot of older people fell into it--and they could not afford the \n\nmedicines they needed to stay well or stay out of the hospital. Where \n\nwas the outcry on behalf of fixing that problem?\n\n Where was the outcry on behalf of the millions of young people who \n\nwere dropped off of their parents' health insurance plans when they \n\naged out at 22? Where was the outcry in those cases?\n\n We have had Republican and Democratic Presidents who have had a \n\nchance for years--for decades to do something about the fact that we \n\nspend twice as much money for health care as the rest of the world but \n\ndon't necessarily get better results and don't cover everybody. \n\nFrankly, I didn't hear a lot of outcry from our friends on the other \n\nside of the aisle during all those years.\n\n As much as we feel for the people whose stories they shared with us \n\nhere tonight, I wish that same sympathy and empathy had been extended \n\nto some of the people who now don't fall into that doughnut hole when \n\ntheir\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\nprescription drugs exceed a certain amount during a year.\n\n Now we have people who are 22, 23, 24, 25 years old who don't age off \n\nof their parents' health care coverage. They are covered until their \n\n26th birthday.\n\n We will add to the number of people who have health care coverage. \n\nSomewhere between 5 and 10 million people will have health care \n\ncoverage either because they are able to qualify under the Medicaid \n\nProgram or because they will get coverage through one of our State \n\nexchanges across this Nation.\n\n Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? No. Are there problems with it? \n\nSure. Anything that is this big and this difficult to do, there will be \n\nproblems. I think the implementation of the startup in October and \n\nNovember was totally unacceptable. We are trying to work our way \n\nthrough it and provide the kind of access and explanation for this \n\ncoverage that people deserve, and eventually we will get this right.\n\n The outcry we now hear attributed to the implementation of the \n\nAffordable Care Act reminds me a lot of the outcry we heard--I want to \n\nsay 2006 and 2007--when we were beginning to implement the Medicare \n\nprescription drug program. To put it bluntly, it was a mess. People \n\nwere confused by it. The information technology didn't work. The \n\nheadlines in the newspaper looked a lot like the headlines in October \n\nand November and even now. But a year or two later, guess what. We \n\nfixed the program with everything but the doughnut hole. And now we \n\nfixed the doughnut hole--it started about 4 years ago--through the \n\n\n\nAffordable Care Act. People don't fall off that cliff anymore the way \n\nthey used to.\n\n So rather than simply criticizing the provisions of the Affordable \n\nCare Act that are troublesome or problematic, why don't we fix them? \n\nThat is what we did with the prescription drug program, Part D under \n\nMedicare, and that is what we should do here.\n\n I did not come here tonight to respond to our colleagues. I just felt \n\nsomebody needed to say something, and I am pleased I had that \n\nopportunity.\n\n Mayorkas Nomination\n\n Madam President, I rise tonight to speak again in strong support of \n\nthe nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to serve as the Deputy Secretary \n\nof the Department of Homeland Security. I spoke yesterday about \n\nDirector Mayorkas' impeccable credentials and experience that has \n\nprepared him for this important position. My colleague from Louisiana \n\nSenator Landrieu did the same yesterday.\n\n Today I would like to address some of the concerns about Director \n\nMayorkas that have been raised by our friends on the other side of the \n\naisle and seek to set the record straight.\n\n I understand that some of our Republican colleagues believe we cannot \n\nmove forward with consideration of Director Mayorkas' nomination until \n\nthe Office of Inspector General finishes its investigation that it \n\nbegan--get this--in September of 2012. There was an investigation as to \n\nhis management of the complex EB-5 program some 15 months ago.\n\n Well, I must say I disagree with my Republican colleagues. I think we \n\nhave waited long enough, and let me explain why.\n\n As I said before, the Department of Homeland Security has been \n\nwithout a Deputy Secretary since April of this year--8 full months--and \n\n6 months have passed since Director Mayorkas was nominated. For many of \n\nthose months, we did not have a Senate-confirmed Secretary of the \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n Three days before Mr. Mayorkas' confirmation hearing in July, \n\ninformation about the OIG investigation was leaked to Congress and the \n\nmedia in a highly irregular manner. The information that was leaked \n\nindicated that in September of 2012, the Office of Inspector General \n\nfor the Department of Homeland Security had received allegations about \n\nconflicts of interest, misuse of position, and an appearance of \n\nimpropriety by Director Mayorkas and other agency officials. We also \n\nnow know that the OIG did not actually begin investigating these \n\nallegations for almost 1 year after receiving them.\n\n Importantly, the OIG confirmed that this was not in any way a \n\ncriminal investigation. Let me say that again because some of our \n\n\n\nfriends on the other side of the aisle seem to be confused about this. \n\nThe OIG confirmed in July of this year and reconfirmed in December of \n\nthis year, earlier this month, that this is not and never has been a \n\ncriminal investigation.\n\n To my amazement, Director Mayorkas has never been contacted nor \n\ninterviewed by the OIG about this investigation. There was no phone \n\ncall, no letter, no email. There was nothing in 15 months. Director \n\nMayorkas only learned of this investigation after its existence had \n\nbeen leaked to the Congress in July, just days before our committee \n\nhearing on his nomination. Even then, Director Mayorkas ably and \n\nvigorously disputed the allegations in his interviews with committee \n\nmembers who would meet with him and staff who would meet with him as \n\nwell at his confirmation meeting in July.\n\n Unfortunately, rather than question the nominee about this matter and \n\ngive him a chance to refute these anonymous allegations, Republican \n\nmembers of our committee boycotted his confirmation hearing and have \n\nrefused to meet with Director Mayorkas to give him an opportunity to \n\nrespond to these allegations from people whose names and faces we don't \n\neven know.\n\n Senator Grassley said this week that Director Mayorkas has been given \n\na chance to defend himself and has ``utterly failed'' to respond to \n\nSenator Grassley's letters. On the contrary. Director Mayorkas did, in \n\nfact, respond to Senator Grassley's letters this past August 20. In \n\nfact, he would have gladly spoken with Senator Grassley or any other \n\nSenator, Democratic or Republican, about the allegations face to face. \n\nThat is the way we do things in Delaware. I can't imagine it is not the \n\nway we do things in other States.\n\n I am perplexed that an even better option--speaking to Director \n\nMayorkas himself--was not taken advantage of by Senator Grassley. In \n\nfact, I offered to fly to Iowa with Director Mayorkas in August to meet \n\nwith Senator Grassley face to face so that Senator Grassley could have \n\nhis questions answered face to face, but, sadly, Senator Grassley \n\ndeclined.\n\n So I think the record shows that Director Mayorkas has been eager to \n\nmeet with Senators on both sides of the aisle to answer their \n\nquestions--not to duck them but to answer them. But our colleagues on \n\nthe other side of the aisle have been unwilling to give him what seems \n\nto me should be a common courtesy.\n\n Again, we are not talking about a criminal investigation. We are \n\ntalking about the mismanagement of a program and allegations brought by \n\npeople whom, again, my staff has never been able to interview.\n\n Getting back to the OIG investigation, of course, in a perfect world, \n\nI would prefer that it be completed before moving forward. At one \n\n\n\npoint, I thought it would be.\n\n First, let me make it clear to all that there is nothing improper \n\nabout the chairman of a committee asking for an update on the status of \n\na pending investigation. There is nothing improper about that. \n\nAccordingly, in July Dr. Coburn joined me in inquiring about the status \n\nof this investigation. I was told it would be completed in October. \n\nAgain, this investigation started a year earlier--in September of 2012.\n\n In October of this year, I inquired again about the status and was \n\ntold it would be completed in December.\n\n On December 2 a bipartisan group of committee staff participated in a \n\ntelephone call with the head of investigations at the Office of \n\nInspector General at the Department of Homeland Security to receive a \n\nstatus update. They were told it would likely take 2 or 3 more months \n\nto complete the investigation. In fact, every time we have spoken with \n\nthe IG staff, we have been told they are just 2 or 3 months away from \n\ncompleting an investigation that began some 15 months ago.\n\n I respect that the OIG must do its job, but we have to do our job \n\ntoo, and the President has to do his job. We cannot wait another 2 \n\nmonths--every other month--especially for a position as critical as \n\nthis one.\n\n Lest we forget, the Department of Homeland Security is charged with \n\nhelping to protect our Nation and its citizens from all kinds of \n\nattacks, foreign and domestic--terrorists from abroad, homegrown \n\nterrorists from within--securing our borders, our aircraft, you name \n\nit. They respond to all kinds of natural disasters whether they\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\nhappen to be hurricanes or tornadoes. There is a lot going on. It is a \n\nbusy and tough neighborhood to run and manage, and we need confirmed \n\nleadership.\n\n I thank our Democrat and Republican colleagues for their vote earlier \n\nthis week on behalf of Jeh Johnson to become Secretary of the \n\nDepartment. He needs a team, and he needs a team that includes \n\nAlejandro Mayorkas.\n\n During the call I mentioned a little bit ago with the bipartisan \n\ncommittee staff in December of this month and trying to find out the \n\nstatus of the investigation, the OIG confirmed that to date they found \n\nno evidence of criminal wrongdoing by anybody at DHS, including \n\nDirector Mayorkas. That is right, no evidence, none, nada.\n\n Given that the investigation appears to be months away from \n\nconclusion and that its completion date has already slipped several \n\ntimes and given the confirmation by the OIG that there is no evidence \n\nof criminal wrongdoing, I believe it is time to move forward. In fact, \n\n\n\nit is past time to move forward.\n\n The allegations that have been made public cluster around Director \n\nMayorkas' administration of the EB-5 visa program. It is an extremely \n\ncomplicated program that provides foreign investors an opportunity to \n\nimmigrate to the United States in exchange for significant investments \n\nin job-creating enterprises right here in America. The Department of \n\nHomeland Security OIG just completed an audit of this program, as a \n\nmatter of fact, but I will get to that in a little bit.\n\n The primary complaint about Director Mayorkas concerns an EB-5 \n\nrelated application by Gulf Coast Funds Management, the regional center \n\nwhich has ties to Virginia Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe.\n\n Anonymous sources have reportedly alleged that Director Mayorkas \n\nimproperly intervened to help change a draft legal decision so it would \n\ncome out in favor of Chairman McAuliffe's former company, Greentech \n\nAutomotive.\n\n First of all, I think it is important for everybody to understand \n\nupfront that Greentech Automotive did not get what they wanted. Let me \n\nsay that again. The final decision in this case did not come out in \n\nGreentech Automotive's favor, from the agency run by Director Mayorkas.\n\n Second, it is important to note that the author of the Greentech \n\ndecision, the former head of the Administrative Appeals Office at the \n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mr. Perry Rhew, told my \n\nstaff last week that he strongly disputed the allegation that Director \n\nMayorkas had inappropriately influenced his decision.\n\n Many of the other allegations that have been made public about the \n\nDirector's management of the EB-5 program contend that applications \n\nappear to have been processed without regard to security concerns. \n\nHowever, in reviewing the leaked emails that were attached to these \n\naccusations, Director Mayorkas actually says the exact opposite.\n\n I found this disconnect between the allegations and the emails \n\npresented as evidence so striking that I am going to read exactly--I \n\nwant my colleagues to hear exactly what Director Mayorkas said in this \n\nemail to support his contention on January 30 of this year concerning \n\nhis application for a regional center in Las Vegas. This is what he \n\nsaid:\n\n We will take the time needed to resolve the security issue \n\n and we will not act until we have achieved resolution. I \n\n agree that we need to run enhanced security and integrity \n\n checks.\n\n This email directly refutes the claim that Director Mayorkas was \n\npushing to expedite applications despite the security concerns raised \n\n\n\nby his subordinates.\n\n In another email attached to one of the letters making accusations \n\nagainst Director Mayorkas, he forwards a question about Mr. McAuliffe's \n\ncompany to subordinates and he notes--this is how he does it: He says--\n\nMr. Mayorkas' words:\n\n I want to make sure that we are providing customer service \n\n consistent with our standards, but that we are not providing \n\n any preferential treatment.\n\n I would ask: Are these the actions of someone who is trying to exert \n\nimproper influence or subvert security checks? I think any fair-minded \n\nperson would agree the answer is no. No. Even our committee's ranking \n\nmember, my friend, Dr. Coburn, indicated that the allegations against \n\nMr. Mayorkas, although serious, are most likely not grounded in \n\nreality. I don't want to mince his words, so I will quote him directly. \n\nIn reference to the allegations against Mr. Mayorkas, Dr. Coburn said \n\nin a committee meeting--again, this is a quote: ``I doubt they are \n\ntrue, but we do not have the facts.''\n\n I agree with Dr. Coburn. We don't have any facts pointing to any sort \n\nof wrongdoing by Director Mayorkas at all, as best I can tell. None of \n\nthe anonymous sources or so-called whistleblowers have presented \n\ninformation to the majority regarding their concerns, something I think \n\nis unprecedented in these types of circumstances for our committee. We \n\nhave been unable to question those bringing these anonymous concerns on \n\nthe majority side, and our Republican friends on the committee--and \n\nmaybe largely in the Senate--have refused to talk to the accused, and \n\nhe has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. That doesn't add up \n\nto me. Maybe it does to some people. That just doesn't add up. We don't \n\nget to talk to the people who raised these concerns and our Republican \n\nfriends won't talk to the accused who has not been accused of any \n\ncriminal wrongdoing.\n\n On the one hand, we have over 30 people from both sides of the aisle \n\nwho are well-known and hugely respected citizens who have gone on the \n\nrecord with glowing support for Director Mayorkas. On the other hand, \n\nnot one person--not one--has stepped forward publicly opposing Director \n\nMayorkas.\n\n Some of the people who have written in strong support of Director \n\nMayorkas include the last Deputy Secretary of the Department of \n\nHomeland Security, Jane Holl Lute; the last Senate-confirmed inspector \n\ngeneral of the Department of Homeland Security, Richard Skinner, who is \n\na Bush appointee; and the three most senior border security officials \n\nin the George W. Bush administration, Robert Bonner, Al Ralph Basham, \n\nand Jason Ayhern.\n\n\n\n The fact is that Director Mayorkas has been proactively addressing \n\nnational security and fraud concerns in the EB-5 program for years. \n\nSoon after being confirmed, he took a number of administrative and \n\noperational steps to address national security concerns. Where he \n\nlacked the administrative authority to improve the EB-5 program, he \n\nrepeatedly appealed to Congress for the legislative authority he \n\nneeded.\n\n Unfortunately, Congress dealt Director Mayorkas and his entire agency \n\na bad hand when we authorized the EB-5 program in 2012. We failed--we \n\nfailed--to give the agency any of the legal authorities that Director \n\nMayorkas and his team at CIS had specifically requested in order to \n\nenable them--and they just requested in 2012, made a request--in order \n\nto enable them to address the national security and fraud \n\nvulnerabilities they could not address on their own. It said: Congress, \n\nwe would like to do this. We need the authority; please give it to us. \n\nThey started asking for that in June of 2012.\n\n Earlier this year, during the Judiciary Committee's debate on S. 744, \n\nthe immigration reform bill, Senator Leahy introduced an amendment that \n\nmade virtually all the national security fixes that Director Mayorkas \n\nhad requested. While the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed \n\nthe Senate with strong bipartisan support, it is unfortunately stalled \n\nin the House.\n\n Fortunately, Senate Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy is working on a \n\nstand-alone bill to address these national security and fraud concerns, \n\nmuch of what Director Mayorkas and his team asked for in June a year \n\nago. I urge all of my colleagues concerned about security issues in the \n\nprogram to join me as a cosponsor of that bill.\n\n It strikes me as grossly unfair to punish Director Mayorkas for the \n\ninability of Congress to address the vulnerabilities in the EB-5 \n\nprogram that Director Mayorkas and his team brought to our attention \n\nand asked us to fix over a year and a half ago. In essence, those of us \n\nin Congress failed to do our job. Yet Director Mayorkas is taking the \n\nfall for our failure. How is that fair? I will tell my colleagues: It \n\nis not.\n\n I mentioned previously that the OIG completed an EB-5 audit, and \n\nalthough that report has not been publicly released yet, some of my \n\ncolleagues have\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\nbeen discussing the OIG's findings earlier today. In light of that, I \n\nthink this is a good time to get some facts straight because this \n\naudit, remarkably, misses some key facts.\n\n\n\n First of all, the report says the EB-5 program is vulnerable to fraud \n\nand national security risks and that the legislation that created the \n\nprogram makes it difficult to fully address those risks. That is \n\nsomething that has been well-known by Congress and the administration \n\nlong before this report and long before Director Mayorkas took over the \n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in August of 2009. The emails \n\nI just discussed demonstrate that Director Mayorkas did not take \n\nnational security and fraud matters lightly. In fact, a review of the \n\nlegislative history of the last year and a half might suggest that we \n\ntake them lightly.\n\n Despite the widespread knowledge about the national security and \n\nfraud vulnerabilities in the EB-5 program--and all visa programs, for \n\nthat matter--CIS did not and does not have the authority that it asked \n\nCongress for in order to adequately police regional centers and the EB-\n\n5 program. I find it incredible that the OIG audit report makes no \n\nmention of Director Mayorkas' efforts to get Congress to pass \n\nlegislation to address this problem since June of 2012.\n\n In the absence of being granted those authorities by Congress, \n\nDirector Mayorkas took it on himself to implement other reforms. Yet \n\nmany of these reforms took place before or during this audit--and yet, \n\nincredibly, those reforms are not even mentioned in the audit report.\n\n One of his first actions as the Director was to elevate the Fraud \n\nDetection and National Security Office to a director reporting directly \n\nto Mr. Mayorkas. This ensured that national security professionals had \n\na seat at the management table and a voice in all major decisions.\n\n He expanded reporting requirements and security checks for regional \n\ncenters, which led CIS to increase the number of national security \n\ninvestigations in the EB-5 program by more than 50 percent in the last \n\n4 years.\n\n He increased EB-5 staffing from 9 people in 2009 to more than 80 \n\ntoday, and hired senior economists and national security officers to \n\nwork side by side with immigration specialists.\n\n He positively engaged other agencies such as the Securities and \n\nExchange Commission, the FBI, and the Treasury Department to help \n\npolice the program. In fact, Senator Grassley himself noted this week \n\nthat Director Mayorkas convened a national security staff working group \n\nto examine the problem last year.\n\n The actions I have described are not the actions taken by someone who \n\ndoes not care about national security.\n\n The audit report says the EB-5 adjudication process is ambiguous. CIS \n\nhas recognized there was a need for a consolidated adjudication manual \n\nand they published one in May of this year--one more fact that was not \n\n\n\neven mentioned in the audit report.\n\n The audit report says the program is fraught with the perception of \n\noutside influence. There is no denying the fact that this program gets \n\na lot of attention, including from us--from Congress. In fact, the \n\nUSCIS receives 1,500 queries about the EB-5 program each year from \n\nCongress, from Senators, from U.S. Representatives--1,500. As it turns \n\nout, almost half of our Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle \n\nhave inquired about the EB-5 program since 2009. That is an enormous \n\namount of interest from Congress in this one program. In many cases--\n\nmost cases--that interest was provided or demonstrated to CIS on behalf \n\nof our constituents, from States from one corner of America to the \n\nother.\n\n But let me be clear: The fact that this program garners a lot of \n\nattention from a lot of Members of Congress and a number of high-level \n\nofficials from all parties about the frequency and status of pending \n\napplications does not mean that the Citizenship and Immigration \n\nServices adjudicators are swayed by the attention. Perception is not \n\nalways reality. Contrary to what some have suggested or assumed, the \n\nOIG reported that all the files they reviewed in their audit--including \n\nthe ones associated with Terry McAuliffe's company--appear to support \n\nthe final decision.\n\n Let me say that again. The OIG audit concluded that the evidence it \n\nreviewed in these cases supported the final decision.\n\n Based on the evidence we have before us, I believe it is clear that \n\nDirector Mayorkas has taken strong steps to improve the EB-5 program. \n\nThese are the actions of a dedicated, thoughtful, and committed public \n\nservant. They are the actions of a leader who is willing to make tough \n\nbut necessary decisions in order to shake things up and improve a \n\nprogram that needed improving. That is exactly the kind of leadership \n\nwe need at the Department of Homeland Security. I think we need it \n\nacross the Federal Government.\n\n I also believe we need leaders who are committed to doing what they \n\nbelieve in their heart is the right thing to do. At his confirmation \n\nhearing in July, I specifically asked Director Mayorkas about the \n\nallegations raised by some of these anonymous sources. Director \n\nMayorkas testified before this committee under oath that he has never \n\nput his finger on the scale of justice, and I have seen no evidence \n\nsince then that would lead me to question his veracity.\n\n I do not believe that we can allow rumors spread by anonymous sources \n\nto rule the day.\n\n Some of our colleagues have been very critical of DHS shortcomings \n\nand they are quick to point out its failures. However, one of the major \n\nreasons the Department fails to live up to expectations more than they \n\n\n\nand the rest of us might like is because their top leadership ranks \n\nhave been riddled with vacancies for much of this year, and the same is \n\ntrue of many other agencies. Again, it is not fair to criticize the \n\nagency on the one hand and yet seem content on the other to leave them \n\nwithout Senate-confirmed leadership for months on end. We can't have it \n\nboth ways. We have some responsibility here as well.\n\n It is time to stop playing political games. It is time to vote to \n\nconfirm Ali Mayorkas for the Deputy Secretary position at DHS.\n\n There is something else that came to my attention today that I \n\nthought was interesting. It is not from an anonymous source. It is not \n\nrumor or innuendo. It is actually a report from the Partnership for \n\nPublic Service. One of the things they do at the partnership is issue, \n\nI think maybe on an annual basis, the rankings of the best places to \n\nwork in the Federal Government in 2013 and, as it turns out, also maybe \n\nthe worst, because they do a ranking from top to bottom.\n\n I was dismayed to find out this week that the Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity ranked last--ranked last--on their list of Cabinet Departments \n\nin terms of employee morale--last. It is not the first year. It has \n\nhappened for a number of years in a row. However, although the \n\nDepartment ranked last among all the Departments, the U.S. Citizenship \n\nand Immigration Services, led by Director Mayorkas, was one of the \n\nhighest ranked components within DHS, coming in at, I think out of 300 \n\nFederal agencies, No. 76, which, if my math is good, that puts them in \n\nmaybe the top 25 percent of all agencies.\n\n After Mr. Mayorkas took over in 2009, employee satisfaction with \n\nsenior leadership there increased by over 20 percent. It has increased \n\nby over 20 percent since he took over in 2009.\n\n Every now and then, in driving on my way to the train station in \n\nWilmington to catch a train to come down here to start our day, I \n\nlisten to the news. Usually I arrive at 7 o'clock. About a year ago I \n\nheard a report on NPR of an international study that was done involving \n\nthousands of people across the country. In the international study, \n\nthey asked the same question of thousands of people from all walks of \n\nlife with different kinds of jobs in different locations. The question \n\nthat was asked of each of those thousands of people was, what is it \n\nabout your job that you like? What is it about your job that you like \n\nthe most? Not surprisingly, those people who were asked the question \n\nhad different responses. Some people said they liked getting paid. Some \n\npeople said they liked getting a pension. Some people said they liked \n\nhaving a vacation or having health care. Some people said they liked \n\nthe environment in which they worked. Some people said they liked the \n\nfolks they work with. But do you know what most people said? Most \n\npeople said the thing they like most about their job is they\n\n\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\nfelt the work they were doing was important and they felt they were \n\nmaking progress. Think about that. The reason most people cite for \n\nliking their job, the work they do, is because they know it is \n\nimportant and they feel they are making progress.\n\n It is ironic to me--if you rely on the anonymous sources the majority \n\nside has not been permitted to talk with, it is ironic to me that in a \n\ndepartment where morale has been low and a problem and a concern for \n\nyears, at this agency that Mr. Mayorkas has led now for 4 years, \n\nemployee morale is, by comparison, fairly high. He does not get any \n\ncredit for that. But if employees really do care that the work they are \n\ndoing is important and they are making progress, maybe that belief is \n\nreflected in these numbers. Maybe that is reflected in these numbers on \n\nbehalf of the leadership that Mr. Mayorkas has provided for Citizenship \n\nand Immigration Services.\n\n Let me close, if I could. My friend from Kansas has arrived.\n\n There are a couple things I want us to keep in mind. This is one that \n\nis hard for me to understand. People whom we do not know, whom we on \n\nthe majority side have not talked to and have not had an opportunity to \n\nhear from to hear their story--it is maybe unprecedented for that \n\nopportunity to be denied the majority or for the majority to deny that \n\nto the minority in a case like this. We have been denied that \n\nopportunity.\n\n I think the person who is maybe best able to provide or to rebut or \n\nto respond to concerns that have been raised by these anonymous folks \n\nwhom we have not been able to talk to is Mr. Mayorkas himself, but our \n\nRepublican colleagues have refused to talk to him. Even though there is \n\nno evidence of criminal wrongdoing, they refuse to talk to him to give \n\nhim a chance to rebut or to respond to the accusations from anonymous \n\nsources we have never heard from. That one just blows my mind.\n\n If the shoe were on the other foot, if Democrats were in the minority \n\nand Republicans were in the majority, if I were the ranking member on \n\nthe minority side and we had a Republican President who nominated \n\nsomebody for office and the chairman of our committee asked me as the \n\nranking minority member to meet with someone whom the Republican \n\nPresident had nominated, I would meet with them in a heartbeat. I would \n\nwant to hear that person's story. That is what I would want to hear.\n\n If the anonymous sources were talking just to us, I would encourage \n\nthem to talk to the other side as well.\n\n By the way, the one person we did talk to--and we got this person, \n\nMr. Rhew--I think we got his name out of a statement given by Senator \n\nGrassley on the floor. We talked to him. He set the record straight. He \n\n\n\nset the record straight. I have already cited that in my comments. But \n\nwe have never had the chance to talk to any other, I think, half a \n\ndozen or so sources.\n\n The other thing I would say is that there is nothing inappropriate \n\nabout the staff of a committee chairman inquiring of an OIG about the \n\npace and the resources provided to conduct an investigation. This is \n\njust not any Department that has lacked Senate-confirmed leadership \n\nfrom us; this is the Department of Homeland Security. Americans have a \n\nlot riding on that Department doing their job well. They need senior \n\nleadership, and they have not had the kind they need.\n\n But despite the repeated efforts to get the OIG to expedite their \n\nefforts, begun in September 2012--a joint letter from Dr. Coburn and me \n\nto the OIG in July of this year; 2 months later, get a response that, \n\noh, maybe we will have something in October. Two months later, it is \n\nDecember, and bipartisan staff--Democratic, Republican; majority, \n\nminority--have a chance to be briefed by the OIG, and rather than say, \n\nwell, this investigation we started 15 months ago is done, is ready to \n\nwrap up, they say, a couple more months, maybe 2 or 3 more months.\n\n Are we supposed to continue to wait? We have the leadership we need \n\nat the Department of Homeland Security. At some point you just say: \n\nEnough already.\n\n What we have learned is that in terms of full-time people working on \n\nthis--I think there are about 650 full-time equivalent people at the \n\nOffice of Inspector General at DHS, about 650, and as I understand it, \n\n3 full-time people--1 investigator and 2 research assistants--have been \n\ndevoted to this investigation. No wonder it is taking 15 months.\n\n I would ask us to keep in mind our failure--our failure--to act on \n\nthe recommendations made to Congress for reforms in the EB-5 program to \n\naddress national security concerns and to address concerns about fraud.\n\n Mr. Mayorkas did the right thing. He and his staff pulled together a \n\nlong list of changes they need, legislative changes they need so they \n\nwould be authorized to address his concern. We dropped the ball. We did \n\nnot include those changes when we reauthorized the EB-5 program for 3 \n\nmore years--a straight reauthorization. We did not make any reforms. We \n\ndid not make any changes despite the fact that he had suggested them \n\nmonths before we acted.\n\n Finally, those changes ended up in the immigration bill. We passed it \n\nhere. Most Democrats voted for it, some Republicans. It is over in the \n\nHouse. It is languishing and not moving. If we are really concerned \n\nabout giving this agency, CIS, the tools they need, the authority they \n\nneed to address these security concerns, fraud concerns, why don't we \n\njoin Senator Leahy in the legislation he is going to introduce that \n\n\n\nlargely is taken from the immigration reform bill? When he introduces \n\nit, let's cosponsor that bill.\n\n Finally, if we are going to accept as gospel criticism about the way \n\na person has run a particular agency--and not of a criminal nature but \n\ncriticisms about the way it has been run--why not give that person a \n\nchance to defend himself? Why not give him a chance to say: Well, there \n\nis another side to this story or maybe there is not, but at least give \n\nhim that opportunity.\n\n Lastly, the morale at the Department of Homeland Security--they do \n\nsome great work, important work, the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nAnd they do a lot better work. I will mention a couple things, if I \n\ncan.\n\n Remember the response of FEMA, which is part of the Department of \n\nHomeland Security? Remember their response to Katrina? It was \n\ndeplorable. How about the response of FEMA to Hurricane Sandy? All \n\naround--for the most part, all around kudos were won.\n\n How about TSA? TSA has been a whipping boy for a lot of folks. All of \n\nus who have the opportunity to fly commercially, we have seen TSA make \n\nchanges. They have taken criticism they have taken to heart. Among \n\nother things, they have created the Trusted Traveler Program so a lot \n\nof people do not have to take off their shoes or their belts or do all \n\nkinds of things to get through a security check. The TSA has done a \n\nnumber of things. Some of the technology they are using is not \n\nintrusive, as it was before. Security is actually strong.\n\n For 10 years, our friends at GAO, the Government Accountability \n\nOffice, have, every 2 years, on their high-risk list at the beginning \n\nof every Congress, cited that the Department of Homeland Security needs \n\nto be able to earn a clean financial audit of its books. They said: 10 \n\nyears; that is enough time.\n\n Well, it turns out the Department of Defense, which has been around \n\nfor, gosh, about 70 years--over 60 years--is still not auditable. The \n\nDepartment of Defense is not auditable, much less to have a clean \n\naudit.\n\n Last week the Department of Homeland Security, for the first time in \n\ntheir existence, received a clean financial audit. They did it in 10 \n\nyears. DOD, also a big operation--it is 60 years and counting, and they \n\nare not even audited yet.\n\n So for those who want to constantly criticize the Department of \n\nHomeland Security, I would just say that the people who work there work \n\nhard. They have tough jobs. They need our help. One of the things they \n\nneed our help in doing is securing the kind of leadership they have not \n\nhad, and that is Senate-confirmed leadership.\n\n We have had some very good people who have been acting as the \n\n\n\nSecretary, acting as the Deputy Secretary, but, friends, it is not the \n\nsame. They need leadership that is going to be there with not just the \n\nblessing of the President but the blessing of this body and that is \n\ngoing to be there today, tomorrow, next month, next year, and provide \n\nthe leadership that is needed.\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\n The most important element I have ever seen in my time in the Navy--\n\n23 years Active and Reserve--my time as Governor, my time here in the \n\nSenate, the most important element I have ever seen in any organization \n\nto determine whether it is going to be successful is leadership. Show \n\nme a school with a great principal, I will show you a school that is on \n\nthe way up. I do not care how ineffective the teachers might be, I will \n\nshow you a school that is on its way up. Show me a business with a \n\nstrong leader, and the same thing is true. Show me a body like this or \n\na military unit, leadership is always the key. And it is the key at the \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n If the improvement that I have noted, that I mentioned here just a \n\nminute ago, is to continue and actually be strengthened, they need \n\nSenate-confirmed leadership. We will have the opportunity in a couple \n\nof hours to give Jeh Johnson, the newly confirmed Secretary of Homeland \n\nSecurity, a key player in the leadership team that he is trying to \n\nbuild at that Department. He deserves our support, and so do the people \n\nat that Department. And if they get it, they will provide the support \n\nwe need in this country to be safer in the days ahead.\n\n With that, Madam President, I thank you for allowing me to give this \n\nstatement.\n\n I see my friend from Kansas on the floor. I thank him for his \n\npatience, and I am happy to yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n Fallen Fort Riley Soldiers\n\n Mr. MORAN. Madam President, CWO2 Joshua B. Silverman, age 35, \n\nScottsdale, AZ; SGT Peter C. Bohler, age 29, Willow Spring, NC; SPC \n\nTerry K.D. Gordon, age 22, Shubuta, MS; SFC Omar W. Forde, age 28, \n\nMarietta, GA; CWO2 Randy L. Billings, age 34, Heavener, OK; SSG Jesse \n\nL. Williams, age 30, Elkhart, IN are names of soldiers who lost their \n\nlives this past week. They lost their lives in a helicopter incident in \n\nAfghanistan, and five of those soldiers were from my home State based \n\nat Fort Riley, KS--the Big Red One.\n\n Our Nation is forever indebted to these young men for their service \n\n\n\nand their sacrifice. This evening I ask the Senate to pay tribute to \n\nthese six soldiers who, in serving their country, lost their lives. If \n\nwe here in Washington, DC, need a reminder about our responsibilities, \n\nwe need only look to our service men and women who, for no partisan \n\nreason--nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats--volunteer to serve \n\ntheir country, and recognize there are things much more important than \n\neven life itself.\n\n These soldiers were committed to preserving the freedoms and \n\nliberties guaranteed Americans by our Constitution, and they sacrificed \n\ntheir lives every day to make certain Americans have the opportunity to \n\npursue the American dream.\n\n I once heard a hymn that has stayed with me ever since the first time \n\nI heard it. It was sung at the funeral service of President Reagan. It \n\nis called ``Mansions of the Lord.'' It was performed by the U.S. Armed \n\nForces Chorus at the National Cathedral here in Washington. The words \n\nof that hymn are these:\n\n To fallen soldiers let us sing\n\n Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing\n\n Our broken brothers let us bring\n\n To the mansions of the Lord\n\n No more bleeding, no more fight\n\n No prayers pleading through the night\n\n Just divine embrace, eternal light\n\n In the mansions of the Lord\n\n Where no mothers cry and no children weep\n\n We will stand and guard though the angels sleep\n\n Through the ages safely keep\n\n The mansions of the Lord\n\n We honor these six soldiers who this week were welcomed into the \n\nmansions of the Lord.\n\n I am grateful for the blessings these brave men afforded us with \n\ntheir service to our country, and we thank God for giving us these \n\nheroes. We remain committed to preserving this Nation for the sake of \n\nthe next generation by honoring that sacrifice.\n\n We Americans are indebted to every member of our military. We are \n\nindebted to do nothing less than to preserving America's freedom and to \n\nmake certain it remains the bright shining star for the world.\n\n I would ask God to bless these service men and women, to bless our \n\nveterans, to bless our country.\n\n This coming week, in a few short days, families will gather around \n\ndining room tables across our Nation to celebrate the holidays. In the \n\ninstance of these six families, there will be an empty chair at the \n\n\n\nChristmas table. For those of us who are Christians, we celebrate \n\nChristmas as the arrival of the Prince of Peace, and I would ask that \n\nwe have peace in our land, peace in our world, and no more wars. And I \n\nwould ask that these families find peace knowing that their son, their \n\nhusband, their father, sacrificed for something more important than \n\nlife itself--they sacrificed for others. May they find peace in knowing \n\nwhat worthy lives their loved ones lived.\n\n I yield the floor.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there has been considerable \n\ncontroversy in recent days over a provision in the recently passed \n\nspending package that became known as the Bipartisan Budget Act which \n\ncuts pensions for military members, including wounded warriors.\n\n There was bipartisan agreement. People on both sides of the aisle \n\nbelieve that it ought to be fixed, that it was an error and should not \n\ngo forward, and that there were better ways to find the money--if you \n\nhave to have money to spend somewhere else--than taking it from \n\nmilitary retirees.\n\n But Majority Leader Reid and every single Member of his conference \n\nsave one stood together to block an effort which I proposed to restore \n\nthe pensions for the military and also find better offsets. They \n\nblocked us from making any alteration to this spending package that was \n\nbefore the Senate, including my amendment to close an egregious tax \n\nwelfare loophole--a tax credit, a payment directly from the United \n\nStates of America to illegal aliens--that could pay for these cuts \n\nitself. Indeed, the inspector general of President Obama's Treasury \n\nDepartment has said this loophole needs to be closed and would save a \n\nsubstantial sum of money. It is an open gate, allowing massive fraud \n\nand illegality.\n\n So we simply wanted to close that loophole. We asked to pay for this \n\nnew spending by closing this loophole that the Treasury Department \n\nasked us to close instead of reducing the retirement benefits by as \n\nmuch as $70,000 for a sergeant who served to age 42 in the U.S. \n\nmilitary.\n\n How can this blockade be defended? How did it happen? Why would we be \n\nin such a position? Is there any Member in the majority who would \n\nreally defend the practice we are now undertaking where legislation \n\nthat clearly needs an amendment to fix a problem in it is not allowed \n\nto have amendments, and the legislation is rammed through the Senate?\n\n This has been the pattern around here for far too long. The majority \n\nleader is eroding the Senate's historic role as the great Chamber where \n\nthe issues are debated and changes and amendments are voted on, and he \n\nis being enabled and supported by his conference.\n\n\n\n Consistently, time and again, when objections are made to try to stop \n\nthis practice and get amendments and votes on important bills, his \n\nconference has stood with him. In other words, his conference is \n\nsaying: We choose to stand with Majority Leader Reid and his procedural \n\nactions which block other colleagues; we choose to stand against even \n\nour own Members having amendments and against the right of individual \n\nAmericans to have their Senator be held accountable--to stand up and be \n\nable to offer amendments to legislation to improve it. And if you don't \n\ndo that, you are accountable for voting for the final bill--which is \n\nimperfect and should be fixed.\n\n That is the way the voters hold us accountable. They need to be able \n\nto see us vote and look at our voting records and decide whether we are \n\nserving their interests, some Wall Street interest, some special \n\ninterest, or some political group instead of the national interest. \n\nThat is what this whole system is about.\n\n Now we have before us the Defense bill that is so important for \n\nAmerica. I serve on the Armed Services Committee. I have been on that \n\ncommittee for nearly 17 years. We moved this bill out with a big \n\nmajority. I voted for it\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nin committee, although I expressed great concern about its budgetary \n\nproblems that needed to be fixed. Unfortunately these problems have not \n\nbeen fixed. But I wanted to see the bill move forward, and I tried to \n\nbe cooperative.\n\n The bill moved to the floor. The budget problem hasn't been fixed, \n\nand there are other problems with the legislation that need to be \n\nrefined. The bill before us, the Defense bill, spends approximately \n\n$500 billion--for the largest single agency in the U.S. Government. Are \n\nwe to accept that it should pass in this body without a single person \n\nhaving a single idea that ought to be made a part of that bill? Can it \n\nnot be made better?\n\n The majority admits it is not a perfect piece of legislation. We \n\ncertainly know that. The American system is designed so that when an \n\nimperfect bill moves forward, a Senator can offer an amendment. Maybe \n\nit is not a good amendment. Maybe it will be voted down. Maybe it is a \n\ngood amendment and will be accepted. But no more, not with what is \n\nhappening here today.\n\n What is happening here today is when Republicans want to offer an \n\namendment, Senator Reid basically says no. He doesn't want any \n\namendments. He then uses a device called ``filling the tree''--because \n\nhe gets to be recognized first--filling it with a series of amendments, \n\nleaving no place, then, for any other Member of the Senate to call up \n\n\n\nan amendment. And the majority leader won't remove the amendments from \n\nthe tree unless he decides he wants to.\n\n On this Defense bill, we had two votes on amendments when the bill \n\nwas up for an entire week. We could have easily had 30 or 40 votes that \n\nweek had we chosen to do so. So only two votes were held, and none now, \n\nand we are moving to final passage. The tree is filled, and we have not \n\nbeen able to force even a single vote to fix matters.\n\n Senator Cornyn offered an amendment this afternoon. He filed a motion \n\nto table some of the amendments Senator Reid had placed on the tree, \n\nand it was voted down by the supporters of Senator Reid on the other \n\nside of the aisle. We have been talking about this for a long time. \n\nThis is contrary to the history of the Senate.\n\n Senator Cornyn laid out how year after year for 51 years we moved a \n\ndefense bill through the Senate, and there have been multiple \n\namendments nearly every time but this one. It is unthinkable that the \n\ngreat Senate of the United States would not allow amendments to a bill \n\nas significant as a defense bill.\n\n So what does the majority leader do after he fills the tree? \n\nRepublicans said: Wait a minute, Senator Reid. There were no amendments \n\nallowed on the bill. We have amendments.\n\n He said: Oh, you are being obstructionist. I am going to file for \n\ncloture. I am going to file a motion to shut off debate, and we are not \n\ngoing to have any amendments.\n\n And then if the Republicans resist and say, we are not going to vote \n\nto end debate because we haven't had any amendments, he says, you are \n\nobstructionist.\n\n This is the pattern that has been going on. He files cloture \n\nvirtually immediately with the filing of the bill, and he claims that \n\nis a filibuster by the Republicans. So by filing cloture immediately, \n\nhe contends that Republicans are filibustering a bill; he counts up \n\nthese filibusters and says: There are too many filibusters in the \n\nSenate. You are obstructing the business of the Senate. In truth, \n\nMajority Leader Reid is the one who is obstructing the Senate. He is \n\nthe one who is blocking debate and amendments.\n\n If you ask a schoolchild somewhere in America, if you ask a senior \n\ncitizen, a World War II veteran who loves this country and has studied \n\nthe great principles of America, you say there is a piece of \n\nlegislation on the floor of the Senate and there is something in it \n\nthat is wrong--they want to cut benefits for wounded warriors, veterans \n\nwho served and have been wounded in combat and disabled--and you do not \n\nwant that to happen, what would you do?\n\n Why, they would all answer, you would file an amendment to the bill \n\nto fix this problem.\n\n\n\n But not in the Senate today. That is the classical understanding of \n\nthe way this body ought to operate. That is what James Madison, I am \n\nsure, conceived and the way it has worked for so many years. But not \n\nany longer. This bipartisan Budget Act is just like the Defense bill--\n\nno amendments. No matter how important the bill is, no matter how many \n\nproblems there are in it, no amendments.\n\n Oh, you want to go back to that old Senate where people could \n\nactually debate and have amendments and offer changes and improve it? \n\nNo longer. That is obstructionist. That is delaying tactics. We won't \n\nhave it anymore. You are slowing us down. It is unacceptable.\n\n When I vote not to end debate on this Defense bill that is before us, \n\nI am not voting to not have a defense bill. That is so obviously wrong \n\nit is hard to believe you have to explain it. But we are not voting to \n\ndo that. We are voting to maintain the classical principle of the \n\nSenate where individual Senators from whatever State there is can come \n\nto the floor and make a contribution to the country. They were elected \n\nby their people. There are almost 5 million Alabamians who elected me. \n\nDo I not get to offer an amendment to the Defense bill of the United \n\nStates? It diminishes my role. It diminishes the role of every single \n\nSenator. So I am asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \n\nwho have been lemming-like, I call it, defending this abuse of power, \n\nto begin to consider what this may mean to them and whether this is the \n\nright way the Senate should operate.\n\n There will be some tough votes. We will all have to take tough votes. \n\nProbably most people can explain their votes if they know what they are \n\ndoing. Maybe some cannot and they will be voted out and sent home. So \n\nbe it. If you cannot defend your vote and you are not casting good \n\nvotes on bills and you cannot respond effectively as to why you voted \n\nfor or against a certain amendment, then you ought to be sent home. We \n\nare not entitled to these jobs. We have to be elected to them.\n\n I am concerned about it. I believe it goes even beyond the \n\nsignificance of this important Defense bill. I think it goes beyond \n\nthis grave error in which we are reducing the pay of military retirees \n\nwhen we are not reducing other retirees' pay.\n\n This is not a belt-tightening across the board. It seems to me to be \n\na targeting of one group of Americans, perhaps those who served more \n\nthan any other group.\n\n Majority Leader Reid continues to complain that the trains are not \n\nrunning on time, not running with enough ruthless efficiency to suit \n\nhis ideas. So he then uses a filling-the-tree tactic. But that is not \n\nall. Although President Obama has had judge after judge after judge \n\nconfirmed, and Cabinet people and sub-Cabinet people confirmed in large \n\nnumbers, the Senate refused to approve one appointment recently and \n\n\n\nrefused to fill three Federal judgeships at the U.S. Court of Appeals \n\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit because they were not needed. The \n\naverage caseload for those judges was 149. Of the 8 judges who are \n\nthere now, there are authorized 11 judges. So the 8 judges there now \n\nhave 149 cases per judge, whereas my circuit, the 11th Circuit, sitting \n\nin Atlanta, has over 700 cases per judge. The national average is \n\naround 350 cases per judge.\n\n We do not need to fill three judgeships for which the caseload is not \n\nthere. The caseload for the DC Circuit is almost half that of the next \n\nlowest circuit in the country. So we do not need these judges. The \n\ncaseload continues to decline. So the Senate refused to give cloture, \n\nrefused to confirm those judges. So in an act of pique or calculation \n\nor deliberateness, the majority leader altered the rule of the Senate \n\nabout how we ought to conduct business here. He did so by breaking the \n\nrules of the Senate.\n\n This is what happened. U.S. Senate rule XXII says in order to bring \n\ndebate to a close, three-fifths of the Senators duly sworn would need \n\nto vote to end the debate. There were not sufficient votes to end the \n\ndebate on the DC judges because they were not needed. This irritated \n\nthe majority leader. So he petitioned to the Presiding Officer and the \n\nParliamentarian and he asserted that it only takes 51 Senators to vote \n\nto end debate. But rule XXII explicitly says it takes three-fifths, 60 \n\nSenators, to end debate. It goes on to say, except when you change the \n\nrules of the Senate, and that takes two-thirds, 67. So it takes 67 \n\nvotes to change the rules of the Senate and 60 votes to end debate.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n What did Senator Reid do? He asked the Parliamentarian to say it only \n\ntook 51. The Presiding Officer, the President pro tempore of the \n\nSenate, Senator Leahy, our longest serving Member, and the \n\nParliamentarian said no, Senator Reid, the rule is it takes 60 votes to \n\nshut off debate.\n\n So what did Senator Reid do? He used the ability to appeal the ruling \n\nof the Chair and he asked his colleagues to overrule the ruling of the \n\nChair, which by any plain reading of the rules of the Senate would be \n\nwithout dispute requiring 60 votes to shut off debate, but he wanted it \n\nto be 51 and his colleagues supported him. His colleagues supported \n\nhim, they supported him and he overruled the Chair, his own \n\nParliamentarian whom he selected and the Presiding Officer that he put \n\nin the Chair. They voted to change the rules of the Senate. It is in \n\nplain language--with 51 votes, not 67.\n\n This is dangerous, colleagues. This is the kind of thing you see in \n\nThird World republics or would-be republics. This is the kind of \n\n\n\nlawlessness that will endanger the American system of government at its \n\nmost fundamental basis. It is endangering us. The President says \n\nwhatever he wants to--you can keep your doctor, the President says your \n\nplan is going to save you $2,000 a year, the President says all these \n\nthings and he gets his bill passed and none of it is true.\n\n I don't see any Members on the floor who voted for this bill, \n\nObamaCare, down here apologizing to the American people, saying I am \n\nsorry, the bill I voted for did not do any of the things I promised you \n\nit would do and I am willing to have an amendment process on the floor \n\nto fix it. No, we are not going to get a vote on ObamaCare. They are \n\ngoing to block that too. If any attempt is ever made, he will fill the \n\ntree and block that vote. So we are not able to bring it to the Senate \n\nfloor and require Senators to vote on serious issues involving health \n\ncare for millions of Americans because Senator Reid doesn't believe in \n\nit and he is backed by his colleagues.\n\n I guess the President probably says, oh, don't let them vote on \n\nObamaCare, they might change some of it. You know, they are finding out \n\nwhat is in it. We don't want them to actually think they have enough \n\nmuscle to actually pass a law to fix it or change it or alter it. That \n\nwould be terrible. Who do they think they are? Do they think this is a \n\ndemocracy or something?\n\n That is where we are. This is huge and significant. We have to \n\nconfront what is happening. It is very important that we cool down and \n\nwe get some sort of work going on, but I am not confident at all on \n\nthat. This effort should result in a retreat from this breaking the \n\nrules to change the rules, this nuclear option.\n\n The reason a nuclear option was called that is because once you do \n\nthat, it blows up the entire Senate. Senator Levin explained the \n\nproblem very succinctly, one of two Democrats who voted against Senator \n\nReid's attempt to execute the nuclear option and to change the rules of \n\nthe Senate. He said if a majority can change the rules of the Senate, \n\nthere are no rules. It is simply what the majority says. There are no \n\nstandards, there are no rules, there are no procedures. If we can \n\nchange them whenever we are frustrated by a majority vote in the \n\nSenate, there are no rules, there are no protections. That is so true.\n\n That is why what has happened here is so significant. I believe this \n\nlate-night work and this process to consider nominations is healthy, \n\nbecause it requires us to go through a painful period of introspection \n\nas to what is happening to us and how we ought to conduct this great \n\nSenate.\n\n This afternoon we did not have the support for Senator Cornyn's \n\n\n\nresolution. Yesterday, when I made the motion to clear a place off of \n\nthe tree so my amendment could be heard and voted on, my colleagues, a \n\nmajority of them, voted no. Only one broke with Senator Reid, actually; \n\none Democrat did. Every Republican voted to allow amendments to go \n\nforward, allow my amendment to be heard. The rights of all the Senators \n\nin this body to defend their State, to defend equal representation, was \n\nundermined.\n\n The two Independents in our Senate, delightful individuals for sure \n\nwho caucus with the Democrats and vote with the Democrats, maybe \n\nsometime they will be willing to prove that the letter ``I'', \n\nindependent, means something and maybe they will help us stand and \n\ndefend the heritage of the Senate. We need to make this thing change. \n\nWe cannot continue to aggregate more and more power into the majority \n\nleader where no longer--where the right to demand 60 votes to shut off \n\ndebate could be further eroded, where we will continue to see bill \n\nafter bill brought up with no amendments being allowed.\n\n They say oh, well, we are at the end of a year. We must do that. We \n\ndo not have time. But the Defense bill has been on the floor since \n\nJune. That is awful. There have been huge amounts of time for us to \n\nbring it to the floor. It has been out of committee since June and it \n\nshould long ago have been brought up and, in fact, it could have been \n\nvoted on last week with full amendments and we would already be through \n\nwith that and be gone today.\n\n The Armed Services bill, the Defense bill is an important bill. I am \n\nvery disappointed we are at a period of impasse, very disappointed that \n\nI cannot support going forward with it to final passage because there \n\nis no ability to amend it and fix some of the obvious flaws that are in \n\nit. It is outside the budget spending limits we agreed to.\n\n The Bipartisan Budget Act was also rammed through the Senate with no \n\nability to offer amendments. This legislation will not allow us to \n\nprevent the cut of veterans retirement pay and disabled wounded \n\nwarriors retirement and benefit pay.\n\n It is a disappointment for me to be in this position. I have tried to \n\nbe supportive of the Defense bill every year. I worked in committee to \n\ndo so. I believe last year we got a unanimous vote, Republicans and \n\nDemocrats, quite a number of times in the committee. A lot of that is \n\ndue to Senator Levin and Senator Inhofe's leadership. This time we have \n\na problem, and it is not going well, and I am deeply disappointed. I \n\nbelieve we can do better, we must do better, and I will not be able to \n\nvote to support this bill tonight.\n\n I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts and concerns of \n\nmy colleagues in the Senate and the House who are unwavering in their \n\n\n\nsupport for our military retirees. We need to correct this grave \n\ninjustice that was made and continue our promise to the men and women \n\nwho serve our Nation by restoring their retirement benefits. We need to \n\ncut spending and put our country on the path to fiscal responsibility, \n\nbut it should not come at the expense of our nation's military \n\nretirees. I could never support a budget deal that contained this \n\nprovision. That is why I opposed the deal that was approved by the \n\nSenate this week. I will work with my colleagues to make sure our \n\nservicemembers receive the benefits they earned. I am confident that we \n\ncan find a solution to this error before any retirees are impacted by a \n\nreduction in their future retirement pay.\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today with strong concerns over \n\nhow the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014, H.R. 3304, \n\napproaches the critical issue of intelligence, surveillance and \n\nreconnaissance, ISR, and specifically the approach to the Global Hawk \n\nsystem. I support H.R. 3304, but I will continue to work with \n\nadministration officials, our Nation's military leaders, and my \n\ncolleagues to make sure our Nation makes the right investments in ISR \n\nthat protect our Nation and our servicemembers.\n\n Since I joined the Senate in January 2013, I have spoken with several \n\nkey Department of Defense leaders who have emphasized the importance of \n\nsufficient ISR capabilities to keep our troops safe and protect U.S. \n\ninterests. The Global Hawk family of platforms plays a key role in \n\nproviding that ISR capability and answering the call of combatant \n\ncommanders with unmatched range, endurance, and cost-per-ISR-hour.\n\n The Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act prohibited \n\nthe retirement of the Global Hawk through the end of the Fiscal Year \n\nand directed the Air Force to maintain the operational capability of \n\neach system to support operational requirements of the combatant \n\ncommands. The original House version of the Fiscal Year 2014 NDAA \n\nextended this retirement prohibition on Global Hawk through the end of \n\n2016. This smart provision would allow the still-fielding Global Hawk \n\nfleet to continue to support operations\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\naround the globe and allow Congress and the Department to gather \n\nadditional information about our Nation's future ISR needs. Such \n\ninformation would allow the best possible decision about the Global \n\nHawk.\n\n Unfortunately, H.R. 3304 only extends the prohibition on Global Hawk \n\nretirement through the end of Fiscal Year 2014. This decision could \n\nallow DOD to follow through on previous efforts to prematurely cancel \n\nthe Block 30 version of the Global Hawk, which represents the largest \n\n\n\ngroup of Global Hawk platforms. DOD's own findings show that the Block \n\n30 Global Hawk represents a more efficient platform for high-altitude \n\nISR needs than platforms which perform the same missions, such as the \n\nU-2.\n\n It doesn't seem wise to allow the potential termination of the \n\nlargest part of the Global Hawk program before Congress fully \n\nunderstand the capabilities and abilities of this system and how it can \n\nfit into larger DOD plans.\n\n I strongly support many of the provisions in H.R. 3304, such as its \n\nimprovement in how the military approaches its sexual assault epidemic, \n\nand amendments I worked on to protect our ICBM forces and ensure our \n\nNation moves forward in an effective way regarding unmanned aerial \n\nsystem integration in the national air space and the use of Reserve \n\ncomponent units for cyber missions. However, I will continue to work \n\nwith my colleagues to improve the DOD's approach to ISR and ensure our \n\nmilitary retains the ISR it needs to keep our citizens and \n\nservicemembers safe.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the National Defense \n\nAuthorization Act includes important reforms to article 32 of the \n\nUniform Code of Military Justice, UCMJ, which are based on an amendment \n\nI authored with Senator Graham.\n\n I thank Senator Graham for working with me on this issue. I also \n\nthank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for working so closely \n\nwith us. Without their support, these critical reforms would not have \n\nbeen incorporated into this bill.\n\n These reforms will help end the abusive and invasive questioning of \n\nsexual assault victims during pretrial article 32 proceedings.\n\n Article 32 proceedings are the military's equivalent of preliminary \n\nhearings in the civilian criminal justice system. However, article 32 \n\nproceedings have become their own trials where the defense counsel can \n\nharass and intimidate sexual assault victims and ask questions that \n\nwould never be permitted in civilian courts. No victim should ever have \n\nto endure this type of abuse.\n\n Our military justice system should encourage sexual assault victims \n\nto report these crimes and pursue justice by prosecuting perpetrators. \n\nTragically, the article 32 process does just the opposite.\n\n Roger Canaff--a former prosecutor who has worked with the military as \n\na legal consultant on sexual assault cases--says that article 32 \n\nproceedings are so difficult for victims that ``a lot of cases die \n\nthere as a result.'' In fact, the military's own statistics show that \n\nnearly 30 percent of sexual assault victims who originally agree to \n\nhelp prosecute their alleged offenders change their minds before trial.\n\n The National Defense Authorization Act addresses this serious problem \n\n\n\nby bringing article 32 proceedings more in line with how preliminary \n\nhearings are conducted in the civilian criminal justice system.\n\n Specifically, the bill limits the scope of article 32 proceedings to \n\nthe question of probable cause. This will help ensure that article 32 \n\nproceedings do not turn into fishing expeditions that serve only to \n\ndiscredit and humiliate victims.\n\n It also requires article 32 proceedings to be presided over by an \n\nimpartial military lawyer except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n In addition, the bill requires all article 32 proceedings to be \n\nrecorded--putting in place a uniform standard across all of the \n\nservices. It also gives victims access to the recording.\n\n Furthermore, it prevents victims from being forced to testify in \n\narticle 32 proceedings. Instead, alternative forms of testimony, \n\nincluding sworn statements, could be used. This will ensure that \n\nvictims are not revictimized during article 32 proceedings.\n\n These commonsense reforms will help ensure that victims of sexual \n\nassault are not put on trial simply for making the courageous decision \n\nto pursue justice. And this change has broad support from survivors, \n\nmilitary leaders and military law experts.\n\n Karalen Morthole--who was raped by a master sergeant at a bar on the \n\ngrounds of the Marine barracks in Washington, DC--supports reforming \n\nthe article 32 process: ``People always say, `This is why so many \n\npeople don't come forward.' I agree. The process should be changed so \n\nsurvivors of rape feel confident rather than discouraged when trying to \n\npursue justice.''\n\n MG Vaughn Ary--the staff judge advocate to the commandant of the \n\nMarine Corps--agrees that ``there is room for change in article 32.''\n\n In addition, Eugene Fidell--a professor of military justice at Yale \n\nLaw School and a former Coast Guard judge advocate--has said that \n\narticle 32 proceedings have ``become bloated'' and ``should be replaced \n\nby a simple probable cause hearing.''\n\n I am so pleased that there is a clear consensus on the need to reform \n\nthe article 32 process to better protect victims of sexual assault. \n\nThis is an important step forward in addressing the epidemic of sexual \n\nassault in our military.\n\n But let me be clear. There is only one fundamental change that will \n\ngive sexual assault survivors the confidence to report these heinous \n\ncrimes knowing that justice will be served--the bipartisan Military \n\nJustice Improvement Act.\n\n I am deeply disappointed that this important bill was not included in \n\nthe National Defense Authorization Act because until vicious crimes \n\nlike sexual assault are handled outside the chain of command, we will \n\n\n\nnot have truly fixed our broken military justice system.\n\n That is why I look forward to proudly casting my vote in support of \n\nSenator Gillibrand's bill in January, and I urge my colleagues to do \n\nthe same.\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the compromise Fiscal Year 2014 National \n\nDefense Authorization Act is an important authorization bill that I \n\nintend to support. This will be the second legislative matter \n\nconsidered by the Senate this week that reflects the kind of compromise \n\ntoo often missing from our deliberations in Congress. It does not meet \n\nthe needs of every Senator, but it marks a step in the right direction \n\nand will allow the Department of Defense to move forward key programs \n\nin the coming year.\n\n I understand the frustration of some Senators who were keen to offer \n\namendments to this authorization bill. In fact, two measures I \n\nintroduced during the Senate's consideration were not included in the \n\ncompromise. These provisions would have extended protections for human \n\nrights by aiding international efforts to prosecute war criminals and \n\ncompensating innocent civilians who fall victim to combat operations. \n\nBoth provisions have significant support, and I remain committed to \n\ncontinuing to work to see them enacted in the new year. But despite the \n\nbest efforts of Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe, the amendment \n\nprocess in the Senate was derailed by irrelevant proposals, which \n\nprevented provisions like these from receiving consideration. \n\nNonetheless, I will support this compromise..\n\n The bill before the Senate authorizes the activities of the \n\nDepartment of Defense, the single largest U.S. Government entity. As a \n\nresult, manufacturers and service providers across the United States \n\nwill keep Americans employed making and doing things for the \n\nDepartment. It means that the U.S. Armed Forces can take the steps \n\nneeded to address threats to our security. Most importantly, it means \n\nthe members of the Armed Forces and their families can count on having \n\nthe equipment and support they need while selflessly serving to keep us \n\nsafe.\n\n The Defense authorization bill before us also contains important \n\nchanges that will help the administration transfer more individuals out \n\nof the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. It includes a provision \n\nthat relaxes the current onerous certification requirements that must \n\nbe satisfied before transferring detainees to third countries. These \n\nrequirements have proven to be unnecessary and counterproductive.\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\n Regrettably, the compromise bill retains two limitations that were \n\nincluded in the House-passed version of the authorization. The \n\n\n\nlegislation extends the current prohibition on constructing facilities \n\nin the United States to house Guantanamo detainees and also extends the \n\nban on transferring detainees to the United States for detention or \n\ntrial. I strongly believe that the executive branch must have all \n\noptions available in handling terrorism cases, particularly the ability \n\nto prosecute terrorists in Federal criminal courts. That is why I voted \n\nagainst an amendment by Senator Ayotte during the Senate floor debate \n\nin November that included these same restrictions.\n\n Although I would have preferred the more favorable detention-related \n\nprovisions contained in the underlying Senate bill, this compromise \n\nrepresents an improvement over existing law.\n\n Reforms to the military justice system in this compromise also \n\naccomplish an improvement of the status quo. This bill includes roughly \n\ntwo dozen changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and \n\nDepartment of Defense policy that enhance victims' rights and \n\nprotections and amend the investigative and prosecutorial process. \n\nAmong the measures included in the bill is the removal of a commander's \n\nability to overturn jury convictions, and a secondary review of any \n\ndecision made not to prosecute, whether made by the convening authority \n\nor the staff judge advocate. Additionally, the 5-year statute of \n\nlimitations on trial by court-martial for additional offenses involving \n\nsex-related crimes is eliminated, and those accused of certain sex-\n\nrelated offenses are required to receive dishonorable discharges or \n\ndismissals if convicted.\n\n These important accountability measures will be supported by the \n\nremoval of the ``good soldier'' defense for the accused, and victims \n\nwill further be protected by changes that prevent them from being \n\nforced to testify at article 32 proceedings and at trial. Though more \n\ncan be done, these and other provisions adopted represent a significant \n\nimprovement and merit the Senate's support.\n\n There are many other provisions in this bill that are worthy of \n\nhighlighting, but as cochair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, I am \n\nmost pleased that this bill does not compromise on supporting the \n\nNational Guard. As an essential part of U.S. security at home and \n\nabroad, the National Guard is an integral part of the Armed Forces \n\ntoday and will remain so in the future. Among the many provisions that \n\ndemonstrate the strong commitment to the National Guard felt by Members \n\nof Congress in both Chambers, two are most important. First, the \n\nauthorization effectively ends the process of ``off-ramping,'' wherein \n\na National Guard unit scheduled to deploy is replaced at the last \n\nminute by an Active unit, preserving both certainty and operational \n\nreadiness for our National Guard personnel and families.\n\n Second, it requires congressional budget justification documents to \n\n\n\nspecifically enumerate funding levels for embedded mental health \n\nproviders in National Guard and Reserve units. For too many years, men \n\nand women in the Guard and Reserves have come home from war to \n\ninadequate mental health resources. The Congress took the important \n\nstep of embedding mental health providers in units, but resources \n\ndisproportionally moved towards the large, Active military bases, while \n\nour hometown heroes at small drill centers around the country went \n\nwithout. With specific enumeration, we can take a better look at \n\nresource allocation and we in the Congress can make sure members of the \n\nGuard and Reserve get similar access to their Active counterparts.\n\n The authorization before the Senate is the result of compromise. The \n\nSenate will close this session of Congress on the heels of two \n\nbipartisan votes that passed a 2-year budget and this important \n\nauthorization bill. I hope that this bodes well for further cooperation \n\nand compromise in the new year.\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I support the compromise National \n\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (NDAA). Though this bill \n\nhas shortcomings, it will be good for our country and for Connecticut, \n\nand it will allow us to keep faith with the brave men and women who \n\nserve and sacrifice each day in our military.\n\n As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have the \n\nprivilege and the important responsibility to honor our men and women \n\nin uniform by providing for them while they are training, when they are \n\ndeployed, and if they are wounded. I voted for the NDAA in committee \n\nthis year, and I will vote for it on the Senate floor because I know \n\nthat it will support our servicemembers throughout their time in \n\nuniform and beyond. This bill funds the training and equipment our \n\ntroops need to go into battle. It funds the critical weapons systems \n\nthat they need to protect our Nation. And it provides for them after \n\nthey return home--albeit less robustly than it should--through medical \n\ncare and opportunities to build skill sets for civilian careers.\n\n This bill is good for Connecticut as it supports both our Connecticut \n\nNational Guard and Reserve and our State's hard-working defense \n\nmanufacturers. Specifically, it funds two submarines a year. The NDAA \n\nmaintains robust funding for the Ohio Replacement Program, the Virginia \n\nClass Submarine, the Heavy Lift Replacement Helicopter Program, and the \n\nJoint Strike Fighter. It funds advanced procurement for the Army's UH-\n\n60 Blackhawk M Model that will be used by the Connecticut National \n\nGuard, and it rightly does not authorize a costly and unnecessary round \n\nof base realignments and closures.\n\n The NDAA will strengthen our commitment to eliminating the scourge of \n\nsexual assault from our military. It includes provisions from my bill \n\nto provide victims of an offense under the Uniform Code of Military \n\n\n\nJustice with the same rights to counsel and other protection afforded \n\nvictims in civilian courts. It rightly eliminates the ability of a \n\ncommander to dismiss a court martial or reduce a sentence, and it \n\nestablishes minimum sentencing guidelines in cases of sexual assault. \n\nThe bill also strengthens rights for victims of sexual assault at \n\npretrial article 32 proceedings and ensures that they will have counsel \n\npresent when interviewed.\n\n I have been very concerned with properly providing for those wounded \n\nwarriors who suffer the so-called signature wounds of these recent \n\nwars: post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. Just this year, \n\nI was saddened by the loss of Connecticut veterans who fought long \n\nbattles with these illnesses. Though I believe that more efforts are \n\nneeded, the NDAA will help to provide improved outreach on suicide \n\nprevention to Reservists in Connecticut and across the country to \n\nhopefully reach additional wounded warriors in need of help.\n\n I have also been very concerned with the lack of interoperability \n\nbetween Department of Defense and VA medical records. Right now, when \n\nsomeone separates from the military, the VA has no complete, automatic \n\naccess to veterans' service-related medical records, even though the \n\nDepartment of Defense has those records. Defects in interoperability \n\nhave contributed to the unconscionable backlog of veterans' claims. I \n\nhave worked with Senator Nelson on a bill to mandate interoperable \n\nmedical records between the Department of Defense and the VA, and I am \n\npleased that provisions on this subject are in the NDAA. These \n\nprovisions require the SecDef and the Secretary of VA to ensure the \n\nDepartments' electronic health record systems are interoperable with \n\nintegrated display of data, or a single electronic health record, and \n\nthat each is compliant with national standards.\n\n Additionally, I am pleased that the NDAA includes provision-enhancing \n\nmechanisms to correlate skills and training for military occupational \n\nspecialties with skills and training required for civilian \n\ncertifications and licenses or IT credentialing. By prioritizing \n\ntraining and certification, not only do we ensure that our military \n\npersonnel have the appropriate skills to carry out their duties, but we \n\nalso ensure that our veterans have a path to translate these skills to \n\ncivilian life and find work that fits their skills once they leave the \n\nservice.\n\n Finally, this bill strengthens our commitment to ensuring that we do \n\nnot contract with the enemy. It includes provisions I championed giving \n\ncombatant commanders greater authority to terminate or void a contract \n\nwith anyone supporting our enemies,\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\n\n\nand it prohibits funding to enter into contracts with Rosoboronexport--\n\na Russian company financing Assad's cruel war against the Syrian \n\npeople.\n\n Overall, I am pleased to support this bill to keep our country safe \n\nand our military strong. I look forward to voting for this bill and to \n\ncontinuing to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to support \n\nour national defense.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to call, as so many others have \n\ndone, for justice. The scourge of sexual assault still pervades in our \n\nmilitary. Our outrage is palpable, but change is possible.\n\n I recently read a heart wrenching story in the Baltimore Sun about \n\nBrian Lewis. Thirteen years ago, after 3 years of service in the Navy, \n\nBrian was assaulted by a higher ranking shipmate. His attacker went \n\nunpunished, while Brian bore shame, depression, and even accusations \n\nfrom his fellow shipmates.\n\n Brian is not alone. He joins thousands of men and women who have \n\nsuffered silently at the hands of a fellow soldier, sailor, or marine. \n\nThis is a compelling national problem. When you join the military and \n\nyou face the enemy, you shouldn't have to fear the enemy within.\n\n Victims of sexual assault have long been redlined and sidelined at \n\nthe hands of a justice system that fails to be objective or effective. \n\nIt is time to put a stop to this now.\n\n Despite lasting trauma, prejudice, and overwhelming obstacles, these \n\nmen and women have endured. Their courage in the face of suffering is \n\nadmirable, but it should not be necessary.\n\n That is why I support the new Defense bill for fiscal year 2014. It \n\nincludes over 30 provisions to address sexual assault. It strengthens \n\nthe justice system. It provides counsel and support for victims. Most \n\nimportantly, it provides a serious deterrent for those who dare take \n\nadvantage of our most patriotic Americans.\n\n For 25 years, I have fought to resolve this issue. I thank those who \n\nhave stood beside me, including, most recently a bipartisan alliance of \n\nwomen Senators. We have made some progress, but we still have far to \n\ngo.\n\n There are 26,000 reasons why we rise today. Twenty six thousand \n\nsexual assaults have occurred in our U.S. military this year. Many of \n\nthese acts of violence are unreported, unprosecuted, and unpunished. We \n\ncannot let this continue, not on our watch.\n\n It is our moral duty to speak for the voiceless, to vouch for the \n\npowerless, to fight for the helpless. The men and women of our military \n\nmay know how to wage war, but they should have to battle through \n\nredtape when it comes to their pursuit of justice.\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \n\n\n\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. I commend the work of \n\nmy colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, especially the chairman, \n\nSenator Levin, on reaching an agreement with the House to complete this \n\nimportant legislation. For 51 consecutive years, the Senate has passed \n\na defense authorization bill, and I hope we will be able to soon send \n\nthe bill before us to President Obama for his signature. We owe it to \n\nour servicemembers to pass a law that will support them and enable the \n\nDOD to execute this year's budget efficiently and effectively.\n\n We made tough decisions in putting together this bill--especially in \n\nthese difficult economic times. But this bill will allow DOD to combat \n\ncurrent threats, plan for future threats, and provide for the welfare \n\nof our brave servicemembers. While it is disappointing that we did not \n\nhave sufficient time to debate amendments, this is a good compromise \n\nbill and it is critical that we pass it.\n\n I would like to point out a few of the highlights of this bill:\n\n It authorizes a 1-percent across-the-board pay raise and reauthorizes \n\nover 30 types of bonuses and special pays for our men and women in \n\nuniform; includes 36 key provisions to strengthen sexual assault \n\nprevention and response programs; extends authorities to continue \n\nseveral ``train and equip'' programs to assist foreign militaries in \n\ncounterterrorism and counternarcotics missions; and authorizes $6.2 \n\nbillion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to further build the \n\ncapacity of the Afghan army and police so those forces can take over \n\nsecurity throughout Afghanistan by December 2014.\n\n This year I once again had the honor of serving as the chairman of \n\nthe Seapower Subcommittee, alongside Senator McCain, the ranking \n\nmember. Working together, our subcommittee focused on the needs of the \n\nNavy, Marine Corps, and strategic mobility forces. We put particular \n\nemphasis on supporting marine and naval forces engaged in combat \n\noperations, improving efficiencies, and applying the savings to higher \n\npriority programs. Specifically, the bill includes the required funding \n\nfor two Virginia-class submarines and provides an additional $100 \n\nmillion to support buying the 10th DDG-51 under the current multiyear \n\nprocurement program. The bill also approves the funding for other major \n\nprograms, including the DDG-1000 destroyer, the Aircraft Carrier \n\nReplacement Program, the Littoral Combat Ship, LCS, and the P-8 \n\nmaritime patrol aircraft. I am particularly pleased about the funding \n\nfor the Virginia-class submarines and the DDG-1000, which so many Rhode \n\nIslanders help to build.\n\n Working together with Senator McCain, this bill increases \n\naccountability for taxpayers' dollars spent on several major Navy \n\nprograms. For example, the bill includes language to increase the CVN-\n\n78 cost cap, while excluding certain urgent and unforeseen testing \n\n\n\ncosts from that cap. In addition, we require quarterly reports on the \n\nprogram manager's estimate for CVN-79, and we freeze the payment of \n\nfees whenever the program manager's estimate of total program costs \n\nexceeds the cost cap.\n\n In this bill, we also require the CNO to submit a report identifying \n\nthe current littoral combat ship, LCS, concept of operations and the \n\nexpected survivability of each sea frame; we require the GAO to review \n\nthe LCS program; and we limit future procurements of the LCS until the \n\nNavy produces certain reports and the Joint Requirements Oversight \n\nCouncil makes certain certifications about the LCS program.\n\n The bill also amends the language of the annual 30-year shipbuilding \n\nreport to require the disclosure of ship prices assumed in the plan and \n\na risk assessment whenever the number of ships in the plan falls below \n\nthe Navy's requirements.\n\n I offer my thanks to Senator McCain and the other members of the \n\nSeapower Subcommittee for their diligence in the subcommittee's work \n\nthis year.\n\n We have a good bill before the Senate, and I urge all of my \n\ncolleagues to support it.\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is \n\ninvoked on Executive Calendar No. 456, Alejandro Mayorkas, to be Deputy \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security, all but 1 hour of postcloture time be \n\nyielded back, and that when the Senate convenes on Friday, December 20, \n\nthe Senate resume consideration of the Mayorkas nomination, with the \n\nremaining hour of debate equally divided between Senators Carper and \n\nCoburn, or their designees, and that following the use or yielding back \n\nof time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Mayorkas nomination; \n\nfurther, that the Senate then proceed to a cloture vote on Executive \n\nCalendar No. 459, John Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service, as under \n\nthe regular order; that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be \n\nyielded back and the Senate proceed to a vote on confirmation; further, \n\nthat the Senate then proceed to a cloture vote on Executive Calendar \n\nNo. 382, Brian Davis, to be a Federal district judge, as under the \n\nregular order, and that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be \n\nyielded back and the Senate proceed to a vote on confirmation; the \n\nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \n\nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, \n\nthat the Senate then proceed to the cloture vote on Executive Calendar \n\nNo. 452, Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve, as under the regular order, and \n\nif cloture is invoked on the Yellen nomination, all postcloture time be \n\nyielded back and the Senate proceed to a vote on confirmation on \n\nMonday, January 6, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \n\nin consultation with the Republican leader; further, that cloture on \n\n\n\nExecutive Calendar Nos. 455, 445, 371, 457, 356, and 189 be withdrawn; \n\nfurther, that following the cloture vote on the\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nMayorkas nomination, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business \n\nfor debate only, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \n\neach.\n\n The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Is there objection?\n\n Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \n\nwill be two rollcall votes tonight at 11:15 p.m. on the motion to \n\nconcur in the House message to accompany H.R. 3304, the National \n\nDefense Authorization Act, and cloture on the Mayorkas nomination. If \n\ncloture is invoked there will be a series of six rollcall votes \n\ntomorrow beginning at about 10 a.m.\n\nFor more information please visit: http://beta.congress.gov  \n"}
