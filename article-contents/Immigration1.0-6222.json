{"title": "High Costs of Sprawl", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nSprawl has indeed become a political issue, and an important reason for this is that sprawl can be as bad for a \ncommunity's economy as for its environment (letters, Feb. 10).\n\nIn many communities the taxes generated by low-density sprawl development do not support the new schools, \nroads and other services that new residents demand. Inappropriate development can also pollute groundwater, \nnecessitating the construction of expensive water-treatment plants, and can exact other economic costs.\n\nSprawl development consumes open space, damages quality of life, destroys community character and is bad for \nthe bottom line. For many voters these are reasons enough to control growth and preserve open space.\n \nWILL ROGERS\nPresident, Trust for Public Land\nSan Francisco, Feb. 10, 1999\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
