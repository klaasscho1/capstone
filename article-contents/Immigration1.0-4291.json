The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour, with 40 minutes \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member on the Committee on the Judiciary and 20 \nminutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) \neach will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. \nMr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4760. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 4760, along with Michael McCaul, Martha McSally, \nand Raul Labrador, to provide an equitable and permanent legal status for unlawful aliens who grew up in America \nafter their parents brought them here as children. Just as importantly, we want to strengthen our borders, close \ngaping loopholes, curtail endemic fraud, and enhance interior immigration enforcement so that our Nation won't \nface the same dilemma in a few years. President Trump did the right thing and tried to end President Obama's \n\n\n\nblatantly unconstitutional DACA program. As a Federal court ruled in enjoining DACA's sister program, DHS cannot \n``enact a program whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts to thwart them. . . . The \nDHS Secretary is not just rewriting the laws; he is creating them from scratch.'' President Trump also did the right \nthing by immediately turning to us, asking Congress to fix the problem. As he asked for, H.R. 4760 solves the \nDACA conundrum. It provides DACA beneficiaries with an indefinitely renewable legal nonimmigrant status allowing \nthem to live and work in the United States without worry and travel abroad as they choose. It also allows them to \nreceive green cards on the same terms as any other intending immigrant around the world. As I indicated, the bill \nwill help ensure that the distressing DACA dilemma does not recur. It ends catch and release at the border, battles \nasylum fraud, and ensures that unaccompanied minors caught at the border will be treated equally, regardless of \ntheir home country. It will ensure that the law no longer tempts minors and their parents to make the dangerous \nillicit journey to the United States and to line the pockets of cancerous cartels with hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThe bill will also take away the other magnet that draws millions of persons to come to the United States illegally: \nthe jobs magnet. Through the inclusion of Lamar Smith's Legal Workforce Act, it makes E- Verify mandatory. After \ntwo decades of constant improvement, E-Verify has become an extremely effective, reliable, and easy way for \nemployers to ensure that they have hired a legal workforce. Three-quarters of a million employers currently use E-\nVerify, which almost instantaneously confirms the work eligibility of new hires 99 percent of the time. The bill will \nalso allow DHS to deport members of MS-13 and other virulent criminal gangs and allow it to detain dangerous \naliens who cannot be removed. It will combat the public safety menace of sanctuary cities in multiple ways, \nincluding by allowing the Justice Department to withhold from them law enforcement grants. The bill makes \nsignificant reforms to our legal immigration system. It puts an end to extended family chain migration and terminates \nthe diversity visa green card lottery, which awards green cards at random to people with no ties to the United States \nor any particular skills. In addition, it replaces the dysfunctional H-2A agricultural guestworker program. The H-2A \nprogram is slow, bureaucratic, and frustrating, often forcing growers to leave crops to rot in the fields. They also \nmust pay an artificially inflated wage rate, along with providing free housing and transportation. In doing the right \nthing, H- 2A users are almost always repaid by being placed at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. The \nbill provides growers with streamlined access to guestworkers when sufficient American labor cannot be found. It \nfinally provides dairies and food processors with year-round labor needs with access to a guestworker program. It \navoids the pitfalls of the H-2A program, and it will remain at its core a true guestworker program. As growers \nlearned the hard way after the 1986 amnesty, illegal farmworkers will leave en mass and flock to the cities when \nprovided with permanent residence. The Agricultural Guestworker Act contained in this bill is supported by the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, the dairy industry, and over 200 distinct agricultural organizations from across \nthe United States. Following introduction of this legislation, I have sat down with my colleagues for months to learn \nof any concerns and to strive to improve the bill. The product of this intensive work is better legislation. While I am \ndisappointed that the rule did not allow me to include all of the improvements made possible by the input of so \nmany Members, I am gratified that I could include the refinements to the H-2C agricultural guestworker program. \nTo give just one example, the bill now clarifies that the Department of Homeland Security will issue documents to \nunlawful alien farmworkers who have been sponsored by growers to join the program, authorizing them to return to \nthe United States without the need for visas after completing their initial touchbacks. This will create certainty for \ngrowers, allowing them to receive pre-approval of their H-2C petitions for current workers before they leave the \ncountry and precertification of the workers' admission back into the United States before they leave. Congress has \na unique opportunity to act before the country ends up with another large population who crossed the border \nillegally as children. Let's take this historic moment to come together and support vital legislation that provides \ncommonsense, reasonable solutions. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join President Trump and support H.R. \n4760, and I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H5424]] House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, \nWashington, DC, June 20, 2018. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. \nDear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for the opportunity to review the relevant provisions of the text of H.R. 4760, \nthe Securing America's Future Act of 2018. As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary, while the Agriculture Committee received an additional referral. I recognize and appreciate your \ndesire to bring this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. \n4760 from further consideration by the Committee on Agriculture.

I \nappreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this \nmeasure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I \nyield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 4760. This legislation is nothing more than a wish-list of \nthe far right anti-immigrant fringe. It would do nothing to solve the real problems plaguing our immigration system, \nwhile causing untold suffering for millions of people. The world has watched President Trump create a family \nseparation crisis out of thin air. I personally met with fathers whose children had been ripped from their arms, who \nhave no idea when, or if, they will ever see their children again. One father I spoke to was promised he would be \nkept with his young child, only to have officers enter his room in the middle of the night and forcibly take away his \nyoung daughter. We have all seen the anguished faces of the parents separated from their children, and listened to \nthe desperate cries of sobbing children screaming for their parents. This is government-sponsored child abuse. This \nbill does absolutely nothing to solve the crisis. The President, after falsely claiming that he had no choice but to \nenact this cruel and brutal policy, now says he will end it, proving that he and his administration were lying all along. \nBut it is not clear that yesterday's executive order immediately ends family separation. It also puts our country on a \ndangerous path to prolonged detention for parents and children. The Keeping Families Together Act, which I \nintroduced this week, along with virtually every Democratic Member, would actually prevent children from being \nseparated from their parents, except in extraordinary circumstances. We could vote on that legislation today. But \ninstead, we have this bill before us now. This bill turns all undocumented immigrants into criminals. It takes \nparticular aim at families, children, workers, businesses, public safety, and our fundamental values as a nation, all \nat once. It is almost impressive how many bad ideas have been crammed into one comprehensive package. For \nexample, it eliminates most visa categories that promote family reunification, as well as the diversity visa program, \nwhich provides residents of many countries the only method of immigrating to the United States. It removes critical \nprotections for unaccompanied children, and it does away with other important safeguards for children traveling with \n\n\n\ntheir parents. It would decimate the agriculture community by requiring employers to use the E-Verify employment \nverification system without fixing the underlying immigration system. And it would undercut American workers by \nimporting guestworkers at drastically depressed wages. It would also undermine our asylum system, breaking with \nour proud tradition of being a beacon of hope and freedom for the oppressed. In exchange for all these harsh, anti-\nimmigrant provisions, it offers the most minimal protections to Dreamers, creating a renewable temporary status \nwith no path to citizenship, leaving them in perpetual limbo, and unable to become full members of society in the \nonly country they have ever known. This is an act of extortion we cannot abide. This bill fails to repair our broken \nimmigration system and, indeed, in many ways, makes it even worse, and all without substantially helping the \nDreamers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. The \nSPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. \n{time} 1230 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), who is the \nauthor of an important provision in this bill related to electronic verification of employment, and he is the former \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee. [[Page H5425]] Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), for all that he has done to \nadvance immigration reform during this Congress. I do support H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act. This \nlegislation ensures that our immigration policies put the interests of Americans first. We need to thank not only \nChairman Goodlatte, but others who have put so much time and effort into this legislation. We appreciate Mr. \nGoodlatte's diligence, expertise, and commitment to improving our immigration system. Any immigration reform \nconsidered by Congress must, at a minimum, secure our borders, implement workforce verification to end the illegal \njobs magnet, reduce chain migration, bolster interior enforcement, and prevent abuse of our asylum laws. Securing \nAmerica's Future Act includes all of these necessary provisions. The bill delivers on the President's pledge to voters \nto complete physical barriers along our southern border, penalize lawless sanctuary cities, and end the Obama \nadministration's catch-and-release policy that returns dangerous criminal immigrants to our streets to prey on \ninnocent Americans. Of special interest to me is the inclusion of the Legal Workforce Act in the bill, which requires \nall new employees' work eligibility to be verified. This will reduce illegal immigration and save jobs for American \nworkers. Also important is the deadline to finally implement an entry-exit tracking system to identify visa \noverstayers. They comprise half of the almost 1 million new illegal immigrants every year. Securing America's \nFuture Act helps keep our communities safe and protects American workers. It deserves our enthusiastic support. \nMadam Speaker, again I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for offering this legislation. Mr. NADLER. Madam \nSpeaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Immigration Subcommittee. Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, this is an anti-immigrant bill. It slashes legal \nimmigration. It will injure the ag industry. It criminalizes nearly the entire undocumented population. It will undermine \npublic safety and removes critical protections for families and children, and it even fails to provide a pathway to \nlegal permanent residence for Dreamers. Sometimes my friends across the aisle say the problem with immigration \nis we don't have assimilation. You don't get assimilation when you create a permanent underclass of people who \nare Americans in every way but their paperwork. It eliminates family-based categories, and this is the relatives of \nAmericans. American citizens and legal permanent residents, forget it. You are not going to be able to get your \nfamily members in if this bill passes. It mandates the use of E-Verify, which would be highly disruptive to \nrestaurants, hotels, and other industries, and the changes in the ag worker provision are just a fig leaf. The bill \ntransforms a civil law violation into a crime so that undocumented immigrants, including the parents of Dreamers \nthe bill purports to help, become criminals overnight. It would accelerate separation of kids from parents when 11 \nmillion American workers suddenly become subject to prosecution. Undermining our asylum system by \nestablishing impossibly high evidentiary burdens, it removes protections, as I have said, and it does nothing to \nreunite the thousands of children who have been taken away from their parents at the border. Instead, it facilitates \nputting mothers in the cages with their toddlers. So why are we debating a bill that nearly everyone, even many in \nthe Republican Party, think is a terrible idea? I fear it is because the very extreme elements of the Republican Party \nhave become the loudest and the most powerful. I continue to have faith in the good people of our country. The \nAmerican people spoke out loudly against President Trump's family separation policy. They couldn't stand seeing \nlittle children, babies, and toddlers ripped from their mother's arms. And we saw a reversal, but it is not a solution, \nbecause locking up mothers, putting those mothers in the cages with their toddlers is not the solution to this \nproblem. We are not going to let hatred, bigotry, and xenophobia prevail in this country. Madam Speaker, I urge a \n``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam \nSpeaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez). Mr. GUTIERREZ. Madam Speaker, the \n\n\n\nreelection strategy for every single Republican Member of the House is to stand strong with a President willing to \ntake children from their parents in order to look mean and nasty and cruel to children who are fleeing for their lives. \nYou own that. That is your campaign strategy. As of today, Republicans want to put the children in the same jails as \nthe parents and fight to hold them indefinitely and demand we charge asylum seekers as criminals and jail them \nwith their children. The more than 2,300 children who have been taken from their parents and put in a vast system \nspread over thousands of miles, we just don't know if those children will ever see their families again. You own that, \ntoo. That is what you are campaigning on to save your jobs this coming November. Taking DACA away from \nDreamers: that is your policy, too. And then putting bills on the floor to cu legal immigration and build a wall are your \nstrategies to blame Democrats for what you are doing. Republicans want to be both the arsonists and the \nfirefighters, and you can't be both. I don't blame Speaker Ryan and Chairman Goodlatte. They are not bad people. \nThey are both decent men of faith who have been put in a position of defending policies that are cruel, inhumane, \nand run deeply contrary to the will of the American people and the values of our Nation. This must be morally \nwrenching for them. But honestly, I have little sympathy. Each has made a devil's bargain to trade their reputation \nfor Stephen Miller's agenda and Donald Trump's name. Legal immigration? No. An asylum policy that protects \nhuman lives? No. DACA to protect Dreamers? No. Policies that treat wife-beating, rape, and human trafficking as \nmatters that require us to protect women? No. A nation of immigrants? No. All they want is a wall. Even though both \nare leaving office because the Republican Party is no longer home for decent men and women of values, faith, and \nconscience, both are leaving us with one last commitment: to put the needs of this erratic President above the will \nof the people and above the good of our Nation. At some point, someone needs to stop complimenting the emperor \non his new set of clothes and start telling the President he is naked. Covering his rear end from all the lies, the \ndeceit, and the soullessness is no longer sustainable. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx). Members are \nreminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President and to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. \nGOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to some of the false charges \nthat we are hearing here. First of all, with regard to E-Verify, unfortunately, there is a misconception that it is our \nintention to implement the new H-2C program and mandate E-Verify for agriculture simultaneously. This could not \nbe further from the truth. The AG Act, under that act, E-Verify would not be mandated for agriculture until the H-2C \nis properly up and running and no sooner than 24 months after enactment of the legislation. In addition, E- Verify \nwill only apply to future hires. Secondly, I want to respond to those who complain about what we are doing for the \nDACA recipients in this legislation. I want to make it very, very clear we are going to do something that is legal, \nsomething that is constitutional for them instead of something that was illegal and unconstitutional, and it is going to \nbe superior in this bill to what was done for them there, because they [[Page H5426]] will be allowed to remain in \nthe United States permanently, renewing every 3 years. They are only excluded if they do not meet certain criteria. \nThe fact of the matter is we will have an opportunity for them to avail themselves of existing pathways to citizenship. \nIf they are married to a United States citizen, as it would be logical that a great many of these DACA recipients are \nbecause of the fact that they have grown up here, they will be able to benefit from that. They could not do that \nunder the Obama executive order. So this is much better than how the Democrats have treated the DACA \nrecipients. Lastly, whether the labor workforce status quo is sustainable for American agriculture, under current law \nin California and other States, farmers are facing chronic employee shortages. Last fall, the California Farm Bureau \nannounced the results of an informal survey of its members. The survey showed that 69 percent of those surveyed \nwere experiencing labor shortfalls. Despite all the efforts California farmers and ranchers have made to find and \nhire people to work on their operations, they still can't find enough willing and qualified employees. California Farm \nBureau President Paul Wenger said: ``Farmers have offered higher wages, benefits, and more year-round jobs. \nThey have tried to mechanize operations where possible and have even changed crops or left ground idle, but \nemployee shortages persist.'' The labor force status quo is simply unsustainable for American agriculture. Clearly, \nthis is not a situation that is going to be solved by granting permanent resident status to farmworkers. In fact, that is \nthe opposite of what is needed. Granting permanent resident status to illegal farmworkers will not do anything to \nensure that farmers and ranchers have access to the labor they need for years to come. It is shortsighted and does \nnothing to relieve employers or legal farmworkers of the unnecessary burdens and competitive disadvantage they \nface under the outdated H-2A program. Americans' food can be grown in other countries where land and labor are \nfar cheaper. To ensure that our meat and produce continue to be grown in America and that our Nation's \nagricultural industry thrives in the global marketplace, the U.S. needs a flexible, workable, and fair guest worker \nprogram like the H-2C program established in the AG Act and contained in the legislation that we are debating right \nnow. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \n\n\n\ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison). Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding \nthe time. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand in full opposition to Securing America's Future Act, H.R. \n4760. First of all, let me say that the only thing that the President's executive order shows is that he is willing to rip \nfamilies apart unless it costs him politically. If there is a political price to pay, then he will back up and try to confuse \nwhat is really going on. But at the end of the day, this zero-tolerance policy is absolutely wrong and we have to end \nit now. Making unlawful presence a crime is probably a violation of international law. This bill makes it difficult, \nmakes it impossible for people who are seeking asylum to come here and try to get their cases adjudicated. They \nare running, in many cases, from the most abominable situations imaginable. People should know that America is \nthe kind of place you can come to if you are seeking refuge. Let me also say that this thing to build this wall, we will \nnever allow that. We will never agree to that, and we will oppose it with everything we have because it is a symbol \nof hate and division. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side. \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 8 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York \nhas 11 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. \nMadam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa). Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I \nthank the gentleman from New York, Congressman Nadler, for this opportunity to speak on this bill. Madam \nSpeaker, I was hired to work across the aisle, to come to Washington to get things done, to fix problems. Earlier this \nmonth, we had a discharge petition that we needed two more signatures on that would have given us the \nopportunity here on this floor to vote on four immigration bills under the queen-of-the-hill rule. Essentially, that \nmeans that whatever bill gets more votes moves ahead. Among those four bills was Mr. Goodlatte's bill, and, of \ncourse, also one of those bills was the Aguilar-Hurd bill that was a product of both Democrats and Republicans \ncoming together working on a solution. {time} 1245 Unfortunately, we weren't given the opportunity to vote on all \nthese four bills. And the current bill on the floor today does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. Of \ncourse, it does not address the current problem of reuniting children who are separated from their families. Madam \nSpeaker, I ask today, my colleagues, please reject this legislation. And I ask the Speaker to give us the opportunity \nto vote on the Aguilar-Hurd bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho \n(Mr. Labrador), the chairman of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. \nLABRADOR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act. This bill \nprovides the tools needed to enforce our immigration laws, secure our borders, and begin the process of reforming \nour legal immigration system while also ensuring a generous protection for DACA recipients. Enforcement remains \nthe key to our system. Without enforcement, our laws have little effect. This bill targets criminal gangs, dangerous \naliens, and the sanctuary policies that allow these public safety threats to thrive. The bill also provides a permanent \nsolution for DACA recipients. They can apply to receive a 3-year, indefinitely renewable visa so they can live and \nwork in the United States forever, as long as they abide by the laws. This permanent status gives DACA recipients \nmore surety than President Obama's temporary program ever did. The bill will finally make good on our \ncommitment to grant our growers and other workers a workable agricultural guest worker program. The lack of a \nreliable source of labor when an American workforce is simply not available is imperiling the future of American \nagriculture. The bill's H-2C program will be a true guest worker program that will allow the current agricultural \nworkforce to participate on the same terms and conditions as any other worker around the world. The program is \nendorsed by the American Farm Bureau. It is a critical part of this bill. Finally, it closes the loopholes that have \nallowed fraud to destroy the integrity of our asylum system by raising the credible fear standard and sending a clear \nmessage that fraud and frivolity will not be tolerated in the United States. This is a good bill, and I encourage every \nMember to support it. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nLawrence). Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4760, the Securing \nAmerica's Future Act. Instead of working in a bipartisan manner, like open rules and committee hearings, Members \nof this body now must vote on two bills that will hurt immigrant families and communities by worsening the family \nseparation crisis on the border and funding the divisive border wall. H.R. 4760 is a hardline anti-immigration bill that \nfails to provide a permanent path to citizenship for our Dreamers. It makes family reunification much more difficult. It \nprovides $25 billion for the Trump wall. This is while we are going to be confronted with a farm bill that cuts food for \nstarving and poor children in America. It would expand the family separation, and it harms children. [[Page H5427]] \nMadam Speaker, this is not the America I know. This bill is nothing more than an attempt to appease the \nadministration and the most extreme faction of the Republican Party. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I reserve \nthe balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee. \n\n\n\nMs. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, it certainly saddens me to have to come call legislation harsh and cruel; for if \nthere is anything that we should do in a bipartisan or, frankly, nonpartisan manner, it should be the complement to \nthe Statue of Liberty, which, over the centuries, has been the standard-bearer of the values and virtues of this \nNation. I am saddened that we have come to a point, having worked on the Judiciary Committee with outstanding \nleaders like my ranking member, my chairman, the subcommittee ranking, Ms. Lofgren, for many years on real \nimmigration reform, here we are today. Let me tell you why I am opposed to this. It may be because I represent \nAmericans, Americans who are in the 18th Congressional District in Texas. It may be because we are one of the \nmost diverse cities--my mayor says the most diverse city--in the Nation. It may be that we have South Asians and \nHaitians. We have people from Eastern Europe. We have those, of course, who are Latino. We have those from the \nCaribbean, and Africans, and many, many more. We have those from Europe. Here is what this bill will do. It will \nquash any opportunity for mom and dad to bring in extended family members, citizen mom and dad to bring in their \nfamily members. It ends legal immigration and what we have called the values of America, family reunification. At \nthe same time, the ugly name that has been given to diversity visas is not true. Those who come through the \ndiversity visa for small countries--should we discriminate against small countries?--have the highest level of \neducation and go into medicine and science and try to help. Then there is no relief for DACA. People who are \nmilitary, paramedics, lawyers, teachers, we are dependent upon them, having grown up here, loving this Nation, \npledging to the flag, pledging to the United States flag. Then, finally, let me say that it is a sin and a shame that we \nhave such an administration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. \nMadam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Then, as we \nhave not done anything for DACA, we have not done anything for the children snatched away from their families, \nthe children that I saw for 2 days on the border at Texas--Roger, who I held in my hands; maybe the 2-year-old like \nthis--because what it does is it does nothing to reunite the children. It does nothing, after 20 days, to be able to \nprotect them, because the fake executive order does not go beyond 20 days. Frankly, we don't know where the \n2,000 children are, and I know the values of the faith community in America are to reunite. I am saddened that we \nhave this bill. I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton). Mr. BARTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the pending legislation \nbefore us. I believe it is very important that we show that we do want to address this issue, and I think the \nGoodlatte-McCaul bill does that in a humane way. Now, we have this issue of separation of children that has arisen \nat the border just in the last week or so. The Trump policy is not any different on paper than the Obama policy was. \nWhat is different is the way it has been covered, and President Trump has realized that something needs to be \ndone differently and has signed an executive order yesterday to that effect. I personally think that we ought to go \nback to the original policy where, if you wanted political asylum, you applied at the embassy or the consulate in your \nhome country. And if you bring your children, and you march them across the deserts of Mexico, and you bring \nthem all the way to the Texas border, you do get a court hearing, but I would say that we give that court hearing \nback in their country of origin. And if we have to send them back at taxpayer expense, we deduct the cost from \nexisting aid packages that we are giving to those home countries. That way, they don't have to come all the way to \nthe Texas border or the California border or the Arizona border or the New Mexico border in order to get their day in \ncourt. They wait in their home country, and then they get their day in court there. Nobody wants to separate \nfamilies, but it is the parents who bring the children with them. It is not the United States Government that is forcing \nthose parents to try to come to this country illegally and bring their children. The Goodlatte bill funds border security. \nIt begins to solve some of the issues of the lottery system. I personally think it is much better to have a merit-based \nimmigration system than a lottery system where you just happen to, luck of the draw, get a come-into-the-United-\nStates card. I think this is a good piece of legislation, and I hope we pass it this afternoon. Mr. NADLER. Madam \nSpeaker, how much time is remaining, please? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has \n6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I \nyield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I \nrise today in strong opposition to this cruel, anti-immigrant bill. This bill is so bad, they even want to destroy legal \nimmigration to this country. For decades, our immigration laws were discriminatory, favoring Nordic and Western \nEuropeans, restricting Italians and Jews, and banning the Chinese completely. Finally, in 1965, during the civil \nrights era, Senator Ted Kennedy ushered in a fair immigration system based on family reunification. Because this \nsystem brings families together, immigrant households are less likely to rely on public benefits. And immigrants are \nalso buying homes and starting businesses at a faster rate. But now, with this bill, Republicans are trying to undo \nthat progress and make America White again. Worse, they are tearing families apart to do this. While Trump and \n\n\n\nRepublicans are ripping parents from children at the border, they are trying to do the same through our immigration \nlaws. This war on families must stop. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, this afternoon, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent an alert to Members of \nCongress that says the cuts to legal immigration in this bill are bad news for States. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 \nminute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to \nthe Securing America's Future Act. It is obscene to bring this deeply flawed bill to the floor when thousands of \nchildren have been ripped from their parents. Americans across the country are outraged over the Trump \nadministration's actions to separate families at the border. And Trump's answer? An executive order that cages \nfamilies indefinitely and will be immediately challenged in court. Unfortunately, this bill before us would do nothing to \nstop any of this. Instead, it criminalizes every undocumented man, woman, and child in this country and subjects \nthem to the same cruel policy being played out at our border. It is shocking we are even considering this bill. Let's \nbe on the right side of history. Let's stop tearing families apart. Let's stop caging people fleeing violence. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the right thing and defeat this repugnant bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I continue to \nreserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lee). [[Page H5428]] {time} 1300 Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me the \ntime and for his tireless advocacy. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4760. This is an anti-\nimmigrant bill, plain and simple: It fails to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers; it dismantles family \nimmigration; it ends the important diversity visa lottery program; it funds $30 billion for Trump's border wall; and it \nfails to address the horrible zero- tolerance policy. Why are we moving forward with a bill that does not address the \nmalicious detention of families seeking asylum, a bill that does nothing to reunite the 2,300 children separated from \ntheir parents? These policies are really a disgrace and a stain on our country. Just imagine the horrors of these \nfamilies fleeing violence, domestic abuse, but we are not providing refuge. No. Our government--our government--\nhas been ripping children out of the arms of parents. We are holding kids in cages. And now the Trump \nadministration wants to leave whole families, including young children, in jail for extended periods of time. Locking \nup kids is child abuse. It is a violation of their human rights. We must ensure that these children are reunited with \ntheir families. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. And as my colleague \nCongresswoman Chu said, it is about making America White again. Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I reserve \nthe balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me the time. Madam \nSpeaker, this bill does many things, but the one thing that it does not do is heal the wound in the soul of America. It \ndoes not provide a pathway for these babies to return home to their parents. This bill is about as bad as it can get if \nyou care about what you see in this picture. Children should not become the tools of the trade for politicians. This \nbill will legitimize children as the tools of the trade. We cannot pass it. We should not pass it. We must rethink what \nwe are doing to this country. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro \ntempore (Mr. Holding). The gentleman from New York has from 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from \nVirginia has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking member of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee. Ms. \nLOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a step in the wrong direction in so many ways. I wish that we had had an \nopportunity to sit down, reason together, and come up with a plan that really serves our country. That didn't happen. \nHere is what the result was: The Chamber of Commerce has just reported that the Niskanen Center that they have \nrelied on indicates that, if this bill became law, the U.S. would lose $319 billion in GDP. That would be the impact, \naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for adopting this bill. And I wonder what my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are really doing by turning every undocumented person in the United States, currently a civil law \nviolation, into a crime. We are now creating 11 million prosecution opportunities. At the same time, The Washington \nPost is just reporting, this is the headline: ``Trump Administration Will Stop Prosecuting Migrant Parents Who \nCross the Border Illegally with Children, Official Says.'' What are we doing here? We are doing a bill that would \nincarcerate families and children to pursue a policy that the administration now says they don't intend to pursue. \nNow, I don't have a lot of trust in the Trump administration because it changes daily. The SPEAKER pro tempore. \nThe time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from California. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to take a step back here. Your President has left you out on a limb. He just sawed that limb off for a bill that \ndoes damage to the country for a policy that he now has apparently abandoned. This is a ridiculous situation here. \nMr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I \n\n\n\nhave remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. \nNADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a harsh anti-immigrant \npackage that fails to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and that fails to end family separation, while \nslashing legal immigration, crippling our agriculture industry, criminalizing undocumented immigrants, undermining \npublic safety, and removing critical protection for families and children, all in one monstrous bill. Mr. Speaker, there \nis no justification for anyone voting for this bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first of all, \nthis bill has been mischaracterized and was just again. This bill makes provisions for when the immigration service \nprosecutes somebody at the border. It doesn't tell them when to do that. So it is entirely incorrect to make that \nassertion. I see the conflicting news reports about what the intention of the administration is today on that issue, \nbut that does not change the fact that that has nothing to do with the good measures in this bill that correct the \nproblems that we are speaking about. The overwhelming majority of the American people want children to be with \ntheir parents, and I have just seen a poll a few minutes ago that shows that the overwhelming majority of them want \nthose children detained with their parents, not to have the parents and the children released into the interior of the \ncountry where they never return for their hearing. That kind of open border policy that is supported by the advocates \non the other side of the aisle is not good for America, and it is not good for sound immigration policy. We are a \nnation of immigrants. There is not a person in this room who can't go back a few generations or several generations \nand find someone in their family who immigrated to the United States. But we are also a nation of laws, and respect \nfor the rule of law and following our legal immigration system is the foundation of our society. So, to me, when you \nsay that it is not good enough to do better for the DACA recipients than Barack Obama did, where do you get that \nidea from? When you say that we are not a generous country with regard to immigration and that this is an anti-\nimmigration bill when it sustains far more legal immigration than any other country on Earth, they are completely \nwrong. But at the same time that we do that and we promote that in this bill, good legal immigration policy and \nsomething fair for the DACA recipients, we must also have secure borders in our country, and we must give any \nadministration, not just this one, the tools it needs to close the loopholes to secure the border and to end crazy \nprograms like the visa lottery program that gives 55,000 green cards to people just based on pure luck. There are \nbetter things to do with those green cards to move to a merit-based immigration system. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation, reject the negative ideas of the opposition, and move forward with a policy that \ndoes both something important for the DACA recipients but also secures America's national security interests and \nthe interests of our citizens. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise \ntoday because we finally have the opportunity to secure our borders once and for all. [[Page H5429]] Before coming \nto Congress, I was a counterterrorism prosecutor in the Justice Department. I saw the threats along our border \nfirsthand. After getting elected to the House, the very first bill I introduced put an end to this catch-and-release \nsystem. Here we are in this Chamber 14 years later, and I am still fighting for it. Doing nothing should not be an \noption. As I have said before, it is time for Congress to act. Today, we have an historic opportunity to fix this \nproblem once and for all with the Securing America's Future Act. Our legislation delivers on the President's four \npillars, which I worked closely with him on. It secures the border by building a wall, ends chain migration and the \ndiversity lottery, provides a rational DACA solution, and also deploys new technology and adds boots on the \nground. We must move toward a moral, merit-based system and not a random system. This legislation also \nprovides, Mr. Speaker, a legal solution that will keep families together when they cross the border illegally. Our bill \nbrings a generational change that prevents us from revisiting these problems down the road. But this isn't just about \nclosing loopholes and fixing broken laws. Border security is a national security issue. Violent gangs like MS-13, \nhuman traffickers and smugglers sneaking into our country infect our neighborhoods, and too many lives are at risk, \nand opioids come across the border. Unfortunately, the threats do not stop there. We know that international \nterrorists are trying to exploit our border. This was made clear from the materials found in bin Laden's compound \nand from propaganda outlets like Inspire magazine. The 9/11 Commission report even stated that predecessors to \nal-Qaida had been exploiting weaknesses in our border security since the 1990s. In April, Secretary Nielsen \ntestified that ISIS has encouraged its followers to cross our southwest border, given the loopholes that they are also \naware of. We must solve this problem, and we must solve it today. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and give the American people the security that they have long demanded and deserve. Mr. \nSpeaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4760, a bill that doubles down on the President's cruel zero-\n\n\n\ntolerance policy. This harsh anti-immigrant, anti-American bill is the realization of the President's cruel immigration \nand border security rhetoric and policies. Remember when the Republican Party used to say it was the party of \nfamily values? H.R. 4760 is focused on families, but not in a good way. It is focused on separating families, \nincarcerating families, and eliminating pathways for family-based immigration. Remember when the Republican \nParty used to say it was the party of law and order? Well, it does take action with respect to local law enforcement, \nbut not in a good way. It would withhold Homeland Security and other law enforcement grants from so-called \nsanctuary cities that, for the purpose of public safety, seek to foster trust from immigrant communities. Law \nenforcement officials across the country oppose this provision because it would make their communities less safe. \nFor example, Latinos in three major cities have been reporting fewer crimes since President Trump took office, \nparticularly as it relates to domestic violence and sexual assault. Finally, remember when the Republican Party \nused to say it was the party of fiscal discipline? Well, no more. {time} 1315 If enacted, H.R. 4760, would require \nbillions of taxpayers' dollars to be wasted on the President's border walls, which I seem to recall hearing that it will \nbe paid for by the Mexican Government. Now they want the taxpayers of America to pay for it. It also waives the \npaygo scorecard. So now you pull a hat trick. You spend the money, but you don't score it. So, ultimately, it won't \nshow up in our budget numbers. Shame on you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 4760, and I \nreserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in \npersonalities toward the President. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. \nMcSally), the chair of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the \nchairman for his years of hard work on this issue to secure our border. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n4760, the Securing America's Future Act. As one of only nine Members of Congress who represent communities \nalong our southern border, and as the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee chair, I have witnessed firsthand \nthe security threats we face from an unsecure border and the dysfunctions of our immigration system. Since I came \nto Congress, I have been working passionately to protect Arizonans from the public safety threats that accompany a \nporous border, and to start to fix a dysfunctional immigration system. This bill which we have been tirelessly working \non since September last year, along with Chairman McCaul, Chairman Goodlatte, and Congressman Labrador, \nrepresent an important step to keep our country safe by securing the border, including building the wall, closing \nmany legal loopholes, ending chain migration, ending the visa lottery, cracking down on sanctuary cities and MS-13 \ngangs, and providing a legislative solution to the DACA population that is reasonable and fair and doesn't \nincentivize more illegal activity in the future. This is the first legislation on these topics in the House that President \nTrump has supported, and we worked very closely with the administration in the process to propose this thoughtful \nsolution to fix these very real and complex security and economic challenges. Like many pieces of legislation \nthough, this bill is not perfect. There are many improvements, such as the guaranteed funding mechanism for \nborder security, including the wall, and other technical corrections that we worked on over the last 6 months that I \nsure would have liked to have seen in this version of the bill on the floor. Nonetheless, I strongly support passage of \nthis legislation as the first significant proposal to solve these very serious issues that continue to impact \ncommunities in Arizona and the rest of the country. I remain ready to lead and help deliver legislation to the \nPresident's desk that he can sign into law. I would urge our colleagues, especially on the other side of the aisle, \nwho say they care about border security and DACA recipients, to not play politics and vote ``yes'' on this bill. Mr. \nTHOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), \nthe retired chief of police of Orlando, Florida. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, during my 27 years in law enforcement, \nI fought many threats to our families. But today, I have to say that I am ashamed that our leaders now say that \nthose families are the threat. Families seeking asylum are not a threat. Toddlers and children at the border are not a \nthreat. Dreamers who are brought here as young children, both of us know, are not a threat. Mr. Speaker, I ask: \nWhy is it so easy to reject those who we believe are different from us? We will not allow this administration to make \nAmerica a country that only accepts the rich and well-connected. When we know better, we are supposed to do \nbetter. And so I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you are right, let's stop playing politics. Let's do \nbetter and reject this dangerous piece of legislation. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. \nSpeaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018. I am a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. I remind all of my colleagues that a sovereign nation cannot stand without sovereign borders. I remind \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we are Representatives of citizens of the 50 sovereign [[Page H5430]] \nStates of America. We have not been elected by citizens of Mexico or Nicaragua or El Salvador. We represent \nAmerican interests. This is an America-first bill that secures America's southern border. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of \n\n\n\nmy colleagues to embrace their oath and to recognize their service to these citizens that depend upon sound, \ndecisive measures from this body. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the sovereignty of \nour country, but we also recognize its diversity, and we all are immigrants. So let's get over it. Mr. Speaker, I yield \n1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice). Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is a shame \nthat we are wasting our time today on two bills that are harmful and hyperpartisan when we all know that the USA \nAct, introduced by Representatives Aguilar and Hurd, have the votes to pass on this House floor. This bipartisan \nsolution would finally provide our Dreamers, college students, veterans, servicemembers, and business owners with \nthe status and certainty that they have long deserved. The USA Act would also effectively secure our borders \nwithout wasting taxpayer money on a wall that would not make us any safer. The bills being considered today are \nsimply not what most Americans want. They deny Dreamers a path to citizenship. They abandon our obligation to \nprotect those fleeing persecution and violence. And they do nothing to reunite the families who have already been \ntorn apart by the Trump administration. Mr. Speaker, I urge you to do the responsible thing, to finally govern, and \nallow the bipartisan USA Act to come to the floor. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Estes), a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise \ntoday in support of H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act. Mr. Speaker, our immigration system is broken. For \ndecades, administrations have offered temporary fixes or chosen to not enforce certain provisions of the law. \nHowever, the election of President Trump shows a clear desire by the American people to fix our broken \nimmigration system and secure our border. The Securing America's Future Act addresses these issues and \nprovides needed solutions. The bill secures our border by authorizing a wall, providing new border technology, and \nputting more boots on the ground. The bill refocuses legal immigration on skills that are needed by ending the visa \nlottery program and chain migration. It also prevents future illegal immigration by mandating E-Verify for employers \nand cracking down on sanctuary cities. Important for my State of Kansas, this bill includes H-2C agricultural visas \nwhich allows people to come work and provide the skills our farmers need. Finally, this bill gives stability to children \nbrought here illegally by providing a renewable legal status as long as recipients pay taxes and obey the law, \nwithout providing a special path to citizenship because no one should get to jump the line. Mr. THOMPSON of \nMississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. \nJACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding the time. I would offer to say that \nthose Guatemalan Americans, El Salvadoran Americans, those Americans from the country of Mexico, and others \nwho serve in the United States military, certainly reflect the diversity of this Nation. I would offer to say that, sadly, \nthis is the image that is America today. It is not the Statue of Liberty. I stand to oppose this bill because I know, as a \nmember of the Homeland Security Committee, we had a plan that was bipartisan that would provide for border \nsecurity that included technology and barriers. Now, we have succumbed to a process which every good-thinking \nperson has to oppose, including the business community. Law enforcement opposes this legislation, in particular, \nbecause it makes communities less safe. Just this week a Texas sheriff's deputy was arrested for sexually \nassaulting a 4-year-old girl and threatening to deport the undocumented mother if she reported the claim. Good law \nenforcement officers understand that they need to have people report the crime. We know that it was an immigrant, \na researcher, who helped us get the polio vaccine. Finally, young people who now are coming to this country, \nsnatched away from their parents, unaccompanied youngsters as well, will no longer have the protections of the \nspecial immigrant juvenile status. It strips crucial protections for abused, abandoned, and neglected children by \nlimiting their ability to access special immigrant juvenile status. This bill is a bad bill. It is not an immigration bill. It is \na bad bill and it really is not for the American people. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), the newest member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mrs. LESKO. \nMr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act, vital legislation to the State of \nArizona. My constituents back home know all too well how desperately we need our borders secured. I signed on \nas a cosponsor of this bill because it will fund a wall and other protective infrastructure, close the gaping loopholes \nin our immigration laws, and finally secure our southern border, ending this problem once and for all. It is \ndisappointing that with all of the rhetoric coming from my colleagues across the aisle, they still refuse to come to the \nnegotiating table and work toward a legislative solution. Our broken immigration system cannot continue to be \nignored. I want to thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Goodlatte for their work on this much-needed legislation, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as you heard, H.R. 4760 is fatally flawed. We are here only today debating it \nbecause the Republican leadership was essentially extorted by extremists within its ranks. Instead, we should be \nhere debating legislation to give Dreamers a path to citizenship. We should be here debating legislation to give safe \n\n\n\nhaven to refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Sudan, and Nicaragua. We should be here debating a measure to end \nzero tolerance and family separation. Even before the Trump administration created this family separation crisis, \nAmerica's image was suffering the effects of the Trump slump due to the President's inflammatory and cruel \nimmigration and border security policies and rhetoric. In fact, last June, the Pew Research Center released an \ninternational survey that concluded that sentiment regarding the U.S. had taken a dramatic turn for the worse. What \nthe President and supporters of H.R. 4760 do not understand is that what makes America great is its people, both \nnative-born and immigrants. Let's send a message to the President that we know what makes America great. Let's \ndefeat H.R. 4760. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are \nreminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume. Let me say, this is a historic opportunity to get something done that we probably \nhaven't gotten done in 25 years. But let me first say that I am a father of five children. I have been down to the \ndetention centers and seen these kids down there, these babies. From a human standpoint, it is one of the most \nhorrible experiences I have had in my lifetime. Let me say this, Mr. Speaker: this bill protects our children. It \nprotects our children because it provides a deterrent for them not to come here in the first place. It also keeps \nfamilies together and doesn't separate them, as current law dictates. Current law dictates this, if we don't change \nthe law. Let me also add, I talked to the Secretary today and 10,000 of these 12,000 children who are in the \ndetention centers came without their parents. And [[Page H5431]] who were their guardians: the drug traffickers, the \nsmugglers, and the coyotes, as they made the dangerous journey from Central America all the way up through \nMexico and into the United States. {time} 1330 I have seen horrors of that, and this bill will provide the deterrence to \nstop that from happening because, as we know, they are abused on the way up that journey. They are abused \nphysically and sexually and demoralized and recruited. That has to stop, and, Mr. Speaker, this bill will stop that. \nMr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. \nSpeaker, I rise in strong opposition of H.R. 4760, the ``Securing America's Future Act of 2018.'' H.R. 4760 is a \nDREAM Killer Bill that fails to fix our nation's fractured immigration system. This bill slashes legal immigration, it \ncripples our agricultural industry, criminalizes undocumented immigrants, undermines our public safety, and denies \ncritical protections for children and families. H.R. 4760 withholds grants from communities implementing community \ntrust policies that limit law enforcement officials questioning an individual's immigration status. This Republican-\nsponsored bill forces local governments to comply with Trump's mass deportation agenda, despite Republican's \nhistoric demands that the federal government stay out of people's lives. My colleagues and I will never vote in favor \nof a bill that perpetuates the administration's mass deportation agenda, especially in light of the human rights \nviolations we are currently witnessing at our U.S.-Mexico border. When I visited the border this past weekend, what \nI witnessed was horrific. It was not the America that I know and love. Since early May, more than 2,300 children \nhave been separated from their parents. By playing the blame game and putting the burden on Congress to fix what \nPresident Trump alone has started, the Administration issued an Executive Order yesterday that pretends to open \nthe door for a halt of his intentionally barbaric policy of separating families intended to deter people from attempting \nto cross the border. The new policy detains entire families together, including children, but ignores legal time limits \non the detention of minors. The President is ignoring the immigration laws that set the precedent on this arena. The \nFlores Settlement, issued in 1997, was the result of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of immigrant children in the \nU.S. District Court for the Central District of California. It requires the government to release children from \nimmigration detention without unnecessary delay to parents, relatives, or those willing to accept custody. It also \nmandates that the government cannot keep children in detention for over 20 days. Trump's executive order is in \ndirect violation of the Flores agreement by allowing children to be detained for well-over 20 days. H.R. 4760 is a \npolitically motivated bill intended to spread the false narrative that immigrants are criminals, liars, and job stealers \nwho are somehow a drain on our society and deserving of punishment. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nMany of our nation's most beloved and respected figures that are even taught about in schools, were immigrants. \nH.R. unfairly and unnecessarily subjects immigrants to lengthy criminal sentences, as well as excessive detention \nand unreasonable scrutiny. The restrictive features of the bill--including asylum provisions, cancelling the \napplications of 3 million people waiting to immigrate legally, and permanent reductions in legal immigration--we are \ntold are a small price to pay to help Dreamers gain a pathway to citizenship. However, this is not the case. The \nCATO Institute recently reported that 82 percent of Dreamers would not even benefit from this bill's citizenship \npath. H.R. 4760 does not provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers; instead, it denies Dreamers the coveted \nAmerican Dream. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to H.R. 4760, the ``Securing America's Future Act of \n2018.'' This bill offers minimal protections for Dreamers in exchange for implementing Trump's mass deportation \n\n\n\nplan. It includes a litany of bad proposals from the House Judiciary Committee. It eliminates most family-based \nimmigration categories, as well as the diversity visa program. It mandates the use of E-Verify on a nationwide basis, \nthereby crippling industries such as agriculture, restaurants, hotels, construction, and many others. It purports to \naddress concerns in the agricultural industry. But its solution is to replace the 1 to 1.5 million undocumented \nfarmworkers in this country with an army of guest workers at drastically depressed wages. This would undermine \nthe wages and working conditions on farms and a host of other sectors (like forestry, logging, and food processing) \nthat employ many U.S. workers and have never been considered agriculture. It subjects each and every \nundocumented immigrant over the age of 18 to criminal prosecution by making it a crime to be here without \nimmigration status. This would effectively turn most undocumented immigrants--including the parents of the \nDreamers the bill purports to help--into criminals overnight. It undermines our asylum system by establishing \nimpossibly high evidentiary burdens and denying asylum to those that travel through ``so-called'' safe third \ncountries. It removes critical protections for unaccompanied children and creates a scheme to swiftly remove them \nwithout an opportunity to see a judge. It also abolishes important child safety protections for children traveling with \ntheir parents. No Path to Citizenship: In exchange for all of the above, and much more, the bill offers no path to \ncitizenship. Instead, it creates a renewable ``contingent nonimmigrant'' status that would perpetually deny Dreamers \nthe American Dream. Dead on Arrival: We are only voting on this bill to appease members of the House Freedom \nCaucus. A similar bill offered by Senator Grassley only received 39 votes in the Senate. The bill is simply too \nextreme for many Republicans, as indicated by letters of opposition from right-leaning groups such as the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the Koch-brothers funded LIBRE Initiative, and the CATO Institute. Expands Family \nSeparation: The Trump/Sessions zero-tolerance prosecution policy is fueling the wave of family separation at the \nborder. This bill doubles down on the use of criminal prosecution by making unlawful presence a misdemeanor, or a \nfelony under many circumstances. This would exponentially increase family separation in the interior, as it \ntransforms non-violent, civil immigration violations into criminal offenses. The result would be the arrest, conviction, \nand detention of millions of immigrants. Harms Children: Republicans will likely argue that this bill treats \nunaccompanied alien children (UACs) from Central American like those from Mexico and therefore does nothing \nmore than remedy a loophole in the law. But in fact, this bill removes basic protections for all UACs. Among other \nthings, the bill: removes protections for young children aged 13 and under, as well as children with disabilities; \neliminates an existing provision allowing limited government funding for counsel for UACs, relegating many children \nto appear in immigration court without legal representation; requires DHS to investigate and remove all potential \nUAC sponsors. This would both disincentivize sponsors from coming forward to claim children and overburden state \nfoster care systems: eliminates the ability for all UACs to first present their asylum claims to specially trained USCIS \nasylum officers in a non-adversarial setting. UACs would instead be required to present their claims in open court to \nan immigration judge, opposite a trained ICE trial lawyer, and likely without legal representation; and strips crucial \nprotections for abused, abandoned and neglected children by limiting their ability to access Special Immigrant \nJuvenile status. Makes Communities Less Safe: The bill withholds DHS grants and other law enforcement grants \nfrom communities that implement community trust policies that limit or restrict law enforcement questioning of an \nindividual's immigration status. Although Republicans often demand that the federal government stay out of \npeople's lives, the bill forces local governments to cooperate with Trump's mass deportation agenda. Republicans \nhave long sought to turn ``sanctuary cities'' into a pejorative term, but studies show that such jurisdictions have \n``statistically significantly lower'' criminal activity compared to other jurisdictions. Law enforcement officials across \nthe country oppose these provisions because it would make their communities less safe. For example, Latinos in \nthree major cities have been reporting fewer crimes since Trump took office, particularly as it relates to domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. Just this week, a Texas sheriff's deputy was arrested for sexually assaulting a 4-year-\nold girl and threatening to deport the undocumented mother if she reported the crime. If enacted, the bill would \nsupercharge Trump's deportation agenda, thereby turning undocumented immigrants into prey for criminals. \nDestabilizes Agriculture: The bill mandates E-Verify use nationwide, despite the reliance [[Page H5432]] on \nundocumented immigrants by several large sectors of the U.S. economy. To address labor concerns in agriculture \nand various other industries, the bill creates a massive new guestworker program in which undocumented \nfarmworkers may purportedly participate. But the bill's unrealistic and anti-worker provisions would have \ndevastating impacts on those workers, as well as similarly situated U.S. workers and employers. Among other \nthings, the bill provides status to undocumented farmworkers through a ``report to deport'' guestworker program \nthat requires them to first leave the country--including their homes and families--with no assurance that they would \nbe able to return. Few would participate in such a program. The guestworker program would eventually result in \n\n\n\nmillions of guestworkers in the country, and all would be paid at far-below market wages. This combination would \nhave devastating impacts on the labor market-- not only in agriculture, but in other covered industries such as \nlogging, forestry, and food processing. Given what Republicans often say about the need to protect U.S. workers, \nwe cannot see why they would support this bill. Fails to Fix the Broken System: The bill fails to repair our \nfundamentally broken immigration system. H.R. 4760 is simply a politically motivated bill intended to propagate the \nfiction that immigrants are criminals, liars, and job stealers who are somehow a drain on our society and need to be \npunished. Nothing could be further from the truth. Immigrants generally play a positive role in our society, and this \nbill unfairly and unnecessarily subjects them to lengthy criminal sentences, as well as excessive detention and \nunreasonable scrutiny. Republicans have long championed their identity as the ``Party of Lincoln,'' but this bill \nproves that they have clearly become the ``Party of Trump.'' Trump champions nativist fear-mongering, relies on \nalternative facts, and seeks to send America back to the dark ages of isolationism and cultural in-fighting. This is \nthe wrong direction for our country. Family Immigration Led To John Tu's Billion Dollar Company. John Tu created \nwealth, shared that wealth with his employees and demonstrated people can achieve the American Dream while \nalso fulfilling the dreams of others. Immigrant entrepreneurs possess relatively few options for starting a business \nand remaining in the United States. There is no startup visa that allows individuals to receive permanent residence \nspecifically for starting a business. Once someone acquires permanent residence (a green card) he or she has the \nfreedom to start a business in America. That is why the stories we hear about successful foreign-born \nentrepreneurs come almost exclusively from individuals sponsored by an employer or family member. John Tu is a \ngreat example of this. John Tu (No. 87 on the Forbes 400 list) was born in China in 1941, where he lived with his \nparents and sisters. He describes himself as a mediocre student unable to attend the best Chinese colleges. He \nwas denied a visa to the United States and instead applied to a college in Germany, where in 1978 he earned a \ndegree in electrical engineering. ``My dream of coming to the United States persisted,'' said John in testimony \nbefore the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration. He recalled visiting his sister, who was living in Boston. She had \ncome to America as a student and married a U.S. citizen born in Taiwan. That trip reignited his dreams. ``My \nexperience brought me to the conclusion that in the U.S. one can be anything he wants. I decided right then that I \nwould find a way to make my home in America.'' His sister, who became a U.S. citizen, sponsored John for \nimmigration through the immigrant preference category for the siblings of U.S. citizens. As someone willing to take \na chance on a new country, it's not surprising John Tu quickly became an entrepreneur. He started a one-man gift \nshop in Arizona, where his sister had moved to, and sold collectables imported from China. A few years later, John \nventured into commercial real estate, eventually buying a condominium in Los Angeles. In California, he met David \nSun, his future business partner, who also was born in China. In 1982, John Tu and David Sun started a computer \nhardware company called Camintonn Corporation. They later sold the company to AST Research, with each man \nearning about $1 million. But a year later, John and David lost almost everything. Their broker, a trusted friend, \ninvested poorly, which caused their savings to be nearly wiped out in the October 1987 stock market crash. John Tu \nand David Sun picked themselves up and did what entrepreneurs do best--they started another business. Their new \ncompany, Kingston Technology, sought to fill a niche in the marketplace for computer memory products. ``Kingston \nsoon began developing memory products for a variety of PCs and thriving beyond either of our expectations. It is \nironic that from the biggest financial failure came my most successful venture,'' said John. The company grew to \nover 500 U.S. employees and by 1996 was valued at $1.5 billion. Not surprisingly, this attracted the interest of \nbuyers. That year, John and David sold 80 percent of Kingston to Japan-based Softbank Corp. While the sale \ninitially made news, it is what John Tu and David Sun did with the proceeds that generated worldwide attention: The \ntwo men set aside $100 million in profits from the sale and awarded bonuses to their American employees, \nsomething virtually unheard. In many cases, the bonuses ranged from $100,000 to $300,000. This decision \nchanged the lives of those working at Kingston, allowing many to fund dreams for themselves and their children. \n``The bonus meant a great deal to the employees, for some it meant ridding themselves of debt, for others a down \npayment on a house, and for one person the opportunity to return to college and finish his education,'' said Kingston \nemployee Gary McDonald. He decided to use the bonus money to fund schooling and assistance for his four \nchildren, two of whom had special needs, including one with autism. ``Without the bonus it would have been much \nmore of a financial struggle,'' he said. Fate intervened and in July 1999, for business reasons, Softbank decided to \nsell its 80 percent share in Kingston back to John Tu and David Sun for less than half of the original sale price. \nToday, Kingston is ``the world's largest independent manufacturer of memory products,'' according to the company. \nKingston employs more than 3,000 people around the world and maintains its headquarters in Fountain Valley, \nCalifornia. It has garnered a number of awards, including Fortune magazine's list of the ``Best Companies to Work \n\n\n\nfor in America.'' John and his company Kingston contribute to many charitable causes. An Immigrant And An \nImmigrant's Son Saved Americans From Polio. Polio struck future presidents and poor children alike, becoming an \nepidemic that consumed Americans throughout much of the 20th century. Immigrant Albert Sabin and the son of an \nimmigrant, Jonas Salk, developed the vaccines that ended polio as a threat to Americans. Neither Salk or Sabin--or \ntheir life-saving Polio vaccines--would have been in America if not for family immigration. ``Without Sabin and Salk, \nAmerican children would continue to be paralyzed for life by polio,'' Michel Zaffran, director of polio eradication at \nthe World Health Organization, said in an interview. ``Their contribution is quite simply immeasurable.'' Americans \ntoday do not consider polio a threat. That was not always the case. ``No disease drew as much attention, or struck \nthe same terror, as polio,'' according to David Oshinsky, author of the Pulitzer Prizewinning book Polio: An \nAmerican Story. ``Polio hit without warning. There was no way of telling who would get it and who would be spared. \nIt killed some of its victims and marked others for life, leaving behind vivid reminders for all to see: wheelchairs, \ncrutches, leg braces, breathing devices, deformed limbs.'' Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair \nthroughout his presidency, is the most famous victim of polio. But at its approximate height, in 1949, around 40,000 \ncases were reported in America, according to Oshinsky. In San Angelo, Texas, one out of every 124 residents \ncontracted the disease, resulting in 24 deaths and 84 cases of permanent paralysis, affecting mostly children. \nCases of polio first appeared in the U.S. in the 1800s. The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s \nallowed researchers to see the virus that causes the polio infection, which is spread through fecal waste, from one \nperson to another, by hand, food, water and other methods. When Albert Sabin was born in Poland in 1906, \nAmericans could not have known this Polish infant would someday grow up and change their lives. ``When he was \n15, his family came to the United States to escape the murderous pogroms [against Jews] that erupted there \nfollowing World War I,'' according to David Oshinsky. ``The Sabins settled in Paterson, New Jersey, an immigrant \ntextile center, where his father took a job as a weaver. Fluent in Polish and German, but knowing no English, Sabin \nwas tutored by a cousin who encouraged him to avoid the dead-end life of the silk mills by getting an education.'' \nSabin did well in high school, while working to help support the family, and accepted an offer from an uncle who \noffered to pay his college tuition if he agreed to join him as a dentist. Albert did not enjoy studying dentistry and lost \nhis uncle's financial support. [[Page H5433]] In a great example of mentoring, the well-regarded New York \nUniversity (NYU) professor William Hallock Park, a bacteriologist, saw something in Sabin and arranged for a \nscholarship.

Ms. \nMICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from \nNew Mexico? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman is \nrecognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, \nthis is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will \nimmediately proceed to final passage, as amended. When DACA was terminated in September, this Chamber \npromised hundreds of thousands of young people and the American public that we would have a public debate and \nvote to protect Dreamers. We gather here today, instead, to vote on legislation that fails to protect these young \npeople, radically changes our immigration laws, and derails the bipartisan queen-of-the-hill effort that would give us \na solution. H.R. 4760 is a hyperpartisan, sweeping bill which would fundamentally change our legal immigration \nsystem and negatively impact our economy, which is why it is opposed by the majority of the Republican \nConference, faith groups, businesses, chambers, and, quite frankly, everyone in between. If enacted, these policies \nwould undermine local law enforcement, hurt businesses, and rip apart communities through mass deportation, \nwhile telling hundreds of thousands of American Dreamers that they can only be a guest in the only country most of \nthem have ever known, but that they will never truly be American. The truth is that this bill is a poison pill-ridden \neffort that does nothing to get us closer to passing a bipartisan, narrow, and targeted solution for Dreamers. \nCongress--that is each and every one of us--has a responsibility to address this Trump-created crisis in a \nbipartisan, rapid, compassionate, and meaningful way. This is what the American people want us to do. But since \nthe start of the Trump administration, a divisive and twisted narrative has been perpetrated to villainize, scapegoat, \nand hurt immigrant families. This week, the pain of immigrant families was felt by each and every person in America \nwho heard the terror and cries of children being torn from their parents. This week we have experienced the horror \nmany immigrant families feel every single day, and we have seen how ugly it is to use vulnerable immigrant \nchildren, mothers, and fathers as political pawns. But we have also seen Americans stand up for these families. We \nsaw them rebuke the President and his heinous policy. Today we must do the same thing by standing up for \nDreamers. We must meet our responsibility as Members of Congress by voting for legislation that fixes this Trump- \ncreated DACA crisis, not by voting for legislation that makes it worse. [[Page H5437]] Every time that a bipartisan fix \nfor Dreamers is within our reach, this chaotic Republican Conference caves to those who aim to exploit Dreamers in \norder to impose radical changes to our immigration system. The provisions in H.R. 4760's partisan anti-immigrant \nbill betray our most fundamental American values. It is a reflection of the xenophobic agenda of the Trump White \nHouse which prioritizes billions upon billions on a wasteful wall, cuts legal immigration, and ends our obligation to \n\n\n\nprotect Dreamers. This is the latest example of Republicans putting Trump's anti- immigrant demands above moral \ndecency, families, Dreamers, and the will of the American people. It is indefensible and immoral that this House \ncontinues to derail bipartisan efforts to protect Dreamers. The antics that we are witnessing are why the American \npeople have lost faith that their Representatives can find bipartisan solutions to our Nation's most pressing issues. \nBut as a Member of Congress in the minority party at a time of deep political division and instability, I still believe it \nis possible for us to work together to improve the well-being of families, children, and young people. Mr. Speaker, \nthat is why I am asking and I am imploring you to join me in voting for the bipartisan Dream Act that upholds our \nvalues and fulfills our promise to protect Dreamers and their families. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro \ntempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong \nopposition to this effort to distract us from the major problems that we are attempting to address in our country. This \nmotion to recommit only--only--deals with amnesty for a far larger population of people than the American people \nexpect to have addressed. The people who are the DACA recipients are people who arrived here as young children \nbefore June 15, 2007. This bill does nothing to solve the problem with the surge of people at the border of our \ncountry. It does nothing to create a new border security wall and fencing system, technology and personnel who are \nneeded, and judges in courtrooms to process the huge number--the 600,000 backlog--of amnesty cases that we \nhave. This does nothing to close the loopholes that are allowing people to enjoy what is called catch and release. \nWhen they come into the country, some of them even turn themselves in knowing that, ultimately, they are going to \nbe released into the interior of the United States. We need to give the administration the tools they need to stop this \nproblem. It is not a new problem. The Obama administration wanted a number of the changes that are in this bill \nwith regard to clarifying things like the terrible Flores decision, which is at the heart of the problem we have with \nyoung children being separated from their parents. We fix those things in this legislation, and yet this would \nsubstitute all of that for something that is just targeted at what the other party wants to do. And they call upon us to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. This bill addresses all of the areas that need to be addressed, and they give lip service \nto the other areas, but they do not address them. This is proof of that by the fact that it only deals with amnesty. We \nneed to have a movement to a merit-based immigration system. We need to end the terrible visa lottery system, \nwhich is a national security problem and which is something that does not benefit the American economy. We need \nto move from chain migration to a merit-based system, and we need to make sure that we treat the DACA \nrecipients better than they are treated under the unconstitutional, illegal Obama process, but not at the cost of not \ndoing the other three pillars that we are seeking to address. We need to address border security and interior \nenforcement; we need to end the visa lottery and move to a merit-based system; and we need to end chain \nmigration. It also doesn't have anything about E-Verify or helping 1 million agricultural guest workers who want to \nwork in this country legally and the farmers who want to have a system that allows them to do that legally. This is \nthe bill that we need to pass, not this motion to recommit. I urge my colleague to oppose the motion to recommit \nand support the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro \ntempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker \npro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM. Mr. Speaker, on that \nI demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 \nof rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of the \npassage of the bill.
