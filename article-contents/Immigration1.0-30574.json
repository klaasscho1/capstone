{"title": "Falling behind on training workers", "body": "\nMichael A. Fletcher's reporting on the bitter irony facing the Fresno, Calif., workforce - an achingly high \nunemployment rate coexisting with a panoply of unfilled job openings for skilled workers [front page, Feb. 2] - said \nas much, if not more, about the need for comprehensive immigration reform as it did about the need for worker \ntraining.  \n\nThe fact is that under even the rosiest scenarios, bringing workers up to speed takes time. Time that an overseas \ncompetitor can use to put American companies out of business. The article added to the overwhelming body of \nevidence that the correlation between hiring immigrant workers and taking American jobs is a false one. The truth \nis that the law as it stands offers companies two choices: Move the jobs overseas to where the workers are, or \nshutter the doors. In either case, American workers lose.\n\nThe writer is an immigration attorney. \n"}
