{"title": "Labor Dept. cites error in missed Sun hiring notices", "body": "\nThe U.S. Department of Labor said Sun Microsystems made a clerical error in failing to post notices about hiring \nforeign workers but didn't break any laws. The finding is being appealed.\n\nThe case is one of two federal probes into Sun Microsystems' use of the H-1B work visa program, both triggered \nwhen a laid-off engineer complained that the Santa Clara company was favoring foreign engineers on temporary H-\n1B work visas over U.S. citizens. In the other case, the U.S. Department of Justice has not yet made any findings.\n\nAccording to a Labor Department letter, Sun erred in not posting preliminary applications, as required by the \ndepartment's rules, for H-1B workers in its offices in Sunnyvale and Austin, Texas. The Labor Department said the \nviolations didn't merit punishment because they weren't \"substantial\" or \"willful\" and didn't involve back pay to \nemployees. According to the letter, Sun has agreed to post the preliminary applications in the future.\n\nSun spokeswoman Diane Carlini said the company was pleased the case was closed.\n\n\"The DOL found no material or intentional violation of the law and determined that no civil or other penalty was \ncalled for,\" she said. \"We are pleased this matter has been resolved and that Sun has been cleared of any \nwrongdoing.\"\n\nGuy Santiglia, the 37-year-old engineer who filed the complaint and is appealing the finding, said he thought the \nposting violation was serious.\n\n\"The posting requirement is a major worker protection built into the H-1B regulation,\" Santiglia said. \"The fact that \nSun was found to have violated that regulation should not be trivialized as a 'clerical error.' \"\n\nContact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660.  \n"}
