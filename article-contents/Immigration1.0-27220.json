{"title": "Immigration Agency to Reveal Some Death Data; DHS Bureau Will Report the Number of People Who Die Awaiting Deportation", "body": "\nThe top U.S. immigration enforcement official told a congressional subcommittee yesterday that the Bush \nadministration will disclose more information about foreigners who die in the sprawling network of federal detention \ncenters around the country.\n\nJulie Myers, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nbureau, said her agency will report such deaths to a branch of the Justice Department that collects similar \ninformation about inmates in state prisons and local jails.\n\nThe Justice Department publishes statistics on the fatalities, not the identities of the victims, but Myers said the \nchange represents \"more transparency\" about detainee deaths. Since last year, congressional Democrats have \npleaded with ICE to reveal the names and circumstances of foreigners who have died in U.S. custody.\n\nMyers announced the new reporting requirement during a congressional hearing on medical care for immigration \ndetainees, the first since The Washington Post published a series of articles last month that documented a broken \nsystem of care for the growing number of foreigners who are imprisoned while the government tries to deport \nthem.\n\nThe articles, based on thousands of pages of internal documents, found that 83 detainees had died since ICE was \ncreated five years ago and that many more sick and mentally ill people have been denied the treatment to which \nthey are entitled. The Post found medical staff shortages, treatment delays, sloppy record-keeping, poor \nadministrative practices and cover-ups by employees aware of the poor care.\n\nYesterday's hearing was partisan and testy. Myers said ICE has been working to improve the health-care system. \nBut detainees, their lawyers and relatives, and advocates for immigrants offered graphic testimony about \nmisdiagnoses, medical neglect and secrecy.\n\n\nICE officials \"are defending the indefensible,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee's immigration subcommittee. \"Whatever you think about the overall debate on immigration,\" Lofgren \nsaid in an interview, \"you are not supposed to kill people who are in custody.\"\n\nRep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) countered, \"Why should the American people be responsible for paying for Rolls-\nRoyce medical care for illegal aliens?\"\n\nMyers and committee Republicans said that ICE figures show that the rate of deaths among detainees has fallen in \nrecent years, and that fewer people die in immigration detention than in prison.\n\nBut one witness, who works in detention centers with foreigners seeking asylum in the United States, disputed \nICE's claims, saying that health care in detention centers \"is getting worse, not better.\" Homer Venters, a physician \nat the Bellevue-New York University Program for Survivors of Torture, said ICE's assertion that deaths among \ndetainees fell by 49 percent between 2006 and 2007 is misleading.\n\nVenters said those figures ignore the fact that detainees are, on average, spending less time in custody. Taking the \nlength of stay into account, he testified, the mortality rate during that period increased by 20 percent.\n\nVenters said ICE's assertion that fewer people die in immigration detention than in prison also is misleading \nbecause detainees tend to be younger and in custody for less time than prisoners.\n\nDemocrats grilled Myers about The Post's findings that more than 250 detainees had been sedated with powerful \npsychotropic drugs for their deportation over the past five years, even though they were not mentally ill. ICE has \nrecently changed its rules to require permission from a federal judge before detainees are drugged for behavioral \nreasons. Myers said yesterday that the agency has sought four such court orders, all of which are pending.\n\nStaff writer Spencer S. Hsu contributed to this report.\n"}
