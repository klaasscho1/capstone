{"title": "ZIGLAR IS LEADING CANDIDATE FOR INS POST", "body": "\nJames W. Ziglar, the Senate's sergeant-at-arms, is the leading candidate to become the next commissioner of \nimmigration and naturalization, Republican aides said.\n\nZiglar, 55, a native of Mississippi and boyhood friend of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, would, if nominated and \nconfirmed, assume control over one of the government's fastest-growing and most troubled agencies. A top priority \nfor a new commissioner would be fulfilling Bush's pledge to split the INS into two agencies, one to enforce \nimmigration laws, and the other to provide services to immigrants.\n\nNotes\n\nNational\nIn Brief\n"}
