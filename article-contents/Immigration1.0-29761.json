{"title": "Los Angeles immigration protesters rolling to Arizona", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES   Hundreds of Southern Californians are rolling to Arizona this morning to protest the state's new \nimmigration law, a day after a federal judge put its key measures on hold.\n\nNearly a dozen chartered carrying immigrant-rights activists left Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for the ride to \nPhoenix.\n\nThe new law taking effect Thursday was designed to crack down on illegal immigration but critics say it \nencourages racism against Hispanics.\n\nA federal judge in Phoenix on Wednesday issued a temporary injunction delaying the most contentious provisions, \nincluding a requirement that immigrants carry their papers and that police check a person's immigration status \nwhile enforcing other laws.\n\nArizona's governor says she'll appeal the ruling.\n"}
