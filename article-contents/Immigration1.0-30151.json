{"title": "A shriek by any other name", "body": "\n A FRIEND TOLD me someone had tied him up chattering on the phone\n\n\"It was a woman, right?\" I said.\n\n\"How did you know?\" he asked.\n\nSimple. The word \"chattering.\"\n\nWhen it comes to words describing speech, we seem to have two separate, often-loaded vocabularies for men and \nwomen. And they tell us a lot.\n\nLet's see, for women, there are words like chattering, gossiping, chitchatting, giggling, tittering, cackling, prattling, \nscreaming, screeching, babbling, jabbering, shrieking, squealing, whining, nagging, shrill, strident (this last usually \napplied to feminists). And don't forget gabfest or hen party. Most are pejorative or critical.\n\nFor men, there are words like roaring, bellowing, grunting, guffawing. Not exactly words that permit men \ntenderness or sensitivity.\n\nThere are, of course, neutral words like shouting, drawling, yelling, whispering.\n\nThe examples are everywhere.\n\nA review in a newspaper describes a group of people as clawing and gossiping. Hmmm, which sex would that be?\n\nIn karate class, a man refers to a cat fight. Women, right? What would it be between men? A slugfest? There's a \ndifferent image there.\n\nA man refers to his wife's conversation as yakking, a word used mostly for women.\n\nWe use hysterical mainly for upset women. No matter how upset a man may be, it's unlikely we would label him \nhysterical.\n\nThese words for women's speech developed partly because some of the things women talk about - basics like \nchild care and food preparation - tended traditionally to interest men less and capture the world's attention less.\n\nWoven through the words is the idea that women's speech is less important. The words serve to mock it.\n\nBut wait, maybe we have all those negative words for women talking because women talk all the time. No, that \ncan't be it. Numerous studies have shown that men talk more than women.\n\n\nRestrictive language hurts both women and men. The words we use for either sex reflect what we think is \nappropriate and limit our use of the full range of human emotions.\n\nTake the word \"roaring,\" usually used for men, and \"shrieking,\" usually used for women. The one for men implies a \nlow voice and one for women a high voice. But the value we put on them is not neutral. Roaring, while perhaps not \ndesirable, clearly is more powerful and effective than shrieking.\n\nOr consider the words \"sissy\" and \"tomboy.\" It's bad for a man to be a sissy, because he is using what are \nconsidered female traits. It says two things: Be careful about exhibiting nurturing behavior, and female is a way to \nbe made fun of. \"Tomboy\" suggests to girls that it is not good to show too many \"male\" traits such as \naggressiveness. But tomboy isn't all bad since it is more acceptable to try to be like men than like women.\n\nI'm not suggesting we give up all these words. The English language is a rich and wonderful instrument.\n\nInstead, we can consider whether we sometimes want to mix up the words. Men giggling and gossiping. Women \nroaring and guffawing. Not too hard to imagine.\n\nSandy Hill is deputy features editor of The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer.\n"}
