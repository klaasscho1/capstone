{"title": "Looking at Sachem Group In Farmingville", "body": "\nA letter to the editor Oct. 29 paints the Sachem Quality of Life Organization as a racist, bigoted group. In actuality \nwhat this group wants is one thing. They wish the government to enforce the law. Hundreds of thousands of people \nenter this country illegally every year. Studies have shown that this flood of people keep wages lower then they \nwould be. The people who are harmed most are minority citizens who are displaced from entry-level jobs. The ones \nwho gain are employers, who save money on wages. In addition this illegal immigration is a cause of overcrowding \nof our schools and increased taxes.\n\nIs it racist for concerned citizens to want their government to enforce the law? Is it racist to be concerned about \novercrowded schools and declining housing values? Our already generous country allows more legal immigration \nthan the rest of the world combined. Illegal immigration, no matter of what nationality, race or country of origin, \nshould not be tolerated.\n\n \n\nROBERT F. LaPORTA\n\nDix Hills\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
