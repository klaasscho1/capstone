{"title": "PROSECUTORS DROP CASE AGAINST SERB", "body": "\nTAMPA\n\nFederal prosecutors moved Wednesday to dismiss charges against Branko Popic, accused of lying on \nimmigration forms about his involvement in the Serb military.\n\nThe government will not seek a third trial in Popic's case. Two previous trials ended with hung juries. One jury split \n11-1 in favor of convicting Popic. But the second jury split 11-1 for acquittal.\n\nPopic, 59, was the first Serb to be tried in Tampa federal court as part of a sweep by the U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement Department to find soldiers involved in the massacre of Srebrenica. The local defendants, \nwho all live in St. Petersburg, aren't accused of direct participation in war crimes, but prosecutors say they may \nhave served in units that were involved.\n\nNone of the men to stand trial so far has been convicted.\n\nLARGO\n\nFoster care task force takes comments today\n\nPeople with an opinion about how foster care is run can speak today to a special task force studying the Safe \nChildren Coalition of Pinellas and Pasco counties.\n\nThe state Department of Children and Families created the task force after a critical report about its handling of a 2-\nyear-old foster girl who disappeared for nine months.\n\nAuthorities say her mother kidnapped her from a Lake County foster home.\n\nIt took her caseworker four months to report it to the local sheriff.\n\nPeople can speak from 1 to 6 p.m. today in Room 418 of the Mary Grizzle State Office Building, 11351 Ulmerton \nRoad, in Largo.\n\nTo schedule a specific time to speak, call Doria Moody this morning at (850) 488-6062.\n\nCLEARWATER\n\nThe power's still off, but rent is going up\n\nResidents of a mobile home park who have sweltered for the past week without power got more bad news: The rent \nis going up.\n\n\nLuther Moore, general manager of Southern Comfort mobile home park, said the notices have been written since \nearly September. Rent is currently $441 a month. The new rate will take effect Jan. 1. The notices were dated Sept. \n22 to comply with state law, which requires 90 days written notice of rent increase.\n\nThe increase has nothing to do with fixing the power lines, which could cost more than $20,000, Moore said.\n\nMoore said electricians have been working to replace the old, burned, underground power lines that feed two rows \nof mobile homes.\n\nHe said he hoped to have power running by this afternoon.\n"}
