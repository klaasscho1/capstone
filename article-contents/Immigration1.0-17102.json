Officials criticized the Guatemalan government and courts for ignoring her \ncomplaints about repeated beatings.\n\nAlvarado fled to the United States 10 years ago and was granted asylum by an immigration judge who found her \nstory of persistent, brutal attacks by her husband credible.\n\nBut in 1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative review panel, reversed that decision.\n"}
