{"title": "National Briefing  Southwest: Texas: Judge Dismisses Smuggling Charges", "body": "\nCharges against one of three defendants on trial in the deaths of 19 illegal immigrants smuggled into the United \nStates from Mexico were dismissed by a judge after federal prosecutors rested their case. The judge, Vanessa D. \nGilmore of Federal District Court in Houston, ruled that the government failed to demonstrate that the defendant, \nClaudia Carrizales de Villa of Houston, had furthered a conspiracy by working at a restaurant that the government \ncontends was a staging ground for the smugglers. \n\nJudge Gilmore refused motions to dismiss charges against the two other defendants. Eleven other people \nindicted in the case are awaiting trial or sentencing. The immigrants, locked in the rear of a transport truck, died of \nheat exhaustion after its driver abandoned the vehicle at Victoria, Tex., in May 2003.
