{"title": "Being Canadian", "body": "\n  So \"being Canadian\" means having a harried culture and spending less time with loved ones because we're \nworking more, watching TV alone and eating alone (For Today's Family, Time's Not On Their Side - front page, \nFeb. 14). \n\n Yet, for many oldcomers, the question remains: How do we turn newcomers into Canadians (The Lesson From \nH\u00e9rouxville - Feb. 8)? I suggest the key question is: How do we oldcomers and newcomers adopt the best of the \nvalue systems that each brings from our respective cultures? In our family and those of many new immigrants, \nhaving at least one daily meal together is paramount. Respect for elders is ingrained, and quoting poetry is second \nnature. \n\n So, as newcomers arrive, do oldcomers have the humility to ask: What is the best in your value system that we \nmust adopt? The wisdom to recognize that at least some of \"being Canadian\" is not worth being. And the courage \nto act on what we learn from our newcomers to nurture the best that this country can be. \n"}
