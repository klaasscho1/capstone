{"title": "'Bambi' is back behind bars", "body": "\nLawrencia ''Bambi'' Bembenek - the ex-cop, escaped con and former Playboy bunny - tasted freedom again for a \nfew hours this weekend. But after being released on $ 10,000 bond Friday, she was back in a Toronto jail Saturday \nnight.\n\nBembenek, 33, who says she was framed for the 1981 murder of her then- husband's ex-wife, fled Wisconsin's \nTaycheedah Correctional Institution in July 1990.\n\nShe and her fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 35, were caught in October 1990 in Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n\nHe was deported to Wisconsin and convicted Sept. 4 of aiding the escape. He could be sentenced to five years in \nprison. She fought extradition and is seeking political asylum in Canada.\n\nAn immigration official released her on bond pending a mid-October refugee hearing, but she was ordered back to \na jail when Wisconsin authorities filed a new extradition request. ''It's just so unfair,'' she sobbed while taken into \ncustody. She was denied bail Sunday.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO; b/w, AP\n\n \n\nCUTLINE: BEMBENEK: Out on bond Friday; back in jail Saturday\n"}
