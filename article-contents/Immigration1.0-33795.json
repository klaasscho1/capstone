{"title": "October 06, 2019: Proforma Graphic Services: Technology Is Blurring the Line Between Field Sales and Inside Sales", "body": "\nField sales and inside sales have traditionally had their own domains. Field salespeople did the heavy-lifting, \nworking with customers in person. Inside salespeople sold over the telephone and web, and were responsible for \nthe uncomplicated products, small and remotely located customers, and simpler sales tasks, such as lead \ngeneration and renewals.\n\nBut in today's digital world, field sales is tapping into the tools of inside sales. At the same time, inside sales is \ninvading the turf of field sales. Consequently, companies must rethink how they structure, hire, support, manage, \nand incentivize field and inside sales forces.\n\nThe blending of field and inside sales is driven by the digital revolution in three related ways.\n\nFirst, digital is powering freemium and subscription sales businesses, which steer customers to buy from digital and \ninside sales channels, rather than from expensive field salespeople.\n\nSecond, digital communication tools have become ubiquitous, as the quality of technology continues to soar. \nIncreasingly, customers and salespeople (both inside and field) use email, live video, online tools and websites \nwhen sharing information, developing and evaluating alternatives, and completing sales transactions.\n\nFinally, data and analytics are informing more decisions for salespeople, sales managers and sales leaders, both \nfor field and inside sales.\n\nWe estimate that most field salespeople interact with customers remotely more than half of the time. Many of these \ncontacts serve simple purposes such as prospecting or following up on in-person conversations. Yet increasingly, \nthese remote communications are focused on more complex issues. At a software company, field salespeople now \ndo most product demos using online tools rather than at the customer's site. The online demos make it easier for \npeople in multiple locations to participate. For example, the customer can invite users from regional offices and the \ncompany can bring in an expert from across the globe to address the customer's questions.\n\nCustomers and field salespeople are interacting over live video more and more. Customers frequently prefer this, \nespecially when they are already knowledgeable about their purchase. Virtual meetings allow field salespeople to \nbe more efficient (sell at lower cost) while still being effective.\n\n\nInside sales has muscled its way into serving larger customers with complex needs. Also, inside salespeople who \nonce performed only simple tasks (generating leads, getting renewals) are doing more complex steps, including \nassessing customer needs, crafting solutions and closing sales.\n\nAt an education technology company, the inside sales role evolved to a hybrid inside/field role as the product \noffering became more complex. Although the company's salespeople still do most selling over the phone and web, \nthey visit customers when warranted by the complexity of the customer situation and the size of the opportunity.\n\nImproving technology and increasing the digital savvy of customers and salespeople make inside salespeople \nmore effective (generating more sales for the effort) while still being efficient.\n\nSales managers should consider three changes to help their organizations deal with these changes by helping field \nsalespeople leverage digital tools while enabling inside sales teams to move up the complexity ladder:\n\nFlexible sales organization structures: Field-heavy sales organizations such as W.W. Grainger and Oracle are \nshifting sales responsibilities from field salespeople to inside salespeople and digital self-service channels. At the \nsame time, digital native companies such as Slack and Zoom are adding inside and field salespeople. These and \nother subscription sales companies are also doubling down on adding customer success managers, a hybrid \nfield/inside role for helping customers realize ongoing value, thus driving usage and more business. In all cases, \nstructures are evolving to give customers flexibility to connect using field sales, inside sales, digital channels or all \nthree simultaneously. The choice depends on each customer's level of knowledge and the complexity of needs.\n\nIn the past, companies revisited sales organization structure every two or three years, or when faced with a major \nopportunity or crisis. But today, waves of change in customer knowledge, markets and the digital landscape are \ncolliding against the traditional rigidity of sales force structures. The number and mix of field and inside salespeople \nneed to adapt almost continuously.\n\nNew enablers of sales activity: Field salespeople at a pharmaceutical company use a \"suggestion engine\" to get \nrecommendations about what information to provide each physician and how to share the information (such as with \nan in-person visit, phone call or digital message). At an airline, a digital assistant prompts field key account \nexecutives to offer the benefits (ease of booking, upgrades, expense management, etc.) each customer values. \nSuch tools are business as usual for inside salespeople. But field salespeople are used to a more organic and self-\ndirected approach that relies on their own judgment and experience for adapting sales activity to a customer's style \nand needs. As field salespeople become more data-driven, silos of field sales, inside sales and marketing are \ncrumbling. A computer technology company has customer teams for large U.S. enterprise accounts. Each team has \na U.S.-based field sales team leader, assisted by a U.S.-based inside salesperson and an India-based inside \nsalesperson. The teams rely on a system that captures customer histories and profiles, tracks all \ncustomer/company interactions, and provides insights about the best offerings and channels for serving each \ncustomer.\n\nAs data and tools support more data-driven field salespeople, inside salespeople also need new tools to help them \nventure beyond scripted customer interactions and engage in more autonomous problem-solving. And as inside \nsalespeople have a more direct hand in closing sales, their performance metrics and incentives must align. Results \nwill get emphasized compared to productivity metrics such as talk time and number of contacts.\n\nChanging sales talent: Field salespeople still need face-to-face interpersonal skills. But to win in the changing world, \nfield salespeople must also excel at leveraging data-based insights and communicating virtually, using methods \nsuch as online video, email and social selling. At the same time, inside salespeople need new skills for succeeding \nin customer acquisition roles. These include a higher-level of problem-solving abilities for partnering with customers \nto address complex business issues. Sales force hiring and training must adapt to these new success profiles.\n\nINDEX\n\nSECTION 1 PROFORMA GRAPHIC SERVICES PROFILE\n\n\n\nSECTION 2 PROFORMA GRAPHIC SERVICES RANKING\n\nSECTION 3 PRESS RELEASES: 2019\n\nSECTION 1 PROFORMA GRAPHIC SERVICES PROFILE\n\n1.1 ACTIVITIES\n\nYour printed projects speak volumes about your company's business and brand.

While initially \nsocial platforms like Twitter and Facebook were primarily used to share information with friends and family, \nbusinesses have been successfully implementing them into their marketing strategies. This is especially true for \nstartups that usually don't have the resources to compete in the expensive traditional marketing arena. Here are 5 \npowerful social media marketing ideas for your startup to get your business started off on the right track. Freebies & \nPromotions Everyone loves free stuff. It is because of this that you will want to consider offering freebies and \ngiveaways to increase your social media marketing campaign success. If your startup is planning to sell a product, \nthen there are few better ways to get it into the hands of consumers than by giving it away for free. This does not \nmean that you must hand out freebies to every user, but instead, have a contest where a member of the audience \ncan win a free demo. In the case that the winner enjoys the product, they will be apt to share their experience and \nthis could entice more buyers. Trivia And Games Placing simple trivia questions on your startup's social media \naccount can be a great way to keep the attention of the audience. These trivia questions can be based on the \nservices of the startup or they can be random questions. In the end, the idea is that prospects and customers find \nthe posts interesting enough to submit an answer, as this could lead to further engagement and curiosity in the \ncompany. Not to mention, learning interesting tidbits of trivia to share with friends is usually fun for everyone. Share \nEmployee Photos This may come as a surprise, but including photos of the employees can go a long way in \ncreating a startup that customers can relate to.\n\nOctober 01: Proforma Graphic Services: Nine Reasons to Start Your Own Groups and Forums | Website Designs\n\nA seriously effective way to build your audience and to make more sales is to start your own groups and forums on \nsocial media. There are many platforms you can use, both independent and dependent. For example, you can use \na system like Ning.com, MightyNetworks.com, or DelphiForums.com to create your own group or forum. You can \nuse a social media platform like Facebook groups or groups on LinkedIn to make your forum or group, or you can \nadd these to your website.\n\nYou can also do both, using the social media platforms to feed your independent and potentially paid groups and \nforums. It's up to you. But there are many reasons to start your own groups and forums and these nine are just a \nbeginning.\n\nWhen you have your own group or forum, you will be able to create a captive audience that is listening to what you \nsay instead of having to fight for attention with others on the general social media feed. This makes it so much \neasier to add value to each message you send to your audience too.\n\nA fun part about building a group or forum is that you can engage with your audience on a new level. You're not \"in \npublic\" so you can get much more personal and more direct with them, and it really starts feeling like a community.\n\nCommunity is so important for repeat sales, more sales, and a good feeling about buying from your audience. \nWhen they feel part of a community, it makes it easier for them to want to buy from you. They see others enjoying \ntheir purchases and getting a lot of value, and they want what they have.\n\nWhen you don't have to compete with a general social media feed, you'll get more focus on your calls to action. \nThis is because it's your audience looking, it's your group or forum, and no one else is placing advertisements or \nmarketing their products or services without your permission.\n\nBeing part of a community and building that community has other benefits too.\n\nOctober 01: Proforma Graphic Services: Common Branding Mistakes | Website Designs Content Marketing\n\nEvery business be it a small business or the largest of businesses needs to focus on its branding. Branding is quite \nsimply the process by which you control what your customers think when they see or hear about your business, it's \nproducts and services. Your aim is to try and get your customers to think of a particular image when they come into \ncontact with your products and services or they think of them or your business.\n\n\n\nHere are a few of the most common mistakes that you'll definitely want to avoid when you're branding your \nbusiness.\n\nIf you want to bring to life a certain image, the best way to do that is to make all your social media profiles the same \nthroughout each network. Match that with your offline image too. Use the same colors, fonts, images and similar \nwording, to help your audience always remember who you are by always being consistent.\n\nBasically you want your audience to know its you no matter which platform they come across you this means that \nyour Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles must match and be easily recognizable.\n\nIt can be expensive to use images in your online presence, but it's worth it. You can save money by creating them \nyourself and using inexpensive graphics through stock photo sites like photodune.net or sites like Canva.com. But, \nthe important thing is that the imagery evokes the feelings you want it to across all branding materials.\n\nIf you don't keep track of what you're doing, the results you have and the goals you are making, you won't know if \nwhat you are doing is working, or not. Look at your metrics often so that you know that you're making an impact. \nSurvey your audience; ask them what they think.\n\nYou have a wonderful connection with your customers through email lists. Use it. Send surveys to your customers. \nAsk them what they think of your branding by showing them images.\n\nSeptember 26: Proforma Graphic Services: 6 Tips for Your Social Media Marketing Strategy\n\nIn this age of social media, it's a huge mistake for a brand not to leverage social platforms.

This is a grand \nglobal event and I'm proud that I have given a speech all six years it has been in existence.\n\nI always try to do something special to bring the thunder at SMMW because so many people travel from around the \nworld to see me speak. This year, I riffed on some of the ideas I've been thinking a lot about lately: Over the next \nfew years, what's going impact our field, and our careers, the most? What do we need to know to remain vital and \nrelevant?\n\nHere is the countdown I presented in my talk.\n\nUndoubtedly AI is going to touch everything we do, but I suggested three ideas to consider in terms of impacting \nour careers.\n\nConsumers are increasingly discovering new ideas, content, and products on smart speaker systems. In fact, most \nanalysts project that the majority of search activities will be conducted through products like Alexa and Google \nHome.\n\nSince much of what we do in the world of social media and content marketing is geared toward helping people find \nour products, this is a vital trend. When we ask Alexa to find an answer, we don't get a list of blog posts, videos, or \nresearch reports to choose from we get the ANSWER.\n\n\n\nSo this is a profound development for marketers.\n\nI asked a developer on IBM's Watson project how they regard content. After all, content is sort of the engine behind \nsearch results today. She said \"We don't really think of it as content we think of it as fuel for Watson.\"\n\nAn interesting perspective, don't you think? We're now in the business of creating Watson Fuel.\n\nI don't foresee most households having multiple speaker systems. We won't want to develop our favorite routines \non Alexa, for example, and then another set for Google Home. So we are on the cusp of a war for the very heart of \neCommerce.\n\nSeptember 21: Proforma Graphic Services: 12 Best Social Media Marketing Tools for Small and Medium Sized \nBusinesses\n\nEvery entrepreneur knows this truth - it is not easy to run an enterprise on fresh air and love!

And the challenge for small \nand medium sized businesses is to grow and make it to a point where they can afford all these resources. \nMarketing is one such crucial area where there are so many resources that different kinds and sizes of business \ncan tap into. When one creates a budget, it is important to create a definite plan for marketing within the spend \navailable in this budget. This is due to the fact that the mainstay of growth would be to reach as many people as \npossible and convert the highest number from that reach into a loyal customer base instead of merely standing on \nthe outside and looking at them as if they are an unattainable audience.

It's also challenging and can cause a lot of headaches. If you do not follow a \nwell-structured business plan, then there's a chance that your efforts may go to waste. When it comes to social \nmedia marketing, many businesses are still failing to harness the potential that social media platforms can provide. \nSo, to help expedite your efforts, here are 5 essential tips you can use to boost your social media marketing. 1. \nHang Out Where Your Audience Hangs Out The most important aspect of your social media marketing campaign \nmight be where you promote your brand and content. There are different social media networks that you can utilize \nto promote your business, but not all of them are appropriate for your specific business. For example, Facebook \nrecently surpassed 2 billion users but for certain businesses, promoting on a platform with fewer users, such as \nLinkedIn, might be more effective. Start by analyzing your own business to identify your target market. Ask yourself \nwho you are targeting with your products or services. Once you have identified who your target audience is, you \nneed to find on which social networks they are most active, then target those particular social networks. 2. Don't \nUse Them All Businesses often tend to target as many social networks as possible when they are getting started. \nUnfortunately, this also means they will have to work much harder to keep their social accounts active. That's time \nand effort that could have been used on more important tasks. Instead, start by targeting a single social media \nchannel. This reduces the time needed to maintain your social media profiles and ensures that you are able to \ndevote most of your time mastering one particular social network before moving on to the next. 3. Perfect Your \nProfile Branding is essential if you wish to build a successful business that is easily recognized by both existing \ncustomers and new prospects.\n\nSeptember 15: Proforma Graphic Services: How to Power Up Your B2B Branding with Thought Leadership\n\nEditor's Note: This post was updated on May 8, 2019\n\nWhat is thought leadership? If you ask 10 people this same question, you are bound to get a variety of answers. \nSome believe that thought leadership tactics are nothing more than hocuspocus, while others feel that they are an \nessential tool for B2B branding.\n\nLet's look at what people are saying about thought leadership campaigns, and why thought leadership and brand \nbuilding go hand in hand.\n\nTake, for example, David Brooks of \"The New York Times,\" poking fun at thought leaders:\n\nOf course, that's one way of looking at it. but we would beg to differ.\n\n\n\nWhen executed correctly, thought leadership PR is a valuable way of branding yourself and your company. It allows \npeople to feel comfortable with your firm even if you're a small business in your industry and not the market leader.\n\nImagine the following scenario: You have the choice to buy a pricey electronics gizmo from a no-name company or \none with an established name -- who would you buy it from? I think we would all agree that a company with an \nestablished name carries weight.

A social media \nmarketing funnel can be a solution to this, allowing you to create a strategic process that converts leads.\n\nSeveral abbreviations or infographics can explain a marketing funnel, but overall, it is made up of the steps that \nyour customer follows on the path to completing their purchase. Therefore, marketing or sales funnels are \nstrategies crafted to nurture the customer's journey when buying your products or services.\n\nTo visualise your sales funnel, think about the path that the customer travels before the conversion takes place. \nGenerally, the funnel is separated into three categories: the top, the middle, and the bottom. Within these stages, \nthe customer becomes aware of your business, develops an interest in your brand, forms a desire to purchase one \nof your products or services, and then converts.\n\nBy visualising your sales in this way, a marketing funnel allows you to adapt your strategies and enable you to \nnurture leads into customers.\n\nSeptember 08: Proforma Graphic Services: Social Media Marketing Ideas For Every Business\n\nSocial Media Marketing Ideas For Every Business A good plan is vital to activating any business strategy. While \nsocial media is simple and attractive to use, and organic posting is free of charge, it seems logical to jump in and \nbegin your social media marketing program immediately. However, this isn't always the best course of action. Since \ngood planning is crucial to the success of any business strategy, it's just as logical to integrate this same philosophy \nwith social media marketing as well. In fact, if you don't have goals or metrics in which to review them, how can you \ntell if your efforts are successful or not? It's due to this fact that slowing down to create a social media marketing \nplan is the best way to ensure that your efforts will pan out. There are several keys to creating a solid social media \nmarketing plan: Setting Objectives And Goals Social media marketing plans should be detailed, specific, attainable, \n\n\n\nmeasurable, practical, and time sensitive. Make sure all goals are established with metrics that will directly impact \nyour business growth, such as reaching and attracting new customers, improving your conversion rates, as \nopposed to simply increasing post likes or shares. Do Research On Your Competition It's important to review the \nsuccess and failures of your competition. Although it's not a smart idea to duplicate their efforts or post-type, the \nlearning curve will be reduced by reviewing their mistakes - or successes. Do A Social Media Audit Sometimes it's a \ngood idea to take a few steps back before moving forward. Such is the case with social media marketing. \nCompleting a social medial audit will help you review what you've done in the past. It's also a good idea to search \nfor any unauthorized duplicate accounts that might be duplicating your efforts.\n\nSeptember 04: Proforma Graphic Services: Power of Emotional Branding: 8 Foundations to Make Your Brand More \nHuman\n\nBrands that inspire a higher emotional intensity receive 3x as much word-of-mouth as less emotionally-connected \nbrands.\n\nAs the digital and social web gets louder and more crowded, marketers are always looking for new ways to better \nconnect with their audiences and communities in a meaningful, authentic and memorable way.\n\nBranding strategies, brand storytelling and even emotional branding is not new. These approaches to branding \nwere invented and used by smart marketers long before Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and blogging.\n\nThe best marketers know that authentic and emotional branding is the secret sauce to igniting customers to loyal \nadvocates, followers and fans!\n\nEmotional branding helps connect you in the most human ways to your audience and ideal customers. It helps you \nbuild a foundation built on human feelings, emotions, understanding and desire that drives action that engages the \ncustomer or audience member even deeper with your brand.\n\nEmotional branding is not just about finding a funny or sad photo, video or quote to tap into the emotions as a one \nnight Facebook gone viral approach. Instead emotional branding is about igniting emotions at the core of everything \nyou say and do. It's about understanding your audience, humanizing your brand, using language that connects you \nwith your brand and the list goes on.\n\nMost important, building an emotional brand requires doing these things consistently. Emotional branding requires \nknowledge of your audience, knowledge of your own brand and the value you offer in the most human way to your \naudience and customers. It must be more than words, more than broken promises. Your words must not only \nconnect but your brand must deliver on those promises or the words will fall on deaf ears and blind eyes.\n\n\"Emotional branding is a term used within marketing communication that refers to the practice of building brands \nthat appeal directly to a consumer's emotional state, needs and aspirations.\n\nSeptember 01: Proforma Graphic Services: How to Start a Social Media Consulting Business in 6 Steps\n\nAs a leading social media speaker and consultant, I often get asked about how to start a social media consulting \nbusiness and develop initial clients. I am happy to mentor a new generation of social media-savvy business \nconsultants, and I plan to be blogging about this more in the future, as I believe the subject can aid not only social \nmedia consultants, but also educate any consultant, entrepreneur, or small business owner on how to better utilize \nsocial media to launch and develop new business. Social media truly levels the playing field for any business owner \nor entrepreneur.\n\nStarting any new business is a risk, and while I find many people might have the expertise in any given field, they \nmight not have the sales skills nor even the social media marketing skills to develop a social media consulting \nbusiness and build up a company. Yes, I have met social media consultants who they themselves are not good \nsocial media marketing practitioners. I will not comment on what types of social media consulting projects these \nindividuals might be appropriate for, as every professional brings a unique skill set and plethora of experiences to \n\n\n\nthe table, but I will say that going forward if you cannot display your own social media marketing expertise with your \nown brand, it will be very difficult to establish the credibility that is necessary to develop business. This is because, \nalthough I have done social media consulting on customer service-related projects in the past, the majority of \ninquiries I get are related to social media marketing consulting.\n\nAssuming that you are qualified for the job and are committing enough time and resources to make your social \nmedia consulting business a success, here are the 6 most important steps in how to start social media consulting:\n\nThis is a no brainer.\n\nAugust 28: Proforma Graphic Services: 8 Big Social Media Marketing Mistakes Businesses Make (and How to \nAvoid Them)\n\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and Twitter present unique opportunities to reach your target customers. \nWhether you're a startup or a more established company, social media plays a vital role in today's marketing \nlandscape. It is crucial to growing awareness for your products and services, so it's important to get off on the right \nfoot or you risk alienating your audience entirely.\n\nFirst impressions are quick, powerful, and enduring - it's very important to do everything you can to make a good \none. Changing a first impression is doable, but it's best to avoid making social media marketing mistakes in the first \nplace.\n\nCompanies without a social media strategy whatsoever can never deliver effective messages to their audiences. \nCommunications appear disjointed and confused. You must have a distinct voice, measurable goals, a social media \npolicy, and a publication calendar. Without these, you'll find yourself posting blindly and diminishing your brand \ncapital. A clear delineated social media strategy puts you on the path to offering useful, engaging content that is \nsticky and memorable.\n\nPlease refrain from signing up for every social media platform out there. Yes, it's important to be in more than one \nplace, but not when you're just starting out. Especially for small businesses, it's much easier and more effective to \nmaster one platform before you branch out to the next. If you rush to create a presence on Facebook, Twitter, \nPinterest, YouTube, Instagram, Vimeo, LinkedIn, Google+, Slideshare, Vine, and Snapchat and begin madly \nposting incoherently on all of them, you will look like you don't know what you're doing. And when you finally throw \nup your hands and abandon most of your platforms because you can't do justice to them, it looks even worse. \nWould you purchase something from a company that's projecting how inept they are? I wouldn't - this type of \nactivity does nothing to engender trust, which is the basis of any customer relationship.\n\nQuantity doesn't trump quality.\n\nAugust 27: Proforma Graphic Services: LinkedIn Launches New Feature; Offers Actionable Marketing Insights\n\nLinkedIn introduces the LinkedIn Insights and Research page, a resource that will serve as a guide for marketers \nand will substantiate their social media marketing strategy based on comprehensive insights.\n\nWith so much data, it can be difficult to pinpoint the most valuable information for their audience's needs.
