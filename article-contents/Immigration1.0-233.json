{"title": "690 STOPPED IN ILLEGAL CROSSINGS", "body": "\nA beefed-up Border Patrol resulted in a record 690 arrests of illegal immigrants Tuesday in Arizona's biggest \nborder town, evidence that a planned crackdown is working, the nation's immigration chief said Wednesday. \"The \nmessage will go out that this is no longer a place you can cross,\" Immigration and Naturalization Service \nCommissioner Doris Meissner said. The increase has been blamed on crackdowns in other hot spots, including San \nDiego and El Paso, Texas, and more recently on the economic hardships caused by Mexico's peso collapse.\n"}
