Annexure C is a list of \ndefined terms. Annexure D is an extract from the Plaintiffs' statement of claim which sets out the pleaded fiduciary \nduties.)  \nINTRODUCTION  \n\n1 This action was brought by Donald and Sylvia Collard, and some of their children Glenys, Ellen, Eva, Wesley, \nBeverley, Darryl and Bonnie (the Children). (To avoid confusion, I refer to the plaintiffs by their first names in these \nreasons, and to the first plaintiff, Donald Collard, as Don. I also refer to Don and Sylvia's children as the Children \nnotwithstanding that they are all well into their adulthood. I also refer to four of Don and Sylvia's other children, \nGlen, Sylvia, Donald and William, by their first names, although they are now deceased. No disrespect is intended.)  \n2 On 13 March 1958, by an order made by the Children's Court at Brookton, Ellen was committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department. On 3 December 1961, Donald, William, Glenys, Eva, Wesley, Beverley, Darryl and \nBonnie (the Siblings), were committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department, pursuant to an order of the \nChildren's Court at Brookton.  \n3 Ellen was just six months old when she was committed to the care of the Department. The other Children ranged \nin age from eight months old (in the case of Wesley) to 10 years old (in the case of Donald, the eldest of the \nSiblings) when they were committed to the care of the Department. All of the Children remained subject to an order \ncommitting them to the care of the Child Welfare Department until they reached 18 years of age (the wardships).  \n\n4 After they were made wards, most of the Children spent little (if any) time with Don and Sylvia until their teens or \nearly adulthood. There is no doubt that all of the Children, and Don and Sylvia, have been deeply scarred by their \nseparation, by the fracturing of their family relationships, and by their disconnection from their aboriginal culture, \nwhich occurred as a result of the Children being made wards.  \n5 I am conscious that it is difficult for a third party to comprehend the enormity of the emotional pain and heartache \nexperienced by all of the plaintiffs as a result of the Children being made wards and living apart from their family for \nso many years. Having said that, it is impossible not to be deeply moved by the plaintiffs' experiences, and one \ncannot help but admire their efforts to rebuild and maintain their family relationships.  \n6 The plaintiffs claimed that the State was subject to fiduciary duties to them during the wardships, because it was \nthe guardian of the Children. The plaintiffs claim that the State was subject to various fiduciary duties to each of \nthem to act in the best interests of the Children, and not to disregard their interest in being raised in their natural \nfamily unit, and that it breached those duties in various ways during the wardships. In these reasons, I refer to these \nfiduciary duties as the primary fiduciary duties.  \n7 The plaintiffs alleged that the State was, and remains, under a fiduciary duty to provide the plaintiffs with \nindependent legal advice or representation in relation to its possible liability to them for a breach of its fiduciary \nduties during the wardships, and that it failed to do so. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that after the termination of \nthe wardships, the State continued to owe the Children a duty to take all reasonable steps (through the provision of \neducation, counselling, psychiatric treatment and access to independent legal advice) to avoid the occurrence of \nfurther loss and damage to the plaintiffs as a result of its breaches of its duties as a fiduciary, and that it has failed \nto do so. In these reasons, I refer to these fiduciary duties as the secondary fiduciary duties.  \n8 The plaintiffs brought this action seeking a declaration that the State breached its duties to them, and equitable \ncompensation or damages, including exemplary damages and aggravated damages, for the injuries, loss and \ndamage they claim to have suffered as a result of the alleged breach by the State of its duties to them.  \n\n9 The State denied that it was, or is, subject to the duties alleged by the plaintiffs, and denies any breach of those \nduties. It also relied on a number of defences namely that the plaintiffs have no right of action against the State \nbecause they have failed to comply with the requirements of the Crown Suits Act 1947 (WA), and that the plaintiffs \nare precluded from obtaining any relief by the application, by analogy, of the limitation periods in the Limitation Act \n1935 (WA) or the Crown Suits Act 1947. The State also pleaded that the plaintiffs were precluded from seeking the \nrelief sought or any relief by reason of the equitable defence of laches.  \n10 Quite apart from the legal remedies they sought, the plaintiffs clearly hope that this litigation will provide answers \nto many questions they have about why the Children were removed. By way of example, Don's evidence was that \nhe commenced the proceedings because he 'wanted answers'.[1] Beverley's evidence was that 'while it has been \n\n\n\nhurtful to go back into the past and face everything that happened, I am ready to get some answers about why our \nfamily had to go through what we did and why my childhood was taken from me'.[2] And Ellen's evidence was that \nshe wanted 'some explanation why I was taken as a little baby and why my life turned out the way it did because of \nthis'.[3]  \n\n11 Perhaps the process of discovery, and the evidence adduced at the trial, will have provided more information to \nthe plaintiffs than they previously had as to what occurred when the Children were made wards, and during their \nwardships. However, a trial is an adversarial means of resolving a dispute, rather than an inquisitorial process \nintended to ascertain all of the facts concerning particular events, and explanations or motivations for, particular \nconduct. In resolving a dispute between litigants, the Court addresses the issues raised by the pleadings, and can \ndo so only on the basis of the facts proved by the evidence before it. In this case the evidence is subject to many \nsignificant limitations: the wardships were between 34 and 55 years ago, many of the people involved in the events \nin question have since died, or are no longer in a position to give evidence, or cannot be found, the available \nwitnesses (including the plaintiffs) do not have perfect recollections of what took place, and there is an incomplete \ndocumentary record of what occurred.  \n\n12 The resolution of the plaintiffs' claims requires the application of the law to the facts established by the evidence \nbefore the Court. The application of the applicable legal principles to the facts established on the balance of \nprobabilities by the evidence leads to the conclusion that the State was not, and is not, subject to the fiduciary \nduties alleged by the plaintiffs. Even if the State was subject to those duties, the plaintiffs did not establish that the \nState breached those duties, other than in relation to a decision which was made in November 1959 not to return \nEllen to Don and Sylvia's care (see below [1355]). Furthermore, the plaintiffs have no right of action against the \nState because they did not comply with the requirements of the Crown Suits Act. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' action \nmust be dismissed. I explain my reasons for those conclusions below.  \n\n13 It is appropriate at this point to deal with a submission which was made in opening by counsel for the plaintiffs, \ncharacterising the nature of this case. He submitted that when the Children were placed in care in this case, that \nwas:  a continuation of the deliberate removal of part-Aboriginal children from their natural parents. ... [I]t was part of \nthe continuation of the policies of Mr Neville, and all of the States of the Commonwealth it would appear, to deal \nwith part-Aboriginal children in a way which is different from what were then called full-bloods or natives and to try \nand breed out their Aboriginality and make them useful citizens of the community by taking them away ... .[4]\n\n14 The evidence did not support the conclusion that when the Children were made wards, that that action was \ncarried out in the pursuit of a policy of assimilation, of the kind described by counsel for the plaintiffs. Counsel for \nthe plaintiffs acknowledged that that was so in closing.[5] Instead, the evidence established that the orders made by \nthe Children's Court, which placed the Children in the care of the Child Welfare Department, depended upon a \nfinding by the Children's Court in each case that the Children had been neglected. The decisions made, and actions \ntaken, with respect to the Children during their wardships, and which are the subject of this litigation, were made \npursuant to child welfare legislation in force at the time.  \n15 In these reasons, I deal with the following matters:    The parties, witnesses, other persons involved and the \ninstitutions where the Children lived;  The legislative framework, and Don and Sylvia's early life experiences under \nthe legislation;  The facts;  Did the State owe the primary fiduciary duties to the Children during their wardships;  Did \nthe State breach the alleged fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiffs;  Did the State owe the secondary fiduciary duties \nto the plaintiffs and, if so, did it breach those duties?  Other defences, and laches;  Issues in relation to equitable \ncompensation.\n1. PARTIES, WITNESSES AND OTHER PERSONS  \n16 In this part of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n(a) the plaintiffs;  \n(b) the witnesses at the trial;  \n(c) other persons involved in the events the subject of the action;  \n(d) institutions where the Children lived at various times during the wardships, and which are referred to in the \nreasons;  \n(e) the documentary evidence;  \n\n\n\n(f) findings as to the credibility of the witnesses.  \n(a) The Plaintiffs  \n17 Don and Sylvia are 80 and 81 years of age, respectively.[6] They were both born in Brookton, and spent much of \ntheir childhood and adult lives there. They were married in Pingelly in August 1950.  \n18 Don left school at about 14 years of age, and throughout his late teens and his adult working life Don did \nseasonal work shearing and crutching sheep, stripping mallet bark, picking mallee roots, labouring and farmhand \nwork, and trapping rabbits. Throughout their marriage, Sylvia has supported Don and raised their children. During \nthe late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Don and Sylvia lived an itinerant lifestyle, staying on farms where they \nwere employed at various times throughout the year but returning regularly and frequently to Brookton, where they \nlived on a block of land owned by Sylvia's mother Bessie Ninyette (Bessie Nineyette's block). Bessie Ninyette's \nblock was a block of about four acres located about a mile outside Brookton, or about a fiveminute walk into the \ntown.[7]  \n19 Together Don and Sylvia have had 14 children. Their first child, Glen Ninyette, was born on 1 May 1950 at \nBeverley District Hospital.[8] Glen died on 18 October 1950 at the age of five months after a short illness.[9]  \n20 Don and Sylvia's second child, Donald John Collard, was born on 19 September 1951 at Beverley District \nHospital.[10] Donald was killed in a car accident on 15 January 1970 when he was 18 years old.[11]  \n21 Don and Sylvia's third child, Darryl Frederick Collard was born on 21 September 1952 at Beverley District \nHospital.[12]  \n22 Don and Sylvia's fourth child, Bonnie Lynette Collard was born on 22 May 1954 at Beverley District Hospital.[13]  \n23 Don and Sylvia's fifth child, William Glen Collard, was born on 20 September 1955 at Beverley District \nHospital.[14] William was killed in a car accident on 7 July 1977 when he was 22 years old.[15]  \n24 Don and Sylvia's sixth child, Beverley Anne Collard, was born on 5 October 1956 at Vailima Hospital in \nNarrogin.[16]  \n25 Don and Sylvia's seventh child, Ellen Jane Collard, was born on 25 September 1957 at Beverley District \nHospital.[17]  \n26 Don and Sylvia's eighth child, Glenys Dale Collard, was born on 15 December 1958 at Kondinin District \nHospital.[18]  \n27 Don and Sylvia's ninth child, Eva Michale Collard, was born on 1 March 1960 at Beverley District Hospital.[19]  \n28 Don and Sylvia's tenth child, Wesley Rohan Collard, was born on 12 March 1961 at Beverley District \nHospital.[20]  \n29 Don and Sylvia's eleventh child, Sylvia, was stillborn on 3 June 1962 at Beverley District Hospital.[21]  \n30 Don and Sylvia's twelfth child, Joseph Collard, was born on 30 May 1963 at Beverley District Hospital.[22]  \n31 Don and Sylvia's thirteenth child, Philip Dean Collard, was born on 8 March 1966 at King Edward Memorial \nHospital in Perth.[23]  \n32 Don and Sylvia's fourteenth child, Arthur Ashley Collard, was born on 31 May 1967 at Beverley District \nHospital.[24]  \n(b) The witnesses at the trial  \n33 Each of the plaintiffs gave evidence at the trial. A witness statement or affidavit, or both, was tendered on behalf \nof each of the plaintiffs as their evidenceinchief.  \n34 Some of the documents tendered in evidence disclosed the views or beliefs of the plaintiffs in relation to \nparticular events. The documents concerned were admitted by consent on the basis that statements in them as to \nthe beliefs, views or feelings of the witnesses were evidence of those beliefs, views or feelings, and not evidence of \nthe objective truth of the matters the subject of those beliefs, views or feelings.[25] I have dealt with that evidence \non that basis.  \n35 Only two witnesses gave oral evidence for the State: Mr Keith Maine, a psychologist within the Child Welfare \nDepartment (from 1958) and later Director of that Department (from 1968 to 1984), and Mrs Mary Patullo, who was \na cottage mother at Sister Kate's Home where the Siblings first lived after they were made wards.  \n36 In addition, a number of witness statements and reports of expert witnesses were tendered by consent without \nthose witnesses being called for crossexamination.  \n(c) Other persons involved in the events the subject of the action  \n37 Annexure A to these reasons contains a list of the people who are referred to in the judgment, together with their \njob or position title, or their relationship, relevant to the proceedings. In Annexure A, I have also indicated whether \n\n\n\nthe person gave evidence, and if the reason why the person did not give evidence was made known to the Court in \nevidence, that reason.  \n38 The State filed affidavits deposing to the enquiries which have been made to locate potential witnesses with \nknowledge of the matters the subject of these proceedings. Those affidavits established that there were numerous \npeople who would in all likelihood have been called as witnesses for the State but who have died or are not now in \nsufficiently good mental or physical health to give evidence.  \n\n39 The State also tendered witness statements from a number of persons who deposed that although they had \nbeen shown documents bearing their names, handwriting, signatures, or text which appeared to have been written \nby them, they had no recollection of the contents of those documents or the individuals to whom they pertained, \nalthough they had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information contained in the documents. Some of those \nwitnesses also deposed to other matters of relevance to these proceedings, which they were able to recall, such as \nthe policy or procedures of the Child Welfare Department or the Department of Native Welfare at relevant times.  \n40 I have discussed the unavailability of witnesses further, below, in relation to the facts concerning the State's \ndefence of laches.  \n(d) Institutions where the Children lived at various times during the wardships, and which are referred to in the \nreasons  \n41 At the time each of the Children was committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department, aboriginal children \nwho were committed to the Department's care fell within the administrative responsibility of the Department of \nNative Welfare (although they were in fact wards of the Director of Child Welfare). Officers and employees of that \nDepartment appear to have exercised power with respect to wards as authorised officers under the Child Welfare \nAct 1947 (WA). From 1 July 1964, by arrangement with the Department of Native Welfare, all aboriginal wards (with \nsome limited exceptions) became the responsibility of the Child Welfare Department.[26]  \n\n42 The Siblings spent time in a variety of institutions during their wardships. I have set out below a brief description \nof Sister Kate's Home where the Siblings lived for some time. The other institutions where some of the Siblings \nwere placed are described in Annexure B. These descriptions were drawn from a publication entitled 'Signposts A \nGuide for Children and Young People in Care in WA from 1920' prepared by the Department for Community \nDevelopment.[27]  \nSister Kate's home/Burnbrae\n43 Sister Kate's Home was established in Queens Park in 1935 by Sister Kate Clutterbuck, an Anglican nun, to \ncare for indigenous children, and it provided residential child care and family support for indigenous children and \ntheir families. Sister Kate's was originally called the Children's Cottage Home, then Sister Kate's Home and from \nabout 1988 it became known as Manguri. Sister Kate ran the Children's Cottage Home from 1933 until 1946. It was \nlater operated by a board, and from 1956 by the Presbyterian Church. The philosophy underlying Sister Kate's \nHome was that children should be brought up in a loving and familial environment. In order to achieve this \nenvironment, children of a variety of ages were housed in cottages staffed either by a cottage mother, or a cottage \nmother and father, and each cottage was intended to function like a family in its own right. Very young children, \nhowever, were accommodated together in a nursery cottage.  \n44 By early 1962 there were 76 children accommodated at Sister Kate's, including 27 children who were wards \nwithin the responsibility of the Department of Native Welfare and 18 children who were wards within the \nresponsibility of the Child Welfare Department.[28] There were a number of cottages at Sister Kate's. There were \nthree older cottages, constructed in the 1930s and 1940, accommodating 10, 13 and 11 children respectively. \nThere were also two cottages constructed in approximately 1961, accommodating 14 children and 10 children \nrespectively. There was also a cottage accommodating 18 very young children which was the nursery of Sister \nKate's.[29] The facilities at Sister Kate's included a central kitchen, a laundry, a chapel, a library housed in an older \ncottage,[30] a swimming pool, a tennis court and a basketball court.[31] There was also a kindergarten on site for \nchildren of kindergarten age, while older children attended the Queens Park Primary School or high schools in the \narea.[32]  \n45 Sister Kate's also operated an annex at Byford, known as Burnbrae. Burnbrae was located on a farming \nproperty.  \n(e) The documentary evidence  \n\n\n\n46 The State tendered a large number of documents in evidence, drawn mostly from its records, particularly the \nrecords of the Child Welfare Department.  \n\n47 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the Court should infer that all of the documents which existed in relation \nto the Children's removal and wardships had been identified by the State and put before the Court in evidence. \nCounsel for the plaintiffs submitted that as a consequence, it was open to the Court to rely on the absence of any \nevidence that something was done as the basis for an inference that that thing was not in fact done. By way of \nexample, he submitted that the absence of documents evidencing any checks on the welfare of the Children \nbetween 1961 and 1964 could be relied upon to draw the inference that no checks were made on the Children's \nwelfare during that period. By way of further example, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that it was open to the \nCourt to conclude that when the Siblings were made wards, the State did not give consideration to alternative \naccommodation apart from Sister Kate's, such as placing the Children with family members or with members of the \naboriginal community.[33]  \n\n48 I am unable to accept the submission advanced by counsel for the plaintiffs that the absence of documentary \nevidence that something was done permits the inference that that thing was not done. The premise on which the \nsubmission was made was not well founded, as the following example illustrates. In support of his submission, \ncounsel for the plaintiffs pointed to the fact that numerous records existed in relation to Don's obligation to pay \nmaintenance in respect of the Children. Although there were a number of documents in evidence in relation to \nmaintenance, they particularly related to payments owed by Don between 1958 and 1964, and there were very few \ndocuments in evidence in relation to the payment of maintenance after that time.[34] Having regard to the content of \nsuch documents as there were in evidence, it cannot be concluded that maintenance was not pursued from Don \nafter 1964 in fact it is quite clear that it was pursued, until as late as 1982.[35] Accordingly in relation to \nmaintenance payments, the possibility thus clearly exists that the State no longer has in its possession all of the \ndocuments which were created in relation to those payments in respect of the Children.  \n49 Furthermore, it was apparent that the documents in evidence did not constitute a complete documentary record \nof the events the subject of these proceedings, for the following reasons.  \n\n50 First, there was virtually no documentary evidence in relation to the Children during the period between 1961 \nand July 1964, when the Siblings lived at Sister Kate's. (This was the period of time during which the Department of \nNative Welfare was responsible for all of the Children, as wards.) The existence of documents from July 1964 \ncoincides with the transfer of responsibility for aboriginal wards from the Department of Native Welfare back to the \nChild Welfare Department. There was no evidence in relation to the existence or whereabouts of documents in \nrelation to the Children during this period.  \n\n51 Secondly, there were other significant gaps in the documentary evidence, particularly in relation to the \ndocuments likely to have been held by third parties. There were, for example, very few documents in evidence \nwhich appeared to have been drawn from the records kept by Sister Kate's in relation to the Siblings, or in relation \nto the arrangements relevant to wards who resided at Sister Kate's during the 1960s when the Siblings lived there. \nAlthough some documents in evidence appeared to have come from the records kept by Sister Kate's it appeared \nthat these documents had made their way onto the files held by the Child Welfare Department. By way of further \nexample, there were no records available from Beverley Hospital in 1958 at the time when Ellen was committed to \nthe care of the Child Welfare Department.  \n52 Thirdly, there was specific evidence explaining that certain significant documents could not be found. By way of \nexample, despite extensive searches of court records and records held by the Department of Child Protection, and \nother agencies, a signed copy of the court order committing the Siblings to the care of the State could not be \nlocated.[36] Further, medical records pertaining to the possible admission of Sylvia Collard to the Pingelly, Narrogin \nand Kondinin Hospitals during late 1967 to early 1968 (which was the period during which there was some \nsuggestion in the evidence that she may have required hospitalisation for treatment for injuries following an assault \nby Don) were not able to be located.[37]  \n\n53 It is apparent that the absence of the documents to which I have referred is consistent with other inferences \napart from that which counsel for the plaintiffs submits should be drawn. To demonstrate the point, it will suffice to \n\n\n\nrefer to the absence of almost any records for the significant period of time between late 1961 (after the Siblings \nwere made wards) and July 1964. It is possible that the State did not itself hold any records in relation to the \nSiblings for this period of time, perhaps because those records were retained by Sister Kate's. Alternatively, it is \npossible that such records that the State had were in the possession of officers of the Department of Native \nWelfare, and were not transferred to the Child Welfare Department when responsibility for the wards was \ntransferred, and that those records no longer exist. Finally, it is possible that records in relation to the period of time \nprior to 1964 when the Siblings were in Sister Kate's were transferred to the Child Welfare Department but were \nsubsequently lost. In my view, each of those inferences is equally, if not more, plausible than the inference that the \ndocuments before the Court represent all the records which were created in relation to the Children during their \nperiods of wardship. That is all the more so when consideration is given to the very large number of documents \nwhich are in evidence in relation to the Children for the period after July 1964 during which each of them remained \nin institutional or foster care.  \n\n54 Furthermore, it would hardly be surprising if a complete documentary record no longer existed in relation to the \nevents in question, having regard to the following considerations: the very long period of time since the Children's \nwardships ended; the very long period of time of the Children's wardships themselves (from 1958 until 1979 when \nWesley's wardship ended); the fact that any records kept would have been paper records (rather than electronic \nrecords); the fact that after about 1962 or 1963 (when Donald, Darryl and Bonnie went to live at Burnbrae) the \nChildren resided in multiple locations during their wardships; the number of departmental officers who appear to \nhave been involved in inspections of, or decisions about, the welfare of the Children over the years; and the fact \nthat the departmental officers responsible for the welfare of the Children were located in metropolitan and regional \nareas.  \n55 Finally, the possibility cannot be excluded that in respect of some decisions reached by departmental officers, \nthat those decisions or the bases for them were not recorded in writing. That is a possibility that is clearly open, \nhaving regard to the absence of electronic communications, and thus the fact that any records had to be made in \nhandwriting or typed, in circumstances where the evidence established that the resources of field officers or welfare \nworkers in the Child Welfare Department and the Department of Native Welfare at the relevant times were limited, \nhaving regard to the case load of those officers.  \n(f) Findings as to the credibility and reliability of the witnesses  \n56 It is appropriate at this point to set out my findings in relation to the credibility of witnesses. I start by making \nsome general observations before turning to make specific findings about credibility.  \nIssues relating to evidence given by aboriginal witnesses\n57 In assessing the credibility of the plaintiffs, I have taken into account the fact that the plaintiffs are all aboriginal \npeople. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that  complexities may arise with respect to language, body language, \nmeaning and the way aboriginal witnesses give evidence in a courtroom' and that these complexities 'should be \nconsidered when assessing the evidence and general credibility of aboriginal witnesses ... including the plaintiffs in \nthis case.[38]\n58 It is well recognised that a number of factors may impact on the evidence given by aboriginal witnesses. These \ninclude some characteristics of communication in aboriginal society such as the avoidance of direct eye contact as \na sign of courtesy and respect, the greater use of silence in communication, gratuitous concurrence with questions, \nand a preference for ascertaining information indirectly, rather than by asking direct questions. Some aboriginal \npeople especially those from remote or regional areas, or those for whom English is not their first language may \nexperience particular language difficulties.[39]  \n59 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that such difficulties were exhibited during the evidence of Don and Sylvia, \nand that I should take these into account in assessing their evidence. He submitted that Sylvia displayed a \ntendency to gratuitous concurrence, especially when she appeared tired. I accept that on numerous occasions \nduring her evidence, Sylvia became emotional. After the crossexamination had proceeded for some time, she \nappeared tired. Sometimes Sylvia was confused by what was put to her, especially when the questions were based \non what was said in documents. These responses were entirely understandable, given Sylvia's age, educational \nbackground, and the traumatic nature of the events about which she was crossexamined.  \n60 Very occasionally, Sylvia appeared inclined to simply accept what was being put to her. However, I viewed this \nas a sign of frustration with the process of being crossexamined, rather than of gratuitous concurrence. In any \n\n\n\nevent, when this occurred, either counsel for the State, or the Court, clarified with Sylvia what her evidence in fact \nwas. On the other hand, on very many other occasions, Sylvia made quite clear that she disagreed with the basis \nfor questions put to her by counsel for the State.  \n61 Taking all of these considerations into account, I am satisfied that on the whole, Sylvia's evidence in \ncrossexamination reflected her recollections of events, rather than merely gratuitous concurrence with the questions \nput to her by counsel for the State.  \n62 Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that on some occasions Sylvia had trouble specifying dates or times with \nprecision. Although Sylvia did express such difficulties, the nature of the questions involved did not suggest that the \ndifficulty was attributable to her aboriginality. The more compelling inference is that Sylvia's evidence was at times \nvague, or imprecise, or inaccurate in some respects, as a result of the very long period of time which has passed \nsince the events in question. Accordingly, as I have observed below, where there were differences between Sylvia's \nrecollection of the dates on which certain events occurred, for example, and documentary evidence as to when \nthose events occurred, I have preferred to rely on the documentary evidence, which was apparently prepared \nconcurrently, or proximately, to the events in question, as being a more accurate indicator of when those events in \nfact occurred.  \n\n63 Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that Don displayed a tendency to 'feel the need to recall details when \nanswering questions from the State's counsel' and that 'it appeared he was trying to please the State's counsel', \nrather than answering that he may not have recalled the particular event. I do not agree. Nothing in Don's evidence \nled me to discern that his answers to questions in crossexamination were affected by a desire to please counsel for \nthe State. He displayed no inhibition about disagreeing with counsel for the State on many occasions.  \n64 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the plaintiffs may have experienced difficulty in their comprehension of \nthe meaning of English words and phrases when they were asked questions about the Children 'coming home' or \n'coming to live at home' or 'living at home'. He submitted that it appeared from Don's evidence that Don did not want \nto describe the Children being under his 'care' whilst they were wards. In my view, Don's reluctance to agree that \nthe Children returned to live at home at various times during their wardships resulted from a concern to avoid any \nadmission that he had assisted the Children to run away and return to live with him and Sylvia. Moreover, Don \ndisplayed the ability to be quite precise about his use of language in relation to such questions. For example, he \nmade clear that 'none of them [the Children] ever come back into our custody ... they come back to live but not in \nour custody'.[40]  \n65 None of the other plaintiffs gave the appearance of having any difficulty in understanding the questions put to \nthem, or in answering in English, or if they did, they sought clarification from counsel. Glenys and Beverley, in \nparticular, displayed the ability to clarify precisely what was being asked of them, and to answer that precise \nquestion.  \n66 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the evidence given by Glenys and Bonnie that other family members had \nassisted to raise their children reflected a common experience among aboriginal families. I have taken this into \naccount.  \nThe impact of emotion\n\n67 I have taken into account that for a number of the other plaintiffs, in addition to Sylvia (who I mentioned at [59]), \ngiving their evidence was at times emotionally difficult. That was not at all surprising their evidence dealt with highly \ntraumatic events, from the separation of the Children from their parents over the many years they spent as wards, \nto the deaths of Donald and William, to traumatic events later in their lives. However, the plaintiffs managed to give \ntheir evidence despite the distress that they experienced in referring to some aspects of that evidence. This was no \ndoubt assisted by the fact that the evidenceinchief of the plaintiffs was given in the form of witness statements or \naffidavits.  \nThe evidence given by Don and Sylvia\n68 On the whole, I formed the view that Don and Sylvia gave evidence that they genuinely believed was true. There \nwas, however, one exception to this, namely in relation to Don and Sylvia's evidence concerning the amount of time \nthey spent at the humpy. As I explain below at [236] to [246] and [560] to [564], I find that during crossexamination \nboth Don and Sylvia deliberately sought to diminish the amount of time they spent at the humpy.  \n\n\n\n69 In my view, some significant aspects of Don and Sylvia's evidence were not reliable, for a number of reasons. \nEach of these is explained further in relation to the evidence in question, but in summary, my reasons in overview \nare as follows.  \n70 First, some of Don and Sylvia's evidence was inaccurate in some respects, including as to significant events. By \nway of example, in crossexamination Don was questioned about when Constable Wall came to see him prior to the \nSiblings being made wards. His answers to this question varied (see [271]). Sylvia's evidence was also inaccurate \nin some respects. Sylvia denied that she had been arrested for fighting in 1956. She said that she had never heard \nof that charge.[41] However, in evidence was the charge sheet showing her conviction for fighting in 1956.[42] The \nmost likely explanation is that Don's and Sylvia's memories of the events in question have deteriorated over the \nmany years since the events in question.  \n71 Secondly, both Don and Sylvia's recollections of the circumstances in which the Children were made wards have \nclearly been affected by their belief as to two things: first, that the Children were taken from them and that the \ncommittals were without any justification,[43] and secondly, that Don and Sylvia and their family had been \nvictimised and targeted by the police, especially Constable Wall, and a missionary in Brookton, Ms Jones.[44] Their \nbelief that Constable Wall and Ms Jones were responsible for taking the Siblings appears to have impacted on their \nrecollection of other events, in that they recollected Constable Wall and Ms Jones having a role in those events, \nwhen other evidence clearly contradicted that recollection. By way of example, Sylvia's evidence was that Ms Jones \nhad told her she should not take Glen with her to Moore River (see below [154] to [161]). However, Sylvia later \naccepted that Ms Jones was not actually present with Constable Wall when he came to take her to Moore River.[45] \nSimilarly, in his evidenceinchief, Don attributed his arrest on a number of occasions to victimisation by Constable \nWall,[46] yet the documentary evidence suggested that other police officers were responsible for those arrests.[47]  \n72 Thirdly, there was evidence that Don and Sylvia had told their story to different persons and for different \npurposes on a number of occasions (for a publication entitled 'Echoes of the Past' in 2002,[48] and in preparing \naffidavits in 2011 for the trial) and they have told their story together, rather than individually, on at least one \noccasion (in 1995[49]). Several problems arise from this. By telling their story together, there is a real risk that they \nhave unconsciously incorporated each other's recollections into their own. In addition, there is a danger that if their \nrecollection of events has varied from one occasion to the next, that altered recollection, by its repetition, may have \nbecome embedded as their genuinely held (albeit inaccurate) memory. These risks appear to have been realised in \nrelation to certain key aspects of their recollection of events especially that the Siblings were taken from them by Ms \nJones.  \n\n73 Fourthly, there were some inconsistencies between versions of events given by Don and Sylvia on earlier \noccasions, and their evidence at the trial. By way of example, in a joint statement Don and Sylvia provided to the \nALS in February 1995,[50] Don said that when Ellen was born, he and Sylvia saw an English nurse at Beverley \nHospital, who told them that they could not look after their children. When crossexamined about that statement, Don \nsaid that nobody had said that to them 'no welfare or anybody'.[51]  \n74 Fifthly, the evidence given by Don and Sylvia was inconsistent in some significant respects in relation to the \namount of time they had spent at Bessie Ninyette's block before the Siblings were committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department, and in relation to whether they had arranged for, or consented to, the Siblings being \ntaken to Sister Kate's before the Siblings were committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department.  \n75 For these reasons, where the evidence given by Don and Sylvia differed from the evidence as to factual matters \ncontained in contemporaneous documents, I have preferred that documentary evidence.  \n\n76 There is one final aspect of Don's evidence which it is convenient to mention here. I am unable to give rely on \nthe affidavit sworn by Don on 13 February 2013[52] which set out his evidenceinchief, for two reasons. First, in \ncrossexamination, Don accepted that there were errors in the affidavit.[53] Secondly, Don gave evidence that he \nhad not read that affidavit, or his affidavit of 9 November 2011[54] (on which his later affidavit was largely based) in \ntheir entirety.[55] Counsel for the plaintiffs accepted that in those circumstances no weight could be placed on \nthose affidavits.[56] That having been said, Don's evidence as to what happened emerged sufficiently clearly in \ncrossexamination, and I have taken that evidence into account.  \nThe evidence of the Children\n\n\n\n77 I accept that Darryl, Bonnie, Ellen, Wesley, and Eva were truthful witnesses. Subject to the caveats set out \nbelow (in relation to their perceptions of why they were committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department) I \naccept their evidence.  \n78 I accept that Beverley and Glenys were truthful witnesses, although they both appeared defensive in giving their \nevidence. I attributed that defensiveness to the sensitive nature of the evidence they gave (particularly in relation to \nhaving been sexually assaulted) and to their concern that they might not be believed about that evidence. I accept \ntheir evidence as to their recollections of their living conditions prior to being committed to the care of the Child \nWelfare Department, and as to the events of 7 December 1961, and their evidence as to their lives while in care.  \n\n79 However, in some respects, the evidence given by each of the Children was not reliable. Their beliefs and \nperceptions as to why they were taken into care, while genuinely held, have in my view been influenced by the \nviews of others as to what occurred, and I therefore place no weight on that evidence. Other specific aspects of \ntheir evidence are, as I explain below, likely to have been affected by the views of others, and I have not placed \nweight on that evidence.  \n80 Finally, other aspects of the Children's evidence as to when events occurred (particularly the events of \nDecember 1970) were not reliable, because of the passage of time. In so far as the evidence given by each of the \nChildren in these respects differed from the evidence as to factual matters contained in contemporaneous \ndocuments, I have preferred that documentary evidence.  \n81 I explain these conclusions further below.  \nReliability the passage of time\n\n82 Ellen, Eva and Wesley said they had no memory of their lives before they were committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department, or the circumstances in which they were committed. That is to be expected: Ellen was \nsix months old, Wesley was eight months old and Eva was 21 months old, when they were committed into the care \nof the Child Welfare Department.  \n83 Bonnie did not have a very detailed recollection of the events prior to, and at the time of, her committal to the \ncare of the Child Welfare Department. She agreed that it was difficult to try to 'reconstruct' memories from when she \nwas seven years old.[57]  \n\n84 However, in so far as the events of 7 December 1961 were concerned, some of the plaintiffs had clear \nrecollections of that day, despite being very young at the time. Beverley, for instance, was five years old when she \nwas committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department, yet she had a detailed recollection of what happened \non 7 December 1961, down to a recollection of what the Siblings were wearing at the time.[58] Darryl also had a \nrecollection of some of the events of 7 December 1961. Beverley and Glenys also had vivid memories of the sexual \nassaults to which they were subjected while they were in care. Counsel for the State submitted that the \nrecollections of some of the plaintiffs as to what occurred when they were committed to the care of the Child \nWelfare Department should be viewed with some caution because it was unlikely that very small children would \nhave such detailed recollections of what occurred after so many years. There is no doubt that as a general \nobservation, the memory of an event begins to deteriorate quite quickly after that event, and a person's memory of \nan event many years after that event may well be quite inaccurate. On the other hand, our common human \nexperience is that significant events, especially traumatic ones, can sometimes be recollected with clarity, even \nmany years later. In my view, this explains how some of the Children recall the events so long ago. The clarity of \ntheir recollections of those events does not lead me to doubt the credibility of their evidence but as I explain below, \nin some respects the evidence given by the Children as to what happened in 7 December 1961 was not reliable.  \n85 In addition, some of the Children (for example, Beverley, Bonnie, and Darryl) gave evidence about what they \nrecollected of their lives as small children. Some of this evidence (such as the details of their living conditions) was \nbroadly consistent with factual matters referred to in the contemporaneous documentary evidence, and I accept it.  \nReliability contamination of recollection\n86 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that during their crossexamination each of the Children gave evidence that \nthey had not spoken with Don and Sylvia in detail about why they were taken into the care of the Child Welfare \nDepartment. He submitted that  [n]o negative inference should be drawn about this. This is not peculiar when \nconsidering aboriginal families and the way many of them communicate. The concept of inner privacy may explain \n\n\n\nto some extent the plaintiffs' evidence that they have not discussed in detail their removal, life before their removal \n... and what happened to them following their removal.[59]\n\n87 I accept that some aboriginal people may not readily discuss highly personal matters with others. There was \nsome evidence in this case to support the conclusion that the plaintiffs had not engaged in much discussion about \nwhat had occurred, because the events in question were too painful to dwell on. Wesley's evidence was that 'none \nof us really talk about being taken. No one gets in each other's business about it or talks about the past.'[60] In \nEchoes of the Past, Wesley is quoted as saying 'we hold back, keep it to ourselves. Some of our feelings, we won't \ngive them all out. It's too painful to go there.'[61] Beverley also said that it hurt too much to talk about what had \noccurred.[62]  \n88 Quite apart from the effect of cultural differences, it is not difficult to envisage that other factors might have \nmeant that the plaintiffs have not discussed with each other, in a great deal of detail, what happened to them when \nthey were committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department the memories may have been too painful, or \nrepresented experiences overshadowed by shame or regret, or were too connected with other painful memories, \nsuch as the loss of Donald and William.  \n\n89 Even allowing for the influence of these possible factors, however, the evidence supports the conclusion that \neach of the plaintiffs has discussed what occurred when the Children were taken into care with at least one other \nplaintiff, and in the majority of cases that other plaintiff was Don or Sylvia (or both). Don initially denied that he had \nhad any discussion with the Siblings, since they were placed into care, about what happened when they were \nplaced into care.[63] However, he later conceded that there may have been some discussion about what \nhappened.[64] Sylvia also initially denied having talked with any of the Children about their being placed into \ncare.[65] However, she accepted that Ellen had asked about it,[66] and that Wesley had asked about what occurred \nand she had told him.[67]  \n\n90 The remaining plaintiffs gave evidence that they had discussed with their parents or some of their siblings what \nhappened when they were placed into care. Darryl said that when he went back to Brookton he had talked to his \nparents about what had happened, although he also independently recollected what had happened to the \nSiblings.[68]  \n91 Bonnie recollected that when she was in her 20s, she had a discussion with Don (and possibly Sylvia) about \nhow she was taken into care. Her evidence was that Don didn't go into a lot of detail 'he just said we were stolen, he \nnever put us there [that is, in Sister Kate's]'.[69] Bonnie said Don and Sylvia didn't give her any details, just that 'we \nwere taken'.[70]  \n92 Ellen's evidence was that she had asked questions of her parents and of other people about what had happened \nalthough she had not had much discussion with her parents because it had been quite painful.[71]  \n\n93 Glenys' evidence was that Bonnie had told her some details of what happened when they were taken into care, \nalthough Bonnie had no recollection of this.[72]  \n94 Beverley said that about four or five years after she met them, she had talked with her parents about what had \nhappened, and she told them what had happened to her,[73] although she denied that they had told her about the \nway in which she was actually removed from their care or the way they lived prior to when they were taken.[74]  \n95 Eva's evidence was that for as long as she could remember she'd been told by family members (aunties and an \nuncle) that Ms Jones removed the Siblings from her parents and they were made wards of the State.[75] Eva also \nsaid that she had talked about what happened with Glenys, Beverley and Bonnie.[76]  \n96 Wesley's evidence was that he talked once with Don about being taken into care, and that Don told him that he \nhad been stolen and that Don had to steal him back.[77] In telling his story for Echoes of the Past, Wesley is quoted \nas saying that  The only thing I listen to is my father, what he tells me. We were taken away by the Native Welfare \nfrom the reserve in Brookton. From what I have been told, wadjelas [that is, white Australians] just turned up and \ntook us away. That was it.[78]\n97 Wesley confirmed that he believed that was what happened because his father told him.[79] Wesley also \nconfirmed that he had spoken with Sylvia about what happened, and accepted that he would have spoken to his \nsiblings about what happened, but he couldn't now remember what was said.[80]  \n\n\n\n98 As the summary above indicates, the evidence supports the conclusion that such discussion as occurred \nbetween the plaintiffs related to the circumstances in which the Children came to be committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department.  \n99 Darryl, Bonnie, Glenys and Beverley had some recollection of the events of 7 December 1961, and of the \ncircumstances in which they lived prior to that time, but they did not have (and could not have been expected to \nhave) any independent contemporaneous knowledge of the reasons why they were committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department. The primary sources of information for the Children about why they were committed to \nthe care of the Child Welfare Department were necessarily Don and Sylvia. Don and Sylvia have clearly long held \nthe view that the Children were taken from them without justification, and in the case of the Siblings that they were \ntaken to Sister Kate's by Ms Jones without Don and Sylvia's consent.  \n\n100 The fact that there has been discussion between the plaintiffs about what occurred in March 1958, about what \noccurred prior to, and on, 7 December 1961 and about why the Children were placed into the care of the Child \nWelfare Department, has had the consequence that the Children's understanding or belief as to why they were \ncommitted to the care of the Child Welfare Department has been affected by the beliefs or perceptions of others, \nespecially Don and Sylvia. For that reason, to the extent that the Children gave evidence as to their belief that they \nwere placed in the care of the Child Welfare Department without justification, I give no weight to that evidence.  \n101 In addition, the evidence of some of the Children dealt with matters in respect of which young children could not \nbe expected to have had knowledge or insight. By way of example, Beverley's evidence dealt with whether Don and \nSylvia had been drinking heavily prior to the time when the Children were committed to the care of the Child \nWelfare Department. I do not accept that a child of five years old would be capable of making a reliable assessment \nof the extent to which the adults around her were drinking alcohol. Furthermore, Beverley accepted that she had \ntold a foster care assessor who interviewed her in 2002 that she had been told by the staff of Sister Kate's that the \nreason she had been removed from her home was because Don and Sylvia were alcoholics, but that she later \nlearned that Don and Sylvia did not start to drink until all of the Children were removed.[81] This evidence also \nsupports the conclusion that Beverley's understanding as to why she was made a ward was largely based on what \nshe was told by Don and Sylvia.  \nReliability inconsistencies in statements\n102 There was evidence that some of the Children, namely Glenys and Beverley, had previously made statements \nconcerning what happened to them when they were taken into care. Glenys confirmed that she had provided a \nnumber of statements. At some time prior to 1996, and with the assistance of the ALS, she prepared a statement \nabout her experiences.[82] In 2008 she prepared a statement, and later a revised statement, in support of her \napplication for an ex gratia payment under the Redress Scheme.[83] She provided information (possibly in \nconnection with the Stolen Generation enquiry[84]) for the purposes of a publication entitled 'Telling our Stories'.[85] \nShe provided a statement dated 5 October 2010 for the purpose of this action.[86] With the assistance of a friend \nshe also drafted notes to assist the ALS to prepare a statement for the purpose of these proceedings.[87] She \nprovided a statement dated 9 June 2011 for the purpose of these proceedings[88] which Glenys said she signed \nbut did not read,[89] and finally, Glenys provided a witness statement dated 15 February 2013.[90]  \n103 There are some differences in the content of these documents, both as to the details of the events recounted, \nand as to the omission to mention some events or details altogether, particularly in relation to the sexual assaults \nupon Glenys while she was in care.  \n104 Similarly, Beverley recalled speaking to someone from the ALS in about 1995 in relation to her family's \nexperiences, and her experiences appear to have formed the basis for one of the stories told in 'Telling our \nStories'.[91] Beverley accepted that some of the sexual assaults referred to in that publication (apparently in relation \nto her) did not appear in her witness statement in this action.[92] Beverley's evidence was that the assaults to which \nshe had been subject were those described in 'Telling Our Stories' report as well as those described in her witness \nstatement.[93]  \n\n105 Although there were discrepancies in the various statements Beverley and Glenys provided in relation to the \nsexual assaults to which they had been subject while in care, those discrepancies do not lead me to doubt the \ntruthfulness of the evidence given by Glenys and Beverley as to what occurred. Recounting a sexual assault can be \na highly traumatic experience for a victim. In contexts where it may not be crucial to recount the full details of what \n\n\n\nhas occurred it would not be surprising if a victim chose not to recount the entirety of the experience. Furthermore, \nthe tenor of Beverley's and Glenys' stories has been consistent over the years, even if the precise details have not \nbeen exactly recounted on each occasion. Glenys' and Beverley's evidence was consistent in relation to the \ncircumstances surrounding some of the assaults (namely those which were committed on Glenys and Beverley \nwhile they were on weekend visits with foster carers) and that consistency supports the veracity of their evidence. \nAccordingly, as I explain further below, I accept the evidence given by Beverley and Glenys that they were \nsubjected to sexual assault on more than one occasion and circumstance while they were in the care of the Child \nWelfare Department.  \nCredibility of the State's witnesses\n106 Mr Maine's evidence was primarily directed to the policies and practices of the Child Welfare Department at \nvarious times. I accept his evidence.  \n107 Mrs Patullo gave evidence of her experience as a cottage mother at Sister Kate's and particularly her \nrecollection of the arrival of the Siblings at Sister Kate's and her care for Wesley, who lived in her cottage. As I \nexplain below, while I accept that Mrs Patullo was truthful in her evidence, in these key respects I find her evidence \nunreliable.  \n\n108 First, Mrs Patullo recalled that Don and Sylvia themselves accompanied the Siblings to Sister Kate's on 7 \nDecember 1961. Mrs Patullo's evidence in this respect was at odds with the evidence of all of the plaintiffs, and with \nthe documentary evidence. In my view, it is likely that Mrs Patullo's recollection pertained to the first visit by Don \nand Sylvia to Sister Kate's, which appears to have been within a week of the Siblings' arrival.  \n\n109 Secondly, Mrs Patullo's evidence was that Wesley showed signs of malnutrition when he arrived at Sister \nKate's.[94] I do not accept this aspect of her evidence. The Sibling's physical health at the time of their admission to \nSister Kate's was noted in a document apparently prepared by the Superintendent of Sister Kate's, Mr Daniel. It is \nhighly likely that had Wesley been showing signs of malnutrition, Mr Daniel would have commented on that is his \nreport, yet there was no such indication in that document.  \n2. LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  \n\n110 In order to understand the facts, and to assess the plaintiffs' claim that the State was the subject of duties to \nthem as a fiduciary, it is necessary to consider the statutory framework for the decisions made, and actions taken, \nwith respect to the plaintiffs, which are the subject of this action. There was no dispute about the applicable \nlegislative framework, but the plaintiffs and the State took a different view of the implications of that framework in \nthe resolution of the plaintiffs' claims.  \n111 Two pieces of legislation which applied specifically to aboriginal people at the time of the events the subject of \nthis action were the Native Welfare Act 1905 1954 (WA) (the NW Act) and the Native Welfare Act 1963 (WA) (the \n1963 NW Act). I discuss below the key provisions of this legislation.  \n112 After undertaking an overview of the Native Welfare legislation, I then turn to consider two examples which \nillustrate how the NW Act applied to Don and Sylvia, prior to the Children being committed to the care of the Child \nWelfare Department.  \n113 At the time the Children were taken into care, and while they remained in the care of the Child Welfare \nDepartment, the legislation which dealt with the welfare of children, and enabled children to be made wards of the \nState, was the Child Welfare Act 1947 (WA) (the Child Welfare Act) and the Community Welfare Act 1972 (WA) (the \nCommunity Welfare Act). I discuss below the key provisions of this legislation.  \n(a) Overview of the Native Welfare Acts  \n114 In this section of my reasons, I provide an overview of the Native Welfare Acts which were applicable to \naboriginal people during the events the subject of this action, by reference to the following subjects:  \n(i) Application of the Native Welfare Acts;  \n(ii) Administration of the Native Welfare Acts;  \n(iii) Restrictions on the rights of aboriginal people;  \n(iv) Guardianship of aboriginal people.  \n115 However, it is useful to consider the legislation within some historical context, so in each subject area I have \nalso examined the provisions of the legislation prior to the 1950s.  \n(i) Application of the legislation\n\n\n\n116 The NW Act was originally enacted as the Aborigines Act 1905 (WA) (the Aborigines Act). The Aborigines Act \nwas an Act 'to make provision for the better protection and care of the aboriginal inhabitants of Western \nAustralia'.[95] It applied to 'aboriginal' persons and to 'halfcastes' within the meaning of the Act.  \n117 Under the Aborigines Act, persons deemed to be 'aboriginal persons' for the purposes of the Act were \naboriginal inhabitants of Australia, a 'halfcaste who lives with an aboriginal as wife or husband', a 'halfcaste who, \notherwise than as wife or husband, habitually lives or associates with aborigines' or a 'halfcaste child whose age \napparently does not exceed sixteen years', and for the purposes of this deeming provision, a 'halfcaste' included \nany person born of an aboriginal parent on either side, and the child of any such person.[96] The term 'halfcaste' for \nthe remainder of the Act was defined to mean 'any person being the offspring of an aboriginal mother and other \nthan an aboriginal father' excluding persons deemed to be 'aboriginal' for the purposes of the Act.[97] In addition, \nthe term 'halfcaste' did not apply to 'quadroons' (which term was not defined in the Act).[98]  \n118 Under the Aborigines Act, the Minister responsible for the administration of the Act was able to issue an \nexemption to an aboriginal or halfcaste who, in the Minister's opinion, ought not to be subject to the Act.[99]  \n119 In 1936, some significant amendments were made to the Aborigines Act.[100] The name of the Act was \nchanged to the Native Administration Act 1905 1936 (WA) and there was a shift in terminology in relation to the \npersons subject to the Act (from 'aboriginal' and 'halfcaste' to 'native').  \n120 In 1936, the deeming provision which identified aboriginal people for the purposes of the Act, and the definition \nof 'halfcaste', were repealed,[101] and replaced with a definition of 'native' which encompassed 'any person of the \nfull blood descended from the original inhabitants of Australia', and any person of less than full blood who was \ndescended from the original inhabitants or from their full blood descendants, other than persons who were \n'quadroons' in certain circumstances.[102] A 'quadroon' was defined to mean a 'person who is descended from the \nfull blood original inhabitants of Australia or their full blood descendants but who is only onefourth of the original full \nblood'.[103]  \n121 In 1936, a quadroon over 21 years of age was able to apply to a magistrate, with the consent of the Minister, to \nbe classed as a native under the Act, and the Commissioner of Native Affairs could also make such an application \nin relation to any quadroon over 21 years of age.[104] Further, any person 'of less than quadroon blood' who was \nborn before the end of 1936 could apply to the Minister to be classed as a native.[105]  \n122 In 1954, further significant amendments were made to the Native Administration Act 1905 (WA) by the Native \nWelfare Act 1954 (WA).[106] The name of the principal Act was changed to the Native Welfare Act 1905 1954 (WA) \n(the NW Act),[107] and there was a change in nomenclature, if not in focus, in that Act from 'native affairs' to 'native \nwelfare'.  \n123 Despite the amendments of the legislation in 1954, its key provisions to which I have already referred continued \nto apply. Accordingly, the definitions of 'native' and of 'quadroon' remained unchanged.[108]  \n124 In 1960, the NW Act was amended again,[109] in several important respects. First, the definition of 'native' was \namended to mean 'any person of the full blood descended from the original inhabitants of Australia' and 'any person \nof less than full blood who is descended from the original inhabitants of Australia or from their full blood \ndescendants, except a quadroon or person of less than quadroon blood'.[110] Secondly, the provisions in the Act \nwhich permitted a quadroon to be classed as a native were repealed.[111]  \n125 The 1963 NW Act was an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to and providing for the welfare of the \nnative inhabitants of Western Australia.[112] It repealed the NW Act,[113] but as its long title suggested, the Act \nretained many of the provisions of the NW Act in identical or very similar terms.  \n126 The term 'native' was relevantly defined in the 1963 Act to eliminate references to the term 'quadroon' while \nnevertheless retaining the distinction that term had embodied:  'native' means(a) any person of the full blood \ndescended from the original inhabitants of Australia; and\n\n (b) any person of less than full blood who is descended from the original inhabitants of Australia or from their full \nblood descendants, except a person so descended who is only onefourth or less than onefourth of the original full \nblood;\n\n ... .[114]\n\n\n\n127 In addition, the Minister was able to extend any or all of the benefits and privileges conferred on natives under \nthe Act to any person who established that he or she was 'a person of less than full blood descended from the \noriginal inhabitants of Australia' but not a native under the Act.[115]  \n128 For completeness, I note that the 1963 NW Act was repealed by the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act \n1972 (the AAPA Act) which, as its name suggests, established an Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority charged with \nthe duty of promoting the wellbeing of persons of aboriginal descent in Western Australia and which was required to \ntake into account the views of such persons as expressed by their representatives. It suffices to say that the \nobject,[116] terminology and focus of this Act represented a marked change from the 1963 NW Act. It is \nunnecessary to say anything further about the provisions of the AAPA Act.  \n(ii) Administration of the legislation\nPersonnel  \n129 Under the Aborigines Act, the key bodies or offices referred to under the Aborigines Act 1905 were the Minister \nresponsible for the administration of the Act, an Aborigines Department, a 'Chief Protector of Aborigines' and \npersons called 'protectors' who within particular districts within the State were able to exercise powers and duties \nunder the Act.[117] (After an amendment to the Aborigines Act 1905 in 1911, a deputy Chief Protector was also \nappointed.[118])  \n130 The Aborigines Department was given the duty of promoting the welfare of aborigines, providing them with \nfood, clothing, medicine and medical attendance, providing for the education of aboriginal children and generally \nassisting in the preservation and wellbeing of the aborigines.[119] The Department had express duties which \nincluded providing for the custody, maintenance, and education of the children of aborigines, managing and \nregulating the use of reserves set apart for the benefit of aborigines, and exercising a 'general supervision and care \nover all matters affecting the interests and welfare of the aborigines, and to protect them against injustice, \nimposition and fraud'.[120]  \n131 In 1936, the legislation was amended to change the name of the Department (to the Department of Native \nAffairs), and the title of the Chief Protector of Aborigines (to the Commissioner of Native Affairs).[121]  \n132 The 1936 amendments also created the office of inspector, and those persons appointed an inspector were \nrequired to report to the Commissioner on the conditions of natives generally.[122]  \n133 In 1954, the Department became known as the Department of Native Welfare, and the Commissioner was \nknown as the Commissioner of Native Welfare.[123] Inspectors under the Act became 'Protectors' under the NW \nAct. However, the functions of the Department remained the same.[124]  \n134 In 1960, the NW Act was amended to permit the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner of Native \nWelfare.[125]  \n135 The 1963 NW Act established a Department of Native Welfare, under the Minister responsible for the \nadministration of the Act, which was charged with the duty of promoting the welfare of natives.[126] The Minister \nwas established as a body corporate.[127] The Commissioner of Native Welfare, under the Minister, was \nresponsible for the administration of the Act and of the Department.[128] A Deputy Commissioner could also be \nappointed.[129]Representatives (formerly protectors) could be appointed by the Minister, and offices could be \nestablished by the Governor for the purpose of carrying out the Act.[130]  \n136 In the balance of these reasons I refer to the Commissioner of Native Welfare as the Commissioner.  \n137 The Minister, Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and officers of the Department of Native Welfare were not \nliable for acts or omissions in good faith in connection with the exercise of their powers under the NW Act and the \n1963 NW Act.[131]  \n(iii) Restrictions on the rights of aboriginal people\n138 The Aborigines Act made provision for where 'aboriginal' persons and 'halfcastes' could live, who they could \nlive with, who would be responsible for them and for their property, and their employment, amongst other things. \nThe Act adopted a paternalistic approach to aboriginal people, whose rights were significantly confined, and whose \nautonomy was significantly curtailed, as compared with nonindigenous Australians at the time.  \n139 It is not necessary for present purposes to outline the variety of ways in which the rights of aboriginal people \nwere confined under the Aborigines Act. For present purposes, it suffices to mention only those provisions dealing \nwith guardianship, residence, marriage and the maintenance of children.  \n\n\n\n140 Under the Aborigines Act, the marriage of an aboriginal woman to any person other than an aboriginal man had \nto be authorised by the Chief Protector.[132] It was an offence for a nonaboriginal man to cohabit with an aboriginal \nwoman, and it was an offence for any person other than an aboriginal person to habitually live with aborigines.[133]  \n141 The movement of aboriginal people around the State was restricted. It was an offence to remove an aboriginal, \na male halfcaste under sixteen years of age, or a female halfcaste from one district to another without \nauthority.[134] In addition, the Aborigines Act provided for reserves to be established where aboriginal people would \nlive.[135] Moreover, the Minister could cause an aboriginal person to be removed to and kept within the boundaries \nof a reserve, or be removed from one reserve or district to another and kept there.[136] It was also an offence for a \nperson other than an aboriginal person to enter onto a reserve without authorisation.[137]  \n142 In 1936, the provisions of the Aborigines Act with respect to marriage and cohabitation were repealed and new \nprovisions inserted into the Act. The effect of those new provisions was that a person who was a 'native' under the \nAct could not marry unless the Commissioner had been given prior notice and the opportunity to object to the \nmarriage.[138] In addition, it was an offence for any person who was not a native to habitually live with natives or \nwith any native not his wife or her husband, or to cohabit with any native not his wife or her husband.[139]  \n\n143 As I have already observed, following the amendments in 1954, the key provisions of the NW Act (in so far as \nthe restrictions on the rights of aboriginal people were concerned) remained the same. It remained the case that a \nperson (not a native) who habitually lived with natives, or with a native to whom he or she was not married, or who \ncohabited with a native to whom he or she was not married, committed an offence.[140] However, the NW Act was \namended so that it was no longer necessary to advise the Commissioner of the proposed marriage of a native, so \nas to permit the Commissioner the opportunity to object to the marriage.[141]  \n144 Under the NW Act, it continued to be an offence for a person other than a native to enter onto a reserve without \nauthorisation.[142]  \n145 Under the 1963 NW Act, the express duties of the Department of Native Welfare were in similar terms to its \nduties under the earlier legislation and include providing for the custody, maintenance and education of the children \nof natives, and exercising:  such general supervision and care in respect to all matters affecting the interests and \nwelfare of natives as the Minister in his discretion considers most fit to assist in their economic and social \nassimilation by the community of the State, and to protect them against injustice, imposition and fraud.[143]\n146 Under the 1963 NW Act, reserves for natives could still be established,[144] and it remained an offence for any \nperson other than a native to enter onto a reserve without authorisation.[145]  \n\n147 However, the 1963 NW Act did not place any restriction on marriage to, or cohabitation or residence with, an \naboriginal person.  \n(iv) Guardianship of aboriginal people\n148 Under the Aborigines Act, the Chief Protector was the 'legal guardian of every aboriginal and halfcaste child \nuntil such child attains the age of sixteen years'.[146] In an amendment made in 1911, the Chief Protector's \nguardianship of 'an illegitimate halfcaste child' excluded the rights of the mother of that child.[147] In addition, a \nProtector was able to apply to justices of the peace for an order requiring the father of a halfcaste child of less than \n14 years of age who was being maintained in an aboriginal institution, or at the cost of the Government, for \nmaintenance payments for the support of the child. The failure to pay maintenance could result in the imprisonment \nof the father.[148]  \n149 In 1936, the guardianship provision in the Act was amended to provide that the Commissioner was the legal \nguardian of every native child 'notwithstanding that the child has a parent or other relative living' until such child \nattained the age of twenty one years.[149] The provisions dealing with the payment of maintenance for children \nwere also amended in 1936 so that a protector could apply for an order for the payment of maintenance by the \nfather of a child of 'a native and some person other than a native' who was being maintained in a native institution \nor at the cost of the Government.[150]  \n150 In 1954, the provisions of the NW Act dealing with guardianship of children, and the payment of maintenance in \nrespect of children in institutions or being maintained at the cost of the Government were amended to align with the \nprovisions of the Child Welfare Act. Section 8 of the NW Act, which dealt with the guardianship of native children, \nwas amended[151] so that it provided:  The Commissioner shall be the legal guardian of every native child \nnotwithstanding that the child has a parent or other relative living, until such child attains the age of twentyone years \n\n\n\nexcept while the child is a ward according to the interpretation given to that expression by section four of theChild \nWelfare Act 1947; and the Commissioner may, from time to time direct what person is to have the custody of a \nnative child of whom he is the legal guardian, and his direction has effect according to its tenor.\n151 The amendments in 1954 permitted an application for an order for maintenance to be made by a protector \npursuant to the provisions of the Child Welfare Act.[152]  \n152 The 1963 NW Act did not contain any reference to the guardianship of aboriginal people.  \n(b) Don and Sylvia: two illustrative experiences under the Native Welfare Acts  \n153 As the overview above indicates, the application of the Native Welfare Acts turned on whether a person was \nclassified as a 'native' or a 'quadroon'. Don was initially classified as a 'native' but in 1956, his classification was \nchanged to that of a 'quadroon' under the NW Act.[153] Sylvia was classified as a 'native' on the basis that she \npossessed 11/32nds native blood.[154] Those classifications, and the application of the Native Welfare Acts to Don \nand Sylvia, had significant practical impacts on their lives, illustrated by the following two examples.  \n154 First, when Don was almost 17 years old, and Sylvia just over 17 years old, officers from the Department of \nNative Welfare became aware that they were living together and that Sylvia was pregnant. With the support of their \nparents they wished to get married. Because they were subject to the NW Act, they needed the permission of the \nCommissioner to do so.  \n155 Mr WrightWebster, then the District Officer for the Great Southern Region, wrote to the Commissioner on 12 \nMay 1950 in relation to their case.[155] Rather than recommend that permission be given for Don and Sylvia to \nmarry, or that they be provided with support to look after their baby when it arrived, Mr WrightWebster instead \nrecommended that Don and Sylvia each be removed to an institution for three months, at the end of which time \ntheir baby would have been born and they could be permitted to marry. The reasoning behind this recommendation \nwas to deter other couples from engaging in similar 'undesirable' behaviour. Mr Wright-Webster noted:  I feel that \nthe prompt removal ... should have the salutary effect on other young couples in this district who contemplate \nadopting this dubious course of living together while unmarried or while too young to get married.[156]\n\n156 Ultimately, however, the Commissioner recommended to the Minister for Native Affairs that only Sylvia should \nbe removed to the Moore River Native Settlement, as there was no institution to which Don could be removed.[157]  \n157 The Minister issued a warrant pursuant to s 18 of the Native Administration Act 1905 1947 for Sylvia to be \napprehended by the police and taken to the Moore River Native Settlement and kept there during the Minister's \npleasure.[158] Sylvia was admitted to the Moore River Native Settlement on 15 June 1950.[159] Sylvia's evidence \nwas that she was not told why she was taken to Moore River.[160]  \n158 Unbeknownst to the Department for Native Affairs, when Sylvia was apprehended by the police, she had \nalready given birth to Glen, who was then three weeks old. The Commissioner of Police advised the Commissioner \nthat Glen did not accompany Sylvia to the Moore River Native Settlement but was instead left behind with his \ngrandmother (Bessie Ninyette) at Brookton.[161]  \n159 One of the documents in evidence suggested that Glen had been left behind at Brookton at Sylvia's express \nwish.[162] However, in her evidence, Sylvia denied that that was the case. Her evidence was that Constable Wall \ntold her that she could not take her baby with her, and told her it would be better if she left Glen behind with her \nmother. Sylvia's evidence was that she did not feel like she had any choice, so she left Glen behind.[163] Given \nGlen's young age, and the fact that Sylvia was breastfeeding him at the time, it is very difficult to envisage that \nSylvia would have voluntarily decided not to take Glen with her to the Moore River Native Settlement. I accept \nSylvia's evidence that she acted upon Constable Wall's advice that she could not take Glen with her to Moore River, \nand that that was the reason he stayed in Brookton with Bessie Ninyette.  \n160 Sylvia's evidence was that she felt frightened, lonely and isolated at the Moore River Settlement, and missed \nDon and Glen.[164]  \n161 The fact that Sylvia had already had her baby by the time she was removed to the Moore River Native Title \nSettlement subsequently came to the attention of Mr WrightWebster. He recommended to the Commissioner that in \nview of the birth of Glen, and in view of the fact that Don and Sylvia's marriage was supported by their parents, they \nshould be permitted to marry upon Sylvia's release from Moore River.[165] The Commissioner then recommended \nthat the Minister cancel the warrant for Sylvia's removal to the Moore River Native Settlement. It appears that Sylvia \nspent three to four weeks at the Moore River Native Title Settlement.  \n\n\n\n162 The Commissioner also recommended that prior to her marriage Sylvia be returned to Brookton so that Glen \ncould live with her, and that Ms Jones, a Missionary Worker in Brookton, had offered to supervise Sylvia and \narrange employment for her until her marriage.[166]  \n163 Don and Sylvia were married on 12 August 1950.  \n\n164 The second example of how the Native Welfare Acts had a significant practical impact on Don and Sylvia's \nlives can be more succinctly stated, but its impact was significant nevertheless. The Department of Native Welfare \nprovided 'housing' on an aboriginal reserve at Brookton (the Brookton Reserve). The evidence suggested that this \n'housing' consisted of tin humpies comprising three rooms, with no insulation, concrete floors, and walls which did \nnot meet the floor, where the water supply to each humpy consisted of a tap at the front, and with toilet and shower \nfacilities in a separate ablution block used by everyone who lived on the reserve.  \n165 Although Sylvia was classified as a native, and she and any of her children were entitled to live on the Brookton \nReserve, she and Don were not able to get accommodation on the Brookton Reserve because of Don's \nclassification as a 'quadroon'. That classification meant that Don was not permitted to enter onto the Brookton \nReserve other than to get water.[167]  \n166 Consequently, Don and Sylvia had to find their own accommodation. As I explain below, for a substantial \nperiod each year until 1970, Don and Sylvia lived in a humpy at a camp on Bessie Ninyette's block which was \nadjacent to the Brookton Reserve.  \n167 In the balance of these reasons, I refer to the humpy in which Don and Sylvia lived on Bessie Ninyette's block \nas 'the humpy'.  \n(c) Overview of the Child Welfare Act  \n168 By way of overview of the provisions of the legislation in force at the time when the Children were removed and \nduring the term of their wardships, I deal with the following matters:  \n(i) Grounds on which a child could be removed into the care of the Child Welfare Department;  \n(ii) The administration of the legislation;  \n(iii) The process for removing a child into the care of the Child Welfare Department;  \n(iv) Guardianship and supervision of wards;  \n\n(v) Where wards could be placed into care;  \n(vi) Maintenance for wards.  \n(i) Grounds on which a child could be removed into the care of the Child Welfare Department\n\n169 At the time when Ellen, and later the Siblings, were placed into care, one of the objectives of the Child Welfare \nAct was to make provision for the care of destitute and neglected children.[168] An application could be made to the \nChildren's Court for a child to be committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department if that child was destitute or \nneglected.  \n170 A 'destitute child' included a child who did not appear to have a sufficient means of subsistence and whose \nnear relatives were in indigent circumstances and unable to support that child.[169] A 'neglected child' was one \nwho, amongst other things, lived with a person known to the police as of bad repute, or who had been or was \nreputed to be, a habitual drunkard, or was a child under the guardianship or in the custody of any person whom the \nChildren's Court considered was unfit to have such guardianship or custody, or was a child who was not being \nmaintained properly or at all.[170]  \n(ii) The administration of the legislation\nThe Child Welfare Department  \n171 The administration of the Child Welfare Act was carried out by the Child Welfare Department, under the control \nof the Minister.[171] The Child Welfare Department was headed by a Director, who (under the direction of the \nMinister) was subject to the duty to carry into operation the provisions of the Act, save in so far as those duties were \nexpressly committed to some other person.[172] An Assistant Director, inspectors and other officers could be \nappointed with such powers and functions as were deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.[173]The \nDirector, Assistant Director, and inspectors and officers with powers and functions to carry out the purposes of the \nAct, were all appointed by the Governor.  \nThe Department of Community Welfare  \n\n\n\n172 In 1972, the Department of Community Welfare was established by the Community Welfare Act 1972 (WA). \nThe Child Welfare Act was amended at the same time, to transfer the administration of the Act to the Department of \nCommunity Welfare. Accordingly, the amendments to the Child Welfare Act provided that the Department of \nCommunity Welfare established under the Community Welfare Act would administer the Act, while the Director and \nAssistant Director referred to in the Child Welfare Act were thereafter to be referred to, and to be in the position of, \nthe Director and deputy of the Director of the Department of Community Welfare.[174] All inspectors and officers of \nthe former Child Welfare Department were deemed to have been appointed and engaged under the Community \nWelfare Act, although they continued to be subject to the Child Welfare Act.  \n173 Under the Community Welfare Act, the control of the Department was vested in the Minister established as a \nbody corporate.[175] The office of Director of Community Welfare was established, and provision made for the \nappointment of a deputy to the Director, and of officers and employees of the Department.[176] In 1978, \ntheCommunity Welfare Act was amended to provide that the Director, deputy of the Director, and any officer of the \nDepartment while acting in the exercise or purported exercise of his or its powers or functions was deemed to be an \nagent of the Minister as the body corporate.[177]  \n174 In the balance of these reasons, I use the term Director to refer to the Director of the Child Welfare Department \nor the Department of Community Welfare.  \nAdministration in more recent years  \n175 I note for completeness that from 1 January 1985, the Community Welfare Act was renamed the Community \nServices Act, the Department of Community Welfare became known as the Department for Community Services, \nreferences in the Community Services Act and the Child Welfare Act to the office of Director of Community Welfare \nwere replaced with the Director General of the Department for Community Services, and the role of deputy to the \nDirector was replaced by an Assistant Director General.[178]  \n176 The Department has subsequently been renamed the Department of Family and Children's Services and the \nDepartment for Community Development.  \nImmunity from personal liability  \n177 In 1958, the Child Welfare Act was amended to provide that a person who occupied, or had occupied, the office \nof Minister, Director, or officer of the Department, or who had carried out duties or functions under the Act was not \npersonally liable for any act or omission in good faith in connection with that exercise or purported exercise of \npower.[179]  \n178 In 1972, the Community Welfare Act was amended to include a provision providing immunity from civil liability \nfor the Minister in his personal capacity, the Director, the deputy Director, any officer of the Department, or any \ndelegate for any act or omission in good faith in the exercise or purported exercise of the powers or functions or \nduties under the Community Welfare Act.[180]  \n(iii) The process for removing a child into the care of the Department\n179 Children's Courts were established by Order in Council of the Governor under the Child Welfare Act.[181] \nThose courts had to be constituted by a special magistrate or at least two members.[182] (A member of a Children's \nCourt had the same powers as a justice of the peace.[183]) Magistrates for a magisterial district, or other \nmagistrates, could be appointed a special magistrate for the Children's Court in a district.[184]  \n180 At the time that each of the children was made a ward, Children's Courts had jurisdiction to hear an application \nbrought in respect of a destitute or neglected child.[185] If satisfied that the child was destitute or neglected, a \nChildren's Court could make a declaration to that effect and make an order that the child be committed to the care \nof the Child Welfare Department, sent to an institution specified in the order to be detained there or otherwise dealt \nwith under the Act, or released on probation, for a specified period or until 18 years of age.[186]  \n181 The Court could direct that the child be detained in a particular institution, at which special training or \nsupervision could be provided to meet the needs of any special case,[187] or it could make recommendations in \nrespect of a child who was the subject of an application.[188] In those cases where the Children's Court had made \na recommendation in relation to the child, that recommendation could not be departed from without the consent of \nthe Minister.[189] (Amendments to the Child Welfare Act in 1959 removed the requirement for the consent of the \nMinister before a recommendation made by a Children's Court could be departed from.[190])  \n182 The order of the Children's Court committing the child to the care of the Child Welfare Department, or to an \ninstitution, had to be set out in a prescribed form and indicate the age and religion of the child, and the cause for \nwhich the child was detained.[191]  \n\n\n\n183 An order made under the Child Welfare Act in respect of a child in the absence of his or her parent or guardian, \nin circumstances where reasonable notice of the complaint had not been given to the parent or guardian, could be \nset aside by the Children's Court upon application by the parent or guardian within three months of the making of \nthe order.[192] Otherwise, if a parent or guardian wished to challenge a decision of the Court to declare a child \nneglected or destitute, they could apply to the Supreme Court, within a month of the decision made by the \nChildren's Court, for a review of that decision.[193]  \n184 A parent could, by writing signed before a special magistrate, commit the care of a child to a person or society \napproved by the Governor as a person or society to whose care destitute or neglected children could be committed. \nIf that person or society consented in writing to accept the care of the child, the person or society would become the \nguardian of the child to the exclusion of his or her parent.[194]  \n\n185 A child who was committed under the provisions of the Child Welfare Act, to an institution, or to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department, became a 'ward'.[195] Subject to some exceptions which are not presently relevant, no \nward could be detained in an institution or remain under the control of the Child Welfare Department after reaching \n18 years of age.[196]  \n186 A ward who absconded from an institution or from a foster parent could be apprehended without a warrant by \nany police officer or by any officer of the Child Welfare Department and conveyed to an institution as directed by the \nDirector.[197]  \n(iv) Guardianship and supervision of wards\n187 As at the time when Ellen, and later the Siblings, were made wards, the Child Welfare Act provided that the \nDirector had the care, management and control of the persons and property of all wards, subject to the direction of \nthe Minister.[198]  \n188 The Child Welfare Act was amended in 1962. One of those amendments provided that subject to the \nregulations, and to the direction of the Minister, the Director was the guardian, and had the care, management and \ncontrol of the persons and property of all wards.[199]  \n\n189 In addition, the Child Welfare Department retained a general supervision over all wards detained in an \ninstitution or placed out.[200]  \n\n190 The Child Welfare Act required that the Director cause all wards placed out to be visited once every six \nmonths by an officer of the Department, to ensure that the treatment, education, and care of such children was \nsatisfactory.[201] In addition, if a child was committed to the care of a person or society, that person or society was \nrequired to permit the child to be visited, and the place of residence to be inspected, by the Director or an officer of \nthe Child Welfare Department from time to time.[202]  \n\n(v) Where wards could be placed into care\n\n191 The Director had the power to deal with any child committed to the care of the Department by (amongst other \nthings) placing the child in a receiving depot, detaining the child in an institution, or placing the child in the custody \nof a suitable person willing to take charge of the child.[203] An 'institution' included any government industrial \nschool, any orphanage or reformatory school, any receiving depot, and all other places under the supervision of the \nDepartment.[204] The Governor could declare any building or place to be a Government institution or a subsidised \ninstitution for the purposes of the Act.[205]  \n\n192 In addition, the Child Welfare Department could (with the consent of the person or society concerned) commit a \nchild in the Department's care to the care of a person or society approved by the Governor for that purpose.[206] \nThe Director could also place out a ward to board with a relative, or with a suitable person approved by the Director \nfor such period as the Director thought fit.[207] A ward placed in one institution could be transferred to another \ninstitution, with the approval of the Minister.[208] In 1959, amendments to the Child Welfare Act permitted the \nMinister to delegate to the Director his power to approve the transfer of a ward from one institution to another.[209]  \n193 As I have already observed, at the time of making an order in relation to a child, the Children's Court could \ncommit that child to an institution, and in doing so, the Court was required to have regard to the future welfare of the \n\n\n\nchild.[210] So, for example, the Court could direct that the child be detained in a particular institution, at which \nspecial training or supervision could be provided to meet the needs of any special case.[211]  \n\n194 It was an offence for any person to remove a ward from any institution or from a foster parent to whom the child \nhad been placed out, before the term of that child's placement expired.[212]  \n(vi) Maintenance for wards\n195 The Child Welfare Act provided for the collection of maintenance from near relatives of a ward (which included \nthe parents of that child), and a near relative who had an ability to contribute towards the maintenance of the child \ncould be summonsed to appear before the Children's Court.[213] If the Court was satisfied that the relative was \nable to pay for, or contribute to, the maintenance of the child, an order could be made that that person do so.[214] \nAn order for the payment of maintenance by a near relative could be made at the time the Children's Court made an \norder declaring a child to be destitute or neglected, without any complaint having been served on the near relative. \nHowever, this could only be done if the near relative was present when the maintenance order was applied for, or \nhad received notice of the Department's intention to apply for a maintenance order.[215]  \n196 A person who failed to comply with a maintenance order could be summoned before the Children's Court on \ncomplaint, and subjected to a term of imprisonment or to other orders.[216]  \n3. THE FACTS  \n197 In this section of my reasons I set out my findings as to the facts relevant to the allegations pleaded in the \nStatement of Claim. I have made each finding of fact on the balance of probabilities, having regard to the evidence \nadduced at the trial.  \n198 A large number of documents were tendered in evidence. Save where I have specifically indicated to the \ncontrary, in the discussion which follows I accept that the information set out in the documents is reliable, and \nwhere I refer to a fact evidenced by information in a document, I rely on that document to establish that fact.  \n199 Before turning to consider the facts, it is appropriate to deal with an issue which arose in relation to the \nquestion of the knowledge which should be attributed to the State in relation to the events the subject of these \nproceedings.  \n200 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that:  the knowledge of the servants and agents of the State is taken to be \nthe knowledge of the State, because those servants and agents comprise the directing mind of the State, or \nbecause the State is taken to know what the servants or agents of the State had a duty to communicate to the State \nrepresented by the Minister. The State, as a principal, must be taken to know whatever the agents had a duty to \ncommunicate. The State does not escape liability where employees of the State did not know about risks of harm of \nwhich the State, through its directing mind was aware.[217]\n201 In support of each of these propositions, counsel for the plaintiffs relied on Western Australia v Watson.[218]\n202 These submissions were directed to the question of what knowledge (as to the risks of harm which could arise \nas a result of separating children from their parents) could be imputed to the State. The submissions were \nadvanced in support of the proposition that if it could be said that the Director had knowledge of the risks of harm to \nthe plaintiffs, then that knowledge could be imputed to the State.  \n203 The issue, however, has a broader significance than the knowledge of the risks of harm from separating \nchildren from their parents. In this case, that broader question concerns the extent to which the knowledge of one \nofficer or employee of the State \u2013 as to a particular fact or state of affairs - can be imputed to the State itself.  \n204 The State's position was that if the State owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs, its conduct (relevant to the \nalleged breaches of those duties) fell to be judged from the observations all public officers had made.[219] That \nappeared to be a submission that the knowledge of the employees of the State could be imputed to the Director, \nand in turn to the State itself.  \n\n205 In Western Australia v Watson the Full Court of this Court dealt with an appeal by the State against a finding of \nnegligence and an award of damages to a plaintiff who had been exposed to asbestos dust while employed in the \nHarbour and Light Department. One of the issues on the appeal concerned whether it was reasonably foreseeable \nby the State that the inhalation of asbestos dust was hazardous and could cause disease. There was evidence that \nat the relevant time, the Ministers for Health and Mines, and the Commissioner for Health, were aware of the \ndangers of exposure to asbestos dust, but there was no direct evidence as to the state of knowledge of the Minister \n\n\n\nresponsible for the Harbour and Light Department. The question was whether the knowledge of the former could be \nattributed to the government as a whole.  \n206 The Full Court held that the directing mind and will of the State comprised the Ministers in the government, who \nwere effectively delegates of the State, so that knowledge acquired by the Ministers, in that capacity, would be \nregarded as actual knowledge of the State.[220] They had a duty to communicate relevant knowledge to one \nanother.[221]  \n207 The Court also held that the directing mind and will of the State extended beyond Ministers to heads of \ngovernment departments, including the Commissioner for Health who, subject to the Minister, was also to be \nconsidered a delegate of the Government. The Commissioner had a statutory duty to communicate information to \nthe Minister. The Court held that the State, as the principal, would be taken to know whatever the agents had a duty \nto communicate.[222] Furthermore, knowledge of agents could be aggregated in such circumstances.[223]  \n208 Accordingly, actual knowledge by the Commissioner in relation to a public health matter would constitute \nknowledge by the Government.[224] Even if that were not so, the Court held that in view of the fact that the \nCommissioner was a servant or agent of the State he had a duty to communicate that knowledge to the State \nrepresented by the Minister.[225]  \n209 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, knowledge of the Commissioner relevant to the NW Act, the \n1963 NW Act and the administration of the Department of Native Welfare, constituted knowledge of the State. \nKnowledge of the Director relevant to the Child Welfare Act and the administration of the Child Welfare Department, \nalso constituted knowledge of the State. The employees within those Departments, as servants or agents of the \nState, can be regarded as under a duty to communicate knowledge relevant to the administration of the legislation \nand their Departments, to the Commissioner and the Director respectively. The State (as the principal) would be \ntaken to know what those agents had a duty to communicate. For this reason, in my view, information obtained by \nan employee of either the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department relevant to the \nimplementation of the NW Act, or the Child Welfare Act, in relation to the Collard case, can be imputed to the \nCommissioner or the Director, respectively, and in turn can be taken to be known by the State.  \n210 In the discussion which follows, when I make findings as to the knowledge of the State, I mean to refer to that \nknowledge which the Commissioner or the Director actually held, or knowledge which was held by, or knowledge \nwhich can be imputed to, the Commissioner or the Director because that knowledge was the knowledge of \nemployees of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department.  \n211 It is convenient to discuss the facts by reference to the key events or issues which are the subject of the \npleadings, namely:  \n(a) The circumstances surrounding Ellen's placement into the care of the Child Welfare Department;  \n(b) The evidence as to Ellen's state of health when she was admitted to hospital in 1958, and as to where Don and \nSylvia and the Children were living in 1958;  \n(c) The circumstances surrounding the Siblings' placement into the care of the Child Welfare Department;  \n(d) Where were Don and Sylvia and the Siblings living in 1961?  \n(e) Responsibility for the Children after they became wards;  \n(f) Where the Children lived during their wardships;  \n(g) Don and Sylvia's family and living situation between 1962 and 1970;  \n(h) The events of Christmas 1970;  \n(i) Don and Sylvia's care for other children during the 1970s;  \n(j) Aspects of the Children's experiences during their wardships, including supervision of the Children by the Child \nWelfare Department;  \n(k) The extent of supervision or monitoring of the Children's welfare by officers of the Child Welfare Department;  \n(l) Contact between Don and Sylvia and the Children during the course of their wardships;  \n(m) The process followed, and factors considered, by officers of the Child Welfare Department and the Department \nof Native Welfare during the late 1950s and early 1960s by which an application would be made for an order that a \nchild be made a ward;  \n(n) Was the removal of the Children undertaken pursuant to a policy of assimilation of aboriginal children?  \n(o) The knowledge possessed by officers of the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department of \nthe potential adverse psychological implications for children removed from their families;  \n(p) Knowledge of cultural implications of removing aboriginal children from their families;  \n\n\n\n(q) Was the return of the Children to Don and Sylvia considered by the Child Welfare Department at any stage \nduring their wardships?  \n(r) Attempts by State authorities to obtain housing assistance for Don and Sylvia;  \n(s) Maintenance orders made in relation to the care of the Children;  \n(t) Injuries and causation;  \n(u) Actions taken by the plaintiffs in pursuit of their claims.  \n(a) The circumstances surrounding Ellen's placement into the care of the Child Welfare Department  \n212 Don and Sylvia gave evidence that when Ellen was nearly six months old, she became ill.[226] She was unable \nto hold down any food and began to lose weight quickly, so they took her to Beverley Hospital.[227]  \n213 Their evidence was that they took Ellen to Beverley Hospital on 12 February 1958. I accept that evidence. It is \nconsistent with a file note prepared by an officer of the Child Welfare Department, Mr John Waghorne, to which I \nrefer below.[228]  \n214 Don and Sylvia's evidence was that they were told that Ellen would have to remain in hospital for a few \ndays.[229] At the time, Don was doing shearing work on a farm near Beverley which was owned by a Mr and Mrs \nMcLean, so after they took Ellen to the hospital, Don and Sylvia returned to the McLean's farm. They, or Mrs \nMcLean, telephoned the hospital every day[230] or every few days[231] to check on Ellen. Sylvia's evidence was \nthat 'each time we called we ... were told that Ellen was 'going alright' but was not yet ready to be collected'.[232]  \n215 There were some inconsistencies in the evidence as to when Don and Sylvia returned to the hospital. Don's \nevidence was that he thought it was about a week after they first took Ellen to hospital,[233] but accepted that it \nmay have been a couple of weeks later,[234] although he denied it was as long as a month later that they \nreturned.[235] Sylvia's recollection was that Ellen had been in hospital for around two weeks when they returned to \nthe hospital to collect her.[236] A file note prepared by Mr Waghorne, dated 13 March 1958[237] indicates that Ellen \nremained in Beverley hospital until 13 March 1958. The date of that file note suggests that it was written very shortly \nafter the events to which it refers, and I find that it constitutes more reliable evidence as to the time frame than Don \nand Sylvia's recollections. I find that Ellen remained in hospital for 1 month.  \n216 I find that Don and Sylvia returned to Beverley Hospital to collect Ellen some time on or after 13 March 1958. \nDon and Sylvia's experience when they returned to Beverley Hospital was nothing short of dreadful. Sylvia's \nevidence as to what they were told, which I accept, was as follows:  When we arrived at the hospital, we said to the \nnurse at the front door of the hospital that we had come to take Ellen home. The nurse rushed back inside to get the \nmatron.\n\n ...\n\n When she arrived at the entrance, the matron told us that Ellen had 'gone'.\n\n I was devastated when the Matron said Ellen was 'gone'. I thought that she meant that Ellen had died, just like the \ndoctor in York told me Glen had died. No one knows how hard that was for me. It was terrible, it really affected me \nand I know it also affected Don. I think that I may have almost fallen over from the shock.\n\n When I came back to my senses we worked out that the Matron was saying that Ellen had been 'fostered' out or \n'adopted'. I can't remember which word the matron used. I felt numb and sick inside and felt as if I couldn't breathe. \nAll this happened while I was at the front door of the hospital.\n\n It was such a shock to hear that Ellen had been fostered out because each time we had rung we had been told that \nEllen was going 'alright'. ... I felt that it had all been arranged without our knowledge and that we had been \nintentionally deceived by the hospital staff who were saying Ellen was going to be alright.\n\n The matron would not let us into the hospital and I am not sure why. Don and I kept asking questions to try and find \nout where Ellen was. They wouldn't answer any of our questions and Don and I were just told that we needed to go \nto the aboriginal Affairs/ Native Welfare office in Wellington Street, Perth for more details of Ellen's whereabouts.\n\n\n\n The nurse told me Ellen would be 'better off' where she had gone. We had a row with her because we were \nobviously upset. The nurse threatened to call the police, so we left because we were scared we would be put in jail \nfor nothing if they arrived.[238]\n217 In fact, what had occurred was that an application had been made to the Beverley Children's Court for an order \nthat Ellen be committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department until she was 18 years of age. Having regard to \na copy of the order which was in evidence, I find that an application was made to the Court on 13 March 1958, and \non the same day, an order was made by two justices of the peace sitting as the Beverley Children's Court by which \nEllen 'was adjudged to be a neglected child within the meaning of s 4 definition of the Child Welfare Act' and \ncommitted to the care of the Child Welfare Department until she was 18 years of age.[239]However, the order was \nmade with a recommendation that the committal be subject to a review of the Collard's home conditions in 12 \nmonths' time.[240]  \n218 The State did not call any witnesses in relation to the circumstances concerning the decision to apply for an \norder committing Ellen to the care of the Child Welfare Department. However, the State tendered a small number of \ndocuments which shed some light on the circumstances surrounding the decision to apply for an order in respect of \nEllen.  \n219 The decision to apply for an order, and the application itself, appears to have been made by Mr Waghorne, an \nofficer in the Child Welfare Department, who has since died.[241] The key document in relation to that application \nwas a file note of the Child Welfare Department prepared by Mr Waghorne and dated 13 March 1958,[242] in which \nhe noted the following:  I have to advise that the matron of the Beverley hospital phoned me on the 12th inst to the \neffect that a baby named Ellen Collard born 25957 had been admitted to the hospital on the 12258 suffering from \nmalnutrition and lack of proper care. She knew the parents as this baby had been born at the hospital and was then \nthe normal weight of 6lbs 3ozs. When brought to the hospital it was five lbs and underweight for its age. The baby \nwas now ready for discharge. She knew that the parents were living in filthy conditions and she considered it would \nbe dangerous to return the baby to such a home. ...\n\n In view of the urgency of the case I came to Beverley, where with Const Whitney I went to Brookton where I \ninspected the Collard home. This home consisted of a tin humpy of one room with a partition constructed of \ngalvanised iron, unlined with a dirt floor. There was practically no furniture and the sleeping arrangements \nconsisted of one double bed and one single bed. The bedding was dirty and the premises generally was not clean.\n\n Mrs Collard told me that she came under the Native Welfare Act. ... Mr Wright-Webster [the then District Officer for \nthe Native Welfare Department] said that he could not get to Beverley for a week or so. In view of this fact I \nconsidered it would be detrimental and in fact dangerous, to the child's welfare to allow it to be returned to such \nfilthy conditions so I decided to make application to the Court to have it made a ward of the State. This application \nwas successful in the Beverley Children's Court this date.\n\n In view of the fact that the children come within ... the Native Welfare I decided to leave the remaining five children \nwith their parents until the matter can be looked into by that Department. ...\n\n The baby is being escorted to Perth this date by ... a nurse from the Beverley Hospital. ...\n\n I was successful in getting a maintenance order against the father. ...\n220 Another of the documents in evidence constituted a portion of a document headed 'Informative Report on Child' \nwhich bears a reference to a date of hearing on 13 March 1958.[243] It appears from the document that it was \nprepared for use in the application to the Children's Court. Those parts of that document which can be deciphered \ncontain a description of the Collards' home as follows:  ... House: Tin Humpy. State of Repair: Poor.\n\n Number of bedrooms: One room for all purposes.\n\n Sleeping arrangements: Very poor.\n\n\n\n ...\n\n Cleanliness: Dirty.\n\n Conditions adequate for Child's needs? No.\n221 The Informative Report on Child thus appears to be consistent with the file note prepared by Mr Waghorne.  \n222 I infer that the matters set out in the 'Informative Report on Child' formed part of the evidence given by Mr \nWaghorne to the Children's Court at Beverley and were the basis for the order made by that Court that Ellen be \ncommitted to the care of the Child Welfare Department.  \n\n223 Don and Sylvia disputed a number of aspects of Mr Waghorne's file note of 13 March 1958, and of the \n'Informative Report on Child'. Sylvia claimed that the matron at the Beverley hospital was new, and could not have \nknown anything about Ellen's living conditions.[244] However, there were no records available from the Beverley \nhospital from 1958, and no staff who worked at the hospital at the time gave evidence, or had been located, so \nthese aspects of Mr Waghorne's file note could not be tested.  \n224 In addition, Sylvia disputed that she had ever spoken with Mr Waghorne.[245] Her evidence was that before \nEllen was taken, the Department of Native Welfare had never had any contact with her at all, and that officers from \nthe Child Welfare Department had never come to her home or spoken to her.[246]  \n\n225 In crossexamination, it was put to Don that native welfare officers had come to Bessie Ninyette's block on a \nnumber of occasions before Ellen was taken, or before the Siblings were taken. Don denied that this was the case. \nHe said that welfare officers had never come to their place at Brookton.[247]  \n\n226 However, those denials were inconsistent with the joint statement Don and Sylvia made to the ALS in 1995. In \nthat statement, Don and Sylvia had said that  native welfare used to come around and see where we lived in \nBrookton at Sylvia's mum's place. Native welfare was feared by us.[248]\n227 In crossexamination, Don was asked about this statement, and he said it was  Constable Stan Wall ... mainly, \nand those welfare officers never come around ... whatever they said, we never saw them once but they wrote ... \nabout us.[249]\n\n228 Sylvia was also asked about the statement she and Don made to the ALS in 1995. Her evidence was:  they \nwasn't feared, but my mother they never came to my mother's block because she was classed as white. She lived \non her own and they never came to her, they wouldn't come on her place when they did come up there, if they \ncame up there.[250]\n\n229 I do not accept Sylvia and Don's evidence, in so far as they denied that officers of the Department of Native \nWelfare had visited the humpy prior to Ellen being removed from their care, for three reasons. First, those denials \nwere inconsistent with the joint statement Don and Sylvia provided to the ALS in which they acknowledged that \nnative welfare officers had come to see them at Bessie Ninyette's block. Secondly, it is difficult to envisage any \nplausible reason why Mr Waghorne would have fabricated the contents of his report, particularly when that report \nwas to form the basis for evidence given to the Children's Court. Thirdly, as I explain below at [854] to [856] the \nevidence as to departmental practice within both the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare \nDepartment suggests that it was the practice of inspectors to inspect a child's living conditions before an application \nwas brought for that child to be made a ward. That evidence also supports the conclusion that it is more likely than \nnot that Mr Waghorne did inspect the living conditions at the humpy prior to preparing his report, and making the \napplication to the Children's Court that Ellen be made a ward.  \n230 I turn next to consider the evidence as to the accuracy of Mr Waghorne's understanding that the humpy was \nDon and Sylvia's home, and as to the accuracy of his report as to Ellen's state of health when she was admitted to \nhospital, and of the conditions at the humpy.  \n(b) The evidence as to Ellen's state of health when she was admitted to hospital in 1958, and as to where Don and \nSylvia and the Children were living in 1958  \nEllen's state of health in March 1958\n\n\n\n231 The key aspects of Mr Waghorne's file note of 13 March 1958 in relation to Ellen's health are that she was \nadmitted to hospital suffering from malnutrition and lack of proper care, and that when she was admitted (at \napproximately five months of age) she weighed less than she had when she was born.[251]  \n\n232 Don and Sylvia's evidence was that Ellen had contracted gastroenteritis (or at least that was what they thought \nthe problem was). Sylvia's evidenceinchief was that that was what they were told by the doctor at the Beverley \nhospital.[252] However, there was no documentary evidence from the hospital, and no one from the hospital at the \ntime gave evidence. Whether or not Ellen was suffering malnutrition, it was not suggested that Mr Waghorne's \nreport was inaccurate in so far as it concerned his report of what he had been told. I find that Mr Waghorne's file \nnote accurately indicated what he was told by the matron of the Beverley hospital in relation to Ellen's admission to \nhospital.  \n233 Don and Sylvia's evidence was that Ellen quickly lost a lot of weight when she became ill.[253] Evidence of her \nweight loss is consistent with Mr Waghorne's note of the matron's report to him (namely that on admission, Ellen \nweighed less than she had when she was born). I accept that in so far as it refers to Ellen's weight loss, that part of \nMr Waghorne's file note of 13 March 1958 was accurate. I digress to note that given Ellen was only five months old \nthe amount of weight she had lost was significant.  \nWhere were Don and Sylvia living in March 1958?\n234 I turn to the evidence as to where Don and Sylvia were living at the time Ellen was taken into care. In his report, \nMr Waghorne referred to a 'humpy' where Don and Sylvia lived.[254] The humpy was a humpy located on Bessie \nNinyette's block. Don and Sylvia had moved to Bessie Ninyette's block around eight months after their \nmarriage.[255]  \n235 The humpy was located at a camp on Bessie Ninyette's block. There was some evidence to suggest that in the \nearly days of Don and Sylvia's marriage, other members of Sylvia's family including her sisters and their partners \nalso lived at the camp on Bessie Ninyette's block, in humpies and tents.[256] However, by the time the Siblings \nwere taken into care, Bessie Ninyette was the only other person who resided on the block.[257] Bessie lived in a \ntent on her block.[258] Don's brother and sister in law, Fred and Jean Collard, lived in a house on a block a short \ndistance away.[259]  \n236 There were inconsistencies in the evidence given by Don and Sylvia as to where they were living at the time \nthat Ellen was taken into care. At times, Don and Sylvia gave evidence that at the time Ellen was taken from their \ncare they were not living at the humpy. Don's evidence was that at the time when they took Ellen to hospital, and \nwhile Ellen was in hospital, they were living in tents on the McLean's farm.[260] (I note that at the time, Don and \nSylvia had six children Donald, Darryl, Bonnie, William, Beverley and Ellen although it was not clear from the \nevidence whether all of the children were staying with them at the McLean's farm.[261])  \n237 Sylvia's evidenceinchief was that at the time when Ellen was taken from their care,  we were living in a small \ncottage on the farm with a few beds and all of us living together as family in the aboriginal way. It was small, but it \nwas clean and we had fresh well water and food and bedding.[262]\n238 Having regard to Don and Sylvia's evidence, I find that at the time that Ellen became ill, Don was doing \nseasonal work at the McLean's farm and Don and Sylvia and at least some of their children, including Ellen, were \nstaying there while Don undertook that work.  \n239 However, it is also clear that Don was undertaking seasonal work at the McLean's farm, as he did every year, \nand that after doing that work he would move back to Brookton, or to another farm where he would undertake other \nseasonal work. In this respect, I bear in mind Don's evidence that he undertook seasonal work in and around \nBrookton and in regional areas generally not far from Brookton, throughout each year. That conclusion leaves open \nthe possibility that the humpy was Don and Sylvia's permanent home, to which they returned when Don was not \nundertaking seasonal work away from Brookton, and to which they returned on the weekends when Don was \nworking nearby to Brookton. Don and Sylvia's own evidence establishes that that was the case.  \n240 At a number of points in their evidence, Don and Sylvia accepted that they lived at the humpy at various times \nduring the year. Their evidence as to what proportion of the year was spent living at the humpy was inconsistent. As \nI have already observed earlier in these reasons, it was apparent that Don and Sylvia sought to minimise the \namount of time they spent at the humpy.  \n241 In her evidenceinchief, Sylvia said that they spent about six months of the year at the humpy on Bessie \nNinyette's block.[263] However, in her oral evidence, Sylvia said that they used to come in on the weekends to stay \n\n\n\nat the humpy,[264] and that '[e]very weekend when we knock off work and that we'd go',[265] by which I understood \nher to mean that they would stay at the humpy every weekend. Later in her evidence, Sylvia said that they would go \nto the humpy on the weekends to stay.[266]  \n242 In her evidenceinchief, Sylvia also indicated that when they went to collect Ellen from the Beverley hospital the \n'shearing was almost done at the McLean's farm so we brought the rest of the children with us and planned to drop \nthem off at my mother Bessie's block when we had collected Ellen so we could pack up at the McLean's farm and \njoin them back in Brookton later that day.'[267] That evidence indicated that Don and Sylvia intended to return to \nthe humpy when they finished the work at the McLean's farm.  \n243 It was put to Don in crossexamination that when Ellen was born they were living in Brookton. His answer was \nthat it 'wasn't necessary' for them to be living in Brookton, but he accepted that 'Brookton' (by which I understood he \nwas referring to the humpy at Brookton) 'was our home'.[268] However, he then went on to suggest that 'most of the \ntime we spent six or seven, eight, 10 months away and we'd come back'.[269]  \n244 In addition, in the joint statement Don and Sylvia gave to the ALS in 1995, they indicated that  when we had \nEllen, Don was shearing in Beverley when Ellen was born at Beverley Hospital. We were still living in Brookton but \nmoving around with the work, staying at the McLean's farm in Beverley, camping where Don was working.[270]\n245 On the other hand, both Don[271] and Sylvia[272] gave evidence that Ellen had never been taken to Bessie \nNinyette's block. As Ellen was just over five months old when she became ill, this would mean that Don and Sylvia \nhad not returned to the humpy in the five months following Ellen's birth. I am unable to accept this evidence, having \nregard to the other evidence given by Don and Sylvia, which established that they regularly returned to the humpy \nthroughout the year.  \n246 Having regard to all of the available evidence, I find that the humpy was Don and Sylvia's permanent home, at \nwhich they resided when they were not working away from Brookton, and to which they returned both in between \nperiods of seasonal work away from Brookton, and on the weekends while undertaking seasonal work nearby to \nBrookton. It is neither necessary nor possible to make a finding as to precisely how much time Don and Sylvia and \ntheir children spent at the humpy, but I accept that they spent a substantial period of time there each year. I find that \nDon and Sylvia intended that once they collected Ellen from the hospital, they would take her to stay at the humpy.  \nLiving conditions at the humpy in March 1958\n247 I turn, next, to consider the evidence in relation to the living conditions at the humpy. There was little evidence \nspecifically about the living conditions at the humpy at the time when Ellen was removed from Don and Sylvia's \ncare most of the evidence about the humpy focused on the period when the Siblings were taken into care. \nHowever, Sylvia did give evidence about the construction and contents of the humpy in 1958.  \n248 Sylvia's evidence in this respect generally accorded with the description given by Mr Waghorne in his file note \nof 13 March 1958. Sylvia accepted that the humpy was made of sheets of iron, with a hessian partition to separate \nthe sleeping area from the kitchen area. Sylvia said there were bits of linoleum on the dirt floor. She said there was \na double bed, and two or three single beds. The only other furniture was a table, and stools to sit on. There was \nalso a food cooler, and a little black stove, although mostly they cooked outside on a fire.[273]  \n249 Sylvia's description of the construction and contents of the humpy is broadly consistent with other evidence in \nrelation to the construction and content of the humpy in 1961 when the Siblings were removed into care. I deal with \nthat evidence at [344] to [351] below.  \n250 Having regard to Sylvia's evidence, and the evidence as to the construction and contents of the humpy in 1961, \nI find that the construction and contents of the humpy remained broadly the same between 1958 and 1961.  \n251 Having regard to Sylvia's evidence, and to the evidence as to the construction and contents of the humpy in \n1961, I find that the description of the humpy's construction and its contents, which was contained in Mr \nWaghorne's file note of 13 March 1958, was accurate.  \n252 The humpy did not have electricity, gas or running water. Instead, Don and Sylvia and their family collected \nwater from the Brookton Reserve. They also used showers and toilets at the Reserve,[274] although they made do \nwith camping toileting arrangements as well.[275]  \n253 The real dispute as to the description of the humpy in Mr Waghorne's file note of 13 March 1958 concerned its \nobservations on the cleanliness of the humpy. Don disputed the description that the bed linen was dirty and the \npremises generally not clean. He said that the humpy was always clean.[276] Sylvia denied that the bed linen was \ndirty she said she did the washing at the Reserve.[277] Sylvia's evidence was that the humpy was always clean. \nHer evidence was that she swept every day.[278]  \n\n\n\n254 Two observations can be made about the available evidence as to the cleanliness of the humpy. First, other \nthan for the reference to dirty bed linen it is not possible to discern what Mr Waghorne's note means in its reference \nto the premises generally being 'not clean'. The fact that the humpy had a dirt floor suggests that it was inevitable \nthat there would have been dust and dirt inside the humpy. Similarly, the fact that the bed linen was dirty might have \nbeen due to no more than the fact that there was a dirt floor, as clean linen would quickly have become dusty and \ndirty when feet bearing dust from the floor made contact with the bed linen.  \n255 Secondly, with six children and two adults residing in what was essentially one room, with a dirt floor (or largely \na dirt floor), it would have been even more difficult to keep the humpy free of dust and dirt. Cleaning the bed linen \nwould also have been difficult without running water, and washing facilities, at the humpy.  \n256 With these qualifications, I find that the description in Mr Waghorne's file note of 13 March 1958 as to the \npremises being 'not clean' was accurate.  \n(c) The circumstances surrounding the Siblings' placement into the care of the Child Welfare Department  \n257 In this section of my reasons I deal with the following matters:  \n(i) the events of 7 December 1961;  \n(ii) did Don and Sylvia arrange for the Siblings to be sent to Sister Kate's?  \n(iii) did Don and Sylvia take the Siblings to Sister Kate's themselves?  \n(iv) the application to the Children's Court for the Siblings to be made wards.  \n(i) The events of 7 December 1961\n258 December 1961 was a deeply sad and traumatic day for all of the members of the Collard family.  \n259 At one point in his evidence, Don suggested that he was at home at the humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block on 7 \nDecember 1961.[279] However, Don's evidence was inconsistent with Sylvia's evidence. She said that he was \naway working at the Yeo's farm that day.[280] Beverley recalled that Don was not present, but was away \nworking[281] and Darryl's evidence was that Don was not at home either.[282] I find that Don was not at home at \nthe humpy on 7 December 1961. Consequently, although Don gave evidence that he was at home and that the \nSiblings were taken to Sister Kate's by Ms Jones and a man I do not accept that evidence.  \n260 Sylvia, the Siblings, Bessie Ninyette, and possibly Don's mother,[283] were present at the camp on Bessie \nNinyette's block on the morning of 7 December 1961. Beverley's evidence was that the Siblings saw a car coming \nup the driveway to Bessie Ninyette's block.[284] It was an old black or grey Austin. Bonnie, Beverley, and Darryl \nrecalled that Ms Jones was inside the car.[285] Beverley recalled hearing her grandmothers shouting.[286]  \n261 Sylvia's evidence was that when the Siblings told her that Ms Jones' car was coming, she walked away up to \nFred and June Collard's block because (in her words) she 'didn't want to be there when Ms Jones was taking \nthem'.[287]  \n262 The only evidence as to what then occurred on 7 December 1961 came from the Siblings. Eva and Wesley did \nnot have any recollection of what occurred, which is not surprising given that Eva was 21 months old, and Wesley \neight months old, at the time. Glenys' recollections were more limited than those of the older Siblings. (Glenys was \nalmost three years old, Beverley was five years old, William was six years old, Bonnie was seven years old, Darryl \nwas nine years old and Donald was 10 years old at the time they were taken.) Despite their young ages at the time, \nthe Siblings who gave evidence had some vivid memories of what had occurred. As I have already found, it is quite \npossible that such a significant and traumatic event for the Siblings may have left them with vivid memories that \nhave survived even after such a long period of time. Although there were some inconsistencies in the evidence \ngiven by the Siblings, there was considerable consistency as well.  \n263 The evidenceinchief given by Bonnie and Beverley supports the finding that Ms Jones came to the humpy \nduring the day, in the late morning.[288] (Darryl's evidence was that the Siblings were collected after \ndinner,[289]but in this respect I find that his recollection was not accurate.)  \n264 There were inconsistencies in the Siblings' evidence as to whether Ms Jones was alone. Bonnie's evidence \nwas that a man was with Ms Jones, and accompanied them to Sister Kate's.[290] Beverley recollected that Ms \nJones was alone[291] and that it was only Ms Jones who accompanied them to Sister Kate's.[292] However, \nBeverley thought Constable Wall arrived at some point and told the Siblings to get in the car.[293] Darryl's \nrecollection was that Ms Jones and two or three other people from the Department of Native Welfare came to \ncollect the Siblings, and that they took the Siblings in the car also.[294] In crossexamination, he suggested that it \nwas Ms Jones, Constable Wall, and two other people (although he did not know who they were) and that one of \n\n\n\nthose other persons accompanied Ms Jones in the car to take them to Sister Kate's.[295] None of the other Siblings \nrecollected the presence of two other people, or of officers from the Department of Native Welfare.  \n\n265 The State tendered a witness statement from Mr Humphries, who was the Welfare Inspector in the Narrogin \nofficer of the Department of Native Welfare at the time. His evidence was that he had no memory of taking any \nchildren from Brookton to Sister Kate's at any time during his employment at Narrogin, and had no memory of ever \nvisiting Sister Kate's in his whole life, so he was certain that he had not escorted the Children to Sister Kate's.[296] \nHaving regard to all of this evidence, I find that Darryl's recollection as to the presence of two or more officers from \nthe Department of Native Welfare is mistaken.  \n266 I find that on 7 December 1961, Ms Jones came to Bessie Ninyette's block, collected the Siblings and drove \nthem to Sister Kate's. As for whether there was another person present, given the conflicting evidence I am not \nsatisfied that it is more likely than not that another person accompanied Ms Jones to collect the Siblings and take \nthem to Sister Kate's.  \n267 Either just before Ms Jones arrived, or after she arrived, all of the Siblings were given a bath or a wash by \nBessie Ninyette.[297] Beverley recollected that Ms Jones provided the Siblings with clothes to wear all the girls \nwere given red tartan allinone pinafores, white tops and brown sandals, while the boys were given shorts, a tshirt \nand a short sleeved shirt with a collar in a greyblue colour.[298]  \n268 All of the Siblings then got into the car. They sat in the front and back seats.[299] Bonnie and Beverley \nrecollected that the Siblings thought they were going for a ride in the car they didn't realise that they were being \ntaken away.[300] Darryl recollected that they had been told that they were being taken for a picnic.[301] However, \nduring the journey the awful realisation must have dawned on the older Siblings that they were not merely going on \na drive or on a picnic, but were being taken away from their parents. Darryl recalled that all of the Siblings cried \nduring the car trip.[302] Glenys also recalled the Siblings crying.[303]  \n269 When they arrived at Sister Kate's, Ms Jones introduced the Siblings to the superintendent of Sister Kate's, Mr \nDaniel.[304] Bonnie recalled that the Siblings had to sit and wait while a number of forms were filled in, and then Ms \nJones left.[305]  \n(ii) Did Don and Sylvia arrange for the Siblings to be sent to Sister Kate's?\n\n270 When the Siblings were taken to Sister Kate's no order had been made by any court to make them wards. That \nfact gives rise to three questions. First, did Don and Sylvia have any prior notice of an application to the Court for \nthe Siblings to be placed in the care of the Child Welfare Department? Secondly, did Don and Sylvia make the \ndecision to send the Siblings to Sister Kate's and did Ms Jones take the Siblings to Sister Kate's with the authority \nof Don and Sylvia? Thirdly, why were the Siblings taken to Sister Kate's?  \nPrior notice of an application to the Court\n\n271 The evidence given by Don and Sylvia established that they had notice that an application was to be made to \nthe Children's Court that the Siblings be placed in the care of the Child Welfare Department. In crossexamination, \nDon stated that the first occasion when he became aware that the Siblings were going to be placed in care was \nabout three or four days before the application was made to the Court on 8 December 1961.[306] Initially Don said \nthat he saw Constable Wall three or four days before the Siblings were committed to the care of the Child Welfare \nDepartment.[307] He later said that he was 'pretty sure' that the application for the committal of the Siblings was the \nfollowing day, although he accepted some doubt about that,[308] and he later agreed that there were a few days \nbetween when he spoke to Constable Wall and when Ms Jones took the Siblings away.[309]  \n272 Don's evidence was that Constable Wall told him that the Siblings were to be taken because of neglect.[310] \nHe said Constable Wall told him not to take the kids anywhere because 'they're being put in the welfare's \ncare'.[311]Don also said that Constable Wall told him that the matter would go to Court, and Don confirmed that \nSylvia and Ms Jones subsequently went to Court when the application was made.[312]  \n273 It is likely that on this occasion, Constable Wall served Don with a summons to attend the Children's Court for \nthe hearing of the application. In approximately 2002, Don recounted what had occurred for the purposes of the \npublication entitled 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's Home Revisited'.[313] In that publication, Don is quoted as \nhaving said that  [w]hen I got the summons to go to court over the kids, I was trying to work out what to do. Well I \ncouldn't run away with the kids, there wasn't anywhere I could take them. I really didn't know what to do.[314]\n\n\n\n274 Don's evidence was that after Constable Wall told them the Siblings were to be removed he and Sylvia 'were \ntoo stunned really. There was nothing we could do because we were warned and told not to take them.'[315]  \n275 Sylvia's evidenceinchief was that:  One morning in December 1961 Ms Jones came to the humpy at our camp \non my mother Bessie's block. She drove up to the block. At the time, the children were all living with us at the camp \nand were attending school in Brookton.\n\n Ms Jones told me that the DNW were coming to get the children. I said words to the effect, 'What for?' She said \nwords to the effect, 'They're going to take the kids to Sister Kate's for a while, just for a while, and you can get a \nhome then get them back.' By 'a home' I understood that she meant a house.\n\n I was in shock and I don't remember what I said to her in response or if I said anything at all.[316]\n276 However, in crossexamination, Sylvia said that she couldn't remember when she had heard that the Siblings \nwere to be removed into care, but thought she and Don heard it from Ms Jones and Constable Wall. She thought \nConstable Wall told Don that they were going to come and Ms Jones was going to take the kids.[317]  \n\n277 Although Sylvia's evidenceinchief suggested that her conversation with Ms Jones was the first indication she \n(and, by implication, Don) had had that the Siblings were to be the subject of an application for the Siblings to be \nplaced in the care of the Child Welfare Department, in that respect I find that that evidence was mistaken given her \nevidence in crossexamination.  \n\n278 I find that early in December 1961 Don was served with a summons by Constable Wall, and subsequently Ms \nJones spoke to Sylvia in relation to the application by officers from the Department of Native Welfare to the \nChildren's Court for the Siblings to be placed in the care of the Child Welfare Department.  \nDid Don and Sylvia decide to send the Siblings to Sister Kate's?  \n\n279 Don recalled that when Ms Jones came to visit them she told them that the best thing to do with the Siblings \nwould be to have them put into Sister Kate's.[318] Don's evidence was that he and Sylvia agreed to do so, so that \nthe Siblings could all be together.[319] However, Don's evidence was that they first asked Ms Jones to call the \nWandering Mission, so that he and Sylvia could also go with the Siblings and live with them on the Mission. His \nrecollection was that Ms Jones went away and called the Wandering Mission, but subsequently told them (possibly \nthe next day) that the Mission was not able to take the Siblings.[320]  \n\n280 Later in crossexamination, Don said that he thought this discussion with Ms Jones about the Wandering \nMission may have taken place a few days before the Siblings were taken. His evidence as to that conversation was \nthat 'that's long before ever these other things. Long before this'.[321] However, he then suggested that the \nconversation took place 'a few days before'[322] the Siblings were removed. Don said that Ms Jones 'was actually \nmaking inquiries, you see, where we could dump them and over a period of maybe two or three days'.[323]  \n281 Don's evidence was that they then 'decided to take them down and put them in [Sister Kate's]'.[324] Don's \nevidence was that Ms Jones picked the Siblings up the following day,[325] but he accepted that it was possible that \nit may have been the day after that.[326]  \n282 Sylvia's evidenceinchief was that:  Ms Jones said that it would be best if the children were taken to Sister \nKate's Children's Home in Queens Park, Perth. She asked me if I would let the kids go with her for just for a while, \nshe would take them to Sister Kate's for me. She also told me that if it went to court the children would be split up \nbut if I let her take them there, they would all be together and then we (meaning Don and I) could pick them all up \nfrom there so it would be better.\n\n She never told me anything about having to go to Court and I don't recall if she told me what would happen if \nWelfare took the children instead of her.\n\n Don was away shearing at the time and I didn't know how to get in touch with him to let him know what was \nhappening. I asked Ms Jones if she could do something to try and get the message to Don about the children and \nwhat was happening. I think she said she was going to try and find Don and tell him. She then left my mother's \nblock. I think Don was working at the Overhau's farm at the time.[327]\n\n\n\n283 Sylvia also accepted that she had had a discussion with Ms Jones about trying to get the Siblings into the \nWandering Mission. Initially, Sylvia said that she thought this discussion was before the Siblings were taken, she \nthen said it was afterwards, when the Siblings were in Sister Kate's,[328] and she later said she couldn't remember \nwhen she had that discussion.[329]  \n\n284 At various other points in their evidence, however, Don and Sylvia both sought to disavow any prior knowledge \nthat the Siblings were likely to be removed from their care or that they had any role in arranging for the Siblings to \nbe sent to Sister Kate's. The tenor of this evidence was that the Siblings were simply taken apparently without any \nauthority by Ms Jones. By way of example, at one point in crossexamination, Sylvia said that prior to the day Ms \nJones came, she had never seen her at Bessie Ninyette's block, she had never seen any native welfare officers at \nthe block, and she did not know Mr WrightWebster or Mr Humphries[330] (who were the native welfare officers who \nmade the application to the Children's Court). Sylvia also said that prior to Ms Jones driving up 'we did hear that she \nwas going to take the kids to Sister Kate's as it was and I didn't want that to happen'.[331] Sylvia also said that she \nhad not agreed to Ms Jones taking the children to Sister Kate's:  No I never gave permission no. We had no say... \nThere was no say.[332]\n285 Sylvia denied that she had changed her mind about the Wandering Mission and asked could the children go to \nSister Kate's instead[333] and she denied that she had ever expressed a wish that the children go to Sister \nKate's.[334]  \n286 I do not accept Don and Sylvia's denials of any role in arranging for the Siblings to be sent to Sister Kate's, for \nfive reasons. First, it is inconsistent with Don and Sylvia's other evidence to which I have referred.  \n287 Secondly, it is highly improbable that Ms Jones simply attended at the humpy without any notice or warning, \nand without any authority proceeded to take the Siblings away.  \n288 Thirdly, Sylvia's conduct on 7 December 1961 is consistent with her having prior knowledge that Ms Jones was \ncoming to take the Siblings to Sister Kate's. Sylvia accepted that when she was told by the Siblings that Ms Jones \nwas coming up the drive to Bessie Ninyette's block, she (Sylvia) had already heard that Ms Jones may be going to \ntake the children.[335] That prior knowledge also explains why Sylvia ran away when Ms Jones' car approached. \nSylvia's evidence was that she didn't speak to Ms Jones when she came to collect the Siblings, because she \n(Sylvia) was 'too angry'.[336] Instead, she went to the home of her sister in law, Jean Collard, and remained there, \nand returned to the humpty later in the afternoon, after the Siblings had left.[337]  \n289 Fourthly, the evidence of Bonnie, Beverley and Darryl was that they thought Ms Jones was going to take them \nfor a ride in the car, or for a picnic. That is consistent with the evidence given by Don that he and Sylvia had told the \nchildren that they were 'going for a holiday, a ride and they (the Siblings) thought everything was right'.[338]  \n\n290 Fifthly, there was documentary evidence in relation to the admission of the Siblings into Sister Kate's which \nsupports the conclusion that the Siblings were admitted to Sister Kate's by Ms Jones, but with the knowledge and \nauthority of Don and Sylvia. In evidence were documents entitled 'Returns Required to be Filled in by Licensee of \nPlace for Reception of Children under Six Years of Age' (the Returns) which appear to have been completed by Mr \nDaniel, the Superintendent of Sister Kate's, in relation to the receipt of Beverley, Glenys, Eva and Wesley (each of \nwhom were under six years of age when admitted to Sister Kate's).[339] The Returns indicated that the reason for \nplacing the child in Sister Kate's was 'parents unable to care for children'.  \n\n291 Each of the Returns was dated 12 December 1961. As I have said, the Siblings were admitted to Sister Kate's \non 7 December 1961. However, as I explain below, the evidence of Don and Sylvia (which, for the reasons set out \nbelow, I accept) was that the first time they went to visit the Siblings at Sister Kate's was a week after the Siblings \nwere taken there by Ms Jones. That time frame corresponds with the completion of the Returns.  \n292 Three pieces of information in the Returns support the conclusion that Don and Sylvia authorised the Siblings' \nadmission to Sister Kate's, and subsequently completed the documentation for the Siblings' admission.  \n293 First, each of the Returns required the 'Name of Person from whom the Child was received' and in each case \nthe name entered was Donald Collard of Brookton. That suggests that even if Ms Jones took the Siblings to Sister \nKate's, that she did so on behalf of Don and Sylvia.  \n294 Secondly, each of the Returns required answers for 'Amount agreed to be paid per week for the Child's \nmaintenance' and 'By whom' to which the answers given were '7/6' and 'Donald Collard'. It is difficult to see how any \n\n\n\nagreement could have been reached with Don for the payment of maintenance if he was not present, or had not \nprovided instructions to someone acting on his behalf that he consented to pay maintenance to Sister Kate's.  \n295 Finally, the date of birth for each child was set out in the Return for that child. The dates of birth entered for two \nof the Siblings did not correspond to the official records of their dates of birth, but in one case did correspond with \nevidence given by Sylvia. The Return for Glenys' admission indicated that her date of birth was 18 December 1958 \n(which was consistent with Sylvia's evidence about her date of birth[340]) whereas Glenys' birth certificate indicated \nthat her date of birth was 15 December 1958. On the other hand, the Return in relation to Eva indicated that her \ndate of birth was 26 April 1960, yet her birth certificate indicates that Eva's date of birth was 1 March 1960. (Sylvia's \nevidence was that Eva's date of birth was either 31 March or 1 April 1960.[341]) The discrepancies suggest that the \nSiblings' dates of birth as noted in the Returns were not obtained from official records, but were provided by a \nparent or family member. (In her evidence, Sylvia thought that perhaps Don had given Mr Daniel the Siblings' dates \nof birth.[342]) At least in the case of Glenys' Return, the information in that document as to her date of birth \nsupports the inference that either Sylvia or Don, or both of them, were present at the time of the completion of the \nReturns, or that they provided Mr Daniel with information necessary for the completion of the forms.  \n296 For completeness, I note that documents entitled 'Application to Admit Native Ward to a Mission' in relation to \nthe admission to Sister Kate's of Beverley, Eva, William, Glenys, Donald, 'Daryl' and 'Bonny' (the Applications to \nAdmit) were in evidence.[343] Each of the Applications to Admit was dated 22 December 1961. Each of them \nappears to have been completed by Mr Daniel, the Superintendent of Sister Kate's. The Applications to Admit \nindicate that the 'Reason for Admission' was 'maintenance and education'. The date on which the Applications to \nAdmit were completed, and the terminology used in them (specifically, references to Native Wards) suggests that \nfresh admission documents were completed after the Siblings were made wards, at which point the authority for \ntheir placement at Sister Kate's derived from the orders made by the Children's Court at Brookton.  \n297 The conclusion that Don and Sylvia authorised Ms Jones to take the Siblings to Sister Kate's is also consistent \nwith two other pieces of evidence. First, in a Report prepared in support of the application to the Children's Court, \nMr Humphries of the Department of Native Welfare noted:  Children taken by mother, with assistance from Ms \nJones of Brookton, to Sister Kate's Home 7/12/61. Children not in attendance and hearing held in their \nabsence.[344]\n298 Secondly, in a memorandum dated 12 December 1961 to the Director, Mr WrightWebster advised that the \nChildren's Court had ordered that the Siblings be made wards, and observed:  On November 30th, the Mother \nrequested Mr Humphries and Mrs O'Dea to arrange that the children be sent to Wandering Mission and \nconsiderable effort was made to arrange this. The Mother however, changed her mind and assisted by Ms Jones of \nBrookton, took the children and lodged them in Sister Kate's home the day prior to the hearing despite being told by \nthe District Welfare Officer that the children must appear at the Court.[345]\n\n299 Having regard to all of the evidence, I find that after Don and Sylvia were told that an application was to be \nmade to the Children's Court in respect of the Siblings, and after discussing with Ms Jones what might happen if \nthat application were successful, Don and Sylvia decided to place the Siblings into Sister Kate's themselves. I find \nthat Don and Sylvia first asked Ms Jones to make enquiries of the Wandering Mission to see if Don and Sylvia and \nthe Siblings could live there, and when those enquiries were not successful, Don and Sylvia decided to place the \nSiblings at Sister Kate's. On behalf of Don and Sylvia, and with their authority, Ms Jones took the Siblings to Sister \nKate's on 7 December 1961.  \nWhy were the Siblings taken to Sister Kate's?\n\n300 As to why Don and Sylvia decided to place the Siblings into Sister Kate's, I find that Don and Sylvia did so in \nthe expectation that that would enable the Siblings to remain together, and that Don and Sylvia would be able to \nremove the Siblings from care at a later date when their financial position and accommodation improved. The \nevidence which supports that finding is as follows.  \n301 In her evidenceinchief, Sylvia said:  I thought there was an agreement between Ms Jones and I and Sister \nKate's, made the day the children went to Sister Kate's that all the children would stay together and that they could \ncome home as soon as Don and I got a house and permanent jobs.\n\n\n\n This was the only reason we signed them into Sister Kate's, because Ms Jones had told us that if the Court was \nleft to decide where the children went to, there was no guarantee they would all be kept together. After all, this was \nthe only thing we thought we had some control over at least the children would be kept together and we could visit \nthem because we would know where they were.[346]\n302 Initially in crossexamination, Sylvia said that she could not recall giving this evidence in the affidavit which \nconstituted her evidenceinchief.[347] She then accepted that perhaps the agreement had been reached after the \nchildren were taken, although she accepted that it couldn't have been long after they were taken.[348]  \n303 Don gave evidence that he thought that there was an 'agreement' between he and Sylvia, and Sister Kate's, \nthat the Siblings would stay together at Sister Kate's until he got a house and a permanent job, at which point they \nwould be able to come home. He said he understood that that was the agreement because he and Sylvia 'went \ndown and signed with the welfare'.[349] Don said he and Sylvia went to Sister Kate's and spoke with 'Danny Daniel. \nI think he was an orderly of Sister Kate's at the time'.[350] Don's evidence was that he was 'pretty sure' that this \nagreement was reached after the Siblings were made wards of the State because 'we had to go down and sign \nthem out so that they had the control of them'.[351] When asked what he meant by 'sign them out' Don said that he \nmeant 'out of our care and into the control of Sister Kate's'.[352] Don said that he and Sylvia signed a document to \npass the Siblings into the care of Sister Kate's.[353] When crossexamined further about when this document was \nsigned, Don initially maintained that it was not signed before the Siblings were made wards, although he later \naccepted that 'once the welfare got them [that is, the Siblings] it was their concern'.[354]  \n\n304 The tenor of this evidence was consistent with the version of events recounted by Don in approximately 2002, \nfor the purposes of the publication entitled 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's Home Revisited'.[355] In that \npublication, Don's recollection was that after he was served with the summons to attend Court for the application for \nthe Siblings to be removed into care:  this church lady came to us and said, 'Oh, we'll take them and put them in \nSister Kate's Home then you can get them out whenever you want to!' ... The Police told me I could go to jail for not \nputting them in there. They were going to have me up for contempt. Plus they were going to put my kids all over the \nplace, separate the brothers and sisters out from each other and split them up. They said if I didn't bring them in \nthey were going to take them and distribute them anywhere. So we thought, we will put them in there and let things \nquieten down with the authorities. We'll get a house and then take the kids back again and there'd be no argument. \nWe thought it was a way of beating the authorities. I didn't sign any papers before the kids went into Sister Kate's. \nThe only papers I may have signed was when I went to the Home, papers to say that they had been received. But \nwhen you look back those bits of paper could have been anything.[356]\n\n305 The evidence in the documents gives rise to one further factual question, about which it is appropriate to make \na finding for the sake of completeness, namely whether Sylvia accompanied, or followed, Ms Jones to Sister Kate's \non 7 December 1961 when the Siblings were placed there.  \n\nDid Sylvia attend at Sister Kate's when the Siblings were placed there on 7 December 1961?\n\n306 Mr Humphries' report, and Mr WrightWebster's memorandum, suggest that Sylvia attended with Ms Jones \nwhen the Siblings were taken to Sister Kate's. In addition, evidence was given by Mrs Patullo who worked at Sister \nKate's at the time of the Siblings' admission. Mrs Patullo gave evidence that when the Siblings arrived at Sister \nKate's she spoke to Sylvia. Mrs Patullo's evidence was that she had asked Mrs Daniel (the wife of Mr Daniel, the \nSuperintendent of Sister Kate's) if she could speak to Sylvia, so that Sylvia could see the nursery cottage where \nEva and Wesley would be living. Mrs Patullo's evidence was that this conversation took place on the day that the \nSiblings arrived at Sister Kate's.[357] Mrs Patullo had a good recollection of a conversation, and of Eva and Wesley \nin particular, and I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that she did speak to Sylvia.  \n307 However, I find that Sylvia did not accompany Ms Jones to Sister Kate's, but rather that she and Don first went \nto Sister Kate's almost a week after the Siblings were taken there by Ms Jones that finding is supported by the \nfollowing evidence.  \n\n308 First, Don and Sylvia both denied that they accompanied the Siblings to Sister Kate's. Don said that he and \nSylvia didn't accompany Ms Jones or follow in another car.[358] He said that the suggestion in Mr WrightWebster's \nreport that Sylvia and Ms Jones took the Siblings to Sister Kate's was wrong.[359] Don's evidence was that the first \n\n\n\ntime that he went to Sister Kate's after was a week or two weeks after Ms Jones took the Siblings to Sister \nKate's.[360] Don suggested that Mrs Patullo's contrary recollection was mistaken.[361] Sylvia's evidence was that \nafter the Siblings were taken by Ms Jones, the next time she saw them was a week or so later.[362] Sylvia said that \nshe signed the children into Sister Kate's after Ms Jones took them. She said she and Don had to sign something \nwhen they went to visit the children at Sister Kate's, but that she didn't know what it was.[363]  \n309 Secondly, in crossexamination, Don confirmed that he had told the authors of 'Echoes of the Past' that 'I didn't \nsign any papers before the kids went into Sister Kate's. The only papers I may have signed was when I went to the \nhome papers to say that they had been received'[364] and he said that he signed those papers two weeks after the \nSiblings were taken to Sister Kate's.[365]  \n\n310 Thirdly, none of the Siblings who recollected the trip to Sister Kate's recalled either of their parents being \npresent when they arrived.[366] Given that Darryl, Bonnie and Beverley recollected the day's events, it would be \nsurprising if they had no recollection of Sylvia attending at Sister Kate's.  \n\n311 Fourthly, in so far as Mrs Patullo's evidence is concerned, Mrs Patullo had no independent recollection of the \ndate on which she spoke to Sylvia. She thought it was the day on which the Siblings arrived at Sister Kate's but \naccepted that she did not actually see the Siblings arrive at Sister Kate's. In my view, Mrs Patullo's conclusion that \nthe conversation with Sylvia took place on the day that the Siblings arrived at Sister Kate's was mistaken.  \n312 Finally, I note that some of the Applications for Admission contain a notation (in answer to a question \nconcerning why the Siblings' admission to Sister Kate's occurred without the consent of the Commissioner) to the \neffect that 'Admission requested by Miss Mary Jones of Brookton (see covering letter)'.[367] (Unfortunately that \ncovering letter was not in evidence.) In addition, a subsequent letter from Mr Daniel to the Commissioner, dated 22 \nDecember 1961 also noted that the Children 'were admitted to the Home on the request of Miss Mary Jones of \nBrookton'.[368] Those two pieces of information provide some additional support for the conclusion that Sylvia did \nnot actually accompany Ms Jones to admit the Children to Sister Kate's on 7 December 1961.  \n(iii) The application to the Children's Court for the Siblings to be made wards\n\n313 On 8 December 1961, a Special Magistrate sitting in the Children's Court at Brookton determined that the \nSiblings were deemed to be neglected children and made an order that the Siblings be committed to the care of the \nChild Welfare Department until they were 18 years of age.[369] The Magistrate also made  a strong \nrecommendation that the children be retained at Sister Kate's Home until such time as parents can afford them \nproper and appropriate accommodation and that [the] children all be kept together in any event at the one \nplace.[370]\n314 Mr WrightWebster sent a memorandum dated 12 December 1961 to the Director in relation to the outcome of \nthe application to the Court.[371] Mr WrightWebster advised:  The application to have the children declared \nneglected was made by myself and Mr Humphries and Constable Wall gave evidence of squalid conditions and of \ndrunkenness by the parents.\n\n On November 30th, the Mother requested Mr Humphries and Mrs O'Dea to arrange that the children be sent to \nWandering Mission and considerable effort was made to arrange this. The Mother however changed her mind and \nassisted by Ms Jones of Brookton, took the children and lodged them in Sister Kate's home the day prior to the \nhearing despite being told by the District Welfare Officer that the children must appear at the Court.\n\n Both the Mother and Ms Jones were present in the Court and were severely reprimanded by the Magistrate who \nheard the application in the children's absence. To comply with the Mother's wishes and the District Welfare \nOfficer's report, the Court recommended that the children be retained at Sister Kate's Home until such time as the \nparents can afford them proper and appropriate accommodation and that the children all be kept together in any \nevent at the one place. The father was not present in Court hence a maintenance order could not be obtained.\n315 As I have already mentioned, an 'Informative Report on Child' was prepared by Mr Humphries in support of the \napplication made to the Children's Court (the 1961 Informative Report).[372] (A copy of the 1961 Informative Report \nwas forwarded by Mr WrightWebster to the Director, under cover of his memorandum dated 12 December \n1961.[373])  \n\n\n\n316 In the 1961 Informative Report,[374] Mr Humphries described the Collards' home in the following way:  Type of \nHouse: Iron and Bag Humpy.\n\n State of Repair: Bad.\n\n Number of Bedrooms: Not defined.\n\n Other rooms: Humpy divided into two rooms.\n\n Sleeping arrangements for Child: 3 beds for 10 people.\n\n Other Sleeping Arrangements, adequate or not? Inadequate.\n\n Is Bedding Adequate? No.\n\n Other Furniture, adequacy and suitability: Very Little.\n\n Remarks re Cleanliness: Bad. Squalid Conditions.\n\n Are Home Conditions adequate for Child's needs? No.\n\n If not, indicate deficiencies and prospects of rehabilitating home. Not possible in present conditions.\n\n317 Mr Humphries also set out the 'Departmental Opinion' which was:  Parents both drink heavily and no provision \nmade for children. No food, water or sanitary convenience at the home when inspected.\n\n318 The 1961 Informative Report indicates that the 'Departmental Recommendation' was:  Strong recommendation \nthat children be retained at Sister Kate's Home until such time as parents can afford them their proper and \nappropriate accommodation and that children all be kept together in any event at the one place.\n319 The recommendation made by the Children's Court when it made its Order on 8 December 1961 was in almost \nidentical terms, which suggests that the Court accepted the recommendation in the terms in which it was put by \nofficers of the Department of Native Welfare at the hearing.  \n\n320 The State tendered a witness statement as the evidenceinchief of Mr Humphries,[375] and he was not required \nfor crossexamination. In his witness statement, Mr Humphries stated that he recalled working as a Welfare Officer \nat the Narrogin officer of the Department of Native Welfare in 1961 or 1962.[376] However he did not recall any \ncontact with any of the plaintiffs during his time at the Narrogin Office of the Department of Native Welfare,[377]nor \ndid he remember Ms Jones[378] or Constable Wall,[379] nor did he recall dealing with any police officers from \nBrookton as he seldom went to Brookton in the course of his duties. Mr Humphries acknowledged that the signature \non the 1961 Informative Report was his signature and that the handwriting in that Report was his handwriting.[380] \nAlthough he did not recall writing the Informative Report, Mr Humphries had no reason to doubt the accuracy of that \ndocument.[381]  \n\n321 Mr Humphries also had no recollection of the matters referred to in Mr WrightWebster's memorandum of 12 \nDecember 1961 to the Director.[382] Although Mr Humphries acknowledged that the reference in that memorandum \nto 'Mr Humphries' was very likely to be a reference to him, Mr Humphries stated that he had no recollection of any \nrequest by Sylvia Collard to arrange for her children to be sent to Wandering Mission, or of making 'substantial \nefforts' to do so and he had no memory of appearing in Court and giving evidence on the occasion referred to in the \nmemorandum (although he often did appear in court on behalf of the Department in child committal cases).[383] Mr \nHumphries recalled that Mr WrightWebster 'was very particular about following rules. He did everything precisely in \n\n\n\naccordance with procedure.'[384] Consequently, Mr Humphries' evidence was that he thought the memorandum \nvery likely to be correct given what he knew of Mr WrightWebster's work practices.[385]  \n322 The content of the 1961 Informative Report, when read with the Order made by the Court, and with Mr \nHumphries' evidence, supports the inference that Mr Humphries' evidence to the Court reflected what was set out in \nthe 1961 Informative Report.  \n323 In her evidenceinchief, Sylvia stated that she was 'fairly certain' that she did not attend the Children's Court on \n8 December 1961.[386] In crossexamination, Sylvia denied that she was present in the Children's Court when the \ncommittals orders were made.[387] In this respect, I find that Sylvia's recollection is erroneous. Sylvia \nacknowledged in her evidenceinchief that her recollection of these events was not entirely clear.[388] Having regard \nto the content of Mr WrightWebster's memorandum of 12 December 1961, I find that Sylvia was present in the \nChildren's Court on 8 December 1961 when the Siblings were made wards.  \n324 It was Don's evidence that to his knowledge he was not given any papers in relation to the Court date for this \napplication.[389] The fact that Sylvia attended the hearing suggests that a summons had been given to Don and \nSylvia in respect of that application. As I have already found, it is likely that that summons was served on Don by \nConstable Wall, when he saw Don in early December 1961 to advise him that the application was to be made. \nFurthermore, as I have also noted above, in 2002, Don recounted what had occurred for the purposes of a \npublication entitled 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's Home Revisited'[390] and in that publication, Don referred to \nhaving received a 'summons to go to court over the kids'.  \n325 However, I find that Don was not present in the Children's Court on 8 November 1961. This much can be \ninferred from Mr WrightWebster's letter, and is also expressly noted in a further memorandum from Mr \nWrightWebster to the Commissioner dated 9 January 1962.[391] It was also confirmed by Don in his evidence. He \nsaid that Ms Jones had told him what had occurred at the hearing.[392]  \n(d) Where were Don and Sylvia and the Siblings living in 1961?  \n326 In this section of my reasons I deal with:  \n\n(i) The evidence as to whether officers of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department had \nvisited the Collards at Bessie Ninyette's block prior to the application to the Court in relation to the Siblings;  \n(ii) The evidence as to the circumstances of the Collard family's living arrangements and living conditions in 1961.  \n\n(i) The evidence as to whether officers of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department had \nvisited the Collards at Bessie Ninyette's block prior to the application to the Court in relation to the Siblings\n327 As I have noted above, Mr WrightWebster's memorandum dated 12 December 1961 states that he made the \napplication to the Children's Court for the Siblings to be made wards, and 'Mr Humphries and Constable Wall gave \nevidence of squalid conditions and of drunkenness by the parents'.[393]  \n\n328 In the course of the hearing, Don and Sylvia denied that they had had any contact with welfare authorities in \nthe period immediately before the application was made to the Children's Court in respect of the Siblings. Don's \nevidence was that prior to the point three or four days before 7 December 1961 when Constable Wall came to see \nhim, he had had no reason to think that the welfare authorities were concerned about the Siblings.[394] Don denied \nthat there had been any visits from the welfare authorities before Constable Wall's visit.[395] Later in \ncrossexamination, it was put to Don that native welfare officers had come to Bessie Ninyette's block on a number of \noccasions before the Siblings were taken (and before Ellen was taken). Don denied that that was the case [396]  \n329 Sylvia was asked whether she'd ever seen officers of the Department of Native Welfare coming to her mother's \nblock. Her evidence was 'if I saw them come I'd be gone, I'd run away'.[397] Sylvia said that in the period after Ellen \nwas taken, and before the Siblings were taken, she had never seen a native welfare officer come to Bessie's \nblock.[398]  \n\n330 I do not accept Sylvia and Don's evidence, in so far as they denied that native welfare officers had visited the \nhumpy prior to the application to the Children's Court in relation to the Siblings, for three reasons. First, their denials \nwere inconsistent with other evidence Don and Sylvia gave during the hearing. For example, when Don was \ncrossexamined about the contents of Mr WrightWebster's report, he admitted that he had seen Mr Humphries, \npossibly two or three times, prior to 8 December 1961, and possibly at Bessie Ninyette's block.[399] In addition, in \n\n\n\ncrossexamination, Sylvia accepted that native welfare officers could have come to Bessie Ninyette's block, but said \nthat she could not recall that they had done so.[400]  \n\n331 Secondly, Don and Sylvia's evidence that they had never been visited at the humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block \nby officers of the Department of Native Welfare was inconsistent with the joint statement they provided to the ALS in \n1995 (to which I referred at [226]), and with the version of events Don recounted in 2002 for the purposes of the \npublication entitled 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's Home Revisited'.[401] In that publication, Don's recollection \nwas as follows:  The thing is we never neglected our kids, no fear, we always looked after them the best we could. \nWith the eight kids we lost, they were going to take us to court over them. I had a summons to appear in court for \nnegligence. We didn't know what that meant. I mean our kids weren't neglected or anything like that.\n\n ... We were happy, but the Welfare used to come around and check up a lot. They would hound you and really \npressurise you.[402]\n332 When crossexamined about his reference to checks 'by the welfare', Don tried to suggest that in speaking of \nthe 'welfare' he may have meant Ms Jones. However, I do not accept that explanation, given that in the Echoes of \nthe Past document Don clearly distinguished between Ms Jones and welfare authorities.  \n\n333 Thirdly, the evidence of Mr Humphries support the conclusion that it is more likely than not that he visited the \nhumpy prior to preparing the 1961 Informative Report and giving evidence at the Children's Court. Mr Humphries' \nevidence was that he had no memory of visiting the humpy but:  it was not my practice to simply rely upon the \nreports of others when giving evidence in court. The normal practice was that Mr Wright-Webster would receive a \nreport from a Police officer or another person about a possible neglect case, and then I or another officer of the \nDepartment would then be instructed to visit the house to investigate.\n\n ... [I]t was our usual practice to visit the home of a suspected neglect case at least once before giving evidence in \ncourt.\n\n When we visited a house to investigate a possible neglect case we checked such things as the condition of the \nchild, whether there was food in the house, and whether the parents were drunk. If the parents were present we \nwould talk to them.\n\n ... If the parents were absent at the time of our visit to the house, or if the home conditions appeared to be better \nthan as reported to us, we would usually visit a second or third time in order to properly assess the situation.[403]\n\n334 Having regard to all of this evidence, and in particular to Don's acceptance that officers of the Department of \nNative Welfare visited them 'two or three times' prior to the Siblings being taken into care, I find that Mr Humphries \nvisited the humpy two or three times prior to preparing the 1961 Informative Report, and that the observations \ncontained in that Report reflected what he saw during his visits to the humpy, and formed the basis for the \nevidence he gave to the Children's Court.  \n(ii) Evidence as to the circumstances of the Collard family's living arrangements and living conditions in 1961\n\n335 In the 1961 Informative Report, Mr Humphries expressed a number of value judgments, for example in relation \nto the adequacy of Don and Sylvia's parenting. I have not placed any weight on those value judgments, because \ntheir meaning is not entirely clear, and because Mr Humphries did not have any recollection of the matter in the \n1961 Informative Report, and was not crossexamined about that document.  \n336 At [316] to [318] I set out relevant portions of the 1961 Informative Report. One of the observations made in \nthat Report was that 'parents both drink heavily'.  \n337 Don denied that that was so.[404] His evidence was that when the Siblings were taken he and Sylvia weren't \ndrinking.[405] Don acknowledged that he and Sylvia would have had a beer but denied any drunkenness on their \npart.[406] Sylvia also denied that she and Don were drinking heavily at this time.[407] While I accept that the 1961 \n\n\n\nInformative Report was based on Mr Humphries' observations, the observation that the parents 'drink heavily' is a \nvalue laden one, which is not capable of any objective measure. As Mr Humphries was not crossexamined, it is not \npossible to determine whether his observation that Don and Sylvia drank heavily was able to be reconciled in any \nway with Don and Sylvia's denial that they were drunk at this point in time. Accordingly, I do not rely on this aspect \nof the 1961 Informative Report.  \n\n338 However, there were a number of other factual observations set out in the 1961 Informative Report. As I have \nfound that the observations contained in that Report reflected what Mr Humphries saw during his visit to the \nhumpy, those observations constitute evidence in relation to the conditions at the humpy in December 1961. The \nplaintiffs contested the accuracy of those observations.  \nWhether Don, Sylvia and the Siblings were living at the humpy when the Siblings were made wards\n339 At various stages in his evidence, Don either sought to deny that in December 1961 he and his family lived at \nthe humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block, or to minimise the amount of time that they spent living at the humpy. He \nsought to emphasise that when he was working on farms away from Brookton, they would stay on those farms. But \nDon accepted that even during those periods, the family would return to Bessie Ninyette's block on the \nweekends,[408] and he said that even when he was away working, 'two or three' of the Siblings would stay at the \ncamp while they went to school.[409]  \n340 In crossexamination, Don accepted that he and his family spent 'a little time'[410] at the humpy on Bessie \nNinyette's block. When asked to give an estimate he said that the time spent at the humpy would not have been \nmore than three months of the year in total (although not in one consecutive period).[411] Don was crossexamined \nabout the evidence given in his affidavit where he stated:  We probably spent about six months of the year on Betty \nNinyette's block in Brookton and the rest of the year, July to October, we moved around to wherever there was \nwork.[412]\n341 When asked whether this evidence was incorrect, Don answered that 'it could be ... these were only \napproximate'.[413]  \n342 Sylvia's evidence was that they 'spent about six months of the year on my mother's block in Brookton and we \nmoved around the rest of the year to wherever there was work'.[414] She said that if they went away to work, their \n'schoolage children would stay with my mother while we worked, so that they could attend school in Brookton and \nwe would take the younger children with us to the farm we were working at'.[415]  \n343 Having regard to Don and Sylvia's evidence, I find that in 1961, the humpy was home for Don and Sylvia and \nthe Siblings. I accept that Don undertook seasonal farm work away from Brookton during some periods in the year, \nduring which time Don and Sylvia and the younger Siblings, would live in accommodation provided on those farms. \nHowever, they would return to live in the humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block on weekends, and in between that \nseasonal work, Don and Sylvia and their children would also return to live at the humpy. The schoolaged Siblings \nwould remain in Brookton on Bessie Ninyette's block so that they would attend school in Brookton. I find that Don \nand Sylvia and the Siblings spent a substantial period of time at the humpy each year, and having regard to Don \nand Sylvia's evidence, I find that they spent between three months and six months of the year in 1961.  \nThe construction and contents of the humpy\n344 The description of the humpy contained in the 1961 Informative Report was consistent with the evidence given \nby Don and Sylvia, and by some of the Siblings.  \n345 In crossexamination, Don was asked about the description of the humpy in the 1961 Informative Report. Don \naccepted Mr Humphries' description of their accommodation on Bessie Ninyette's block as an iron and bag humpy \nwith a tin roof, tin around the sides, and bag doors, and with a wooden floor in the front room and a dirt floor for the \nremainder.[416] Don said the humpy was divided into two rooms by an iron partition with a wooden frame.[417] \nDon's recollection was that the humpy was not in need of repair.[418]  \n346 Sylvia agreed that the description of the humpy as an iron and bag humpy was correct, and that it was divided \ninto two rooms.[419]  \n347 Don disputed that the humpy housed 10 people as suggested in the 1961 Informative Report. Don's evidence \nwas that he and Sylvia and their eight children may have lived there for a night on a weekend, but said it was \nseldom that all of the family would stay in the humpy.[420] Don's evidence was that sometimes some of the children \nwould stay with his parents. However, his evidence was that in December 1961 his parents were living in South \nKumminin, 150 km away.[421] That aspect of his evidence was inherently improbable and I do not accept it.  \n\n\n\n348 Don agreed that there were three beds a double and two singles in the humpy, and said that the family \nmembers would also sleep on the ground or on mattresses.[422] Sylvia's evidence was that there was a double bed \nand three single beds.[423]  \n\n349 Don said that apart from the beds, the humpy contained a wooden table and some chairs.[424] He confirmed \nthat there was no electricity at the block, and they cooked with wood on a stove inside the humpy, or on a fire \noutside.[425] Sylvia's recollection was that there was a table, a cooler, a cupboard and a little stove.[426]  \n350 Don strongly disagreed with Mr Humphries' description of the 'squalid conditions' at the humpy. He said that \nfloor was swept clean,[427] and the sheets and clothing were washed once a week at a washhouse on the \nReserve.[428] Sylvia also said that the area in and around the humpy was swept every night.[429]  \n\n351 Don[430] and Sylvia both confirmed that there was no water supply at the humpy.[431] Sylvia said that they \nused to cart water from the reserve, or sometimes get it from Jean and Fred Collard's place.[432]  \n352 Don said the children had showers in a toilet and shower block opposite the Brookton Reserve, as and when \nthey needed to wash, which may have been two or three times a day or a week.[433] Sylvia said that the family \nused the showers and toilets near the Brookton Reserve,[434] but Don recalled that they also used to dig a toilet at \nthe camp site near the humpy.[435]  \n353 Bonnie recollected the construction and condition of the humpy prior to December 1961. Her evidence was that \nthe humpy was made of galvanised iron, that it was partitioned into two rooms, had hessian bags on the walls, \nhessian bags or mats on the dirt floor, a table, a cool safe, and some stools to sit on.[436] She recalled that there \nwas a double bed and a couple of single beds.[437] Bonnie confirmed that they would get their water from a well \nnear the Brookton Reserve, or from Fred Collard's house nearby, and that there was a big tub which they would \nbring inside to wash in.[438] She said they would have a bath every couple of days or so.[439] Bonnie also said that \nthey used toilets at the Reserve, although they had an old toilet (tin) at the camp as well.[440] She remembered that \nthe humpy was kept in a neat condition by her grandmother.[441]  \n\n354 Darryl also recollected life on Bessie Ninyette's block before he was taken into care. He recalled that the camp \nwas kept clean, and the dirt floor of the humpy was swept every day.[442] He recalled collecting water from Fred \nCollard's house[443] and bathing in a big tub every second day, using water heated on the campfire.[444] Darryl \nalso recalled that the humpy was an iron or tin humpy and there was a partition that divided the area into two rooms \nand a little kitchen area. He recalled that there was a dirt floor with no floor coverings. Darryl recalled that the \nfurniture comprised a double bed and four single beds, a cooler for keeping food cool, a table and a couple of old \nchairs, and a couple of old car seats outside to sit on.[445] He also confirmed that they used the showers and toilets \nat the Reserve.[446]  \n355 Beverley also had some memory of life at Bessie Ninyette's block prior to December 1961.[447] She recalled \nthat the humpy was made of iron and had two rooms. In the bedroom area she recalled that there was a double bed \nand a single bed. She remembered that Don and Sylvia slept in the double bed with Glenys, Eva and Beverley. \nDonald, Darryl and Bill shared the single bed. When the double bed was too crowded, Beverley would sleep in the \nboys' bed, while Wesley used to sleep in a pram or bassinet next to the double bed.[448] She also recalled water \nbeing carried to the humpy. She remembered that the Siblings 'would get dirty very easily from running around but \nwe were always clean and bathed'.[449]  \n356 Glenys also recalled that the humpy was made of tin with a dirt floor covered with hessian bags and a hessian \nbag for a door.[450] She recalled that Sylvia and Bessie would pick up the bags every day and use a broom to \nclean them, and the floor would be swept every evening.  \n\n357 Having regard to this evidence, I accept that Mr Humphries' observations as to the construction and the \ncontents of the humpy in December 1961 were accurate. I find that the humpy in which Don and Sylvia and the \nSiblings lived prior to December 1961 was made of galvanised tin, with hessian bags lining the walls. There was a \ndirt floor, with some hessian bags or lino to cover it. There was a partition dividing the space into two rooms. There \nwas little furniture, comprising a table and some stools, a cooler for food, and a stove. There was a double bed and \ntwo or three single beds, which was clearly inadequate for a family of two adults and eight children. Cooking was \ndone on an outside fire or on the stove. There was no electricity, gas or running water, and consequently no \n\n\n\nbathing or toilet facilities, apart from a camp (dug) toilet near the humpy. The family used the bathing and washing \nfacilities at the nearby Brookton Reserve.  \n\nThe observation that there was 'no food' in the humpy\n\n358 As for the observation in the 1961 Informative Report that there was 'no food' in the humpy, Don's evidence \nwas there were no fridges in those days, but he said they did have a meat safe at the humpy. He said that they \nalways had food in the humpy such as potatoes, onions, flour, tea, sugar, tinned meat, eggs and tomatoes, which \nmade up the family's daily diet.[451] He said a farmer would occasionally give them a sheep to eat, and they would \neat food caught from the land such as kangaroo or a rabbit 'maybe once a week or once a month'.[452] However, \nhe said that most of their food such as bacon, eggs and tomatoes was purchased from the shops.[453]  \n359 Sylvia also said that there was always plenty of food, which they purchased at the shops, or which Don brought \nhome from the farms (such as a sheep) or which they caught (such as rabbits).[454]  \n360 Some of the Siblings had memories of the food they ate before they went to Sister Kate's. Bonnie remembered \neating damper for lunch and dinner, and kangaroo meat. She recalled that sometimes Don would bring home a \nsheep from a farm, that there were always lots of eggs, and that they would buy fruit and tomatoes.[455] Darryl \nrecalled that there was always lots of food at the camp including sausages and mince, kangaroo, and sometimes \nlamb which Don would bring home from the farms. They would also buy fresh eggs, bread from the bakery, and \nmeat from the butcher in Brookton.[456] Beverley recalled that there was always plenty of food, and that Don would \nbring food home from the farms he worked on. She remembered cooking being done on the fire outside when the \nweather was warm and fine, and inside on the stove when it was cold.[457]  \n361 For completeness, I note that Mrs Patullo gave evidence that when Wesley first arrived at Sister Kate's he \ncame to live in the nursery cottage with her. She recalled having been told that Wesley had only been fed milk and \nwater before he came to live at Sister Kate's despite being eight months old at the time.[458] Mrs Patullo recalled \nthat Wesley had a bloated stomach when he arrived, which she thought suggested he was starving.[459] It appears \nthat she also thought he was small in size for his age.[460] In contrast, in crossexamination Don confirmed that by \nDecember 1961 Wesley was eating solid food such as potato or carrot as well as a bottle of milk.[461] He denied \nWesley had any bloating around his stomach at the time.[462]  \n\n362 I accept that Mrs Patullo recalled Wesley (and she clearly had a great deal of affection for him). However, there \nwere a number of details in Mrs Patullo's evidence about Wesley which were not accurate in important respects. \nFor example, Mrs Patullo thought Wesley was 10 months old when he arrived,[463] when in fact he was only eight \nmonths old. She also had no recollection that he wore surgical boots as a child because of a problem with his feet, \nbut Wesley gave evidence that this was so.[464] Further, as I noted at [109], had Wesley been suffering from \nmalnutrition on his admission to Sister Kate's, it is very likely that that would have been noted by Mr Daniel in his \nReport on the Siblings' health. There was no such indication. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that Mrs Patullo's \nrecollections of Wesley's health when he first came to Sister Kate's were sufficiently reliable to warrant any weight \nbeing placed on them.  \n\n363 For the reasons I have set out above, I accept that the 1961 Informative Report reflected what Mr Humphries \nobserved when he visited the humpy. As for Mr Humphries' observation that there was no food in the house, I bear \nin mind that the Collards did not own a refrigerator, that much of their food consisted of fresh supplies from farms in \nthe area, and that Don and Sylvia's evidence was that they were not living continuously at the humpy, but would \nspend some of the year living on farming properties where they worked. In those circumstances, it would not be \nsurprising to find only a modest amount of food, or perhaps little fresh food, in the humpy at any point in time. Even \ntaking all of that into account, however, in a house where two adults and eight children were living on a regular \nbasis it would be a matter of considerable concern to welfare officers to find no food whatsoever in the house.  \n364 The evidence given by Don and Sylvia, and the Siblings, paints a generally rosy picture of the Siblings' lives up \nto December 1961. However, it seems very likely that the passage of time, and their happy memories from the \nyears before the Siblings were made wards, has tempered the plaintiffs' memories of the harsh conditions in which \nthey lived. The evidence clearly supports the conclusion that in December 1961, the Collard family lived in \nextremely impoverished conditions, with none of the basic facilities which would be regarded as essential today. \nFurthermore, although I accept that the Siblings had enough food to eat, their physical wellbeing was far from ideal. \n\n\n\nIn a letter to the Commissioner dated 22 December 1961, Mr Daniel, the Superintendent of Sister Kate's observed \nthat the Children were 'all under treatment for trachoma, vermin and ringworm'.[465]  \nEvidence as to the conditions in which aboriginal people lived at the time\n\n365 At this point, it is appropriate to note that there was some, albeit limited, evidence about the living conditions of \naboriginal people on the Brookton Reserve in 1961. Sylvia gave evidence as to the conditions of housing for \naboriginal people at the time. She said:  There were no State homes in the area at the time, but the Department of \nNative Welfare provided housing on the Brookton Reserve for aboriginal people.\n\n We didn't live on the Reserve but I did visit there often because so many aboriginal people lived there.\n\n The Reserve houses were threeroom, tin humpies with concrete floors and a big verandah. But there was a gap \nbetween the walls and the floor so they were cold and the dust blew into them all the time. The houses had one tap \nout the front and you had to walk a long way for a shower and the toilet.\n\n There were four or five of what we called 'dog houses' on White Street [in Brookton]. They were built by the \ngovernment for Aborigines to live in just out of the main town in Brookton. Usually they were cement houses with tin \naround the sides. They were in pretty bad shape.\n\n They were such poor accommodation that we preferred to stay on Bessie's block in our humpies.[466]\n366 Sylvia said that the humpy in which she and her family lived was similar in size to the houses on the Reserve:  \nbut was much cooler in summer and warmer in winter because it was lined with hessian, had a dirt floor covered in \nhessian bags rather than a concrete floor and the walls of the humpy met the floor.[467]\n367 Sylvia also said that their humpy was 'much better and cleaner than the houses provided by the [Department of \nNative Welfare] to aboriginal people on the Reserve'.[468]  \n\n368 Don also gave evidence that 'a humpy, shack, tents ... it was the order of the day in which aboriginals \nlived'.[469] Don maintained that the humpy was typical of the accommodation in which aboriginal people lived at the \ntime.[470] Similarly, in approximately 2002, in recounting his recollection of what had happened when the Siblings \nwere taken, for the purposes of the publication entitled 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's Home Revisited',[471] Don \nsaid that:  If our kids were neglected then so was hundreds of others. We had a proper camp and we lived like any \naboriginal mob, in a tent. You couldn't find a house or even a shed to live in, in those days. You couldn't find any tin \nto make a decent humpy. Some used to cut up four gallon tins, hessian bags and tents. No matter how hard it was, \nthey were the living conditions then and to me they were beautiful days.[472]\n\n369 I accept Don and Sylvia's evidence as to the housing for aboriginal people on the Brookton Reserve at the \ntime. That evidence was consistent with the evidence given by Mr Maine. He was asked about the Child Welfare \nDepartment's view of accommodation for aboriginal people on the reserves:[473]  Was there any general effort by \nyour department to move aboriginal families from what you have described as the primitive housing conditions on \nreserves?---Well, the department had the objective of closing down the reserves because we did not consider they \nwere satisfactory places to bring children up ... .\n370 He was then asked what was the problem with the conditions on the reserves:[474]  From your perspective, \nwhat was the problem with the reserve?---I think there was a general feeling in the department that they were \nunhealthy environments in which to raise children. The accommodation was very basic. It wasn't until the \ndepartment put some extra money in that we even got electricity connected to the houses; so parents had to try and \nbring children up in homes that were simply not fitted out with the normal kinds of provisions you have to raise and \ncare for a family. The toilets and showers were in the form of ablution blocks and in that kind of situation it's very \ndifficult to get anyone to take proper care of them because nobody owns them individually. The grounds of the \nreserve were difficult to maintain. There often tended to be drinking and things like that on the reserve, and overall it \nwas there was children had a very poor chance of achieving any kind of reasonable adjustment if they grew up on \nthe reserve.\n\n\n\n371 In the course of the hearing, I asked Mr Maine whether the Child Welfare Department employed the same \napproach to neglected children living on aboriginal reserves as was applied to neglected children living outside \nreserves, or in towns. His evidence was:  Generally, yes. The department would have to show to the Children's \nCourt that the children were being neglected or in danger of being neglected and that could occur in any kind of \naccommodation, because as much as anything, it was the fact of the parents' quality of care or the parents' ability to \ncare and that could be lacking even in a good conventional home. So the test of whether the child was endangered \nby the situation was applied overall, but it was probably more central when you came to look at children on \nreserves, because you not you also had an impoverished environment in which the child was living, whereas in the \nnormal community, there are likely to be some compensations that the children might make use of.\n\n But your evidence is that the same general approach applied to everybody, all children, regardless of where they \nlived, in terms of whether they needed to be placed in care?---The general approach of whether the child was \nneglected or in danger of neglect, that applied to everybody, but the measures by which you might demonstrate that \nwould have varied to some degree where you were dealing with children on a reserve.[475]\n\n372 The evidence as to the conditions on the Brookton Reserve did not detract from the implications of the \nevidence as to the impoverished living conditions in which the Siblings lived prior to 1961. But it did serve as a \nreminder that many aboriginal people lived in extremely impoverished circumstances, including on the reserves set \naside by the State as places where aboriginal people could live.  \n(e) Responsibility for the Children after they became wards  \n\n373 Although Ellen had been placed in the care of the Child Welfare Department following an application to the \nChildren's Court made by Mr Waghorne, an officer of the Child Welfare Department, the practical responsibility for \nEllen's wardship was subsequently transferred to the Department of Native Welfare because she was an aboriginal \nchild.[476]  \n374 Similarly, in so far as the Siblings were concerned, on 17 January 1962 the Director wrote to the Commissioner \nof Native Welfare in response to Mr WrightWebster's memorandum of 12 December 1961. The Director advised \nthat the Child Welfare Department was 'in agreement that the children remain at Sister Kate's Home and in view of \nthe circumstances, would be pleased if you would see fit to accept the custody of the children'.[477] The \nDepartment of Native Welfare accepted the custody of the Siblings on 26 January 1962.[478]  \n375 I find that the Department of Native Welfare assumed the practical responsibility for decisions in relation to the \ncare of Ellen from shortly after she was made a ward on 13 March 1958, and in respect of the Siblings from 26 \nJanuary 1962.  \n376 The Department of Native Welfare retained that practical responsibility for decisions in relation to the Children \nuntil July 1964. At that time, the Child Welfare Department resumed responsibility for all State wards who had \npreviously been within the responsibility of the Department of Native Welfare, including the Children.  \n(f) Where the Children lived during their wardships  \n\n377 The primary source of evidence in relation to where the Children were placed during their wardships was the \ndocumentary evidence. Save where I indicate to the contrary, I accept the documentary evidence is accurate in so \nfar as it discloses where each of the Children lived during their wardships.  \n\n378 A number of the documents indicate that Don and Sylvia removed the Siblings from the places where they \nwere living at various times. As I indicate below, on many occasions during the course of their evidence, Don and \nSylvia denied that they had taken the Siblings. I refer to these specific denials below, but by way of example, I note \nthat in her evidenceinchief, Sylvia said:  I never removed the children from Sister Kate's. I remember that several of \nour children ran away from Sister Kate's. We would hear from other people in town that the police would pick them \nup on their way to see us. The police would always come to us as soon as they went missing, but often we didn't \nsee them because they didn't get to us. If they ran away they never let us know if or where they had found them.\n\n I remember Darryl was our only child who actually was able to run away and spend some time with us before he \nwas picked up and taken back. ...\n\n\n\n The only child we ever 'took' was Wesley. Don took Wes from his school in Mt. Lawley. We had a house by then in \nKondinin that Don had bought and we wanted to show it to him. I don't recall getting permission for taking Wesley \nand I remember there were people enquiring about him but we managed to keep him for a few weeks and then he \ncame back to school in Perth.\n\n I remember that sometimes when we went to visit the kids in Sister Kate's or at school they would say they were \ndying to come home but, Glenys in particular and Beverley would say, 'we're scared to come home because we \nthink you and Dad would get in trouble or go to jail.[479]\n379 As I explain further below, I do not accept Don and Sylvia's denials that they removed the Siblings from care. \nAs Sylvia's evidenceinchief suggests, Don and Sylvia's reluctance to admit that they had removed the Siblings from \ncare at various times appears to have been attributable to concern about whether such an acknowledgment even \ntoday would constitute an admission that they had breached the law, for which they might be punished.  \nDonald\n380 Although it is not strictly necessary to do so in order to resolve the issues in dispute in this action, I set out my \nfindings as to where Donald lived during his wardship, although the documentary evidence in relation to Donald was \nlimited.  \n381 Donald was 10 years old when he was made a ward in December 1961. In October 1966, he left school during \nhis second year of high school.[480] In late 1962 or during 1963,[481] Donald was transferred to Burnbrae, together \nwith Darryl and Bonnie. At the time he left school, Donald also left Burnbrae, and went to board with Mr and Mrs \nSmith in order to commence an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker.[482]  \n382 In late 1966 Don collected Donald and took him back to the Brookton area.[483] Having been made aware of \nthis, Constable Wall spoke to Donald and ascertained that he did not like sheet metal work. Constable Wall spoke \nto officers of the Child Welfare Department and suggested that they leave Donald with his parents over Christmas, \nand Constable Wall would 'keep an eye on him'.[484]  \n\n383 By at least March 1967, Donald had returned home to live with his parents at Brookton, and was working with \nDon. Mr Hill, the Child Welfare Department's District Officer at Narrogin, prepared a file note dated 10 April 1967 in \nwhich he reported that he had visited Don and Donald on 15 March 1967. At that time,  Donald Junior said straight \nout that he was not prepared to go back to the Metropolitan area to continue his apprenticeship. He said he wanted \nto stay with his family. I could see no useful purpose in picking him up and returning him after so long an absence \nhad elapsed, so left him with parents, whilst he is of good behaviour.[485]\n\n384 Mr Hill wrote a further file note on 11 April 1967 in which he noted:  Donald Collard [junior] was placed out with \nMr D. Smith, as a sheet metal worker. His Father removed him. ... \n\n ... As soon as I saw Donald Jun. he said straight out that he wanted to stay home with his parents, and get work \nwith his Father. He said straight out that he would not go back to his job, but wanted to stay in Brookton. I could see \nno point in attempting to pick him up forcibly, and take him to Perth, so told him that we would allow him to stay \nhome whilst he kept himself usefully employed, and out of trouble, and whilst of good behaviour. ...\n\n It is rather a pity that I had not been advised to go to Brookton to pick up this child, when first he left his job. \nHowever, I very much doubt whether he would have stayed with his employer, even if he had been returned ... .\n\n ... I feel this home is not a suitable place for this boy to stay in, but I feel sure that he will return to his home \nwhatever we do, unless we were to place him in such a place as 'Hillston'. So far, however, he has not to my \nknowledge done anything to place him there. I recommend that we leave him with his parents 'whilst of good \nbehaviour' and I will visit him as soon as possible.[486]\n385 In his evidence, Don confirmed that he was not sure precisely when Donald returned home to live with them, \nnor what age Donald was at the time, but he recollected that Donald stayed with Don and Sylvia until February \n\n\n\n1968.[487] Sylvia didn't recall Donald ever coming home to them while he was a ward. Her evidence was that he \ncame home when he was 19 years old, just before he was killed.[488] (In fact, Donald was 18 years old when he \nwas killed.) However, Sylvia then said that if Donald 'had come home or run away', he 'could have gone down to the \nsheds with Don', but that she did not know whether this had happened.[489] Given the ambivalence in Sylvia's \nevidence, and in view of the documentary evidence, and Don's evidence, I am unable to accept Sylvia's evidence \nthat Donald did not return home to live with her and Don at the humpy while he was still a ward.  \n\n386 For reasons which are not presently relevant, in early 1968 the Children's Court ordered that Donald be sent to \nLongmore detention centre.[490] After assessment there, it was determined that he should be placed at \nHillston.[491] Departmental records suggest that Donald absconded from Hillston three times.  \n387 On 12 September 1968 Donald commenced work as a farm hand on a farm in Moora,[492] but on 26 \nSeptember 1968 he left that position.[493] As a result of a further order of the Children's Court in April 1969, Donald \nbriefly stayed at Longmore in 1969.[494] Donald's wardship ended when he reached 18 years of age on 19 \nSeptember 1969.[495]  \n388 Donald was killed in a car accident on 15 January 1970 when he was 18 years old.[496]  \nDarryl\n\n389 Darryl was nine years old when he was made a ward. He resided at Sister Kate's for some time, before being \nmoved to Burnbrae. There was no evidence as to the precise date when this occurred. However, it appears that \nthis occurred during late 1962 or in 1963 because Darryl's evidence was that he had been moved to Burnbrae by \nthe time he was 10 years old.[497] Donald and Bonnie were transferred to Burnbrae at the same time.  \n390 There was little evidence in relation to Darryl's wardship between then and about August 1967 by which time \nDarryl was almost 15 years old. It is apparent from the documents that by that time, Darryl was (or remained) \nunhappy about being separated from his family, and did not wish to remain at Burnbrae.  \n391 The documents suggest that on a number of occasions, Darryl was either removed by Don and Sylvia from \nBurnbrae and taken back to Brookton, or that Darryl himself ran away to Brookton.  \n392 The documents in evidence indicated that on 7 August 1967, Darryl and Bonnie were taken from Burnbrae by \nDon and Sylvia.[498] A report from the manager of Burnbrae, Mr Scott, to the Director, indicated that 'Donald \nCollard called at Burnbrae with the intention of seeing the children. Apparently he took them out for the day and \nfailed to return them.'[499] Don did not have permission to do so.[500] The Child Welfare Department requested \nthat the Brookton police remove the children from their parents' care immediately and return them to Burnbrae.[501]  \n393 On 8 August 1967, the Director wrote to the Commissioner and requested that one of his officers investigate \nwhether Darryl and Bonnie should be returned to Burnbrae, or 'if conditions are satisfactory ... [whether] you would \nbe accepting supervision in this case if these children were released to their parents'.[502] However, by that stage, \nConstable Wall had located Darryl and Bonnie, who were with their parents at Langley Farm where Don was \nshearing, and returned them to Burnbrae.[503]  \n\n394 Darryl denied that he had gone with Don and Sylvia from Burnbrae.[504] However, this denial appears to have \nresulted from the fact that he had no independent recollection of doing so.[505]  \n395 There was also a record[506] that Darryl ran away from Burnbrae in about October 1967. Darryl did not recall \nrunning away on this occasion.[507]  \n\n396 There was also evidence that in about midNovember 1967 Don came and collected Darryl (who by then was 15 \nyears of age), over the objections of staff at Burnbrae.[508] Again, Darryl said he had no recollection of these \nevents.[509]  \n\n397 Don was crossexamined as to whether he had removed Darryl (and Bonnie) from Burnbrae in 1967. His \nevidence was that he could not recall taking them, but he acknowledged that 'they may have run away and I picked \nthem up somewhere. I can't recall.'[510] He was also vague as to whether he could remember Darryl and Bonnie \nbeing collected by Constable Wall from a farm where Don was shearing. When asked if he recalled this, Don's \nevidence was that 'I probably just can', and then 'I'm not sure that I do remember well' and finally 'no, I don't \nremember it'.[511] However Don accepted that Constable Wall 'continually warned' him and Sylvia not to remove \nthe children without approval.[512]  \n\n\n\n398 Don was also asked whether he collected Darryl from Burnbrae in November 1967. Don's evidence was that he \ncouldn't remember removing Darryl on this occasion[513] and denied any recollection of Darryl working with him \nbefore Darryl was 18 years old.[514]  \n399 Sylvia also denied any recollection that Don, or she and Don, had removed Darryl (and Bonnie) from Burnbrae \nin August 1967. She accepted that they might have come home but said she couldn't remember taking them, nor \ncould she remember Constable Wall coming out to Langley's farm to remove them.[515]  \n\n400 Documents from the Department's files indicate that in January 1968, Mr and Mrs Romer of Byford made an \napplication to foster Darryl.[516] It appears that they had previously lived and worked at Burnbrae, and while there, \nthey had become fond of Darryl, and now hoped to be able to assist Darryl to find work.[517] Darryl was collected \nfrom Brookton where he was living at that date, and was taken to live with Mr and Mrs Romer. Darryl's evidence \nwas that he agreed to go to Mr and Mrs Romer because it would be an 'easier place to get away from ... when [he] \nwas ready to make the next move'.[518] Darryl thought he was with the Romers for about two weeks,[519]after \nwhich he ran away again.[520] On this occasion, Darryl rode to Brookton on his bike.[521] Darryl recalled being \nhome for about two weeks and then the police came and picked him up.[522] After he was returned, and started \nwork, he recalled that Don came and picked him up from work and took him home to Brookton.[523] Darryl's \nevidence was that he 'left the new bike and everything' and went with his father.[524] This appears to have been in \nlate January or February 1968.  \n401 For the reasons I have already given, I do not accept Don and Sylvia's evidence in so far as they denied \nremoving Darryl from Burnbrae in 1967 and I prefer the documentary evidence on that issue.  \n402 Reports and memoranda prepared by the staff of the Child Welfare Department in mid to late 1967 were in \nevidence. Those documents noted that the staff at Burnbrae had advised that Darryl was very attached to his father \nand had indicated that he did not intend to stay in any job found for him by the authorities, but rather intended to go \nhome to his family.[525] Welfare officers at the Child Welfare Department then concluded that there was little point \nin trying to prevent Darryl from staying with his family, and instead he should be permitted to return, but monitored \nby officers of the Child Welfare Department and the Department of Native Welfare in Narrogin.[526]  \n403 It appears that Darryl resumed living with Don and Sylvia from late January or February 1968.  \n404 For reasons which are not presently relevant, in July 1968 the Midland Children's Court recommitted Darryl to \nthe care of the Child Welfare Department and recommended that he be sent to Hillston.[527] There was evidence \nthat suggested that by early 1969 Darryl was not living with his immediate family. His evidence was that at this time \nhe was 'living with my people any of them ... wherever I wanted to stay as I could stop with any of them'.[528]  \n\n405 It appears, however, that by July 1969, Darryl had returned to live with his parents in Brookton, and was doing \nseasonal work with Don.[529] A file note prepared by Mr Moulton, following a visit to the Collard family in July \n1969,[530] indicated that Darryl was living in Brookton with his family while his parents were away shearing, and \nthat Darryl was attending school in Brookton. Mr Moulton also visited in September 1969, and reported that Darryl \nwas said to be working with Don at that time. A file note made by Mr Moulton on 14 October 1969[531]indicated that \nhe had received information that Darryl and William had gone to Boyup Brook to work with Don.  \n406 Darryl's evidence was that between the age of 16 and his late 20s he worked with his father doing seasonal \nwork.  \n\n407 In her evidence, Sylvia either denied that Darryl had returned to work with Don, or said she had no recollection \nof him doing so, on the occasions to which I have referred above.[532] In view of the documentary evidence, and \nDarryl's evidence that he was working with his father during this period, I do not accept this aspect of Sylvia's \nevidence.  \n408 For reasons which are not presently relevant, in December 1969, the Children's Court at Narrogin recommitted \nDarryl to the care of the Child Welfare Department,[533] although Mr Moulton determined that in all of his \ncircumstances he should be released to the care of his parents.[534]  \n409 According to a file note made by Mr Moulton on 21 May 1970, Darryl was then living in Doodlakine where he \nwas employed.[535]  \n410 On 27 May 1970, for reasons which are not presently relevant, Darryl was returned to Longmore,[536] and was \nthen transferred to Hillston[537] On 25 June 1970 he was released into the care of Sylvia.[538] Darryl returned to \n\n\n\nLongmore on 13 July 1970,[539] although he was again transferred to Hillston.[540] He was released from Hillston \non 21 July 1970[541] into the care of his aunt, Mrs Jean Collard.[542] Darryl confirmed that this had occurred.[543]  \n411 Darryl's period of wardship expired when he reached 18 years of age on 21 September 1970.  \nBonnie\n\n412 Bonnie was seven years old when she was made a ward. Like Darryl, she resided at Sister Kate's for some \ntime, before being moved to Burnbrae, although there was no evidence as to the precise date when this occurred. It \nappears that this occurred during late 1962 or in 1963.[544]  \n413 As I have already found, on 7 August 1967, Bonnie and Darryl were taken by Don and Sylvia, without \npermission, from Burnbrae.[545] Bonnie was 13 years old at the time. Bonnie and Darryl were located at Brookton \nand returned by the police to Burnbrae.[546] As I have noted above, the Director wrote to the Commissioner and \nrequested that one of his officers investigate whether Darryl and Bonnie should be returned to Burnbrae, or whether \nthe conditions at home were satisfactory so that they could remain with their parents.[547] However, by that stage, \nDarryl and Bonnie had been located and returned to Burnbrae.[548]  \n\n414 In late January 1968, Bonnie was placed with foster parents, Mr and Mrs Scott.[549] She remained with them \nuntil late May 1968 when she was temporarily returned to Sister Kate's while Mr and Mrs Scott's house was being \nrenovated.[550] Bonnie was briefly fostered by Mrs Scott's mother, Mrs Helen Roemer, in Byford, from midJuly \n1968[551] but then returned to live with Mr and Mrs Scott from later in July 1968.[552] She remained with Mr and \nMrs Scott until December 1968 when she was fostered to her aunt, Mrs Farmer, in Doubleview.[553]  \n415 In February 1969, Miss Hobcroft, a Welfare Officer for the Child Welfare Department, made a file note in which \nshe noted that Bonnie (who was 14 years old at that stage) had applied to the Department for an exemption from \nschool, as she had found a job.[554]  \n416 Bonnie remained with Mrs Farmer until about March 1969. Bonnie recollected that Don came and collected her \nfrom Mrs Farmer's house in March 1969.[555]  \n417 A file note of the Child Welfare Department[556] indicates that on 18 March 1969, Don and Sylvia arrived in \nPerth to fetch William, and that they had already picked up Bonnie with the intention of taking both children to \nBrookton. Don was crossexamined about this.[557] He denied any recollection of having collected William and \nBonnie from where they were living in March 1969.[558] He also denied any recollection that Bonnie and William \nhad returned to live with them in 1969. Don's evidence was that 'they never come back to live with us. They were \nnever allowed to.'[559] By March 1969, however, Bonnie had been released by the Child Welfare Department to \nlive with her parents in Brookton.[560]  \n418 An inspection by Mr Moulton on 30 July 1969 confirmed that Bonnie was living with her parents at that \ntime.[561] A further inspection by Mr Moulton, on 30 September 1969, confirmed that Bonnie was still living with her \nparents in Brookton, although she was not attending school.[562]  \n419 Sylvia was crossexamined about Bonnie's return to live with her and Don in Brookton. As was the case in \nrelation to her evidence concerning Darryl, Sylvia denied any recollection of Bonnie returning home.[563] She later \naccepted that William and Bonnie may have come home in around 1969, although she didn't remember collecting \nthem.[564] Later, she again denied that Bonnie had returned home to live with her her evidence was that after the \nSiblings went to Sister Kate's 'they never came back in my care at all'.[565] Sylvia was also crossexamined about a \nletter dated 14 April 1969 sent to her by Ms Hobcroft,[566] which referred to a meeting with Sylvia at which it had \nbeen agreed that William and Bonnie should return to Brookton with her. Sylvia denied that this was true.[567]Sylvia \nalso denied ever seeing Mr Moulton in Brookton.[568]  \n420 For the reasons I have already given, I do not accept Don and Sylvia's evidence, in so far as it involved a \ndenial that Bonnie had returned to live with them in Brookton during 1969. I prefer Bonnie's evidence, together with \nthe documentary evidence, to the evidence given by Don and Sylvia in this respect.  \n421 Bonnie said that she went with her parents to a farm near Pingelly in July 1969 and that she did not return to \nBrookton, but stayed in Pingelly on the reserve there.  \n\n422 By December 1969, Bonnie was pregnant and living in a de facto relationship with Basil Little. They lived with \nMr Little's parents on the Brookton Reserve.[569] Bonnie gave birth to a son at Narrogin Hospital on 2 January \n1970 and thereafter she lived with Basil Little at the Brookton Reserve.[570] By July 1970, Bonnie and Basil had \nmoved from the Brookton Reserve to a house in Pingelly. Mr Moulton visited Bonnie at that time and reported that \n\n\n\nshe was 'fit, well and happy'.[571] Bonnie continued to live in Pingelly until at least June 1971.[572] In March 1972, \nMr Moulton noted that he had received information that Bonnie was living on the Native Reserve at Pingelly.[573]  \n423 Bonnie did not dispute that she lived with Basil Little and his family in Pingelly while she was a ward. Her \nevidence was that she did not receive any help from welfare authorities while she was living with Basil and his \nfamily during her wardship.[574]  \n424 Bonnie's wardship ended on 22 May 1972 when she reached 18 years of age.  \nWilliam\n425 Although it is not strictly necessary to do so in order to resolve the issues in dispute in this action, I set out my \nfindings as to where William lived during his wardship.  \n426 William was six years old when he was made a ward in December 1961. Although there is little documentary \nevidence about his time at Sister Kate's, it appears that William lived there until October 1968 (when he was 13 \nyears old).  \n427 In October 1968, William ran away from Sister Kate's and returned to Brookton. He was located and returned to \nSister Kate's. He ran away again on 7 November 1968.[575] On 26 November 1968 he was found to be at the \nhome of his aunt, Mrs Farmer, in Doubleview, who reported that she was happy to have him stay with her, and Ms \nHobcroft recommended that William (or Bill as he was known) remain with her.[576] However, William was \nsubsequently collected from Mrs Farmer by other members of his family.[577]  \n\n428 On 6 December 1968, for reasons which are not presently relevant, the Children's Court at Pingelly \nrecommitted William to the care of the Child Welfare Department.[578] From 30 December 1968, he was placed at \nLongmore.[579]  \n\n429 William was placed at Sister Kate's on 27 February 1969 but ran away on 9 March 1969. A file note of the \nChild Welfare Department[580] indicated that after William ran away from Sister Kate's he was collected by \nConstable Wall and brought back to Perth, but Sister Kate's would not accept him back.  \n430 William was then returned to the Child Welfare Reception Home but was released to his parents on 18 March \n1969.[581] As I have already observed, a file note of the Child Welfare Department[582] indicated that on 18 March \n1969, Don and Sylvia arrived in Perth to collect William, and that they had already collected Bonnie, with the \nintention of taking both children to Brookton. As I have already noted, Don was crossexamined about this.[583] He \ndenied any recollection of having collected William and Bonnie from where they were living in March 1969.[584] He \nalso denied any recollection that Bonnie and William had returned to live with them in 1969. Don's evidence was \nthat 'they never come back to live with us. They were never allowed to.'[585]  \n\n431 Mr Moulton visited the Collards in July 1969 and after that visit he reported that William was living with his \nparents in Brookton,[586] although he was working in a shearing shed with his father rather than attending school.  \n432 A file note prepared in August 1969 by Ms Hobcroft indicated that William had sent a message to her, \nindicating that he wished to return to Sister Kate's.[587]  \n\n433 Mr Moulton visited the Collards again in September 1969, and reported that William was still in Brookton with \nhis parents, and had advised Mr Moulton that he did not wish to return to Sister Kate's.[588] Mr Moulton indicated \nthat at this time, William was refusing to attend school and was working occasionally with his father.  \n434 A file note made by Mr Moulton on 14 October 1969[589] indicated that he had received information that Darryl \nand William had gone to Boyup Brook to work with Don.  \n\n435 Sylvia and Don were crossexamined about William's return to live with them. On several occasions, Sylvia \ndenied that William had returned to live with them in 1969, and that he had gone to work with Don.[590] Don also \ngave evidence that William did not return to live with them when he was of school age[591] or alternatively that he \nhad no recollection of William working with him.[592] Don was also crossexamined about Mr Moulton's report that \nin September 1969 William was living with him and Sylvia. He denied having any recollection that William came \nhome to live with them[593] and he said:  Not one of those kids that were taken by the welfare were ever allowed to \ncome home to us or were we ever given permission to take them. They came home either with a girlfriend or a \nboyfriend and that was the state's bringing up.[594]\n\n\n\n436 For the reasons I have already given at [69] to [75], I do not accept Don and Sylvia's evidence in so far as it \nconstituted a denial that William had returned to live with them in 1969, and was working with Don during 1969. I \nprefer the documentary evidence as to the timing of William's return to Brookton to live with his parents in 1969.  \n\n437 On 10 November 1969, for reasons which are not presently relevant, the Albany Children's Court recommitted \nWilliam to the care of the Child Welfare Department.[595] By January 1970, William had been placed at \nBurnbrae.[596] When Burnbrae closed in February 1970, William was temporarily placed with Mrs Farmer in \nDoubleview,[597]before being placed with Mrs Jean Collard (Don's sisterinlaw) in White Gum Valley.[598]  \n\n438 In March 1970, William went to Brookton to visit his parents, but when it was time to return he could not be \nlocated.[599] By May 1970, Mr Moulton had ascertained that William was in Brookton and was working on a farm in \nthe area.[600] William remained in Brookton for several months but had difficulty finding employment,[601] and \nreturned to Mrs Jean Collard in White Gum Valley later in 1970.[602] In December 1970, the Perth Children's Court \nrecommitted William to the care of the Child Welfare Department until he reached 18 years of age.[603]  \n439 The evidence in relation to where William lived during the balance of his wardship was sketchy. By July 1971, \nWilliam was living with another aunt, Mrs Collard, in Bunbury.[604]  \n440 There was evidence that in December 1972, William was living in Maylands.[605]  \n441 In January and March 1973, the Child Welfare Department returned William to the care of Don and Sylvia.[606]  \n442 William's period of wardship expired when he reached 18 years of age on 20 September 1973.  \n443 William was killed in a car accident on 7 July 1977 when he was 22 years old.[607]  \nBeverley\n\n444 Beverley was five years old when was she made a ward and placed at Sister Kate's. She lived there until \nSeptember 1968. Beverley gave evidence that she ran away from Sister Kate's for the first time when she was \nabout nine years old. She said that she made it all the way back to Brookton.[608]  \n\n445 From 23 September 1968, Beverley was placed in foster care with Mr and Mrs Stephenson in Yokine, with \nwhom Wesley was living.[609] Following the breakdown of that placement, on 12 February 1969, Beverley was \nplaced at the Bridgewater Assessment Centre for a short time for assessment.[610] She was then transferred to \nSister Kate's.[611]  \n446 Beverley ran away from Sister Kate's on 11 March 1969[612] and returned home to her parents in \nBrookton.[613]Beverley confirmed that this was the case.[614]  \n447 A file note by Ms Hobcroft dated 10 April 1969 indicated that she had received  information through Queen's \nPark School ... that Beverley is with parents in Brookton. She is enrolled at Brookton Primary School.\n\n It seems pointless to insist on this child's return to Sister Kate's as she will most likely abscond again.[615]\n\n448 Mr Moulton visited the Collards in July 1969 and reported that Beverley was living with her parents and \nattending Brookton Primary School.[616] Beverley recalled going to the Brookton Primary School in this period.[617]  \n449 Beverley recalled that when she returned home to Brookton in mid1969, Bonnie, William, Darryl and Donald \nwere already living there, and Glenys came afterwards.[618]  \n\n450 Mr Moulton visited the Collards' humpy in Brookton on 30 September 1969. As a result of that visit (the details \nof which are referred to elsewhere in these reasons), he recommended that Beverley and Glenys (who was also \nliving with Don and Sylvia by then) be placed in foster care in Perth.[619]  \n\n451 In her evidence, Sylvia denied any knowledge of Beverley running away from Sister Kate's on 11 March 1969 \nand returning home, and she denied that Beverley was later found to be living with her and Don in Brookton and \nattending Brookton Primary School.[620] Sylvia claimed that she was living in Kondinin then.[621] She then \nsuggested that Beverley may have run away and that the Siblings ran away a lot.[622] Sylvia also denied any \nmeeting with Mr Moulton when Beverley was living at home with her in Brookton,[623] and she denied that Beverley \nwas attending the Brookton Primary School at the time of Mr Moulton's visits.[624]  \n\n\n\n452 For the reasons set out above at [69] to [75] and having regard to Beverley's evidence and the documentary \nevidence, in so far as Sylvia denied that Beverley had returned to live with her and Don in Brookton during 1969, I \ndo not accept her evidence.  \n\n453 The documents in evidence indicate that on about 7 October 1969, Don and Sylvia left Beverley, Glenys and \nEva (who by that stage were also living in Brookton with them) with Ms Jones in Brookton.[625] On 10 October \n1969, Beverley, Glenys and Eva were driven to Perth by Constable Brennan and Ms Jones.[626] Beverley was then \nplaced in an emergency foster placement with Mrs Piercy in Wanneroo.[627] She confirmed this placement.[628] \nHer evidence was that she was taken to Bridgewater Receiving Home and was placed with Mrs Piercy temporarily \nuntil there was a vacancy at Sister Kate's.[629]  \n454 Beverley denied that Don and Sylvia had left her and her sisters with Ms Jones. She said she had never stayed \nwith Ms Jones.[630] Sylvia also denied that she and Don had left the girls with Ms Jones.[631] Don's evidence was \nthat he would not have left the girls with Ms Jones.[632]  \n\n455 I do not accept this aspect of the evidence given by Beverley, Sylvia and Don, having regard to the fact that \nBeverley was placed in an emergency foster placement with Mrs Piercy, which she did not deny. The most likely \nexplanation for why that emergency placement was required is that Beverley, Glenys and Eva were unable to \nremain living with Don and Sylvia. The only evidence as to why that was so is that Don and Sylvia left the girls with \nMs Jones. I find that that is what occurred.  \n\n456 Subsequently, Mrs Price of Gosnells (who had fostered Beverley for holidays while she was living at Sister \nKate's) contacted the Child Welfare Department and asked to foster Beverley.[633] On 15 December 1969, \nBeverley and Eva were placed in foster care with Mrs Price in Gosnells.[634] Beverley confirmed that this had \noccurred.[635]  \n\n457 Beverley and Eva remained with Mrs Price until around late July 1970 when they were placed in foster care \nwith Mrs Mathews in Armadale.[636]  \n458 Following their return to Don and Sylvia for Christmas in 1970 (which is discussed elsewhere in these reasons), \nBeverley, Glenys and Eva ran away and returned to Perth, and on 15 January 1971 they went to the home of their \ncousin, Mrs McIntyre, in Hamilton Hill.[637] Beverley remained with Mrs McIntyre for the remainder of January \n1971.  \n459 On 2 February 1971, Beverley returned to live with Mrs Mathews in Armadale.[638] She remained with Mrs \nMathews throughout 1971 and 1972 and attended high school in Armadale. She finished high school at the end of \n1972, and obtained employment with a view to commencing nursing aide training in June 1973.[639]  \n460 In the latter half of 1973, Beverley sought the permission of the Child Welfare Department to marry her \nboyfriend Kevin Hill.[640] Approval was given by the Department in October 1973, by which time Beverley was 17 \nyears of age.[641] Beverley's recollection was that she was married on 17 December 1973.[642]  \n461 Beverley's wardship ended on 5 October 1974 when she reached 18 years of age.[643]  \n462 I note that Beverley's recollection of events and of her placements from around 1970 was rather vague \u2013 for \nexample she recalled going home for Christmas one year, but not which year it was or from whose house she went, \nand she could not recall how long stayed with Mrs McIntyre.[644] Given Beverley's limited recollection, I find that \nthe facts set out in the documents in evidence, to which I have referred, are a more reliable source of evidence as \nto Beverley's placements and the dates of those placements, than Beverley's recollection, to the extent that there \nwas any inconsistency in that evidence.  \nEllen\n463 Ellen was received into the Child Welfare Reception Home on 14 March 1958.[645] On 18 March 1958 she was \ndischarged into the care of a foster parent, Mrs Betty Dwyer, of Carlisle.[646]  \n464 Ellen resided with Mr and Mrs Dwyer until her late teens when she joined the army and later married and had \nchildren. On the whole, Ellen had a very stable childhood. Numerous reports in relation to her foster care with the \nDwyers were in evidence. The consistent tenor of those reports was that she was progressing satisfactorily and was \nnormal for her age in health and conduct.[647]  \nGlenys\n\n\n\n465 Glenys was almost three years old when she was made a ward in December 1961. She lived at Sister Kate's \nuntil June 1969, by which time she was 10 years old.  \n466 The documents in evidence indicate that on about 11 June 1969, Glenys and Eva were collected from Sister \nKate's by Don and Sylvia and taken back to Brookton. Ms Hobcroft recommended that in the circumstances, their \nrelease to Don and Sylvia should be approved[648] and the girls were permitted to remain with Don and Sylvia at \nthat stage.[649]  \n467 Glenys recalled going home to Brookton when she was nine or 10 years old (that is, in 1969). She recollected a \ntime when Don and Beverley came and collected her from Sister Kate's.[650]  \n468 Beverley also recollected that a couple of months after March 1969 (in other words, around June 1969) she \ndrove to Sister Kate's with her parents and that she went in to fetch Glenys. Beverley recollected that Glenys lived \nat home with Don and Sylvia for a time after that.[651]  \n\n469 Mr Moulton of the Child Welfare Department visited the Collards in July 1969 and reported that Glenys was \nliving with her parents and attending Brookton primary school.[652] Mr Moulton also visited the Collards' humpy in \nBrookton on 30 September 1969. He noted that at the time of his visit, Glenys was attending school. As a result of \nthat visit (the details of which are referred to elsewhere in these reasons), Mr Moulton recommended that Glenys \nand Beverley (who was also living with her parents in Brookton at that time) be placed in foster care in Perth.[653]  \n470 Glenys also recollected that she had attended Brookton primary school for a couple of months during \n1969.[654] Glenys recalled that during this time, she lived at the humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block.[655] She \nrecalled her parents going away to work and that she stayed at Bessie Ninyette's block with family and went to \nschool in Brookton. Glenys confirmed that Mr Moulton's report to that effect was correct.[656]  \n471 Don was asked whether he and Sylvia collected Glenys and Eva on 11 June 1969. He denied any recollection \nof that incident. His evidence was that 'they never came with us'.[657] Sylvia also denied that they had collected \nEva and Glenys from Sister Kate's in June 1969. Her evidence was that the only time the Department had permitted \nGlenys and Eva to come home was for Christmas in 1969.[658]  \n472 Sylvia denied that Glenys was living in Brookton with her and Don in July 1969.[659] She also denied any \nrecollection that Glenys ever attended Brookton Primary School.[660] For the reasons I have already given at [69] \nto [75], and having regard to the documentary evidence and to the evidence of Glenys and Beverley, I do not \naccept Don and Sylvia's denials that Glenys returned to live with them in mid1969.  \n473 As I have already noted, on about 7 October 1969, Glenys (together with Beverley and Eva, who were also \nliving in Brookton with Don and Sylvia) were left with Ms Jones in Brookton by Don and Sylvia.[661] Don was asked \nabout a file note[662] which indicated that Eva and Glenys had gone from living with their parents in Brookton to live \nwith Mrs Gethin in Dianella in October 1969. The note indicated that  the parents 'dumped' the girls at the door of ... \nMs Jones. As Ms Jones could not keep the girls any longer emergency care homes had to be found.[663]\n\n474 Don denied any knowledge of this having occurred.[664] Sylvia also denied having left the girls with Ms \nJones.[665] Glenys recollected that she and her sisters were picked up at a roadhouse by Ms Jones and spent a \nnight or two with her.[666] Glenys' recollection is not inconsistent with the documentary evidence that Don and \nSylvia left the girls in Ms Jones' care on this occasion, save as to the place where the girls were left before they \nwere collected by Ms Jones.  \n\n475 For the reasons set out at [69] to [75] I do not accept Don and Sylvia's evidence to the extent that they denied \nhaving left Beverley, Glenys and Eva with Ms Jones on this occasion. That the girls were left with Ms Jones is also \nconsistent with the other documentary evidence, which establishes that on 10 October 1969, Glenys, Beverley and \nEva were driven to Perth by Constable Brennan and Ms Jones.[667] Glenys and Eva were placed in emergency \nfoster care with Mrs Gethin in Dianella, but ran away and were placed in St Joseph's in Subiaco.[668] Glenys \nrecalled that she and Eva went to Mrs Gethin's for one night and then went to St Joseph's.[669] She confirmed that \nshe ran away from Mrs Gethin's home.[670] Glenys' recollection was that she was at St Joseph's for six or seven \nweeks.[671]  \n\n476 Glenys' evidence was that in September or October 1969 she was living at Sister Kate's. She recollected that \nthat was so because she recalled visiting the Perth Royal Show at that time that year and recalled seeing her \nbrother Donald there, which was the last time she saw him before his death. She denied she had the years mixed \n\n\n\nup.[672] I am unable to accept Glenys' evidence that she was living at Sister Kate's in September or October 1969. \nIn so far as her evidence suggested that she went to the Royal Show in October 1969, that recollection was \ninaccurate. It was an agreed fact between the parties that the 1969 Perth Royal Show was held between 18 and 25 \nSeptember 1969. Furthermore, there was not just one document, but several, which indicated that Glenys lived in \nBrookton with her parents during September 1969 and up until 10 October 1969. In my view, the information in \nthose documents as to the dates and places where Glenys was living during this period are more reliable than her \nmemory of the events.  \n477 On 17 December 1969 Glenys went on a holiday placement with Mrs Mathews in Armadale.[673] Glenys \nconfirmed that this had occurred.[674]  \n\n478 From early in January 1970, Glenys was placed with Mrs Price in Gosnells.[675] Glenys also confirmed that \nthis was so. She recollected that Beverley and Eva were living with Mrs Price at the same time.[676]  \n\n479 In February 1970, Glenys was placed at Mofflyn Homes because her former cottage mother from Sister Kate's, \nMrs Cross, with whom she had formed a close attachment, was living there.[677] Glenys confirmed that this had \noccurred.[678]  \n480 In May 1970, Glenys was transferred, at her request, to Sister Kate's, as Mrs Cross was returning there as a \ncottage mother.[679] Glenys accepted that she followed Mrs Cross to Sister Kate's.[680]  \n\n481 On 21 December 1970, Don collected Glenys from Sister Kate's to spend Christmas with her family in \nKondinin.[681] (That Christmas visit is discussed elsewhere in these reasons.) In the course of that visit, Glenys, \nBeverley and Eva (who were also staying in Brookton at the time) ran away and returned to Perth, Glenys then \nstayed with Mrs McIntyre's mother, Mrs Bennell, in Forrestfield.[682]  \n\n482 At the end of January 1971, Glenys returned to Sister Kate's.[683] She ran away on 30 March 1971, and \nfollowing a brief return, ran away again on 12 April 1971.[684] At that point Glenys refused to return to Sister Kate's \nand was placed with her aunt, Mrs Jean Collard (Don's sisterinlaw) who lived in Hilton.[685]  \n\n483 In August 1971, Glenys ran away.[686] Although she returned to the home of Mrs Jean Collard, that placement \nsoon broke down and Glenys ran away again.[687] On 9 September 1971, she was placed in the Child Welfare \nReceiving Home.  \n\n484 On 21 September 1971, Glenys was placed in a group foster home with Mrs Hoare in Wanneroo but within \ndays ran away and refused to return, so she was admitted to the Child Welfare Receiving Home.[688] Glenys was \nplaced in Longmore in November 1971.[689]  \n485 At that point, arrangements were made for Glenys to return to live with her parents in Brookton,[690] but within \na short period she ran away from there also.[691] A Child Welfare Department file note[692] suggested that Glenys \nran away from her parents and went to live with her aunt, Mrs Narkle, in Armadale.  \n486 Don accepted that at the end of 1971, when Glenys was about 12 years old, she returned to live with him and \nSylvia. (Don thought they were living in Kweda, half way between Brookton and Corrigin, at the time.[693]) Don \ncould not recall whether Glenys ran away at that stage.[694]  \n487 Don recalled that he saw Glenys on the odd occasion in a park on Beaufort Street in Perth, with other \nNyoongahs where they congregated.[695]  \n\n488 Glenys agreed that at around this time she ran away from her placements on many occasions, stayed in a park \non some occasions, and was recommitted to the care of the Child Welfare Department on some occasions. She \nagreed she lived with Jean Collard but denied being placed with Don and Sylvia.[696] I do not accept the latter \naspect of Glenys' evidence. Given the number of placements during this period, it is not entirely surprising that \nGlenys did not recall that she had actually been placed with her parents.  \n\n489 In April 1972, for reasons which are not presently relevant, the Children's Court recommitted Glenys to the care \nof the Child Welfare Department until she reached 18 years of age, and she was placed at Longmore, but in June \n1972, Glenys was placed at Nyandi.[697]  \n\n\n\n490 Glenys ran away from Nyandi on 29 January 1973. On 31 January 1973, the Perth Children's Court \nrecommitted Glenys to the care of the Child Welfare Department,[698] and she was returned to Nyandi.[699]  \n491 On 11 April 1973, the Bunbury Children's Court recommitted Glenys to the care of the Department of \nCommunity Welfare for three months.[700] She returned to Nyandi but again ran away and was returned to Nyandi \non 14 June 1973.[701]  \n492 There followed a period of a few months during which Glenys briefly and intermittently lived at Nyandi, or with \nvarious relatives, or with Don and Sylvia. During this period there were a number of incidents when Glenys engaged \nin heavy drinking.[702] A file note on the Child Welfare Department's files indicates that on 13 October 1973, Don \nsigned committal papers[703] authorising Glenys' admission to hospital for treatment for her heavy drinking and she \nwas subsequently treated and admitted.[704]  \n493 On 14 November 1973, 25 January 1974, 1 February 1974, 12 February 1974, 22 April 1974 and 21 May 1974, \nfor reasons which are not presently relevant, the Perth Children's Court recommitted Glenys to the care of the \nDepartment of Community Welfare.[705]  \n\n494 On 5 June 1974 Glenys left Nyandi and was placed with Mrs Jones in Kelmscott.[706]  \n495 From shortly after that time, Glenys lived with her sister Beverley and Kevin Hill, or with Don and Sylvia in \nKondinin.[707] Don denied the suggestion that Glenys moved from Beverley's house to his house in December \n1974, although he suggested that she may have moved there to see him and Sylvia, rather than to stay with \nthem.[708]  \n496 Glenys gave birth to a child in January 1975, by which time she was 16 years of age, and had commenced a \nrelationship with Albert Eades.[709]  \n497 Glenys' period of wardship ended on 15 December 1976.  \nWesley\n\n498 Wesley was eight months old when he was made a ward. He has no memory of his life with his parents before \nthat time, or of being taken from their care. He is unable to recall much about his life at Sister Kate's other than to \nsay that '(l)ife was as it was there', and he thought of Sister Kate's as his home.[710]  \n\n499 Wesley was placed in a foster placement with Mrs Stephenson of Yokine on 24 August 1968.[711] Wesley \nrecollected that he was eight years old at the time,[712] although in fact he was seven years old. He recalled that \nthe placement happened after he, Glenys, Beverley and Eva, and later he and Glenys, had had holiday placements \nwith the Stephensons. Wesley was happy at the Stephensons so he stayed on permanently. He got to know their \nchildren as his brother and sister, and he got on particularly well with their son. Wesley's evidence was that the \nStephensons treated him very well. While living with the Stephensons, he attended primary school, and then Mount \nLawley High School, and completed his schooling to half way through year 9. His evidence was that he enjoyed \nsome aspects of school, although he was not academically talented.[713] He especially enjoyed sport, which he \nwas good at, and for which he received many athletics awards.[714]  \n500 Wesley remembered playing football at an exhibition match at Subiaco Oval one day when he saw his sister \nGlenys in the crowd and she called out to him. He recalls that that brief encounter made him realise that he missed \nhis brothers and sisters.[715]  \n501 Wesley remained with the Stephensons until September 1975, when his relationship with Mr and Mrs \nStephenson broke down.[716] He complained to a welfare officer from the Department of Native Welfare about the \nrelationship break down, and he was transferred to the Mount Lawley Reception Home for a short time.[717] It \nappears that he may have returned, briefly, to the Stephensons' home.[718]  \n502 In October 1975, Don collected Wesley from school and took him home to Kondinin where Don and Sylvia \nwere then living.[719]  \n503 In 2002, Wesley recalled what had occurred for a publication entitled Echoes of the Past:  I started running \naway and sleeping away. It had all been building up. Then my real father came along and I was ready to be off. ... \n[T]here he was at the school with my sister Glenys. Just turned up out of the blue. ... Then he took me back to my \nadopted parent's house. They weren't home. I packed my clothes and away we went and that was it.[720]\n504 Wesley's evidenceinchief was in very similar terms. He said that after they had packed up his clothes from the \nStephensons' home, they went to the 'Welfare Office' in Perth and spoke to his welfare officer, before they drove \nback to Kondinin.[721]  \n\n\n\n505 Don accepted that he collected Wesley from high school on 28 September 1975, and that Glenys was with Don \non that occasion.[722] Glenys also confirmed that she went with Don to collect Wesley from school.[723]  \n506 Welfare officers from the Child Welfare Department then decided that Wesley should be permitted to live with \nhis parents at Kondinin.[724]  \n507 Wesley said that when he returned home to live with his parents they were living in Kondinin, in a duplex there. \nWesley said he left school shortly after he got back to Kondinin, and started working with his father on farms in the \narea.  \n508 From that point until 1978, Wesley lived intermittently with his parents in Kondinin, and in Perth.[725]  \n509 In 1978 or early 1979, when he was 17 year old Wesley commenced a relationship with a woman named \nBrenda and they lived together for a time, initially with Don and Sylvia, and then in Hyden and in Wave Rock.  \n510 Wesley's wardship expired on 12 March 1979 when he reached 18 years of age.[726]  \nEva\n511 Eva was 21 months old when she was made a ward. She lived at Sister Kate's until June 1969.  \n512 On about 11 June 1969, Eva and Glenys were collected from Sister Kate's by Don and Sylvia and taken back \nto Brookton. A file note which was in evidence indicates that officers of the Child Welfare Department allowed Eva \nand Glenys to remain with Don and Sylvia at that stage.[727] Eva's evidence was that she didn't recall leaving \nSister Kate's with Don, but she did recall Beverley coming and telling her 'we're taking you home', and Eva went \nwith her.[728] Eva recollected that Glenys was at home in Brookton at the time, and Beverley too. Eva also \nrecollected going to school in Brookton at the time.[729]  \n513 Beverley recollected that a couple of months after March 1969 she drove to Sister Kate's with her parents, that \nshe went in to collect Glenys, and that she tried to carry Eva out but had to leave her behind.[730] Beverley could \nnot remember Eva coming home in 1969.[731] It is more likely than not that Beverley's recollection of leaving Eva \nbehind is inaccurate. I find that Eva was collected from Sister Kate's by Don and Beverley on 11 June 1969, and \nthat she returned to Brookton with them.  \n\n514 As I have already found, on about 7 October 1969, Eva (together with Glenys and Beverley, who were still \nliving in Brookton with Don and Sylvia at the time) was left with Ms Jones by Don and Sylvia.[732] Sylvia denied \nhaving left the girls with Ms Jones.[733] Eva's evidence was that her parents had not left her with Ms Jones, but \nrather that Beverley and Glenys did so,[734] although Beverley and Glenys were subsequently located in Brookton \nby the Department of Native Welfare. On 10 October 1969, all three girls were driven to Perth by Constable \nBrennan and Ms Jones.[735] Eva and Glenys were placed in emergency foster care with Mrs Gethin in \nDianella.[736] Eva accepted that she and Glenys (and on her recollection, Beverley) were placed with Mrs \nGethin.[737] However, Eva's evidence was that she couldn't recall how she got to Mrs Gethin's house.[738] As I \nhave already found, only Eva and Glenys were placed in an emergency placement with Mrs Gethin, while Beverley \nwas placed with Mrs Piercy.  \n\n515 I do not accept Eva's evidence that it was Beverley and Glenys, and not Don and Sylvia, who left her with Ms \nJones, for two reasons. First, it is not immediately clear how or why Beverley and Glenys would have taken Eva to \nMs Jones, rather than leave her at home with Don and Sylvia, if they wished to run away. Secondly, Eva's \nrecollection of these events was not detailed, and was inaccurate in other respects for example, in relation to how \nshe came to be at Mrs Gethin's house, and in relation to whether Beverley was also placed at Mrs Gethin's house. \nIn addition, Eva was unable to recall how long she stayed with Don and Sylvia, whether she went straight to Mrs \nGethin after living with Don and Sylvia in 1969, or whether she first went to Sister Kate's before being placed with \nMrs Gethin. Eva was unable to recall Mrs Gethin herself, but she did remember her home.[739] Given Eva was only \nnine years old at the time, and the many years that have passed since then, it is not surprising that her recollection \nof these events is not entirely accurate.  \n516 In addition, for the reasons I have already given I do not accept Sylvia's denial that she and Don left the girls \nwith Ms Jones, and I prefer the documentary evidence to the contrary.  \n\n517 Eva and Glenys subsequently ran away from Mrs Gethin's home, and were later placed in St Joseph's in \nSubiaco.[740] Eva confirmed that this had occurred.[741]  \n\n\n\n518 On 15 December 1969, Eva and Beverley were placed in foster care with Mrs Price in Gosnells.[742] Eva \nconfirmed this placement.[743]  \n\n519 On 31 July 1970, Eva was placed in foster care with Mrs Mathews in Armadale.[744] Eva recollected this \nplacement.[745]  \n520 As I have already noted, following their return to Don and Sylvia for Christmas in 1970 (which is discussed \nelsewhere in these reasons), Eva, Beverley and Glenys ran away and returned to Perth, and on 15 January 1971 \nthey went to the home of their cousin, Mrs McIntyre, in Hamilton Hill.[746] Eva confirmed that she went to stay with \nMrs McIntyre around this time, but she was unable to recall how she came to be there.[747] Beverley and Eva \nremained with Mrs McIntyre for the remainder of the school holidays[748] although Eva's recollection was that she \nhad in fact stayed with Mrs McIntyre's mother, Mrs Bennell, in Forrestfield. She then lived with her Uncle Fred and \nAuntie Jean (Don's brother and sister in law).[749]  \n\n521 Eva was returned to Sister Kate's in February 1971.[750] Eva remained at Sister Kate's until September 1974 \nwhen she was placed with her sister Beverley, who by that stage was married.[751] Eva recalled that she began \nliving with Beverley at this time.[752] Eva's evidence was that she then tried to make her way back to her \nparents,[753] and in December 1974 she went to live with Don and Sylvia who were at that time living and working \nin Kondinin.[754]  \n522 Beverley thought that Eva commenced living with her in 1975.[755] The documents in evidence suggest that \nofficers of the Child Welfare Department were unsure of Eva's whereabouts for much of 1975, and the information \nnoted in those documents suggested that the Department's officers received information to suggest that Eva moved \nbetween her parents' home and the home of her sister Beverley during that period.  \n523 Having regard to the documentary evidence, I find that Eva commenced living with Beverley in September \n1974, briefly returned to her parents in December 1974, and for some of the time during 1975 she also lived with \nBeverley.  \n524 Eva's evidence was that she ran away from Beverley's house in 1975. Beverley also confirmed that Eva ran \naway.[756] Eva's evidence was that she didn't know what she was trying to do other than to find her family, and that \nshe was scared because she was 'under the welfare and they could put me here, there'.[757]  \n525 By October 1975, the Child Welfare Department received information that Eva was living in Northam with her \nthen partner, Vernon Lawrence.[758]  \n526 In a statement she later made in support of an application to Redress WA, Eva said that at this time she was \nliving with her husband in the bush.[759] In her evidence, Eva said that she had it in mind that 'if the State caught \nme they could put me somewhere ... so I tried to keep quiet and hide out'.[760]  \n527 A report prepared by an officer of the Child Welfare Department in October 1977 noted that the Department \nhad lost track of Eva for lengthy periods and she eventually was located living in Narembeen, where she had \ncommenced living in a de facto relationship with Mark Jetta.[761]  \n528 Eva gave evidence about where else she had lived between 1974 and 1977 (apart from the placements \norganised by the Child Welfare Department to which I have referred). Eva's evidence was that at various times \nduring this period, she lived with Francis and Fred Little (Bonnie's parentsinlaw) in Pingelly, Mrs Mary Williams, \nBeverley, Vernon Lawrence, May Narkle, at the Ave Maria Hostel, with Don and Sylvia in Kondinin, and with Mark \nJetta (her husband).  \n529 On 29 May 1977 Eva gave birth to her first child.[762] She was then 17 years of age.  \n530 Eva's wardship expired on 1 March 1978 when she reached 18 years of age.  \nSummary: When did the Siblings return to live with Don and Sylvia; and otherwise\n531 As is apparent from the factual outline above, by June 1969 William, Bonnie, Darryl, Beverley, Glenys and Eva \nwere living with Don and Sylvia, with the authority of the Child Welfare Department. Donald had returned to live with \nhis parents, with the authority of the Child Welfare Department, some two years earlier, in 1967. Only Ellen and \nWesley remained in foster care in June 1969. They were living with the Dwyers, and the Stephensons, respectively.  \n532 It was put to Don that by June of 1969, William, Bonnie, Darryl, Beverley, Glenys and Eva were living back with \nhim and Sylvia. His evidence was that 'I honestly can never remember my kids coming back home'.[763]  \n\n533 He was also asked about a file note made by Mr Moulton's file note[764] which indicated that in July 1969, Mr \nMoulton had visited Don and Sylvia on a farm west of Pingelly, and at that time, Bonnie and William were with \n\n\n\nthem, or with Don's parents, and that the other three children were staying with relatives and attending school in \nBrookton. Don's evidence again was that 'I cannot remember my kids being with me'[765] but he later \nacknowledged that 'they may have wandered back there, but I can't recall anything'.[766]  \n\n534 Don was also crossexamined about a file note prepared by Mr Moulton[767] after a visit to Sylvia and Don on \n30 September 1969, at which point he noted that Bonnie, Glenys, Beverley, Darryl and William were living with their \nparents. Again, Don's evidence was that 'they weren't living with me, not to my knowledge.[768]  \n535 For the reasons I have already given I do not accept this aspect of Don's evidence. It was clear from his \nevidence that he was concerned to maintain the position that he had not removed the children without authority \nbecause he would otherwise have been breaking the law. In contrast, Don's evidence was that he remembered \nDarryl working with him when he was over 18,  because I would have been uncomfortable with still being under the \nwards, and as you can see, my record shows that I would have been would have been another conviction.[769]\n\n536 Don also accepted in crossexamination that by late 1969 Bonnie was living with Basil Little on the Pingelly \nReserve.[770] Don was also crossexamined about a file note[771] made by Mr Moulton following a visit to Brookton \non 10 October 1969, in which Mr Moulton indicated that Darryl and William were working in Boyup Brook with Don. \nDon accepted that Darryl and William had been working with him around this time.[772]  \n537 It was put to Don that by September 1975 none of his children were living in state institutions or foster care. He \ndenied any knowledge of this.[773]  \n538 Wesley's evidence was that by the time that he returned home to live with his parents in Kondinin, Glenys, Eva, \nBonnie, Joseph, Philip and Ashley were all living in Kondinin but only Wesley and his brothers actually lived with \nDon and Sylvia. Darryl was also living independently in a home of his own by that stage.  \n539 Having regard to the evidence given by the Siblings and to the documentary evidence, I find that by September \n1975, none of the children were living in institutions or in foster care.  \n540 Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged that his case in relation to the State's alleged breaches of fiduciary \nduties was focused on the period between 1962 and 1970. Accordingly the evidence at the trial, and the findings \nset out below, focused primarily (although not exclusively) on that period.  \n(g) Don and Sylvia's family and living situation between 1962 and 1970  \n541 In this section I deal with the following matters:  \n(i) consideration of Don and Sylvia's living conditions by the Child Welfare Department after the Siblings were \nremoved;  \n(ii) evidence as to Don and Sylvia's living conditions after the Siblings were removed from their care;  \n(iii) evidence as to Don and Sylvia's consumption of alcohol;  \n(iv) evidence of gambling by Don and Sylvia;  \n(v) evidence of domestic violence;  \n(vi) evidence as to Don and Sylvia's care for their other children;  \n(vii) other evidence as to Don and Sylvia's ability to provide for the Children between 1962 and 1970.  \n(i) Consideration of Don and Sylvia's living conditions by the Child Welfare Department after the Siblings were \nremoved\n\n542 There was evidence that officers of the Child Welfare Department and Department of Native Welfare visited \nDon and Sylvia on a number of occasions between 1961 and 1970 and recorded their observations about their \nliving conditions. On a number of these occasions, the officers made recommendations as to whether those living \nconditions were suitable for the return of the Children.  \n543 In approximately August 1962, Mr WrightWebster inspected Don and Sylvia's living arrangements for the \npurposes of advising the Commissioner of Don's suitability for a State Housing Commission house. Mr Wright-\nWebster advised:  An inspection of this applicant's living conditions and standards at the present time leaves much \nto be desired before any consideration could be given in support of a State Housing project.\n\n The applicant lives in a camp constructed of iron and timber with no furniture other than a bed.\n\n The applicant is a seasonal worker with a not very impressive record.\n\n\n\n The applicant and his wife are addicted to liquor.[774]\n544 I note that Mr WrightWebster made a report to the Commissioner in relation to Ellen on 29 May 1959[775] in \nwhich he noted that Don 'and his wife who were both inveterate drinkers have, I believe, turned over a new leaf and \nhave ceased drinking'.  \n\n545 In December 1966, Constable Wall became aware that Donald had returned to Brookton. As I have already \nnoted, Constable Wall recommended to the Child Welfare Department that Donald be permitted to stay with his \nparents over Christmas that year, but noted that Don and Sylvia 'are addicted to drink, and their place of dwelling is \nvery poor indeed'.[776]  \n\n546 On 10 April 1967, Mr Hill prepared a file note of a visit he made to Don on 15 March 1967. He reported that \nDon had told him he had only managed to get a week's work since just prior to Christmas 1966.[777] Mr Hill noted \nthat one of Don's main concerns was housing, which was a 'rather acute' problem, as he 'was living in a rough iron \nhut on the edge of the Native Reserve' at Brookton.[778] (That appears to be a reference to the humpy on Bessie \nNinyette's block.)  \n547 On 7 September 1967, Mr Tilbrook, the Superintendent for the Southern Division of the Department of Native \nWelfare, prepared a file note in which he observed:[779]  There has recently been some marital trouble in this \nfamily when the wife, Sylvia Collard, was severely assaulted by her husband. Separation and maintenance action \nwas contemplated by Mrs Collard and actually commenced but it is now understood that Mrs Collard wishes to \nwithdraw from legal action.\n\n ...\n\n The living accommodation consists of a one roomed wood and iron shack, approximately [12 foot by 12 foot] \nadjacent to the Native Reserve in Brookton.\n\n Due to the living conditions and the marital relations at present it could not be recommended that these children be \nreturned to their parents.[780]\n548 It thus appears that in 1967, Don and Sylvia were still living in the humpy on Bessie Ninyette's block.  \n549 On 11 January 1968, Mr Hill prepared a file note in which he made the following observations:  Whenever he \n[ie Don] can get it, he uses his money to buy liquor, belts up his wife whenever he gets drunk, is frequently out of \nwork, and is not keen on it when some falls into his lap.\n\n Inferior Housing\n\n For quite a long time this man has made a shocking crude shack just outside of the Native Reserve his 'home' and \nhe and his family have used the Dept. of [Native Welfare] showers and toilets.\n\n ...\n\n Ill-treatment of his wife\n\n On the 8168 I saw Mrs Sylvia Rachael Collard in Narrogin. She told me that a few days before her husband had \ngiven her a severe thrashing, and had beaten her up so much that she had spent three days in the Pingelly \nHospital. She stated that this sort of thing had now been going on for 20 years or so, and the time had now come \nwhen she was scared to go back to him, but what was concerning her was that their six children were all in his care \nnow. She stated that she wanted custody and control of them and Maint[enance].\n\n ...\n\n\n\n Visit Neglect\n\n When I went with Miss D. Saggers of the Department of Native Welfare to inspect the home, and see the children \nMiss Saggers had already ascertained that [Don] was away at Boddington ... . A thorough examination was not \nmade as the Father was not present. From what I saw however, I am satisfied that these children are 'Neglected' if \nfor no other reason than the shack they live in. Now that their Mother has left the home, of course it is far worse.\n\n ...Don Collard had the three boys Darryl ... (who had absconded from Sister Kate's at the end of last year), Joseph \n... and Philip ... away with him. The latest baby, Arthur Ashley Collard ... was there in the care of old Mrs Bessie \nNinyette, who is really far too old to have the care of a very young baby. When I arrived the baby was crying in his \npram and in obvious need of his Mother's care. According to Mrs Ninyette, she had fed the child. Whilst it was not \ngood, I did not feel that I should remove the child forthwith.\n\n ...\n\n I ... asked [Bessie] to tell the Father that he must make better arrangements for his children ... .\n\n Later next week I will visit Brookton again with Miss Saggers and will make an application to have these children \n'Declared Neglected' if they are still not being properly cared for.[781]\n\n550 On 19 January 1968, Mrs Hayden of Brookton submitted a 'Return required to be filled in by licensed foster \nmother with particulars of child in her care'.[782] In that document, Mrs Hayden noted that Arthur Ashley Collard \nhad been left in her care by Don on 18 January 1968 because Sylvia 'left her husband about three months [ago]' \nand that the reason given for placing Arthur Ashley with Mrs Hayden was 'Mother has left her children because of \nhusband's ill treatment of her'.[783]  \n\n551 A file note prepared by Mr Hill, on 26 January 1968, noted that Mrs Hayden had visited his office that day and \nadvised him that Sylvia had returned to live with Don, but that they had continued to leave Arthur Ashley in her \ncare.[784]  \n\n552 On 15 February 1968, Mr Hill wrote a memorandum to the Director of Child Welfare in relation to Arthur \nAshley.[785] He advised:  ... Mrs Janet Hayden no longer has the baby in her care, as his Mother has now \nreturned, and some sort of a reconciliation has been effected.\n\n Even although the Mother has returned I feel that these children will not be properly looked after, because the \nparents still continue to live in most unsatisfactory shacks, with little furniture. This coupled with the husband's only \noccasional work, and insatiable thirst, and subsequent illtreatment of and bashing up of his wife, makes the lot of \nthe children that of 'Neglected' children.\n\n Because of this it is my intention to write a letter to Donald Collard, urging him to make every effort to find himself \nsomewhere decent to live in the future.\n\n ...\n\n I will ask my relief Officer to watch this case as closely as possible, and let you know of any deterioration.\n553 On 15 February 1968, Mr Hill also wrote to Don in the following terms:  As you know the Native Welfare \nOfficers and myself were at the point of taking action to have your children brought before the court as 'Neglected \nChildren'. ...\n\n\n\n For years now since I have been in this district, you have allowed your wife and family to live in extremely \nsubstandard shacks, and you still do not appear to have found anywhere decent for them to live in.\n\n Your infrequent employment, and lack of permanent jobs, drinking, and domestic upheavals, are making conditions \nfor your children that cannot be tolerated any longer. It is imperative that you intensify your efforts to make \nconditions satisfactory for your wife and children, or definite action will have to be taken.\n\n This matter is now placed in writing, as I have not been able to catch up with you although I have visited your \nhome several times. Another Officer of this Dept. is shortly taking over, and I sincerely hope that you will improve \nconditions so that Court action will not have to be taken.[786]\n554 A handwritten file note on the bottom of the Department's file copy of that letter appears to have been written \nby Mr Hill to the Director. Mr Hill noted:  For your information.\n\n I doubt whether this man will take any action to improve conditions, but I hope he might try.[787]\n\n555 On 30 September 1969, Mr Moulton visited the Collard family in Brookton. In his report of this visit he noted:  \nhome conditions are deplorable. Parents show no interest at all in children's welfare. Both were rolling drunk at time \nof my visit. Police report both are continually drunk. Recommend placement of Beverley and Glenys in f/homes in \nPerth.[788]\n556 From late August 1970, Don and Sylvia lived in a State Housing Commission house in Kondinin.[789]  \n557 According to a file note prepared by a social worker in the Child Welfare Department on 6 January 1972, Don \nand Sylvia approached the Department in December 1971 about the return of Wesley. They informed the social \nworker that they now had a house in Brookton and had somewhere where the Children could live.[790] Don and \nSylvia's request for the return of Wesley was denied following the receipt of information from the District Officer at \nNarrogin who reported that 'home conditions were not suitable for the return of the children'.[791]  \n558 The documents to which I have referred support three findings. First, Don and Sylvia's living conditions, and \ntheir home environment relevant to the care of their children, were being monitored by officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment in the years after the Siblings were removed from their care. Secondly, the observations made by those \nofficers, or information provided to those officers, was to the effect that until approximately mid1970, Don and Sylvia \ncontinued to live in the humpy in circumstances which were largely unchanged (as compared with when the \nSiblings became wards) that they engaged in heavy drinking and that their relationship was marred by domestic \nviolence. Thirdly, that information was relied upon by officers of the Child Welfare Department in considering \nwhether the Children should be permitted to return to live with Don and Sylvia.  \n559 Don and Sylvia disputed the accuracy of the observations set out in the documents to which I have referred. \nAccordingly, I turn to consider the other evidence in relation to Don and Sylvia's living conditions, and in relation to \ntheir home environment, in order to make findings as to whether the descriptions of Don and Sylvia's living \nconditions in the documents are reliable, and should be accepted as an accurate description.  \n(ii) Evidence as to Don and Sylvia's living conditions after the Siblings were removed from their care\n560 The evidence given by the plaintiffs supports the finding that between 1961 and mid1970, Don and Sylvia \ncontinued to live at the humpy for a substantial period of time each year, and that it was their home. The evidence \nalso supports the finding that the living conditions at the humpy remained largely unchanged during that period. I \nrefer to relevant parts of the evidence below.  \n\n561 Don confirmed that the amount of time he and Sylvia spent at the humpy was the same between 1961 and \n1965.[792] Don was also crossexamined about the observations made by Mr Hill in his file note of 11 January 1968, \nand in responding to those observations, Don continued to deny that the humpy was ever his home.[793] There \nwas no dispute that through this period, Don continued to work on farms doing seasonal work at various times \nduring the year, and would often stay in accommodation on those farms, but for the reasons set out above at [69] to \n[75], and also in view of Don's confirmation that he and Sylvia lived at the humpy for the same amount of time each \nyear between 1961 and 1965, I do not accept Don's denial that the humpy was his home as at January 1968.  \n\n\n\n562 Don's evidence in crossexamination also supports the conclusion that the living conditions at the humpy \nremained, broadly speaking, unchanged between 1961 and 1968. Don accepted that the 'shack' referred to in Mr \nHill's file note of 11 January 1968 was the humpy at Bessie Ninyette's block, and he confirmed that it was the case \nthat he and his family used the Brookton Reserve toilets and showers, and got their water from the Reserve.[794]  \n563 Sylvia's evidence was that the observations made by Mr Hill in his file note of 11 January 1968 were 'for the \nmost part ... completely untrue'.[795]  \n564 Further, Sylvia's evidence about where she and Don lived in the late 1960s was vague. For example, Sylvia's \nevidence was that she couldn't remember where she was living in September 1969.[796] Sylvia was also unable to \nrecall that by that time, Bonnie, Glenys, Beverley, Darryl, William and Eva had all been living with their parents for \nsome months and the younger children had been attending Brookton Primary School, although Sylvia accepted that \nit would have been significant to have some of the Children return to live with her.[797] For the reasons I have \nalready given, I find that Sylvia was deliberately evasive about where she and Don were living.  \n565 The evidence given by some of the Siblings as to when they returned to live with Don and Sylvia also supports \nthe conclusion that Don and Sylvia continued to live at the humpy, and that the living conditions there remained \nlargely unchanged, between 1961 and 1969.  \n566 Darryl's evidence was that when he returned to stay with Don and Sylvia during 1967 and 1968 the conditions \nhad not changed from when the Siblings left. Darryl confirmed that it was the same camp, and there were the same \nnumber of rooms in the humpy.[798]  \n567 Glenys recalled returning to Brookton, and staying with her parents in Brookton for a few weeks at a time, and \notherwise living with her relatives at the camp, including in a humpy with Bessie Ninyette.[799]  \n568 On the other hand, Beverley recollected that when she went home with her parents in 1969 she was living on \nthe Brookton Reserve. She described a tin shed with gaps between the floors and the walls.[800] Eva and Glenys \nalso recollected living for a short time in a 'house' on the Brookton Reserve, which they described as having tin \nwalls and a cement floor.[801] Neither Don nor Sylvia gave evidence that they lived on the Brookton Reserve during \nthis period. Even if Beverley, Glenys and Eva lived on the Brookton Reserve at this time, the other evidence \nsuggests that this must have been for a very short period only.  \n569 I find that Don and Sylvia lived at the humpy, and that it was their home between 1961 and 1970, \nnotwithstanding that they also spent some time living on the farms where they worked during the year.  \n(iii) Evidence as to the information available to the State in relation to Don and Sylvia's consumption of alcohol\n570 The documents to which I referred at [543] to [555] contained numerous reports of officer of the Child Welfare \nDepartment and Department of Native Welfare to the effect that Don and Sylvia consumed alcohol excessively. In \naddition, there was evidence that information was provided to welfare authorities by other persons which suggested \nDon had been engaged in heavy drinking during this period.  \n571 A report dated 31 October 1969 was prepared by Inspector Gray of the Child Welfare Department in relation to \nan application by Mrs Jean Collard for assistance to care for Joseph, Philip and Ashley. (This document is \nconsidered further at [644] below.) In that report, Mr Gray noted that Mrs Jean Collard had advised that Don was \nliving in Brookton, but Sylvia's whereabouts were unknown.[802] Mr Gray also noted that Mrs Collard had \ndiscovered that Joseph, Philip and Ashley were being cared for by their grandmother, and that Mrs Collard had \nremoved the children from the camp. According to Mr Gray:  Mrs Collard advised that prior to removing the children \nfrom this camp, she located their father, who incidentally was in a drunken stupor, and his permission was also \nobtained for the children to be taken into custody by Mrs Collard.[803]\n572 Don was crossexamined in relation to the contents of this document. He confirmed that the boys had been left \nwith Bessie Ninyette.[804] He also confirmed that the three boys were entitled to go and live with Mrs Jean Collard \nand his brother Fred. Although he could not recall how he came to give permission for that to occur, but he denied \nthat Mrs Jean Collard had found him in a drunken stupor.[805] Given that the other aspects of Mrs Jean Collard's \nreport were true, it is difficult to envisage any reason why she would have made a false report about Don's sobriety \nto Inspector Gray.  \n573 There was also evidence that in September 1973, Sylvia made an application for financial relief for herself, \nJoseph, Phillip and Arthur. According to the notes made by the Relief Officer of the grounds for Sylvia's application, \nthose grounds were:  Husband deserted 6.9.73. Applicant states he is an alcoholic and just left to go drinking. He \nmay possibly be located in the Brookton, Hyden area where he normally works.[806]\n\n\n\n574 Some of the Children also gave evidence in relation to their parents' consumption of alcohol. In her evidence, \nEllen recollected that Don came to visit her when she was about 14 years old (that is, in 1971 or 1972), while she \nwas living with Mr and Mrs Dwyer, and she recalled smelling alcohol on his breath.[807]  \n575 In crossexamination, Darryl accepted that he could remember his parents being drunk once or twice, but \notherwise he did not remember them drinking heavily.[808]  \n576 Beverley said that she did not recall her parents ever being 'rolling drunk'[809] and that she had never known \nDon and Sylvia to drink.[810] However, in a statement she provided to the ALS in 1995, Beverley said  [w]e were all \ntogether in the camp on the top reserve at Brookton. There was funny times, there was drinking and fighting, but it \ndidn't seem a reason to be taken away because everyone did the same.[811]\n577 In crossexamination, Beverley sought to qualify this statement, and suggested that she was speaking about \nother families who lived nearby or in the camp.[812] However, it is nevertheless apparent that Beverley was \nreferring to her family (and implicitly Don and Sylvia) engaging in 'drinking and fighting' because the unfairness to \nwhich Beverley referred arose in Beverley's view because only the children from her family were removed when \nother families were also engaging in behaviour of that kind.[813]  \n578 Bonnie also provided a statement to the ALS in 1995, and a copy of that statement was in evidence. Bonnie \naccepted that the signature on the document was hers and that some of the statements in the document were true, \nbut her evidence was that other statements in the document were not true. One of those statements was that:  My \nparents did have a drinking problem. However, my parents have told me that at the time we were removed they did \nnot have a drinking problem. It was only after we were removed that my parents started to drink heavy. It was the \ntrauma and upset of our removal that caused them to start drinking.[814]\n579 In crossexamination, Bonnie said that she did not know that her parents had a drinking problem, that she had \nnever held the view that they did, and that she wasn't around at the time. She said her parents had never spoken to \nher about any drinking problems. When asked whether she had a view that her parents were drinking heavily, she \nanswered 'not really'.[815] Her evidence was that some of the things in the statement were not things that she had \nsaid to the ALS.[816] In the absence of any feasible explanation for why inaccurate statements would be included in \na witness statement provided to the ALS by Bonnie, and which she signed, the likely conclusion is that Bonnie \nsought to minimise evidence which she thought may be damaging to her parents, by denying that she had ever said \nthat she thought they had a drinking problem.  \n580 In addition to this evidence, there was evidence that Don was convicted on 13 occasions between 1955 and \n1973 for offences involving the excessive consumption of alcohol. I have summarised the evidence of those \nconvictions, and the information in relation to them which was in evidence, below.  \n581 On 21 November 1955 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court of the offence of being drunk, after \nbeing arrested by Constable Wall.[817]  \n582 On 16 January 1959, Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court of the offence of drunkenness.[818]  \n583 On 15 February 1963 Don was convicted in the Kulin Police Court of assault.[819] According to the \nApprehension Information prepared by the arresting officer, Constable Jenkins, Don had been drinking with four \nmen in a house at Hyden when a fight broke out between Don and another man, which was stopped by the other \npeople who were present. Later the other man returned to the house and Don  who was standing in the kitchen \nbelieved that he was in danger of being attacked again and he threw an empty beer bottle which struck a wall, \nsmashed and a portion struck [another man] above the left eye ... . Inquiries by police revealed that a considerable \namount of liquor was consumed on this occasion by all parties.[820]\n584 On 17 September 1964, Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court of the offence of being drunk. \nAccording to the Apprehension Information prepared by the arresting officer, Constable Wall, Don was drunk at the \nBrookton Agricultural Show.[821]  \n585 On 26 October 1964, Don was convicted in the Police Court at Kondinin of the offence of being drunk. \nAccording to the Apprehension Information prepared by Constable Daff, Don was 'found in a drunken condition in \nRankin Street, Kondinin. He had been troublesome during the evening and ignored warnings given by Police to go \nhome.'[822]  \n\n586 On 6 January 1968 Don was convicted in the Police Court at York for the offence of drunkenness. The \nApprehension Information prepared by Constable Booth indicated that 'a complaint was received that natives were \nfighting. When the Police visited the scene the accused was found to be drunk.'[823]  \n\n\n\n587 On 12 July 1968, Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court of the offences of drunken driving, \ndangerous driving and driving while unlicensed. According to the Apprehension Information prepared by Traffic \nInspector Smeding, Don 'was seen by the Traffic Inspector driving his motor car, swaying from one side of the road \nto the other, when stopped by the Traffic Inspector it was found that the driver was drunk'.[824]  \n588 On 2 November 1968, Don was convicted in the Wagin Police Court for the offences of drunken driving and \ndriving while under suspension. According to the Apprehension Information prepared by Constable Harper, Don \nwas driving a car in Wagin in an erratic manner, and when stopped was found to be obviously under the influence \nof alcohol.[825]  \n589 On 15 September 1969 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court for the offences of disorderly conduct \ncreating a disturbance and excessive drinking. According to the Apprehension Information prepared by Constable \nBrennan, Don 'was fighting with his wife and yelling and screaming'.[826]  \n590 On 26 December 1970 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court for the offence of being drunk. \nAccording to the Apprehension Information which was prepared by Constable Brennan, on 24 December 1970 Don \nwas found drunk in the street in Lennard Street in Brookton.[827]  \n591 On 28 August 1971 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court for the offence of drunkenness.[828]  \n592 On 30 April 1973 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court for the offence of drunkenness. According to \nthe Apprehension Information prepared by the arresting officer, Senior Constable Fearon, Don was found to be \ndrunk in Robinson Street Brookton.[829]  \n593 On 7 July 1973, Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court for the offence of drunkenness. According to \nthe Apprehension Information prepared by the arresting officer, Sergeant Fearon, Don was observed by the police \nin the street in Brookton 'in a drunken condition and unable to take care of himself'.[830]  \n594 (For completeness, I note that there was also evidence that Don was convicted of a number of other offences \nbetween 1961 and 1973. He was convicted on 3 July 1963 at Brookton, for the offences of disorderly conduct and \nresisting arrest.[831] On 8 January 1964, Don was convicted in the Boddington Police Court for the offence of \nstealing and receiving.[832] On 15 April 1970 Don was convicted in the Brookton Police Court of the offence of \ndriving a motor vehicle while under suspension.[833])  \n595 The tenor of Don's evidence in relation to these offences was that Constable Wall and Constable Brennan \nthrew him in gaol 'many times' for being drunk and disorderly when in fact he was sober.[834]  \n596 There was also evidence that Sylvia had been convicted on three occasions at the Brookton Magistrates Court. \nTwo of these convictions were unrelated to drinking and not presently relevant.[835] However, on 26 December \n1970, Sylvia was convicted of the offence of being drunk. According to the Apprehension Information which was \nprepared by Constable Brennan, on 24 December 1970 Sylvia was found drunk in the street in Lennard Street in \nBrookton.[836] Sylvia denied that she was drunk on this occasion.  \n597 Don's evidence was that he probably drank more after the Children went away, but that he never drank to \nexcess.[837] He also accepted that after the children were taken he may have drunk more, but he said he never \nlost control while he was drinking.[838]  \n598 Sylvia denied that either she or Don had ever been 'addicted to liquor' as indicated by Mr WrightWebster in his \nletter of August 1962.[839]  \n599 Sylvia's evidence was:  I do not say that Don and I never drank. In fact, it is fair to say that Don and I 'gave up' \non some level after all the children were removed and we had drank a little more than we had previously. But to say \nthat we drank heavily is an absolute exaggeration and is untrue. The farmers treated us to beer when a job was \ndone to their satisfaction and as a celebration. You didn't get to drink to excess because you had to get up and \nwork hard from dawn the next day.\n\n To start with, aboriginal people couldn't simply go to the local pub and buy a lot of alcohol. It was not permitted and \nit was in fact illegal to sell alcohol to an aboriginal person. Don was able to buy some alcohol because he was \nclassified as a 'quadroon' but even then he was only ever able to buy 2 bottles of beer. We shared what he bought \nand that was all that was available, one couldn't just go out and buy more.\n\n Also we weren't allowed to drink on the Reserve. Therefore, I do not believe I was drunk on any occasion and I \nhave definitely never been so drunk I couldn't stand up. A lot to drink in those days was two bottles of beer or a \nbottle of wine. And that would be shared between a whole group of aboriginal people.\n\n\n\n I mostly recall drinking or having access to beer at the farms and not at my mother Bessie's house. Sometimes at \nmy mother's house, my sisters would come and they brought beer, they were good shearers, and I would drink \nsome with them, but again that happened very rarely. And my mother didn't like having alcohol at her house \u2013 she \nnever drank. ...\n\n Apart from the fact that we wouldn't be able to buy much alcohol, we never had enough money anyway to buy a lot \nof alcohol. Alcohol was expensive and hard to come by for aboriginal people and we shared whatever we had with \nother aboriginal people. The other aboriginal people asked Don to buy liquor for them because they knew he had \nmoney and could afford to buy it. This was the only time Don ever bought lots of alcohol and it may have given a \nfalse impression that he was buying lots of alcohol for himself when in fact it was for others to share.[840]\n600 Sylvia said she had her last drink on 16 January 1970 just before her son Donald died. She said she recalled \nthe date because that was the last occasion on which she saw Donald, and the last time she had a drink with \nhim.[841] Sylvia also said that Don had had very little alcohol in the past thirty years.[842]  \n601 In relation to Mr WrightWebster's report in 1959, which indicated that Don and Sylvia had been inveterate \ndrinkers, Don's evidence was that Mr WrightWebster was wrong.[843]  \n602 As for Constable Wall's observation, in January 1967, that Don and Sylvia were 'addicted to drink,'[844] Don's \nevidence was that Constable Wall was 'absolutely' wrong in that observation.[845]  \n\n603 Similarly, in relation to Mr Moulton's report about his visit on 30 September 1969, and his observation that \n'both [parents] were rolling drunk at time of my visit',[846] Don denied being drunk on one occasion when Mr \nMoulton visited, although he later said that he could not recall the occasion.[847]  \n\n604 Sylvia was crossexamined about her application for financial assistance in 1973. She specifically that she ever \ntold anyone that Don was an alcoholic or that he had left to go drinking.[848] It is, however, very difficult to envisage \nany reason why the officer concerned would fabricate information and claim that it had been provided by Sylvia. \nAccordingly, I do not accept Sylvia's denial that she made the statement attributed to her. Don was crossexamined \nas to whether it was accurate that he was an alcoholic at this time, and his response was 'not really, no'.[849]  \n\n605 Don was asked about Ellen's evidence. He denied that he had visited Ellen at all when she was around 14 \nyears of age,[850] and he denied ever having visited Ellen at the Dwyer's home when he was drunk.[851]  \n606 When crossexamined about the offences of which he had been convicted, which were associated with drinking, \nDon accepted in relation to at least some of them that drinking, or a large amount of drinking, had been \ninvolved.[852] However, in respect of his conviction on 26 October 1964, Don denied that he had been drunk. His \nevidence was that he had been with other people who were drunk, yet he was the one arrested.[853] In respect of \nhis conviction on 2 November 1968, Don admitted that he had 'had a drink' but claimed that he had passed a \nsobriety test administered by the arresting officer.[854] And in respect of his conviction on 26 December 1970 for \nbeing drunk in the street, Don's evidence was that neither he nor Sylvia were drunk and that they had not been \nconsuming beer.[855]  \n\n607 It is not necessary for present purposes to make a finding as to whether Don and Sylvia drank alcohol \nexcessively, or were drunk on any, or how many, occasions during the period between 1961 and 1970.  \n\n608 For present purposes it seems to me that the question is whether the State had or received information that \nDon and Sylvia drank excessively, or were drunk, and whether the source or nature of that information was such as \nto raise any question about its reliability so that it should not be taken into account by the State's officers in any \ndecisions which were made in relation to the care of the children.  \n\n609 The evidence to which I have referred clearly establishes that the State received information from a variety of \nsources, and on numerous occasions, between 1961 and 1970 which indicated that Don in particular, and less \nfrequently, Sylvia, had engaged in excessive drinking or was drunk.  \n\n610 That information came to the State from numerous sources \u2013 from officers of the Child Welfare Department and \nthe Department of Native Welfare, from police officers and from Don and Sylvia's convictions for alcoholrelated \n\n\n\noffences, from Don's sisterinlaw Mrs Jean Collard, and from a report made by Sylvia herself in support of an \napplication for financial relief.  \n\n611 The fact that this information came from numerous sources supports the conclusion that the State (through its \nofficers) was entitled to treat the information as reliable. Although Don and Sylvia clearly held the view that they had \nbeen victimised by certain individuals \u2013 especially Constable Wall \u2013 many other persons had recorded observations \nthat Don and Sylvia had been drinking excessively. (By way of example, eight different arresting officers from six \ndifferent towns arrested Don for drinkingrelated offences during this period.) I do not accept that there is any basis \nfor concluding that the information received by the State should have been, or should now be viewed, as unreliable.  \n\n(iv) Evidence of gambling by Don and Sylvia\n\n612 In a letter from the Commissioner to the District Officer at Narrogin dated 12 November 1959, the \nCommissioner noted that Ms Jones had advised that Sylvia was 'gambling heavily'.[856] That information was relied \nupon as a reason for the Commissioner's determination that Ellen's return to her family should be deferred while her \nfamily situation was further evaluated. I have dealt further with this issue below.  \n\n613 There was no evidence to substantiate the report made by Mrs Jones or otherwise to support the conclusion \nthat Sylvia was 'gambling heavily', either in 1959, or at any stage until 1970.  \n\n614 Furthermore, both Sylvia and Don denied that Sylvia had ever gambled heavily. Sylvia's evidence was that she \nplayed cards with other aboriginal people on the Reserve, and that she and Don, and other members of their \nfamilies, went to the horse races a few times a year, and would place some small wagers.[857] (This was hardly \nsurprising. Sylvia's family had been involved in the horse racing industry and her father trained and raced \nracehorses and was a jockey.[858]) In addition, Sylvia recalled that once or twice she went to the betting shop in \nBrookton to place some modest bets for Don.  \n\n615 Beverley said that she had seen her parents playing cards, but not for money (or for much money) and that \nthey did not go to the horse races very often.[859]  \n\n616 Bonnie's evidence was that she had never been in a betting shop and hadn't been to a betting shop with Don \nand Sylvia.[860]  \n\n617 Eva recalled that her parents would go to the TAB in Narembeen 'a lot', and she went with them on two \noccasions.[861] However, this appears to have been when Eva was in her midteens, and thus in around 1975 or \n1976, and this evidence thus does not support the conclusion that Sylvia was gambling heavily at all, or at any \nrelevant time prior to 1970.  \n\n618 Again, it is not necessary to make a finding as to whether Sylvia was gambling, or 'gambling heavily' at any \nstage between 1959 and 1970. It suffices to find that the information available to the State came from one source, \non one occasion, and as I explain further below at [959] it was not subsequently substantiated. Those \nconsiderations support the conclusion that the report received in 1959 as to Sylvia's gambling should have been \nviewed as potentially unreliable.  \n\n(v) Evidence of domestic violence\n\n619 The file notes prepared by Mr Tilbrook and Mr Hill in 1967 and 1968, to which I referred in [547] to [552] above, \nindicate that those officers had received information including from Sylvia herself that Don had physically assaulted \nher, and that Sylvia had left Don and commenced separation and maintenance action in 1967.  \n\n620 Don was crossexamined about the contents of these file notes. He admitted that he had physically assaulted \nSylvia during the course of their marriage,[862] and that he 'did not have to be drunk' to physically assault \nher.[863]Don admitted to having assaulted Sylvia on 8 to 10 occasions, and accepted that he had probably caused \nbruising, may have caused cuts or broken her skin, but that he didn't think he had caused any broken bones.[864]  \n\n621 Sylvia also gave evidence that Don had assaulted her. However, her evidence was that Don had hit her 'a few \ntimes, but never very badly, definitely not so badly as to put me in hospital'.[865] She said that after the Children \nwere removed from their care, they 'had more rows than we ever had before. Around that time Don hit me one or \ntwo times. Once he blackened my eye when he hit me.'[866]  \n\n622 Sylvia was crossexamined about the information in Mr Tilbrook's file note dated September 1967. Her evidence \nwas that she didn't remember Mr Tilbrook. However, while Sylvia admitted that she and Don would fight, she sought \n\n\n\nto blame herself for those fights, and to minimise Don's culpability for them. She said that she had hit Don, and said \nthat the arguments sometimes involved Don hitting her 'a scratch and a crack and squabble' . She said that Don \n'might have' slapped her to stop her from fighting him, but that it didn't involve hitting her hard.[867]  \n\n623 Sylvia was crossexamined about Mr Hill's file note of 11 January 1968, and to Mr Hill's note that Sylvia had told \nhim that Don had given her a 'severe thrashing' which resulted in her ending up in hospital. Sylvia's evidence was \nthat she did not recall speaking with Mr Hill in Narrogin, or with any native welfare officer in Narrogin, and denied \nhaving told him that Don had given her a 'severe thrashing'.[868] She denied having told any welfare officer that \nDon had beaten her up so much she had ended up in Pingelly hospital.[869] However, Sylvia did admit that she told \nMr Hill that she was too scared to go back to Don. It appears that she did so because she wanted a home and \nsomewhere to live,[870] and thought that if she reported abuse by Don, welfare authorities would find her a \nhome.[871] Also in evidence was an application for Legal Aid dated 30 May 1968, which appeared to bear Sylvia's \nsignature. The application was made in Sylvia's name and sought legal aid for proceedings for separation and \nmaintenance for Sylvia and her three children on the grounds of Don's cruelty towards her (the Legal Aid \napplication). The Legal Aid application was accompanied by a document entitled 'Basic Information for Investigating \nProposed Actions' and which is marked 'To be used in conjunction with Legal Aid application form' (the \naccompanying form). The accompanying form noted that Sylvia left Don on 27 May 1968 after he physically \nassaulted her and threatened to kill her.  \n\n624 In her evidenceinchief, Sylvia said that she did not recall filling in any Legal Aid application forms but agreed \nthat she did make an application for legal aid. Her explanation for that application was as follows:[872]  The only \nreason that I ever signed the forms that were given to me by Legal Aid was because I thought that was what I had \nto do to get a house. None of the handwriting on the forms is mine except for the signatures. Therefore, I did not fill \nout any of the information on the forms, the Legal Aid officer did. I just signed the forms because they told me that \nwould help me get a house and I believed that that was all that the forms were for. I did not read what was in the \nforms before I signed them.\n\n ...\n\n It looks like my plea for help turned into Legal Aid saying that I wanted to leave Don but this was never the case. I \ndo not remember travelling to Perth after a fight with Don at any time or asking anyone to try to leave Don or to file \na Violence Restraining Order against him. If I had gotten a house, I would have made sure Don was living in it with \nme.\n\n625 In crossexamination, Sylvia was very evasive in her answers to questions about the Legal Aid application, \nrefusing to accept that the signature on the document was hers, notwithstanding that she accepted the accuracy of \nmany details in the document in relation to her family.[873] However, she did eventually accept that she had asked \nfor help from Legal Aid, although she said didn't remember signing a form for that purpose.[874]  \n\n626 Don was also crossexamined about legal aid applications made by Sylvia in May 1968. Don denied any \nrecollection that he had assaulted Sylvia, or threatened to kill her, at that time.[875]  \n\n627 Having regard to the nature of the documents, to Sylvia's signature on the document, to Don and Sylvia's \nevidence as to the domestic violence in their relationship, I find that the Legal Aid application was prepared at \nSylvia's request, and that the information contained in the Legal Aid application and in the accompanying form was \nprovided by Sylvia. It is extremely unlikely that an officer working for Legal Aid would have fabricated the grounds of \nSylvia's application.  \n\n628 Other documents in evidence indicate that Sylvia was undecided about whether to pursue legal action against \nDon.[876] Ultimately, it appears that Sylvia did not pursue legal proceedings.[877]  \n\n629 Having regard to the number and sources of these reports and to Don's acceptance that on at least eight to ten \noccasions throughout their marriage, including during 1967 and 1968, he physically assaulted Sylvia, leaving her \nwith not insignificant physical injuries, there is no basis on which the State should have considered the information \nthe State received during this period as to domestic violence in Don and Sylvia's relationship to be unreliable.  \n\n\n\n630 Some of the other documentary evidence indicated that the State received information that Sylvia left Don for a \nperiod of time in approximately September or October 1967, or January 1968, as a result of domestic violence. \nSylvia was asked whether she had commenced any action to separate from Don in September 1967 (as Mr \nTilbrook had indicated). Sylvia implicitly appeared to accept that she had commenced such action. In her answer \nshe offered a reason for why she had done so: she said that she had been told that if she was not with Don that she \ncould live on the Brookton Reserve.[878]  \n\n631 Information contained in a document entitled 'Return required to be filled in by licensed foster mother with \nparticulars of child in her care' which was completed by Mrs Hayden of Brookton on 19 January 1968,[879] also \nsupports a finding that Sylvia left Don in about September 1967. In that document, Mrs Hayden stated that Arthur \nAshley Collard had been left in her care by Don on 18 January 1968 because Sylvia 'left her husband about three \nmonths [ago]' and that the reason given for placing Arthur Ashley with Mrs Hayden was 'Mother has left her \nchildren because of husband's ill treatment of her'. A file note prepared by Mr Hill, on 26 January 1968, indicated \nthat Mrs Hayden had visited his office that day and advised him that Sylvia had returned to live with Don, although \nthey had continued to leave Arthur Ashley in her care.[880]  \n\n632 Don was crossexamined about the Return submitted by Mrs Hayden. He denied emphatically the report that \nSylvia had left him about three months prior to the date of the report.[881] As for the suggestion in that report that \nSylvia left because of his ill treatment of her, Don's evidence was that 'Sylvia went for two to three weeks ... . It \nhappened quite often when we had a bit of an argument or going through our traumatic conditions that were placed \nupon us, but here it's all false.'[882] He denied that anything that could have been called cruelty was going on at \nthat time.[883]  \n\n633 Don was also crossexamined as to whether Sylvia left him for a period in around January 1968. He accepted \nthat Sylvia left him for two or three weeks, that he had the care of Joseph, Philip and Ashley at that time, and that \nhe left them in the care of Bessie Ninyette while he worked.[884] Sylvia's evidence, on the other hand, was that she \nnever left Don with the three youngest boys.[885]  \n\n634 On 24 October 1969, Mrs Jean Collard made an application for assistance for the care of Joseph, Philip and \nAshley as foster children in her care. The reason given for why the children had been left in her care was that the \n'children were left with their father who is unable to look after them' and Sylvia's address was said to be \n'unknown'.[886] Sylvia denied that this was correct.[887] She said that she and Don hadn't really separated at \naround this time.[888]  \n\n635 There was some documentary evidence which indicated that the State received information that Don deserted \nSylvia in September 1973, namely Sylvia's application for financial relief in September 1973, to which I referred at \n[573].  \n\n636 In crossexamination, Don accepted that he had left Sylvia around this time to go and work in Hyden. He \nconfirmed that Sylvia was living in Kelmscott with her sister at that time.[889]  \n\n637 Having regard to the fact that reports of Don and Sylvia's separations came from third parties, and having \nregard to Don's evidence at the trial, I am not persuaded that there was any basis on which the State's officers \nshould have regarded the information the State received as to Don and Sylvia's separations in 1967, 1968, 1969 \nand 1973 as unreliable.  \n\n(vi) Evidence as to Don and Sylvia's care for their other children\n\n638 Don and Sylvia's three youngest surviving children, Joseph, Philip and Ashley were born in 1963, 1966 and \n1967 respectively. There was evidence that in the period between early 1968 through to 1970, the State received \ninformation to suggest that Don and Sylvia had experienced some difficulty in providing care for these children.  \n\n639 As I have already mentioned, Mrs Janet Hayden submitted a 'Return required to be filled in by licensed foster \nmother with particulars of child in her care' dated 18 January 1968. In that form, Mrs Hayden indicated that Don \ndelivered Ashley into her care because 'Mother has left her children because of husband's illtreatment of \nher'.[890](A file note made at this time by Mr Hill indicated that he understood that Don had taken Joseph and Philip \nwith him to Hyden where he and Darryl were then working.[891])  \n\n\n\n640 In a file note dated 26 January 1968 Mr Hill noted that Mrs Hayden had called at his office to advise that Sylvia \nhad returned to live with Don, but that they had left Ashley in her care.[892]  \n\n641 On 15 February 1968, Mr Hill wrote a memorandum to the Director in relation to Arthur Ashley.[893] He \nadvised:  ... Mrs Janet Hayden no longer has the baby in her care, as his Mother has now returned, and some sort \nof a reconciliation has been effected.\n\n Even although the Mother has returned I feel that these children will not be properly looked after, because the \nparents still continue to live in most unsatisfactory shacks, with little furniture. This coupled with the husband's only \noccasional work, and insatiable thirst, and subsequent illtreatment of and bashing up of his wife, makes the lot of \nthe children that of 'Neglected' children.\n\n Because of this it is my intention to write a letter to Donald Collard, urging him to make every effort to find himself \nsomewhere decent to live in the future.\n\n ...\n\n I will ask my relief Officer to watch this case as closely as possible, and let you know of any deterioration.\n\n642 Sylvia denied ever having left Ashley in Mrs Hayden's care (although she did accept that Mrs Hayden may \nhave been a relative of Don's).[894] Don also denied that Ashley had been in Mrs Hayden's care.[895]  \n\n643 On 24 October 1969, Mrs Jean Collard (Don's sister in law) made an application for assistance for the care of \nJoseph, Philip and Ashley as foster children in her care. The reason given for why the children had been left in her \ncare was that the 'children were left with their father who is unable to look after them' and Sylvia's address was said \nto be 'unknown'.[896]  \n\n644 A report by Inspector Gray dated 31 October 1969 (to which I have already referred) indicated that Mrs Jean \nCollard had advised that 'the father of the children is residing in Brookton, with the whereabouts of the mother being \nunknown'.[897] Inspector Gray also noted that Mrs Collard  advised that she was appalled by the condition and \nappearance of the three children, who were apparently being cared for by their grandmother, and as a \nconsequence she approached the Native Missionary in Brookton, namely, Ms Jones, who later telephoned this \nDepartment's district officers at Narrogin, where permission was granted for Mrs Collard to take the children to the \nMetropolitan area.[898]\n\n645 As I have already noted, in crossexamination, Don confirmed that the boys had been left with Bessie \nNinyette.[899] He also accepted that the three youngest children had been cared for by his sisterinlaw, Mrs Jean \nCollard, in October 1969 when Sylvia left him,[900] and that this was done with his permission, although he could \nnot recall when or how he came to give permission for that to occur.[901]  \n\n646 Sylvia accepted that the three youngest children had been left with Mrs Jean Collard, but not in October \n1969.[902] She did, however, accept that the boys stayed with her for a couple of years.[903] Having regard to the \nother evidence, it is more likely than not that Sylvia's memory of the dates when the boys lived with Mrs Jean \nCollard is inaccurate.  \n\n647 Joseph, Philip and Ashley remained with Mrs Jean Collard until approximately October 1975 when they \nreturned to their parents who were at that stage living at Kondinin.[904]  \n\n648 Having regard to the fact that information as to the care of Joseph, Philip and Ashley was provided by third \nparties, and having regard to Don and Sylvia's evidence, there is no basis on which it can be said that the State's \nofficers should have regarded the information received in relation to the care of the boys as potentially unreliable.  \n\n(vii) Other evidence as to Don and Sylvia's ability to provide for the Children between 1962 and 1969\n\n649 There was some evidence as to Don's employment and income during the period between 1961 and 1970. \nDon's evidence was that from the late 1950s through to the mid1960s (and, for some years after that[905]), he did \nseasonal labouring and farming work in regional Western Australia. From around July to midOctober each year he \n\n\n\nwould shear in the Brookton, Beverley and Pingelly area. From midOctober he would move to Boyup Brook for \nabout six weeks for shearing work. Then from December to March, Don would clear land around Corrigin, Hyden, \nNarembeen and Kondinin. In the autumn, he would pick mallee root and work on farms around Brookton, Beverley \nand Pingelly crutching sheep, and then would return to shearing by July.[906]  \n\n650 The documentary evidence to which I have already referred (including Mr Hill's file note of 11 January 1968) \nindicated the State received information that Don was out of work at times, and even frequently. His evidence, on \nthe other hand, was that that he loved working, that he had worked 'just about every day of his life', and that he \ncould only remember being out of work for about three or four months in his life.[907] Sylvia's evidence was that Mr \nHill's statement that Don was frequently out of work was not accurate. Her evidence was that Don was never out of \nwork.[908]  \n\n651 Information the State received that Don was out of work was not inherently unlikely or unreliable in view of the \nfact that Don casually was employed on farming properties at various times throughout the year.  \n\n652 As for his income, Don's evidence was that he earned about $80 $90 dollars per week when he was \nshearing,[909] and that for the remainder of the year he earned about $50 per week.[910] However, he accepted \nthat this recollection could not have pertained to the 1960s (prior to the introduction of decimal currency).[911] He \naccepted, however, that when he was shearing he was earning 'reasonable money'.[912] Sylvia's evidence was \nthat Don was paid a 'good price' for shearing although she did not know how much he was paid.[913]  \n\n653 As for their expenses, as there was no water or electricity at the humpy, Don and Sylvia did not have expenses \nof that kind. Sylvia said that she and Don helped to pay for the rates on Bessie Ninyette's block, but other family \nmembers who lived on the block also contributed to paying the rates.[914] Both Don and Sylvia said they spent \nmoney on food and clothing,[915] although as I have already observed, and as Sylvia herself accepted, they \nobtained some of their food without charge from the farms where Don worked.[916]  \n\n654 The import of Don and Sylvia's evidence suggests that Don earned 'good money' when he was working, that he \nworked consistently throughout the year, and they had minimal expenses other than food and clothing, yet in the \nperiod from 1958 until 1970, they lived in extremely impoverished conditions at the humpy, or stayed in \naccommodation provided for them at the farms where they were working. It was put to Don that his income was \nspent on alcohol, but he denied that that was so.[917] An alternative explanation is that Don was out of work for \nlonger periods each year than he was willing to admit in his evidence. Another possibility is that Don and Sylvia \nshared their income with other family members. However, there was insufficient evidence to make a finding about \nthe cause of the family's impoverishment.  \n\n(h) The events of Christmas 1970  \n\n655 One series of events which featured prominently in the evidence were those which occurred when Beverley, \nGlenys and Eva were permitted to spend Christmas with Don and Sylvia in 1970.  \n\n656 At the outset, I note that there was a dispute on the evidence as to when these events occurred. For the \nreasons set out below, I find that the events in question occurred in December 1970 through to January 1971.  \n\n657 At Don and Sylvia's request, officers of the Child Welfare Department agreed that Beverley, Glenys and Eva \ncould spend the Christmas period of 1970 with them. At that stage, Don and Sylvia were renting a State Housing \nCommission house at 9 Rankin Street in Kondinin.[918]  \n\n658 In evidence was a letter dated November 1970 from the Victoria Park Division of the Child Welfare Department \nto District Officer White in Katanning.[919] In that letter, District Officer White was asked to visit Don and Sylvia to \nascertain whether it would be possible for the Siblings to spend Christmas at home.  \n\n659 A file note indicated that following an inspection of their home, the District Officer from Katanning, Mr White, \nrecommended that Beverley, Glenys and Eva be allowed to spend the holidays with their parents.[920] Don said \nthat he had not been visited at the Kondinin House by a welfare officer at around that time.[921] Given that Don \nworked away from home for periods throughout the year, it is entirely possible that he was not home when the \ninspection occurred. I accept that District Officer White visited Don and Sylvia's home in Kondinin in November or \nDecember 1970 for the purpose of determining whether to recommend that the girls be permitted to go home for \nChristmas.  \n\n\n\n660 The visit was approved, and Don and Sylvia were advised of the approved arrangements in a letter from Ms \nHobcroft.[922] The arrangements were that Beverley, Glenys and Eva would be collected by their parents on 21 \nDecember 1970, and that at the end of January 1971 Beverley and Eva would return to live with Mrs Mathews, and \nGlenys would return to live at Sister Kate's.[923]  \n\n661 Sylvia's evidence was that she and Don, through Mrs Jones, arranged for the girls to come home for \nChristmas. She said that she had not received any letter from Mrs Hobcroft indicating that Glenys, Beverley and \nEva could spend Christmas with them.[924] It is more likely than not that a letter approving the arrangements was \nsent.  \n\n662 There was evidence that Don collected Beverley and Eva from Mrs Matthews' house[925] and Glenys from \nSister Kate's.[926] Don was unable to recall collecting Beverley, Eva and Glenys and taking them from Perth to \nKondinin on 21 December 1970,[927] but I find that he did so. That conclusion is supported by the documentary \nevidence, and there is no other alternative explanation open on the evidence as to how the girls were collected \nfrom Mrs Matthews' house and Sister Kate's.  \n\n663 There was no dispute that the family were staying at a house owned by a family member in \nBrookton.[928]There was also no dispute that Don, Sylvia and the girls ended up in Brookton some time before 24 \nDecember 1970. However, the evidence given by Don and Sylvia as to how and when the girls arrived in Brookton \nwas inconsistent. Initially Don said that he and Sylvia took the girls to the Brookton Reserve at Brookton, but he \nlater said that he couldn't recall whether he had taken the girls to Brookton.[929] Earlier in crossexamination he said \nthat the girls weren't with them by the morning of Christmas Eve but were coming by then.[930] Sylvia's evidence, \non the other hand, was that on the morning of Christmas Eve, the Siblings were at the house with other family \nmembers getting ready for Christmas.[931] I find that Don and Sylvia took Beverley, Glenys and Eva to Brookton \nsome time between 21 and 24 December 1970. There is no other alternative explanation open on the evidence as \nto how the girls reached Brookton.  \n\n664 Although Beverley, Glenys and Eva were to have stayed in Brookton until the end of January 1971, a file note \nwhich was in evidence indicated that they had returned to Perth by 18 January 1971. On 18 January 1971, a \nDepartmental welfare officer was contacted by Mrs McIntyre of Hamilton Hill who advised that Beverley and Eva \nwere then staying with her.[932] The officer visited Mrs McIntyre and made the following file note as a result of that \nvisit:  It appears Eva, Beverley and Glenys were not taken to Kondinin by parents, but instead to Brookton Native \nReserve where they drank and brawled until 15.1.71 when girls decided to run away to Perth. Went to Mrs \nMcIntyre.\n\n665 I infer that that the information was given to the Departmental welfare officer either by Beverley and Eva \nthemselves, or by Mrs McIntyre who had received that information from the girls.  \n\n666 Don's evidence was that he did not recall the matters set out in this file note, and that he thought it was \nwrong.[933] Sylvia denied any knowledge of her and Don drinking and fighting or that the three girls ran away on \nabout 15 January 1971.[934]  \n\n667 As I have already noted, in evidence were copies of court records from the Brookton Police Court which \nindicate that on 26 December 1970, both Don and Sylvia were convicted for the offence of being drunk. According \nto the Apprehension Information which was prepared by Senior Constable Brennan in respect of each charge, on \n24 December 1970 Don and Sylvia were found drunk in the street in Lennard Street in Brookton.[935]  \n\n668 Don and Sylvia each gave evidence that on the morning of 24 December they walked into Brookton to collect \nsome bread from the bakery for Christmas.[936] Don's evidence was that they had just arrived outside the bakery \nwhen Constable Brennan and his wife drove up in a police car and arrested them for being drunk and disorderly or \ncreating a disturbance. Don said that they had not had any alcohol to drink, they were not drunk, and they were not \ncreating any disturbance. Don's evidence was that someone had telephoned the police and told them that two \naboriginal people had been arguing on the street, and that by the time Constable Brennan arrived, only Don and \nSylvia were in the street and they were arrested instead.  \n\n\n\n669 Don's evidence was that he and Sylvia were taken to the Brookton police station where they were kept in \ncustody for three nights, including Christmas day. However, when he was shown the record of his conviction he \naccepted that he was in custody for two nights instead.  \n\n670 Don accepted that when the charge was brought before the Court on 26 December 1970 he pleaded guilty. His \nevidence was that although he had not been drunk he wanted to get out of gaol as soon as possible to get home to \nhis children.  \n\n671 However, his evidence was that when they arrived home, the children weren't there. Initially Don denied any \npossibility that the children remained with them until midJanuary 1971. Later, he accepted that they 'might have \ndone', and then he said he couldn't give an answer as to whether the children were with them until midJanuary \n1971.  \n\n672 Sylvia's evidence was that as she and Don walked along the street towards the bakery, a group of people ran \npast them, and she thought there may have been a fight going on at the pub.[937] She said that Constable Brennan \nand his wife then pulled up in a car and arrested her and Don. Sylvia said that she and Don had not been drinking \nand were not drunk. Sylvia's evidence was that she and Don were taken back to the police station and kept locked \nup for four days.[938] She said that they were charged with drunk and disorderly conduct.[939]  \n\n673 Sylvia's evidence was that when the charge was heard in court, she initially pleaded not guilty, but was told that \nthe matter would be stood down for 8 days without bail.[940] At that point, she changed her plea to guilty.[941]  \n\n674 Sylvia's evidence was that by the time she got home, the children had gone.[942] She said her mother told her \nthat 'welfare went there and took them, picked them up'.[943]  \n\n675 Don and Sylvia's recollections of the events of Christmas 1970 were vague, or obviously inaccurate, in a \nnumber of respects. By way of example, Don and Sylvia both gave evidence that the visit took place over \nChristmas 1969. However, in crossexamination, Don accepted that he could have been wrong in relation to the \ndate. The overwhelming body of the evidence, including the evidence as to Don and Sylvia's arrest and conviction, \nsupports the conclusion that the events set out above occurred during December 1970 and into January 1971. (For \ncompleteness, I note that Glenys recalled having gone home to Brookton with Beverley and Eva to stay with their \nparents for Christmas, and she agreed that she and her sisters stayed with their parents until the girls ran away to \nMrs Bennell and Mrs McIntyre. However, Glenys did not agree that these events occurred in December 1970 to \nJanuary.[944] To the extent that Glenys disputed that these events occurred in December 1970 to January 1971, I \nam unable to accept her evidence, and prefer the documentary evidence instead.)  \n\n676 Further, Don and Sylvia each gave evidence that they were allowed to have Donald, Darryl, William and Bonnie \nhome for this Christmas, as well as Beverley, Glenys and Eva.[945] However, as I have noted above, by December \n1970, Donald had died, Darryl and William had been living at home with their parents for some time, and Bonnie \nhad been living in Pingelly with Basil Little and his family for some time. In those circumstances, it is not surprising \nthat there was no documentary evidence to suggest that the Child Welfare Department permitted any of the \nSiblings other than Beverley, Glenys and Eva to return home.  \n\n677 In addition, both Don and Sylvia recollected that they had spent more time in custody after being arrested than \nwas in fact the case.  \n\n678 Sylvia also recollected that she was fined 10 pounds for this offence, and she confirmed that evidence in \ncrossexamination. Yet this cannot have been the case, given that decimal currency commenced in Australia in \n1966. The court records in evidence suggested that Sylvia was in fact fined $5 for the offence.  \n\n679 There remained two matters on which there was a difference between Don and Sylvia's recollection of the \nevents of Christmas 1970, and the contents of the documents in relation to these events. The first concerns \nwhether Don and Sylvia had been drinking at the time of their arrest. Again, I do not think it is necessary for present \npurposes to make a finding as to whether they had been. It suffices to say that given Don and Sylvia's guilty pleas, \nand their conviction for being drunk, constituted reliable information that Don and Sylvia were drunk on this \noccasion.  \n\n680 The second issue on which Don and Sylvia's evidence was inconsistent with the documents concerned \nwhether Beverley, Glenys and Eva were still in Brookton when their parents were released from custody. Having \n\n\n\nregard to Glenys' evidence that the girls ran away to Mrs Bennell and Mrs McIntyre, which corresponds with the \ninformation given to the welfare officer who visited Mrs McIntyre on 18 January 1971, I have concluded that it is \nmore likely than not that Beverley, Glenys and Eva were still in Brookton when Don and Sylvia were released from \ncustody.  \n\n(i) Don and Sylvia's care for other children  \n\n681 There was evidence that Don and Sylvia have looked after children, apart from their own, with the approval of \nthe Child Welfare Department.  \n\n682 For a brief period in around October 1972 Don's 15yearold nephew lived with them.[946] In addition, Don said \nthat he and Sylvia had fostered another child in the period 1975 to 1977. There was no documentary evidence \nsuggesting that these were formal fostering placements arranged by the Child Welfare Department, and Don \nacknowledged that he had no documents in relation to these arrangements, and that he and Sylvia hadn't received \nany subsidy for providing this care.[947] I find that these were informal arrangements, most likely arranged between \nfamily or friends.  \n\n683 In August 1977, however, Mr Moulton reported that Don and Sylvia had been looking after Bonnie's three \nchildren for the previous 12 months. He reported that 'the grandparents are sincere and genuine in their desire to \ncare for the children, which they are doing ... in a very satisfactory manner'.[948] As a consequence, Don and \nSylvia were paid private foster rates by the Department of Community Welfare for the care of these children.[949]  \n\n684 There is also evidence that Don and Sylvia cared for another child from late 1978 through till the end of 1979, \nand received a Departmental subsidy for that foster placement.[950]  \n\n685 Sylvia accepted that she and Don began fostering children on or after 1977.[951] Don accepted that by this \ntime, all of his children other than Wesley were older than 18 years of age.[952]  \n\n686 I find that Don and Sylvia fostered children, in formal placements arranged by the Child Welfare Department, \non or after 1977. By that time, all of the Children, with the exception of Wesley, were older than 18 years of age, \nand by that time, Wesley had returned to live with Don and Sylvia, with the permission of the Child Welfare \nDepartment.  \n\n(j) Aspects of the Children's experiences during their wardships, including supervision of the Children by the Child \nWelfare Department  \n\n687 There was evidence about the Children's experiences while they were wards. I have dealt with some aspects of \nthose experiences below. In this part of my reasons, however, I deal with three matters. First, I make some general \nobservations about the evidence of the Children's experiences. Secondly, I address evidence about sexual assaults \non Beverley. Thirdly, I address evidence about sexual assaults on Glenys, during the period when Beverley and \nGlenys were living at Sister Kate's.  \n\nGeneral observations about the Children's experiences\n\n688 It is fair to say that at Sister Kate's, and at Burnbrae, the Siblings' physical and educational needs were met. \nThey were fed, bathed, had play time and attended school.  \n\n689 All of the Siblings, apart from the youngest ones, were expected to carry out chores during the week at Sister \nKate's and Burnbrae. At Sister Kate's, these were by and large ordinary household chores in the cottages, while at \nBurnbrae, they also included some farm chores (like collecting eggs, chopping wood or milking cows). Mrs Patullo \ndescribed the approach in her cottage at Sister Kate's as being that she:  had a roster of all the children's jobs and \na roster of little kids' jobs, so they each had a little job to do that was within their capacity. The older ones had more \nto do.[953]\n\n690 Initially the plaintiffs' case encompassed an allegation that the Siblings were required to carry out manual \nlabour to an excessive extent. However, the evidence did not support any such finding, and counsel for the plaintiffs \nabandoned any reliance on that claim.[954]  \n\n691 There was also evidence that while the Siblings lived at Sister Kate's or at Burnbrae, if they misbehaved they \nwould be physically disciplined. Some of them reported being given a smack, or hit with a flyswat or a stick or a \nstrap. Initially, the plaintiffs' case encompassed an allegation that the Siblings were subjected to excessive physical \ndiscipline. However, counsel for the plaintiffs abandoned any reliance on that claim.[955]  \n\n\n\n692 Although their separation from their parents was clearly a traumatic and emotionally damaging experience for \nall of the Siblings, and although it is apparent that as they grew older, and developed the capacity to run away, \nsome of the Siblings did so, not all of their experiences while at Sister Kate's or at Burnbrae were unhappy ones. In \n'Echoes of the Past', Wesley is quoted as saying:  They had a fete every year and that was good. ... Plus we used \nto go to Point Peron for two weeks holiday every year. It was good down on the beach. Sometimes we went to \nFremantle to visit the big aircraft carriers and the Zoo was another good place for happiness.[956]\n\n693 Wesley also gave evidence that he was sent on a few holiday placements with families when he was at Sister \nKate's he sometimes went alone, and on other occasions he went with other children, including Eva and \nGlenys[957] and he enjoyed those holidays.[958]  \n\nSexual assaults of Beverley\n\n694 Both Beverley and Glenys gave evidence that while they lived at Sister Kate's they were the victims of sexual \nabuse on numerous occasions. It is unnecessary and inappropriate in the circumstances to describe in detail the \nparticular conduct involved. Rather, it suffices to make the following findings.  \n\n695 Beverley's evidence was that while she lived at Sister Kate's she was sexually abused by two males, whom she \nidentified by name. Beverley had referred to this sexual abuse on her application form in relation to the Redress \nscheme, but in doing so, she identified only one male as having sexually abused her.[959] However, a handwritten \nstatement Beverley provided to the ALS in 1995 referred to the sexual abuse in a manner broadly consistent with \nher witness statement in these proceedings.[960] Furthermore, in the course of crossexamination, Beverley \nconfirmed that two males had sexually abused her during this period.[961] I accept Beverley's evidence that she \nwas sexually abused by the two males. Beverley's evidence, which I accept, was that these incidents of sexual \nabuse were carried out on numerous occasions, as frequently as several times a week over the course of \napproximately two years.[962]  \n\n696 Beverley also gave evidence that she was sexually abused in the course of weekend placements, or outings \norganised through Sister Kate's. This abuse was of two kinds.  \n\n697 First, Beverley gave evidence that occasionally the children at Sister Kate's would be sent on a weekend \nplacement with a family or an individual. Beverley recalled going on weekend placements, along with Glenys and \nEva, to the home of a couple with a baby boy. Beverley recollected that they went to this home on more than one \noccasion, including once on a long weekend where they stayed for more than one night.[963] Beverley's evidence, \nwhich I accept, was that she was sexually abused by the baby's father during these placements. One instance of \nthis sexual abuse occurred when the three girls slept on a mattress on the lawn outside the man's house, and he \ncame outside to where the girls were sleeping and sexually abused Beverley.  \n\n698 In the course of her application as part of the Redress scheme[964] Beverley referred to sexual abuse during a \nweekend placement at the home of this couple, but referred only to the abuse happening while the girls were \nsleeping inside the house. Beverley was crossexamined about this apparent inconsistency with her evidenceinchief. \nBeverley's evidence was that on another night during the visit to the man's house on the long weekend, the girls \nwere sleeping inside the house, and in the same room as the baby, and the man came into the room and sexually \nabused her.[965]  \n\n699 Beverley recalled that when the man came into their room, she, Glenys or Eva would pinch the baby in the \nhope that the baby's mother would come in response to the baby's cry, and that the abuse would then \nstop.[966]Beverley also said that when she heard the man coming she lay on top of her younger sisters to protect \nthem from him.[967] I accept Beverley's evidence that this sexual abuse occurred.  \n\n700 Beverley was also crossexamined about a publication prepared by the ALS called 'Telling our Story'. (There \nwas no mention of Beverley by name in that publication, as all the people in it were referred to by pseudonyms. \nHowever, Beverley's experiences and those of her family, bear many similarities to the stories told in that \npublication. There was no mention in that story of the sexual abuse experienced by Beverley during her weekend \nplacements.) Beverley's evidence was that she could not remember whether she had told the ALS about the abuse \nduring her weekend placements for the purposes of the 'Telling Our Story' publication.[968] However, I do not place \nany weight on the 'Telling our Story' document, for two reasons. First, the document itself makes clear that  the \nhistories of four families ... are told to complement the discussion on the treatment of aboriginal children who were \n\n\n\nremoved from their families and the effects of these removals. Their histories are not told completely but parts of \neach individual's history is reported to reflect the past policies and practices of removing aboriginal children from \ntheir families and culture. ... The histories have not been altered, although they have been edited.[969]\n\n701 In addition, a statement given by Beverley to the ALS was in evidence.[970] It is apparent that the story set out \nin 'Telling our Story' does not reproduce in full the details in that statement.  \n\n702 The second kind of sexual abuse which Beverley experienced occurred during weekend outings with men from \ncar clubs in Perth. Her evidence was that men and women from car clubs in Perth would sometimes volunteer to \ntake children from Sister Kate's out for lunch or a picnic on the weekend. Beverley said that she was sexually \nabused on occasion by some of these men, although she was not specific as to when, or how often, these incidents \noccurred.  \n\n703 Beverley gave evidence that the children at Sister Kate's were made to line up so that the adults could choose \nwhich children they wished to take out for the day. After she had been assaulted on one such outing, Beverley tried \nto push Glenys and Eva into the dirt before they had to line up on the next occasion, so that they would not be \nchosen to go out for the day.[971]  \n\n704 In her application to the Redress scheme, Beverley did not make any mention of sexual abuse by members of \nthese car clubs. In crossexamination, her explanation about this omission was that the application forms 'never \nasked for everything. It was what I could remember at the time.'[972]  \n\n705 Beverley was also crossexamined about the fact that in an application to become a foster carer in 2002, \nBeverley did not mention all of the sexual abuse which she had experienced while a ward, but only referred to the \nsexual abuse carried out by the father of the baby. Beverley's evidence was that who she told about the sexual \nabuse depended upon that the person to whom she was talking to, and that in the foster carer application, she \nsimply answered the questions on the form.[973]  \n\n706 The fact that Beverley did not mention the sexual abuse at the hands of the car club members in the course of \nher Redress application or her foster carer application does not lead me to doubt her evidence that she was abused \nin the course of these visits. It is not at all surprising that a victim of sexual abuse may be reluctant to disclose \ndetails of such a traumatic events to complete strangers if there is no pressing need to do so.  \n\n707 I accept Beverley's evidence that she was sexually abused during weekend outings with car club members. \nHowever, her evidence in relation to the abuse was not sufficiently specific to permit any specific findings to be \nmade about this abuse.  \n\nSexual assaults of Glenys\n\n708 Glenys also gave evidence that she was sexually assaulted by two males, who she also identified by name, \nwho lived at Sister Kate's. She said the sexual abuse started soon after she arrived, when she was three years old, \nand continued until she was about five years old. Glenys gave accounts of these assaults on several occasions in \nthe witness statement which constituted her evidenceinchief in these proceedings, in crossexamination, in her \nRedress scheme application, and in a statement provided to the ALS in 1995. There were some differences in \nthese accounts as to the nature and frequency of the sexual abuse which Glenys recounted. Nevertheless, I am \nsatisfied as to the truthfulness of her evidence that the sexual abuse occurred. Furthermore, Beverley also gave \nevidence that she witnessed Glenys being sexually abused by the same two males (separately) on several \noccasions.[974] I accept that Glenys sexually abused by the two males on numerous occasions over approximately \na twoyear period.[975]  \n\n709 Glenys also gave evidence that she was sexually abused by a man during a school holiday placement when \nshe was about six or seven years of age. Glenys said that she had initially forgotten this placement until reminded \nof it by another couple with whom she had also had a holiday placement, and who were neighbours of the man in \nquestion. However, Glenys recalled details of the man involved, his age and his appearance, and she had a vivid \nmemory of the furniture in the man's house where the sexual abuse occurred. Although Glenys' evidence was that \nshe had contact with the man on several occasions, including when she stayed with the couple who were \nneighbours of this man, it was not clear that the man sexually abused her on more than one occasion. Accordingly, \nI accept Glenys' evidence that this man sexually abused her on one occasion.  \n\n\n\n710 Glenys also gave evidence that she was sexually abused by the father of the baby, at whose home she, \nBeverley and Eva had had a holiday placement. She recalled three visits to this man's house. On the second visit, \nGlenys recalled that she and her sisters slept on mattresses in his back yard, and during the night, the man sexually \nabused her.[976] Glenys evidence was that she and Beverley ensured that Eva was not left alone with the man, \nand they ensured that they slept between Eva and the man, so that nothing would happen to her.  \n\n711 Glenys also said that on another evening at the home of the same man, he engaged in similar conduct, and I \nfind that the man sexually abused Glenys on this occasion also. Glenys said that on this occasion, she and \nBeverley decided that they had to do something to make the abuse stop, so they pinched the man's baby in the \nhope that if the baby cried, the man's wife would come to check on him and the man's abuse might stop.  \n\n712 Glenys also gave evidence that the girls visited the man's house on another occasion. However, on this visit, \nthe girls decided that in order to avoid any abuse by the man, they would hide in the toilet at his house and scream \nuntil they were taken back to Sister Kate's.[977]  \n\n713 Eva also recalled an occasion during a weekend placement where the girls had hid in the toilet and screamed \nuntil they were taken back to Sister Kate's. No abuse occurred on this occasion.  \n\n714 Glenys also gave evidence that in about 1970, during a period when she had run away from one of her \nplacements, she was living at Beaufort Park, which is a park on the corner of Newcastle and Stirling Streets in \nNorthbridge where a number of aboriginal people lived at the time. Glenys' evidence, which I accept, was that on \none occasion, she was sexually assaulted by two young white men. Glenys' evidence was that she felt guilty and \nashamed, and that this assault was the start of a period in her life where she engaged in heavy drinking.  \n\n715 Glenys also gave evidence that while she was staying at the home of her Auntie Jean and Uncle Fred in \nHamilton Hill, a male member of her Auntie Jean's family, who is now deceased, tried to sexually assault her. It \nappears that this attempt was not successful as Glenys' brother William, who was also staying at Auntie Jean's at \nthe same time, protected her from this attempted abuse.  \n\n716 Both Beverley and Glenys gave evidence that they decided not to tell anyone about the sexual abuse they \nexperienced. Beverley's evidence was that the girls decided not to tell anyone about the abuse on the weekend \nplacement at the man's house 'because we knew nobody would believe us. It was already happening to us at Sister \nKate's and no one cared in there so why would they care about this.'[978] Glenys also gave evidence that she did \nnot report the sexual abuse she had experienced.  \n\n717 I find that during their wardships neither Beverley nor Glenys reported the sexual abuse they experienced while \nat Sister Kate's.  \n\n(k) The extent of supervision or monitoring of the Children's welfare by officers of the Child Welfare Department  \n\nIn this section of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n\n(i) evidence in relation to the staff resources, workload and operations of the Department of Native Welfare, and \nChild Welfare Department, in the period prior to, and during, the Children's wardships;  \n\n(ii) evidence in relation to the Child Welfare Department's requirements for inspecting institutions, including Sister \nKate's, and for monitoring the welfare of wards in institutions or foster care;  \n\n(iii) evidence in relation to checks on the welfare of the Children which were conducted during their wardships;  \n\n(iv) evidence in relation to inspections of Sister Kate's and Burnbrae while the Siblings lived there;  \n\n(v) evidence in relation to systems for reporting and dealing with complaints about the treatment of wards; and  \n\n(vi) evidence in relation to checks for permanent and occasional foster carers and the staff of institutions such as \nSister Kate's.  \n\n(i) Evidence in relation to the staff resources, workload and operations of the Department of Native Welfare, and \nChild Welfare Department, in the period prior to, and during, the Children's wardships\n\n718 There was very limited evidence in relation to the resources and operations of the Department of Native \nWelfare which were directed to the welfare of aboriginal people, and aboriginal children in particular, in the period \nprior to, and during, the Children's wardships.  \n\n\n\n719 Mr Terence Long was a patrol officer for the Southern District of the State from March 1959, and was stationed \nat the Narrogin office of the Department of Native Welfare from March 1959 until March 1960. In a witness \nstatement, Mr Long deposed that the Department of Native Welfare divided the State into seven districts, and that \ndeposed that he was the only patrol officer for the Southern District in 1959 1960. Also based in the Narrogin office \nat the time were Mr WrightWebster, a clerical officer and a typist.[979] Mr Long deposed that his duties as a patrol \nofficer included patrolling the district, visiting aboriginal communities to locate and identify aboriginal persons, and \nassisting aboriginal persons such as by securing work or arranging school attendance.[980] He would provide his \npatrol notes to the District Officer, who would then communicate with the Commissioner in respect of any action \nwhich was required.[981]  \n\n720 Even without any evidence as to the number of aboriginal people living in the Southern District, it is \nimmediately striking that the resources of one patrol officer and one District Officer, to carry out the work of the \nDepartment of Native Welfare within the district, appears to be a very limited resource.  \n\n721 The evidence to which I have already referred established that during the period of the Children's wardships \nofficers of the Department of Native Welfare, and of the Child Welfare Department, drew on the resources of police \nofficers, and on occasion, on the resources of members of the local community (such as those engaged in \ncharitable works), in carrying out their duties. Police officers and members of the local communities provided \ninformation about individuals and families, and police officers were sometimes called upon to assist in the \napprehension of children who were wards. Evidence to this effect was also contained in a witness statement \nprepared by Mr Cornish, a patrol officer and later the Acting District Superintendent (also known as District Officer) \nbased at the Narrogin office of the Department of Native Welfare between 1956 and 1963). In his statement, Mr \nCornish referred to Ms Jones:  I recall that I often dealt with a lady missionary in Brookton during both my stints at \nthe Narrogin office whose surname I think was Jones. I ... would see her each time I visited Brookton in the course \nof my duties, which I think was roughly monthly. Because Brookton was quite close to Narrogin it was easy to visit \nBrookton when the need arose.\n\n When I visited Brookton I would make contact with the missionary, and we would discuss local families with whom \nshe had contact. She would tell me what she had heard about how children were faring, whether the children were \ngoing to school, and everything that affected the welfare of children. She was a very useful point of contact.\n\n She would also contact the Department in the case of a person requiring assistance when she was unable to \nprovide that assistance herself.\n\n I knew the missionary both personally and professionally and I held her in the highest regard.[982]\n\n722 There was also some evidence in relation to staff resources in the Child Welfare Department during the period \nof the Children's wardships. According to the Department's Annual Report for the financial year ending 30 June \n1959, the number of children controlled and supervised throughout the financial year, within the various areas of the \nDepartment's responsibility, was 5982, including 430 wards of the Department in institutions, 452 boarded out on \nsubsidies, and 244 wards under the supervision of probation officers.[983] Within the same period, the Department \nhad two psychologists, thirteen probation officers, five welfare officers and five district officers (the latter were \nstationed in country areas).[984] It is apparent that workload was a matter of concern to the Department's staff at \nthat time. The Report noted that  it is important that case loads be kept to a workable size and constant review must \nbe made to ensure that officers are able to cope with their allotted tasks. An effective load is considered to be 80 \ncases as a maximum. The case load per officer is far in excess of this as a general rule.[985]\n\n723 The 1959 Annual Report also noted that the five welfare officers in the metropolitan area conducted 2204 visits \nto wards, 354 visits to foster children, and 1700 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected \nchildren) within the financial year. The five district officers in country areas conducted 1382 visits to wards, 77 \nvisits to foster children, and 2863 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected children) within the \nfinancial year.  \n\n\n\n724 According to the Department's Annual Report for the financial year ending 30 June 1962, the number of \nchildren controlled and supervised throughout the financial year, within the various areas of the Department's \nresponsibility, was 7,451, including 423 wards in institutions, 551 boarded out, and 263 wards under the supervision \nof probation officers.[986] It appears that there were 6 welfare officers employed in the Department during this \nfinancial year, who between them were responsible for 1049 cases (or, on average, 174 cases each), while there \nwere eight district officers responsible for a total of 1921 cases (or, on average, 240 cases each).  \n\n725 The same report noted that the welfare officers in the metropolitan area conducted 3344 visits to wards, 442 \nvisits to foster children, and 2280 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected children) within the \nfinancial year. The five district officers in country areas conducted 2406 visits to wards, 188 visits to foster \nchildren, and 3469 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected children) within the financial year.  \n\n726 According to the Department's Annual Report for the financial year ending 30 June 1965, the number of \nchildren controlled and supervised throughout the financial year, within the various areas of the Department's \nresponsibility, was 7,041, including 732 wards of the Department in institutions, 725 boarded out, and 349 wards \nunder the supervision of probation officers.[987] In this financial year there were 711 aboriginal wards, including 329 \naboriginal wards in institutions, and 69 boarded out with foster parents. There were 12 welfare officers employed in \nthe Department during this financial year, who between them were responsible for 1982 cases (or, on average, 165 \ncases each), while there were seven district officers responsible for a total of 1368 cases (or, on average, 195 \ncases each).  \n\n727 The same report noted that the 12 welfare officers in the metropolitan area conducted 4387 visits to wards, \n663 visits to foster children, and 3355 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected children) within \nthe financial year. The seven district officers in country areas conducted 2707 visits to wards, 163 visits to foster \nchildren, and 3067 inspections and investigations (including those for neglected children) within the financial year.  \n\n728 These figures suggest that throughout the years of the Children's wardships, welfare officers within the Child \nWelfare Department had a very significant workload. Those statistics were confirmed in the evidence of welfare \nofficers at the trial, although it was also apparent from that evidence that caseloads varied (sometimes very \nsignificantly) between officers. The reasons for those variations were not explored in the evidence, although one \nwould expect some variations in case loads depending upon the complexity of the cases, and the experience of the \nwelfare officers responsible for them.  \n\n729 Ms Lynette Boag was a case worker in the Child Welfare Department between August 1968 and January 1973. \nShe deposed that 'I had a large caseload, and it was common knowledge that we had huge caseloads at that \ntime.'[988]  \n\n730 Ms Jean Hamory, a welfare officer and later social worker and social work supervisor, with the Child Welfare \nDepartment from 1960 until 1991, deposed that  I considered that a welfare officer's caseload was extremely heavy. \nThe size of the caseload meant it was occasionally difficult to manage all of the competing priorities. Investigations \nof reports from the public about possible danger to a child were required to be given precedence over all other \nwork, including the visiting of wards and the visiting of families receiving welfare monies.[989]\n\n731 Ms Stephanie Keating, a welfare officer with the Child Welfare Department from February 1969, said that at \nthat time the metropolitan region was divided into four geographical subregions, and there was an office within each \nregion comprising approximately 15 staff, the majority of whom were welfare officers. Ms Keating's evidence was \nthat there were very few social workers or psychologists employed by the Department at that time, in part because \nthe Bachelor of Social Work course was not introduced in a Western Australian university until the mid1960s.[990]  \n\n732 Mr Kenneth Monson, a social worker with the Child Welfare Department from July 1969, deposed that in 1970 \nhe carried a case load of approximately 45 children in care, although his evidence was that he carried a larger case \nload of children than other staff members, and dealt with more complex cases.[991]  \n\n733 Mr Terence Mulroney, a social worker with the Department from 1971, deposed that his case load was roughly \n30 cases, and his cases would be reviewed with a supervisor.[992]  \n\n\n\n734 In contrast, Ms Caroline Brazier, a social worker with the Child Welfare Department from 1967, deposed that as \na social worker in metropolitan Perth at that time, she was responsible for a significant case load of about 100 \ncases.[993]  \n\n735 Mr Desmond Semple, who was a social worker with the Child Welfare Department from 1970, and later \nDirector General of the Department, recalled a heavy case load during his time as a social worker. His evidence \nwas that in his experience most social workers had a case load of about 100 cases, although in 1971 when he \nworked at the Morley divisional office, he had about 150 cases.[994] However, from 1973 1976, the case load for \nindividual staff had decreased to about 70 80 cases each.[995]  \n\n736 The available evidence supports the conclusion that during the period of the Children's wardships, welfare \nofficers employed in the Child Welfare Department carried a significant case load. In addition, the evidence \nsupports the conclusion that during the same period, there were very few psychologists and social workers \nemployed by the Department.  \n\n(ii) Evidence in relation to the Child Welfare Department's requirements for inspecting institutions, including Sister \nKate's, and for monitoring the welfare of wards in institutions or foster care\n\n737 As I observed at [190], during the period of the Children's wardships, the Child Welfare Act required that the \nDirector cause all wards to be visited once every six months by an officer of the Department, to ensure that their \ntreatment, education, and care was satisfactory.[996] There was evidence in relation to the supervision of \ninstitutions and foster placements, and of the wards placed in institutions and foster placements, by the Child \nWelfare Department during the years that the Children were in care.  \n\n738 Mr Maine's evidence was that in 1961 (and thereafter) the Child Welfare Department had the statutory \nresponsibility of licensing institutions for children and it would have been interested in Sister Kate's to confirm that it \nmet the basic requirements for satisfactory care of the children who lived there.[997] Mr Maine said that there was \nan institutions officer within the Department who had to visit all of the institutions licensed by the Department. Mr \nMaine said that there was no formal arrangement for staff at an institution to make contact with the Department, but \nthis could happen informally, such as if a cottage mother took advantage of the presence of a field officer who was \nthere to discuss some problem or issue they were dealing with.[998]  \n\n739 Mr Maine also gave evidence that there were individual field officers who were responsible for the children who \nwere in care in those institutions. His evidence was that those officers would have visited the children personally \nfrom time to time and he thought that would have been at about threemonthly intervals, depending on staff \navailability.[999] Mr Maine had no personal recollection of the extent to the obligation to visit wards was complied \nwith. He observed that there were staff shortages and these requirements couldn't always be complied with.[1000]  \n\n740 The tenor of Mr Maine's evidence both as to the requirements for supervision of institutions and wards, and as \nto the extent to which resources impacted upon compliance with these requirements was borne out by evidence \nfrom officers of the Child Welfare Department at the time.  \n\n741 Ms Mary Walsh (nee Argyle) was a field officer with the Child Welfare Department between 1964 and 1965. \nShe deposed that in that role she was occasionally required to visit children's institutions, and that she visited \nSister Kate's two or three times during her time at the Department. Ms Walsh deposed that  my duty when visiting \nwards and foster parents, which I followed as a matter of practice when visiting Sister Kate's, was to look for any \nproblems there might be for the child I was visiting or for the foster parent. ... [I]t was more a question of \nobservation and general conversation.[1001]\n\n742 Ms Caroline Brazier recalled that during the period when she was a social worker, an instruction was issued \nwithin the Child Welfare Department that all wards should be visited on a certain number of occasions each \nyear.[1002]  \n\n743 Mr Kenneth Monson recalled that in approximately 1973 a requirement for 'quarterly reports' was introduced, \nwhich meant that at a minimum an officer was required to conduct a physical visit to a child in care once a \nquarter.[1003]  \n\n\n\n744 Ms Stephanie Keating deposed that she visited wards of the State and their caregivers every three months, \nwhich she understood to have been a requirement under the Child Welfare Act.[1004]  \n\n745 Mr Desmond Semple deposed that even if a child was in a stable environment, the prevailing guideline was \nthat the child should be seen face to face at least once every three months. However, he deposed that  the reality, \nin my experience, was that heavy case loads invariably meant that you were often caught responding to crises, and \nas a result, you were not necessarily able to visit every 3 months.[1005]\n\n746 He also deposed that although he recalled that there was a requirement for the completion of quarterly reports \nby field workers in relation to children under their supervision, some officers were more capable of meeting this \nrequirement than others, and that if an officer had to respond to crises this would affect their ability to complete the \nrequired visits and reports.[1006] Mr Semple's evidence was that:  In my experience, both as a social worker and a \nSupervisor, the provision of services by officers within the Department, and the quality of those services, was \ninfluenced more by the capabilities and diligence of the individual officer, and their approach to case work practice, \nrather than any wide spread discrimination on the basis of a child or family's background.[1007]\n\n747 Mr Terence Mulroney deposed that the frequency of his visits to a ward placed in foster care would depend on \nthe specific circumstances. He could recall visiting a foster child once a week in difficult cases, but that if the \ncircumstances were suitable, the supervision would be less frequent (for example face to face contact once a \nmonth). His evidence was that he could not recall going for a period of three months without seeing a foster child \nface to face.[1008]  \n\n748 Mr Maine also gave evidence that when he was a psychologist with the Child Welfare Department, he attended \nat Sister Kate's on a weekly basis for about a year, to work with some of the older girls in the older girls' cottage \nthere, and he therefore had regular contact with the children in that cottage during that period.[1009]  \n\n749 The evidence therefore established that if a ward or wards had a particular need, a welfare officer might see \nthat ward on a more regular basis.  \n\n750 I find that during the period of the Children's wardships, and either as an administrative requirement within the \nChild Welfare Department or in order to comply with the Child Welfare Act, welfare officers within the Department \nwere expected to visit wards on a regular basis, and at least every six months. However, the need to give priority to \nurgent or crisis cases meant that it was not always possible for Departmental welfare officers to conduct checks on \nwards as regularly as this. On the other hand, if a ward had a particular need which required the attention of an \nofficer of the Department (such as a psychologist), that officer might see the ward on a more regular basis.  \n\n(iii) Evidence in relation to checks on the welfare of the Children which were conducted during their wardships.\n\n751 As I have explained elsewhere in these reasons, there was virtually no documentary evidence in relation to the \nSiblings while they lived at Sister Kate's prior to July 1964. After that period, and while they continued to reside at \nSister Kate's or Burnbrae, there was evidence that the Siblings were each given regular medical checkups, and that \nthey were visited by welfare officers, on a relatively regular basis. There was evidence that while some of the \nSiblings were in foster care, their foster homes were visited by child welfare officers on a relatively regular basis.  \n\n752 I find that the Siblings (other than Donald and William, about whom it is not necessary to make findings on this \nissue) were seen on the following occasions.  \n\nDarryl\n\n753 Whilst he was at Sister Kate's or Burnbrae, Darryl was seen by a doctor on 31 July 1964, 19 November 1965, \n28 April 1966, 24 November 1966, 4 April 1967, and 13 October 1967.[1010]  \n\n754 A later medical report indicates that Darryl had a medical examination on 28 October 1965,[1011] but there was \nno report from that examination in evidence. However, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Darryl had a \nmedical examination on this occasion.  \n\n755 In addition, the documents in evidence indicate that welfare officers visited locations where they expected \nDarryl to be found, but did not find him there, on the following occasions: 7 January 1970 (at Brookton, reported to \n\n\n\nbe away working), 24 February 1970 (at Brookton, reported that he was believed to be away working) and 21 May \n1970 (at Brookton, reported that he had left Brookton and was living in Doodlakine where he had secured \nemployment).[1012]  \n\nBonnie\n\n756 Copies of medical or welfare reports which were in evidence indicate that Bonnie was seen by either a doctor, \nor a welfare officer, on the following dates: 31 July 1964, 19 November 1965, 28 April 1966, 24 November 1966, 4 \nApril 1967, 14 November 1967, 3 January 1968, 21 October 1968, 10 October 1969, 10 December 1969, 24 \nFebruary 1970, 22 May 1970, 7 July 1970, 28 July 1970 and 11 June 1971.[1013]  \n\n757 In addition, the documents in evidence indicate that welfare officers visited locations at which they expected \nBonnie to be, but did not find her there, on the following occasions: 30 September 1969 (Brookton), 24 March 1970 \n(Pingelly Native Reserve) and 28 March 1972 (Pingelly Native Reserve).[1014]  \n\n758 Other documents also refer to welfare reports that had been submitted in relation to Bonnie on 18 March 1971 \nand 3 December 1971.[1015] Although those welfare reports were not in evidence, I am satisfied that it is more \nlikely than not that Bonnie was the subject of a welfare report on those occasions also.  \n\nBeverley\n\n759 Copies of medical or welfare reports which were in evidence indicate that Beverley was seen by a doctor, or a \nwelfare officer, on the following dates: 31 July 1964, 12 August 1964, 16 March 1965, 19 November 1965, 7 \nDecember 1965, 27 April 1966, 23 May 1966, 21 November 1966, 20 March 1967, 3 April 1967, 13 November \n1967, 22 April 1968, 30 September 1969, 30 June 1970, 1 July 1970, 30 September 1970, 20 November 1970, 2 \nDecember 1970, 21 December 1970, 1 September 1971, 15 March 1972, 22 March 1972, 19 April 1972, 23 August \n1972 and 30 August 1972.[1016]  \n\n760 Later medical reports which were in evidence refer to medical examinations of Beverley that took place on 19 \nFebruary 1962 and 26 October 1965.[1017] Although there were no medical reports from those examinations in \nevidence, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Beverley also had a medical examination on those \noccasions also.  \n\n761 Welfare officers visited locations at which they expected Beverley to be, but did not find her there, on 5 \nDecember 1968 (Mr and Mrs Stephenson's home, Beverley reported to be at school) and 15 April 1970 (Mrs Price's \nhouse in Gosnells, Beverley reported to be out at the time).[1018]  \n\nEllen\n\n762 The documents in evidence established that on 30 September 1958, 31 March 1959, 30 September 1959, 31 \nMarch 1960 and 30 September 1960, Ellen was the subject of a 'half yearly report on committal case'.[1019] The \nobservations made by officers of the Department of Native Welfare in these reports indicated that Ellen had been \nseen prior to the preparation of the report, but the reports do not specify the exact dates on which she was seen.  \n\n763 Documents in evidence also established that Ellen was seen by a doctor, or a welfare officer, on the following \ndates: 15 September 1964, 26 January 1965, 26 May 1965, 27 January 1966, 25 May 1966, 7 December 1966, 15 \nMay 1967, 19 January 1968, 27 February 1968, 10 May 1968, 14 May 1968, 29 July 1968, 10 January 1969, 10 \nApril 1969, 2 July 1969, 20 December 1970, 4 February 1971, 8 February 1971 and 15 June 1972.[1020]  \n\n764 Documents described as 'Quarterly case reports' dated 13 March 1974 and 27 September 1974 were also in \nevidence.[1021] The observations in these reports indicated that Ellen had been seen prior to the preparation of the \nreport, but the reports do not specify the exact dates on which she was seen.[1022]  \n\n765 Other documents indicated that Ellen was seen by a doctor on 23 August 1966 and 23 May 1967.  \n\n766 Finally, a document in evidence indicated that a welfare officer visited the Dwyer's home on 5 December 1969, \nbut that Ellen was not able to be seen on that occasion as she was at school at the time.[1023]  \n\nGlenys\n\n767 Copies of medical or welfare reports which were in evidence indicated that Glenys was seen by a doctor, or a \nwelfare officer, on the following dates: 31 July 1964, 12 August 1964, 16 March 1965, 19 November 1965, 7 \n\n\n\nDecember 1965, 27 April 1966, 23 May 1966, 21 November 1966, 20 March 1967, 3 April 1967, 13 July 1967, 13 \nNovember 1967, 22 April 1968, 21 October 1968, 17 May 1969, 26 May 1970 and 23 November 1970.[1024]  \n\n768 Other medical reports which were in evidence refer to medical examinations of Glenys that took place on 8 \nMarch 1962 and 19 July 1965.[1025] Although there were no medical reports from those examinations in evidence, \nI am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Glenys had a medical examination on those occasions also.  \n\n769 On 30 September 1969, a welfare officer also visited Brookton, hoping to see Glenys, but found that she was \nnot present, but was reported to be at school.[1026]  \n\nEva\n\n770 Copies of medical or welfare reports which were in evidence indicated that Eva was seen by either a doctor, or \na welfare officer, on the following dates: 31 July 1964, 12 August 1964, 16 March 1965, 19 November 1965, 7 \nDecember 1965, 27 April 1966, 21 November 1966, 20 March 1967, 3 April 1967, 13 November 1967, 22 April \n1968, 21 October 1968, 6 May 1969, 15 April 1970, 20 May 1970, 30 September 1970, 2 December 1970, 21 \nDecember 1970, 4 May 1971, 3 August 1971, 2 December 1971, 2 May 1972, 2 February 1973, 12 June 1973, 3 \nDecember 1973, 23 April 1974, 10 October 1974.[1027]  \n\n771 Other medical reports referred to medical examinations of Eva that took place on 9 December 1963, 26 \nOctober 1965, 3 December 1971 and 14 November 1972.[1028] Although there were no medical reports from those \nexaminations in evidence, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Eva had a medical examination on those \noccasions also.  \n\n772 In addition, welfare reports in relation to Eva dated 13 April 1973 and 19 October 1977 were in evidence, \nalthough those reports did not, on their face, indicate whether or not the welfare officer saw Eva prior to making the \nreport.[1029]  \n\nWesley\n\n773 Copies of medical or welfare reports which were in evidence indicated that Wesley was seen by either a doctor, \nor a welfare officer, on the following dates: 29 July 1964, 12 August 1964, 16 March 1965, 19 November 1965, 26 \nApril 1966, 21 November 1966, 5 April 1967, 24 May 1967, 16 November 1967, 22 April 1968, 18 October 1968, 12 \nMarch 1969, 6 May 1969, 8 January 1970, 29 January 1970, 25 June 1970, 24 June 1971, 6 June 1972, 12 March \n1973, 4 May 1973, 26 June 1973, 11 October 1973, 8 October 1975 and January 1976.[1030]  \n\n774 Other medical reports referred to medical examinations of Wesley that took place on 19 July 1965, 27 October \n1965 and 15 October 1970.[1031] Although there were no medical reports from those examinations in evidence, I \nam satisfied that it is more likely than not that Wesley had a medical examination on those occasions also.  \n\n775 Welfare officers visited locations where they expected Wesley to be, but did not find him there, on the following \noccasions: 5 December 1968 (Mr and Mrs Stephenson's home, Wesley reported to be at school), 21 June 1977 \n(Collard home in Kondinin, Wesley reported to be visiting the metropolitan area) and 2 August 1978 (Collard \nresidence in Kondinin).[1032]  \n\n776 Other documents in evidence referred to welfare reports that were submitted in relation to Wesley on 13 \nFebruary 1972 and 9 May 1977.[1033] Those welfare reports were not in evidence. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that \nit is more likely than not that welfare reports in relation to Wesley were made on those occasions also.  \n\n777 In evidence was a document[1034] relating to a complaint made by Wesley's foster mother, Mrs Stephenson, in \n1971, to the effect that a welfare officer had not been to see Wesley for 18 months. Mr Maine was crossexamined \nabout the nature of this complaint, and he accepted that from time to time staff shortages meant that visits to wards \nwere not as frequent as would have been desirable.[1035]  \n\n778 However, the problem to which Mrs Stephenson referred in this letter does not appear to have been a \nprotracted one, because Wesley recalled that while he was living with the Stephensons, welfare officers from the \nDepartment of Native Welfare came and saw him many times. He also said that  the Department of Native Welfare \nofficer always told me I could go see him at his office in town if I had any questions or wanted to talk to him. I did go \n\n\n\nand see him once when I was around 14. My relationship with the Stephensons was deteriorating and I complained \nto the officer about this.[1036]\n\n779 Having regard to all of the evidence to which I have referred I find that from mid1964, and during the periods in \nwhich they were living in institutions or in foster homes during their wardships, the Siblings were seen on a regular \nbasis either by a doctor, or by a child welfare officer. Those examinations were not always conducted every six \nmonths, and I infer that that was because sometimes workload pressures on welfare officers meant that they could \nnot visit wards as frequently as every six months.  \n\n780 In so far as the position prior to 1964 is concerned, for the reasons I have already set out, the absence of any \nevidence for this period suggests that the evidence before the Court did not comprise a complete documentary \npicture, and in those circumstances, it cannot be inferred from the absence of documents that no inspections or \nchecks were carried out on the Siblings during that period.  \n\n(iv) Evidence in relation to inspections of Sister Kate's and Burnbrae while the Siblings lived there\n\n781 There was very little evidence that inspections were conducted of Sister Kate's, or any other institution where \nthe Siblings lived, to monitor the adequacy of the care provided to wards. The only evidence of such an inspection \nwas a report prepared by an 'Institution Officer' of the Child Welfare Department who conducted an inspection of \nSister Kate's in May 1963. The officer reviewed the accommodation and facilities at Sister Kate's and also \ncommented on the children residing there, as follows:  Children in residence:\n\n At the time of my visit there were 71 children at Sister Kate's Home, including 13 under the jurisdiction of this \nDepartment, 25 under the Department of Native Welfare and the remainder being private cases. All the children \nwere seen during the midday meal and their appearance without exception was satisfactory.\n\n Education:\n\n There is a kindergarten on the premises, which caters for children from the Home and some children from outside. \nThe primary school children attend the Queen's Park State School, while the high school children are divided \nbetween Bentley, Armadale and Kalamunda High Schools.\n\n ...\n\n Health:\n\n Satisfactory arrangements are made to follow up the medical, dental and optical treatment required by the children, \nand suitable records are maintained.\n\n Visiting Leave and Outside Contact:\n\n Weekend leave and visits are allowed once a month. As several other Homes are extending their visiting \narrangements, I feel it would be desirable if Sister Kate's Home followed suit.\n\n General Comments:\n\n It is apparent that in recent years there has been a vast improvement in Sister Kate's Home, particularly with the \nreplacing of old buildings with new ones. Generally, all equipment and utensils are in good condition and I am \n\n\n\nsatisfied that the children are well cared for. There appears to be an excellent relationship between Mr and Mrs \nDaniel and the children and it is obvious that they take a personal interest in each and every child in the Home.\n\n782 For the reasons I have already given, I am not persuaded that the absence of any other reports of similar \ninspections of Sister Kate's or Burnbrae, in particular, permits the inference to be drawn that no other inspections of \nthose institutions was carried out. However, the dearth of evidence means that it is not possible to make any finding \nas to when such inspections were carried out, save for the inspection in May 1963.  \n\n(v) Evidence in relation to systems for reporting and dealing with complaints about the treatment of wards\n\n783 Mr Maine gave evidence as to how complaints in relation to the treatment of wards were dealt with. His \nevidence as to the position in about 1966 was that if a complaint was received in relation to the treatment or care of \na ward, the role of the Child Welfare Department was to investigate that complaint to see whether it was \nsubstantiated and then steps could be taken to correct the situation.[1037]  \n\n784 Mr Maine's attention was drawn to a document indicating that a concern had been raised by a cottage mother \nat Sister Kate's in 1966 to the effect that the children in her cottage (who did not include the Siblings) had been \nengaging in play of a sexual nature. Mr Maine was asked about whether particular officers in the Child Welfare \nDepartment were assigned to deal with complaints or concerns of this kind. Mr Maine's evidence was that at that \ntime there was one parttime psychologist and one fulltime psychologist in the Department, and that 'it would be \nnormal to refer such a problem to them but whether they were there then or available or what, I can't tell'.[1038]  \n\n785 However, at least up until 1968, the staff members at Sister Kate's had no formal training in child care.[1039] \nMr Maine's evidence was that there was 'no specific training for foster parents, no particular qualification for cottage \nparents, and people were generally selected on the basis of their life experience'[1040]  \n\n(vi) Evidence in relation to checks for permanent and occasional foster carers and the staff of institutions such as \nSister Kate's\n\n786 There was very little evidence in relation to whether there was any system for checking the suitability of \npermanent or occasional foster carers and the staff of institutions such as Sister Kate's, during the period of the \nChildren's wardships.  \n\n787 Mr Maine's evidence was that the Child Welfare Department had no role to play in the selection of staff at \ninstitutions like Sister Kate's.[1041]  \n\n788 There was also a dearth of evidence in relation to whether any checks were carried out by Sister Kate's in \nrelation to persons who volunteered to be weekend carers, or to take children for holiday placements. Mrs Patullo \ngave some evidence about the process of selecting weekend or holiday carers. Her evidence was that as a result of \nspeaking with Mrs Daniel, she was aware that Mrs Daniel would interview applicants, assess them and maybe \nsuggest a child for a placement.[1042] She would then tell the cottage parent that a child from their cottage was to \nhave a weekend placement. Mrs Patullo's evidence was that when the child came back  it was a matter of \nassessing whether it had been successful or not. If the child didn't want to go, they didn't have to go next time, as \nfar as I'm aware. I never found any difficulty there.[1043]\n\n789 However, while I accept Mrs Patullo's evidence for what it was, I do not think it can be relied upon to draw \nconclusions as to what checks (if any) were conducted in respect of prospective weekend or holiday foster carers \nfor the children at Sister Kate's. Mrs Patullo was not involved in the administration of Sister Kate's. Her evidence \nwas confined to her understanding about the process, as a result of a conversation with Mrs Daniel.  \n\n790 As for the checks carried out by the Child Welfare Department in relation to persons seeking to become foster \nparents, in evidence were copies of a number of applications by persons to be foster carers in relation to the \nSiblings. However, there was no evidence as to what (if any) checks were undertaken, during the period of the \nChildren's wardships, to determine whether an applicant was suitable to be a foster carer.  \n\n791 The final observation which can be made about this evidence, however, is that there was no evidence as to \nwhat checks could have been made in respect of the suitability of weekend or occasional carers at that time. There \n\n\n\nwas, for example, no evidence as to whether criminal record checks could be done in the 1960s in the same way in \nwhich they are now commonly done.  \n\n(l) Contact between Don and Sylvia and the Children during the course of their wardships  \n\n792 In this section of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n\n(i) evidence as to the policy at Sister Kate's in the 1960s in relation to visits to wards by their families;  \n\n(ii) evidence as to the policy of the Child Welfare Department during the late 1950s and the 1960s in relation to \nvisits to wards in foster care by their families; and  \n\n(iii) evidence as to the Children's contact with their family during the period of their wardships when they lived in \ninstitutional care or in foster care.  \n\n(i) Evidence as to the policy at Sister Kate's in the 1960s in relation to visits to wards by their families\n\n793 The report prepared in May 1963 by the 'Institution Officer' of the Child Welfare Department to which I referred \nat [781] above addressed, amongst other things, family visits to the children of Sister Kate's. The officer noted:  \nVisiting Leave and Outside Contact:\n\n Weekend leave and visits are allowed once a month. As several other Homes are extending their visiting \narrangements, I feel it would be desirable if Sister Kate's Home followed suit.[1044]\n\n794 I accept that that document sets out the position at Sister Kate's in 1963. The document also suggests that this \nwas not out of the ordinary for institutions of this kind at the time, although clearly the position was changing, and \nthere was an appreciation that it would be desirable if visiting arrangements at Sister Kate's were extended in the \nsame way as they had been at other institutions.  \n\n(ii) Evidence as to the policy of the Child Welfare Department during the late 1950s and the 1960s in relation to \nvisits to wards in foster care by their families\n\n795 Mr Maine was crossexamined about the knowledge possessed by officers in the Child Welfare Department \nduring the 1950s and 1960s about the work of the child psychologist, John Bowlby, who had emphasised the \nimportance of maintaining the relationship between a child in foster care, and the child's biological parents, and the \nimportance of encouraging visits by parents to promote parentchild relations.  \n\n796 Mr Maine's evidence, which I accept, was that these views were generally known to officers in the Child \nWelfare Department in the 1950s, but not with the same 'strength' that they became known in time, and that field \nofficers at the time would vary in the extent to which they implemented those kinds of principles.[1045]  \n\n797 For completeness, I note that Ms Kathleen BrentonCoward, a social worker and later Superintendent of \nHostels, with the Child Welfare Department in the 1970s, provided a witness statement in which she deposed:  In \nmy experience, in the case of white children, attempts were made for supervised contact with the natural parents.\n\n I was not aware, from my case load as a Social Worker, that attempts were made for Aboriginal Children to have \nsupervised contact with their natural parents.[1046]\n\n798 I do not place any weight on this evidence. It is too vague, and suggests that Ms BrentonCoward was unaware \nwhat the position was with respect to visits to aboriginal children.  \n\n(iii) Evidence as to the Children's contact with their family during the period of their wardships when they lived in \ninstitutional care or in foster care.\n\n799 In this section of my reasons, I address the evidence in relation to Ellen's contact with Don and Sylvia and her \nsiblings, the Siblings' contact with Don and Sylvia, and the Siblings' contact with each other during their wardships. \nAs I have already mentioned, all of the Siblings ran away and returned to Don and Sylvia at various points in time \nduring their wardships. I do not address that contact between the Siblings and Don and Sylvia in this section of my \n\n\n\nreasons. Rather, I have confined the examination to contact which occurred while the Siblings remained at Sister \nKate's and Burnbrae, or in foster care.  \n\nContact between Don and Sylvia, and Ellen\n\n800 The evidence suggests that Ellen had little contact with Don and Sylvia during the years in which she lived with \nthe Dwyers. Sylvia's evidence was that after Ellen was taken into care, they came to Perth to try to ascertain what \nhad happened to her. An officer of the Department of Native Welfare told them that they could only see Ellen at \narranged times. Eventually Don was told by a case officer at the Department of Native Welfare that they could not \nvisit Ellen at her foster home but could meet her in a park.[1047]  \n\n801 Sylvia's evidence was that they had only a few visits with Ellen when she was young. The first time they saw \nher was around two or three months after she was taken into care. On that occasion, a case worker from the \nDepartment of Native Welfare brought Ellen to a park to meet Don and Sylvia, and then took her back to the \nDwyers afterwards.[1048]  \n\n802 According to Sylvia, from then on Don and Sylvia had to telephone the Department of Native Welfare a day in \nadvance of when they wanted to see Ellen, so that arrangements could be made for them to see her in the park. \nSylvia's evidence was that they always saw Ellen in a park, and that they saw her on around four or five occasions \nbefore she was four years old.[1049]  \n\n803 Sylvia also said that when Ellen was about four years old, a new employee at the Department of Native Welfare \ntold them that Ellen was living with the Dwyers, and gave Don and Sylvia the Dwyers' address. Sylvia said that \nonce they had this information they visited Ellen at the Dwyers' home a few times.  \n\n804 Sylvia said that Mrs Dwyer did not seem hostile to the visits, but asked that Don and Sylvia only visit Ellen \nwhen Ellen wanted to see them. Sylvia's evidence was that Ellen did not want to see them very often, and they \nhardly saw her as she grew older. Sylvia's evidence was that:  Once Ellen was in her teens, it seemed that she was \nrejecting us and the idea of us as her parents. This hurt Don and me very much but what could we do. We wanted \nEllen to be happy but we also wanted her to know about us and her siblings. But because of this and because it \nbecame harder and harder for us to see Ellen, we actually only saw Ellen a handful of times when she was a \nteenager.[1050]\n\n805 Sylvia also gave evidence that Mrs Dwyer and Ellen visited her and Don in Kondinin when Ellen was around \n21 years old, and that on that occasion Mrs Dwyer told her that she wanted Don and Sylvia to keep in contact with \nher and Ellen from then on. However Sylvia's evidence was that it was only after Mrs Dwyer died in 1991 that Ellen \nfirst began to make contact with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n806 In the publication Echoes of the Past, Don is quoted as saying:  We kept in touch with Ellen because we made \nit our business to. But the Welfare of the day wasn't any good you understand. They put up barriers. They wouldn't \ntell us where they took her. I used to pay somebody to track me down information. ... I wasn't allowed to see the girl \nanywhere unless I contacted the Welfare and they would ring up this person, the home where Ellen was and Sylvia \nand I would travel all the way from the bush and we didn't know much about Perth in those days.[1051]\n\n807 Ms Wendy Manchester, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Dwyer, Ellen's foster parents, provided a witness \nstatement in these proceedings. Ms Manchester recalled being present when Ellen was about nine or 10 years old \nand was told by Mr and Mrs Dwyer that she was a foster child, and that she had other family. Ms Manchester said \nthat 'during my upbringing, I can recall my parents telling my siblings that they should be proud of their aboriginal \nheritage'.[1052]  \n\n808 Ellen could not remember much of Don and Sylvia before she reached about 14 years of age, other than for a \nvague recollection of a few visits from them at the Dwyer's home when she was a child.  \n\n809 The first visit from Don and Sylvia which Ellen could clearly remember took place when Ellen was 14 years \nold. Ellen recollected that she felt embarrassed, and she recalled that Don smelled of alcohol. Don denied having \never visited Ellen when she was about 14 years of age,[1053] and Sylvia said that she was never drunk when she \n\n\n\nwent to the Dwyers' house.[1054] Ellen also recollected that on one visit, her two grandmothers visited along with \nDon and Sylvia, although she didn't know who they were at the time.  \n\n810 There was some documentary evidence from the files of the Department of Native Welfare and the Child \nWelfare Department in relation to the contact between Ellen and Don and Sylvia. A file note from the Department of \nNative Welfare's files dated 24 August 1964 indicated that Don and Sylvia had visited Ellen at the Dwyer's home \non several occasions.[1055]  \n\n811 A file note prepared by Ms Hobcroft following her visit or visits to the Dwyer's home on 27 January 1966 noted \nthat 'Mr and Mrs Collard, with several relatives in tow, visited before Christmas. Mrs Dwyer does not mind and \nHelen (ie Ellen) seems quite unaffected.'[1056]  \n\n812 A file note prepared by Ms Hobcroft following a visit to the Dwyers on 27 February 1968 indicated that Don and \nWilliam 'phoned when in Perth before Christmas. Date was set for a visit but family did not turn up. Helen (ie Ellen) \nnot particularly interested.'[1057]  \n\n813 A file note prepared by Ms Marchant of the Child Welfare Department following a visit or visits to the Dwyers \non 10 and 14 May 1968 noted that Ellen 'doesn't associate with aboriginals ... [Foster Mother] encourages her to \nidentify with her race and to be proud of it'.[1058]  \n\n814 Finally, an inspection report prepared by a Child Welfare Department Welfare Officer following a visit to Ellen \non 15 June 1972 noted that 'Father calls at home quite often. Drinks and puts up tales for money ... . Helen (ie \nEllen) has no desire to leave this family.'[1059]  \n\n815 Having regard to the evidence, I find that until Ellen was about four years old, Don and Sylvia were able to visit \nher by arrangement with the Department of Native Welfare, whenever they wished to do so, but provided that the \nDepartment was given some prior notice to arrange the visit.  \n\n816 I find that once Don and Sylvia made contact with the Dwyers, they were able to visit Ellen was often as they \nand Ellen wished, without any resistance from Mr and Mrs Dwyer, and that Mrs Dwyer, in particular, encouraged \nEllen to be proud of her aboriginal heritage. I find that neither the Department of Native Welfare, nor the Child \nWelfare Department prevented or impeded contact between Ellen and her biological family. Despite all of this, I find \nthat Ellen's contact with her family was quite infrequent, particularly once she became a teenager. However, it \nappears that this resulted from the nature of the relationship between Ellen and Don and Sylvia, rather than from \nany impediment created by any third party.  \n\nThe Siblings' contact with Don and Sylvia, and with other extended family members\n\n817 Sylvia's evidence was that after the Siblings were taken, she and Don would try and make regular visits to \nSister Kate's to see them. They would visit every two to three weeks. Sylvia said that they did not telephone before \nthey went to visit the children, but would just turn up. She said that the Siblings  would run from school to see us \nand then Sister Kate's would call the police. In fact every time we went to see the kids the staff there would call the \npolice just in case. ...\n\n We were never allowed to take the children out but there was a little shop across the road and we were allowed to \ntake them there. Our visits lasted about two hours.\n\n The children loved our visits, their eyes would light up when we arrived, but they would be so sad when we had to \ngo. ...\n\n I suppose in all, we got on reasonably well with the people from Sister Kate's. But things were never made easy for \nus to see our kids. They expressed that they didn't like it when we turned up to see the kids without calling first. ... \n\n\n\nSometimes we would arrive to see them, and would be told that they were out and were told off for not ringing \nbefore we arrived. They wanted us to ring first so that they could bring the children in for our visit.[1060]\n\n818 Sylvia's evidence was that when the older Siblings were transferred to Burnbrae it became harder to see \nthem.[1061]  \n\n819 In approximately 2002, when Don recounted his story for the publication 'Echoes of the Past Sister Kate's \nRevisited', he described his and Sylvia's visits to see the Siblings at Sister Kate's in the following way:  We still had \nto follow the work, because seasonal work was all you could do then but we made sure we went and visited them \nas much as we could. ... we made sure we went and visited them as much as we could. When it was time to leave, \nthey had big tears like marbles, they knew what was going to happen but we had to go. That Mr Daniel was a bit \nfiery, but I was a bit the same too. Sometimes they tried to lock us out of the gates. Not let us in the Home. He \nreckoned we were creating a disturbance, that we upset the kids all the time, all that rubbish. I became a bit \narrogant when he said that sort of stuff to me.[1062]\n\n820 The Siblings had different recollections of the extent to which they saw their parents. Bonnie recalled seeing \nher parents once or twice while she lived at Sister Kate's.[1063] She also recalled asking her cottage parents at \nSister Kate's if she could see Don and Sylvia for the holidays but this was always refused.[1064]  \n\n821 Darryl recalled visits from Don and Sylvia when he was at Sister Kate's. He recollected that they would visit \nabout once a month and sometimes a few times a month, and that sometimes they would come to watch him play \nfootball. He said:  It was so good when they did come, but it was also very sad when they left. I always wanted to go \nhome with Mum and Dad, but I was not allowed to and I was so angry about that. When they left I can remember it \nalways gave me a very empty feeling inside of me.[1065]\n\n822 Darryl recalled seeing Don and Sylvia only about four or five times during the whole time he was at Burnbrae, \nalthough he was told that they had come to see him on three or four other occasions but he had been out when \nthey came, and he had not seen them.[1066]  \n\n823 Beverley recalled that she saw her parents at least 4 times a year while she was at Sister Kate's. She also \nrecalled that sometimes her grandmothers would come with them, and that her grandmothers attended the f\u00eate at \nSister Kate's each year. Beverley also said:  I saw them turned away from the gate many times over the years and \neven turned away from our school if they tried to visit us there. I saw their car and would know they were at school \nor Sister Kate's but never got to see them.\n\n Sometimes I'd get back from a weekend or holiday foster placement and be told by other kids that I'd missed my \nmum and dad's visit while I was gone which upset me. They didn't always see all of us kids together; it was \nwhoever was at Sister Kate's at the time when and if they were allowed in to visit. If we were away or on foster \nplacements we missed them.[1067]\n\n824 Glenys' evidence was that she loved it when Don and Sylvia visited her at Sister Kate's:  I thought I was lucky \nbecause my Mum and Dad came quite often and brought my cousins and aunties and uncles with them. My Nanna \nBessie and her sisters would save up to come once a year at the Fete. Pop Collard would come occasionally with \nMum and Dad. Sometimes we were allowed out with them. Mum and Dad brought my new baby brothers with them \nand I loved meeting the new babies. I loved to tell the other kids about my family.\n\n I often cried for my Mum and Dad when they weren't there. I really missed them. One school day ... I saw my Dad \nand I ran really fast to get to him. I didn't want him to be sent away without me seeing him. I hadn't seen him for a \nlittle while and he told me that he had come but that I was gone. ...[1068]\n\n825 Glenys also said that her grandmother visited her every year at Sister Kate's, along with her two sisters.[1069]  \n\n826 Wesley's first memory of seeing Don and Sylvia was when he was around four years old.[1070] His evidence \nwas that he remembered his parents coming to see him a lot at Sister Kate's once or twice a month[1071] and that \nthe last time he saw them while he was at Sister Kate's was when he was about six years old.[1072]  \n\n\n\n827 Eva also recalled that Don and Sylvia came to see her at Sister Kate's, although her recollection was that they \ndid not come regularly, and she did not recall them coming to see her after she reached about eight years \nold.[1073]  \n\n828 There was also some documentary evidence which indicated that some of the Siblings were visited by their \ngrandmother. A note on the Department's file indicates that in early November 1970, Glenys received a visit from \nher maternal grandmother.[1074]  \n\n829 The evidence thus varied as to the frequency with which Don and Sylvia visited the Siblings at Sister Kate's. \nHaving regard to the broad consistency in the evidence of Don and Sylvia, Darryl and Glenys, I find that while all of \nthe Siblings were living at Sister Kate's, Don and Sylvia visited regularly, sometimes as often as every few weeks, \nbut otherwise at least once every month or two. I do not overlook the fact that Don and Sylvia were engaged in \nseasonal, casual farm work, which may have made it more difficult to travel away from Brookton, and that each \nvisit to the Siblings involved a drive from Brookton to Perth. I accept Don's recollection that they tried to visit the \nSiblings at Sister Kate's as often as they were able to. Sometimes other relatives (such as the Siblings' \ngrandparents) also visited. I find that the staff of Sister Kate's generally permitted these visits to occur.  \n\n830 Although the evidence given by Don and Sylvia suggested that they believed that it was not made easy for \nthem to see the Siblings, that belief appears to have derived from the fact that the staff of Sister Kate's preferred \nthat Don and Sylvia telephone in advance of a visit. There was no direct evidence as to whether this was an \napproach which was applied generally to all visiting parents, or whether it was applied solely to Don and Sylvia, or \nas to the rationale for that requirement. However, having regard to Sylvia's evidence, I infer that this requirement \nwas made of all parents and was intended to enable the staff to ensure that their children would be at Sister Kate's \n(rather than on an outing, or out playing sport, for example) at the time when their parents visited. In any event, \nthere was no evidence to suggest that the staff of Sister Kate's, or any officer of the Child Welfare Department, or \nthe Department of Native Welfare, sought to make it more difficult for Don and Sylvia, in particular, to visit the \nSiblings, or to discourage their visits.  \n\n831 In so far as Sylvia suggested that the staff of Sister Kate's called the police 'every time' they visited 'just in \ncase', I do not accept that evidence. There was no suggestion in the evidence given by any of the other plaintiffs \nthat the police were called, or often called, during visits by Don and Sylvia. On the contrary, the evidence given by \nthe Siblings suggests that their visits were happy occasions, and there is no suggestion that the visits were \nmarred by the arrival of the police.  \n\n832 Don's evidence does suggest that on some occasions, the staff of Sister Kate's refused to permit Don and \nSylvia to see the Siblings. There was no direct evidence in relation to why this occurred, but the implication from the \nversion of events Don gave in 2002 suggests that they were refused entry because they were creating a \ndisturbance. That would also explain why the police may have been called on occasion.  \n\n833 The evidence suggests that once Donald, Darryl and Bonnie moved to Burnbrae, the frequency of Don and \nSylvia's visits to the Siblings declined. This may simply have been due to the fact that with the Children then living \nin three different places, it may have been more difficult to visit them all with the same frequency as Don and \nSylvia had previously managed. However, it is not necessary to make a finding about that matter. For present \npurposes it suffices to say that there was nothing to suggest that the declining frequency of Don and Sylvia's visits \nwas the result of any requirement or impediment imposed by the staff of Burnbrae, or Sister Kate's, or of the Child \nWelfare Department or the Department of Native Welfare.  \n\n834 I turn to consider the evidence in relation to contact between Don and Sylvia and the Siblings who lived in \nfoster care. There was very little evidence of that kind. Beverley recalled seeing Don twice, and Sylvia once, while \nshe lived in foster care with Mrs Mathews.[1075] Sylvia acknowledged that she and Don were allowed to see \nBeverley when she lived in foster care.[1076] Wesley's recollection was that Don and Sylvia never visited him at \nthe Stephensons and he didn't knew if they even knew where he was. Although he missed them, he eventually \nstopped thinking about them over time.[1077]  \n\n\n\n835 The evidence thus suggested that once some of the Siblings moved into foster care, they saw Don and Sylvia \nquite infrequently. However, I do not overlook the fact that as the Siblings grew older, they took it upon themselves \nto run away and see Don and Sylvia themselves. The evidence does not permit any conclusion to be drawn as to \nwhy Don and Sylvia's visits to the Siblings became less frequent once some of the Siblings were in foster care. In \nparticular, there is no evidence to support a finding that the infrequency of the visits was the result of any \nrequirement or impediment imposed by the staff of the Child Welfare Department, or the Department of Native \nWelfare, or of any institution where any of the Siblings lived, or of the attitude of any foster parent.  \n\nThe Children's contact with each other\n\n836 The evidence in relation to the extent to which the Children saw each other during the terms of their wardships \nwas of three kinds. Each of the Children gave evidence about the extent to which they saw each other. Mrs Patullo \nalso gave some evidence about the extent to which the Siblings were permitted to have contact with each other \nduring their time at Sister Kate's. Finally, there was also some documentary evidence in relation to contact between \nthe Children.  \n\n837 Bonnie recollected that when they first went to Sister Kate's, she, Darryl and Donald were in the same cottage, \nEva and Wesley were in the nursery cottage, Glenys and Beverley were in the Kookaburra cottage, and William \nwas in Myalla cottage. Bonnie's evidence was that when she went to Sister Kate's she did not see her brothers and \nsisters, other than Donald and Darryl, because all of the other Siblings lived in different cottages. She said that the \nchildren at Sister Kate's only interacted with the children in their own cottages. However, Bonnie acknowledged that \nthe Siblings who were of school age all went to school together at Queens Park Primary School, while the younger \nSiblings who were old enough to do so went to kindy together at Sister Kate's. Bonnie also accepted that she saw \nthe rest of her Siblings when Don and Sylvia visited Sister Kate's.[1078] Bonnie also recalled attending school with \nDonald and Darryl when they lived at Burnbrae.[1079]  \n\n838 Darryl's evidence was broadly consistent with Bonnie's evidence in terms of the limited contact he had with the \nyounger Siblings when they were at Sister Kate's. He remembered going to school Queens Park Primary School \nwith Donald and Bonnie.[1080] Once he, Bonnie and Donald went to Burnbrae, they were separated from the \nyounger Siblings and did not see them.[1081] However, he went to school with Bonnie and Donald while they lived \nat Burnbrae.[1082]  \n\n839 Darryl also recalled that on one occasion he went with Don to visit Ellen at the Dwyer's home, but that the \nDwyers would not let them in.  \n\n840 Beverley's evidenceinchief was that she had only a little contact with the Siblings when they first went to Sister \nKate's. However, in crossexamination, she accepted that for some of the time when she was at Sister Kate's she \nhad contact with Glenys and Eva as they lived in the same cottage. She also had contact with Bonnie who lived in \nthe same cottage before Bonnie was sent to Burnbrae.[1083]  \n\n841 Beverley recalled that Glenys came to see her on one occasion while Beverley lived with Mrs Mathews. \nBeverley also recalled that while she was living with Mrs Mathews, she would visit Eva at Sister Kate's from time to \ntime.[1084]  \n\n842 In her evidenceinchief, Glenys indicated that she rarely saw her brothers and sisters while she was at Sister \nKate's because she spent most of her time with the children who lived in her cottage. However, in \ncrossexamination, Glenys accepted that she saw Eva and Wesley every morning in the first couple of years for \nkindy, because she could see them while they were playing. Glenys also accepted that Beverley lived in the \nKookaburra cottage from the time Glenys lived there, and that Eva joined them there after about 18 months or two \nyears.[1085] Glenys recalled Beverley and William going to Queens Park Primary School when she was \nthere.[1086]  \n\n843 Glenys also recollected that on one occasion Don took her for a visit to see Ellen at the Dwyer's house, and \nthat Don and Sylvia took her to see Donald, Darryl and Bonnie at Burnbrae on a few occasions.  \n\n844 Wesley's evidence was that he initially lived in the same cottage at Sister Kate's as Eva, whom he knew to be \nhis sister. He said he knew who his other brothers and sisters were, but did not have much contact with them at \n\n\n\nSister Kate's. He was able to socialise with them while they were at school,[1087] during lunchtimes and walking to \nand from school,[1088] and during visits from Don and Sylva.[1089]  \n\n845 Wesley's evidence was that between leaving Sister Kate's and reaching 14 years of age he only ever saw one \nother member of his family. He recalled that when he was eight or nine years old he went with Mr Stephenson and \nMr Stephenson's son Michael to see Beverley, who was then living at Mrs Price's house.[1090]  \n\n846 Eva's evidence was that while she was living at Sister Kate's she only saw the Siblings occasionally.  \n\n847 Mrs Patullo also gave some evidence about the contact between the children in the various cottages at Sister \nKate's. She said that there was not a great deal of interaction between children in different cottages during the day, \nbecause they had to do their chores and attend school. However, after school they were able to go outside to play \nand at that point the children from different cottages were able to play outside together on the grass.[1091]Mrs \nPatullo confirmed that although the children did not tend to go into each other's cottages, there was no restriction \non the children from different cottages playing together outside.  \n\n848 Having regard to all of this evidence, I find that while the Siblings lived at Sister Kate's they did not all live in the \none cottage. Instead, they lived in cottages with children of the same age group, including some of their Siblings. \nEventually, Donald, Darryl and Bonnie moved to Burnbrae, and the remaining Siblings, possibly with the exception \nof William, lived in cottages with at least one other Sibling. Although as the Siblings moved into foster care, that \nposition changed over time, until eventually only Eva remained at Sister Kate's. There were, however, opportunities \nfor the Siblings to have some contact with each other while they lived at Sister Kate's: during play time at Sister \nKate's, and at school, and when Don and Sylvia visited.  \n\n849 There was no evidence to suggest that the staff of Sister Kate's sought to prevent the Siblings having contact \nwith each other during these times. There was also no evidence that any officers of the Child Welfare Department \nor the Department of Native Welfare were able to, or did, determine whether and how much contact there should be \nbetween the Siblings.  \n\n850 On the other hand, there was some limited evidence to support the conclusion that at least by the late 1960s, \nofficers of the Child Welfare Department considered it desirable for the Siblings to have contact with each other. A \nnote from the Child Welfare Department's files in relation to Wesley contains a record of comments apparently \nmade by Wesley's foster mother, Mrs Stephenson, who stated that 'when we first took the boy, we were told that his \n'siblings' were of great importance and I must arrange for him to see them from time to time'. Mrs Stephenson \nreported that she had done so until 1969 when Wesley met some of his siblings while visiting the Royal Show with \nher, but that that contact did not end happily for reasons which she did not explain.[1092] There was also a file note \nof the Child Welfare Department from November 1972, in which it was noted that Beverley had expressed a wish to \nmake contact with Ellen. A welfare officer from the Department sought to facilitate this by suggesting that the girls \nfirst write to each other (given that they had never met), following which a meeting could be considered.[1093]  \n\n(m) The process followed, and factors considered, by officers of the Child Welfare Department and the Department \nof Native Welfare during the late 1950s and early 1960s by which an application would be made for an order that a \nchild be made a ward  \n\n851 There was some evidence about the way in which officers of the Child Welfare Department and Department of \nNative Welfare carried out their duties relevant to the welfare of children and more specifically as to the enquiries \nand investigations which were made by officers of those Departments for the purpose of determining whether an \napplication should be made for a child to be declared a ward.  \n\n852 As I have already noted, Mr Long's evidence was that as a patrol officer for the Department of Native Welfare, \nhis duties included patrolling the district, visiting aboriginal communities to locate and identify aboriginal people, \nand assisting aboriginal people, such as by securing work or arranging school attendance.[1094] He would provide \nhis patrol notes to the District Officer, who would then communicate with the Commissioner in respect of any action \nwhich was required.[1095]  \n\n\n\n853 Mr Humphries (who prepared the 1961 Informative Report which formed the basis for the application to the \nChildren's Court for the Siblings to be made wards) provided a witness statement in which he deposed that  ... it \nwas our usual practice to visit the home of a suspected neglect case at least once before giving evidence in \ncourt.[1096]\n\n854 Mr Humphries also deposed that it was  not my practice to simply rely upon the reports of others when giving \nevidence in court. The normal practice was that Mr Wright-Webster would receive a report from a Police officer or \nanother person about a possible neglect case, and then I or another officer of the Department would then be \ninstructed to visit the house to investigate.\n\n ...\n\n When we visited a house to investigate a possible neglect case we checked such things as the condition of the \nchild, whether there was food in the house, and whether the parents were drunk. ... The parents being drunk was \nthe most common factor in applications for committal orders as I recall.[1097]\n\n855 The evidence provided by Ms Jean Hamory was consistent with Mr Humphries' recollection about the \nDepartment's practice at the time. Ms Hamory's evidence was:  It was the practice of the Department that, where \nthere was evidence about danger to a child, a decision would have to be made as to whether the Department would \napply to the Court to request that the child be made a ward of the State.\n\n A Welfare Officer was authorised to investigate, collect evidence, and to decide, in consultation with their \nSupervisor, whether there was enough evidence of the danger to the child's welfare for an application to proceed.\n\n By evidence, I mean physical evidence, such as ... evidence from someone who could act as a witness ... .\n\n In some cases, parents presented their children to the Department requesting the Department to take care of their \nchildren.\n\n I tried to avoid the court process wherever possible as such applications were often distressing to the parents and \nthe children.\n\n However, in some cases of neglect, the child's welfare required that an application be made to authorise the \nDepartment to manage a child's welfare, where the parents were not capable of doing so.\n\n When a Welfare Officer, in consultation with their Supervisor, decided to apprehend a child, it was the Welfare \nOfficer's job to take the child to a receiving home and to place an application before the Children 's Court within two \ndays.\n\n ...\n\n It was my preference to communicate with the parents of children who had become wards of the State. Where a \nparent wished for the return of his or her child, I would occasionally encourage that parent to write to the \nDepartment asking for the return of his or her child.\n\n This would instigate an administrative process to enable some consideration of whether a child could be returned \nto the parent and where I considered that there was merit in returning a child to his or her parents, I would write a \nreport supporting such a move.\n\n\n\n However, I often found that parents did not utilise this process.[1098]\n\n856 Ms Stephanie Keating deposed that to investigate allegations of harm to children, she would visit families in \ntheir homes and assess the child. If she formed the view that removal of the child was warranted, she would provide \nthat information to the Department's solicitor and that solicitor would make an application to the Children's Court for \nthe removal of the child. If the Court made an order for the removal of the child, the child would be placed with \nfoster parents.[1099]  \n\n857 Since the 1970s, however, there has been a gradual change in the practices of officers of the Department, \nincluding more detailed investigations into a child's circumstances before a decision would be made to make an \napplication to the Children's Court for a child to be made a ward, and more limited orders concerning wardships. \nThat gradual change in approach appears to have coincided with a greater knowledge and understanding on the \npart of welfare officers in the Department of the implications of the removal of children from their families, which I \ndiscuss below.  \n\n858 The evidence of this change can be seen in the witness statements provided by Mr Kenneth Monson, Mr \nTerence Mulroney (who was involved in the apprehension of children who appeared to be abandoned or neglected \nduring his time as a social worker in the early 1970s) and Mr Desmond Semple. Mr Monson deposed that the \nprocess of a child being apprehended and placed in care was complex and involved thorough case planning, \ninvolved the collection of information about the child's circumstances from various sources, visits to the child's \nhome to ascertain the circumstances of the family and to determine if a child was at risk and the severity of the risk, \nand a consideration of any alternatives to the removal of the child.[1100]  \n\n859 Mr Mulroney observed that  as time progressed, the inquiry into the background of a child has become more \nand more extensive, and as such, matters are not brought on in court as quickly as they were in the early 1970s \nwhen I started as a social worker.[1101]\n\n860 Mr Mulroney's evidence was that:  During the apprehension of a child ... my primary legal responsibility was the \nwellbeing of the child.\n\n I understood that this could not be looked at in isolation, and needed to include an examination of the child's \ncontext, including their family situation.\n\n The main question I would pose is how we could maintain the child within their home setting, and this would require \nexamination of the family's resources and their capabilities, and whether attempts could be made to try and build \nthe skills and capabilities of the family if they were deficient.\n\n In some cases, the skills and behaviour of parents of a child were so deficient there was a need to remove the child \nfrom their home setting. This was always a difficult, lifechanging decision.[1102]\n\n861 Mr Mulroney also deposed that the parents of the child were required to attend Court hearings at the Children's \nCourt, and many would attend and would put their view forward.[1103] He also deposed that in the early 1970s,  \nwardship was generally ordered for a period of years, or until a child turned 18. As time progressed, orders \ncommitting a child to the care of the State became far more specific, with shorter periods ordered, and more \nspecific, special objectives attached to the order.[1104]\n\n862 Mr Semple recollected that during his time as a social worker between 1970 and 1973, he made only two \napplications for the removal of a child from his or her family.[1105] In other cases, he was able to identify a solution \nother than the removal of the child.[1106] He deposed that the investigation of a child's circumstances would \ninclude obtaining information from a variety of community resources familiar with the child including government \ndepartments, nongovernment community based agencies, aboriginal organisations and the child's school. Then aim \nof such an investigation was to identify the relevant circumstances of the child, and to determine what would be the \nbest and least disruptive course for the future care and protection of the child.[1107]  \n\n863 Mr Semple deposed that when he was a social worker within the Department in the early 1970s, it was well \nunderstood by people within the Department although not strictly enshrined in written policy, that there was an \n\n\n\nemphasis on fully investigating a child's background, attempting to develop a course of action which involved \nminimal disruption to the child (but adequate care and protection) and ensuring siblings were placed together \nwherever possible.[1108] He also recalled that as a Supervisor in the Kimberley in 1975, there was an emphasis on \ncommunity development, and the number of children removed from home was significantly decreased as a \nresult.[1109]  \n\n864 The change in approach can also be seen in the evidence given by Mr Maine, who was asked about whether \napplications for wardship, during the period when the Children were made wards, were contested. It was put to Mr \nMaine that in the late 1950s and early 1960s those court proceedings were 'onesided' in the sense that the \nDepartment's officers attended, but a parent would be unrepresented.[1110] Mr Maine's evidence was:  That view \n[as to contested applications] wasn't held then. It's a view that has occurred in more recent years. The court was \npresumed to be focused on the best interests of the child and the evidence given by departmental officers was in \nrelation to the circumstances in which the child was living at the time and recommending the child's removal. The \nparents were usually, but not always, present in the court and it wasn't the custom or requirement, either \nlegislatively or otherwise, for there to be anyone representing the parents as such. Also a legal officer, usually from \nthe department, attended the courts in some cases, but that legal officer's function wasn't so much to represent the \nchild, but just to make sure the legalities of the department's presentation were correct.\n\n865 Mr Maine acknowledged that a challenge to the view the Department's officers put to the Court was 'unlikely' in \nthose days:[1111]  There would be questions asked by the Children's Court bench and the department had to \nsatisfy the magistrate or Children's Court members that their circumstances were correct and that the evidence \nprovided by the department was satisfactory.\n\n866 Having regard to all of this evidence, I make the following findings. In the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the \nprocess by which an application would be made for a child to be taken into care involved information coming to the \nattention of an officer of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department to suggest that a child \nwas neglected. An officer of that Department would then visit the child's home at least once to inspect the child's \ncircumstances, including living conditions at the home, the child's physical condition and other matters such as \nwhether the parents were drinking. The welfare officer would then discuss the case with his or her supervisor. If it \nwas determined that the child was being 'neglected' within the meaning of that term in the Child Welfare Act, an \napplication would be made to the Children's Court. An officer of the Department would give evidence at the hearing \nbefore the Court based on the investigation which had been made. The child's parents were not usually legally \nrepresented at those hearings. If the Court made an order that a child be made a ward, that order would usually be \nin the form that the child be a ward for a period of years, or until the child reached 18 years of age.  \n\n867 From about the 1970s, however, the investigations undertaken by officers of the Child Welfare Department into \nthe circumstances of a child suspected of being neglected became more thorough, there was an increasing \nemphasis on identifying the best course for the future care and protection of the child which involved minimal \ndisruption to the child's life, applications for children to be made wards became less common, and when those \napplications were made, the orders sought and made by the Court became more specific, with shorter periods of \nwardship ordered, and more specific, special objectives attached to the order.  \n\n868 Having regard to the findings I have made in relation to when the Children were made wards, I find that the \napproach of the officers of the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department who were involved \nin those applications reflected departmental practices at the time, and that the orders sought and made that each of \nthe Children be made a ward until he or she reached 18 years of age also reflected the approach which was \ngenerally taken at the time.  \n\n(n) Was the removal of the Children undertaken pursuant to a policy of assimilation of aboriginal children?  \n\n869 At this point, it is appropriate to address an issue which was occasionally raised in the course of the hearing, \nalthough not vigorously pursued by counsel for the plaintiffs, namely whether the removal of the Children was \nundertaken pursuant to a policy whereby aboriginal children were sought to be assimilated into the 'white' \ncommunity.  \n\n870 There was very little evidence of a policy of assimilation within the Department of Native Welfare or the Child \nWelfare Department during the period of the wardships of the Children. The only evidence which made any \n\n\n\nreference to a policy of assimilation was a letter from a bishop in the Kimberley to the Minister for Native Welfare in \n1962 in which the bishop noted that  the current official policy of the Native Welfare Department is the policy of \nassimilation. We regard this as a sound policy because the Natives in the Kimberleys ... have been \ndetribalised.[1112]\n\n871 However, the bishop went on to express his concern about the implementation and application of this policy. \nHe suggested that the Minister should 'proceed with caution rather than precipitate the process of \nassimilation'.[1113] A briefing note prepared for the Minister by the Deputy Commissioner of Native Welfare on 19 \nSeptember 1962 indicated, in relation to this latter point, that 'this, I think, is what the various Governments have \nbeen doing'.[1114] The Deputy Commissioner went on to say that 'much advance has been made in the past ten \nyears but there is still much to be done. The speed at which the advancement of natives is going on is governed by \nthe finance and staff (both government and private) available and, above all, the knowledge of those directing the \ndestiny of the natives.'[1115]  \n\n872 There was some evidence that within the Child Welfare Department, raising aboriginal children at Sister Kate's \nwas thought to facilitate their assimilation into white society. The Director provided a briefing note to the Minister for \nChild Welfare prior to a visit by the Minister to Sister Kate's in July 1961. In that briefing note, the Director noted \nthat  the Home is a haven for partcoloured children and probably one of the greatest agencies for the assimilation of \ncoloured children in the State. Children go to State School nearby where assimilation in their age groups is \ncomplete and unquestioned.[1116]\n\n873 The references to 'assimilation' in the evidence I have set out above are not sufficient to support a finding on \nthe balance of probabilities that at the time of the wardships there was, within the Department of Native Welfare or \nthe Child Welfare Department, the pursuit of a policy of assimilation of aboriginal people into white Australian \nsociety which through the wardship of aboriginal children.  \n\n874 More particularly, there was no evidence that the decisions to apply for each of the Children to be made wards \nwere made in the pursuit of a policy of assimilation of aboriginal people into white Australian society. Rather, the \nevidence supports the finding that the decisions to apply for the Children to be made wards, and subsequent \ndecisions at various times not to return them to the care of Don and Sylvia, were all made having regard to the \nwelfare \u2013 albeit primarily the physical welfare of the Children.  \n\n875 At the same time, other evidence (to which I will refer in a moment) indicated that in the late 1950s and early \n1960s there was very little awareness or appreciation within the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare \nDepartment of the emotional implications of the removal of children from their families. The emphasis at the time \nappears to have been on the physical wellbeing of children, as opposed to their emotional wellbeing.  \n\n876 In addition, other evidence (to which I will refer in a moment) indicated that in the late 1950s and early 1960s \nthere was very little awareness or appreciation within the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare \nDepartment of the importance to aboriginal people of their family relationships and their culture.  \n\n877 Before turning to address that evidence, it is appropriate to mention one further matter. One striking aspect of \nthe evidence in relation to the conditions in which Don and Sylvia and their family lived in 1959, in 1961, and \nthrough to 1970, was that those living conditions were not materially different from the living conditions of aboriginal \npeople living on reserves, including on the Brookton Reserve. (In fact, in one respect, namely the construction of \nthe humpy, the evidence suggested that the humpy was superior to the accommodation provided on the Brookton \nReserve, where the walls of the humpies on the Reserve did not meet the floor.) It was clear from the evidence of \nDon and Sylvia, in particular, that they did not understand why the Children were made wards when their living \nconditions were no worse than conditions at the Brookton Reserve. Four points can be made about the relevance \nof the living conditions of aboriginal people on the Brookton Reserve to the issues in dispute in this action.  \n\n878 First, there was no evidence as to whether, at the relevant time, applications were made to the Children's Court \nin relation to any aboriginal children from the Brookton Reserve, on the basis that those were neglected because of \ntheir living conditions. Secondly, even if no such applications were made it is far from clear how that would be \nrelevant to whether the State breached fiduciary duties it is said to have owed to the plaintiffs in this case. Thirdly, \nthe evidence of Mr Maine was that the same approach was taken in relation to all children suspected of being \n\n\n\nneglected whether or not they lived on an aboriginal reserve. I set out the relevant portion of his evidence on this \nissue at [371] to [372] above:  \n\n879 Fourthly, Mr Maine's evidence was that the living conditions of aboriginal people on reserves would have been \na central factor taken into account by the Child Welfare Department in any case of the neglect of a child living on a \nreserve because the impoverished conditions on the reserve may have contributed to the child being considered a \nneglected child. The import of Mr Maine's evidence was that the accommodation and living conditions of aboriginal \nchildren living on reserves (or living in similar circumstances, as the Children were) figured prominently in \nconsideration of whether those children were neglected for the purposes of the Child Welfare Act, by virtue of the \nvery impoverished nature of that accommodation and conditions.  \n\n880 I turn, next, to consider the evidence as to the knowledge or awareness, possessed by officers of the \nDepartment of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department, in the 1950s and 1960s, about the psychological \nimplications for children of their removal from their families.  \n\n(o) The knowledge possessed by officers in the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department of \nthe potential adverse psychological implications for children removed from their families  \n\n881 In this section of my reasons I deal with:  \n\n(i) the extent to which officers in the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department were aware of \nthe possible adverse emotional or psychological consequences for children separated from their families;  \n\n(ii) whether such knowledge impacted on decisions by departmental officers as to whether children should be taken \ninto care; and  \n\n(iii) whether such knowledge impacted on decisions by departmental officers as to the kind of care into which \nchildren should be placed after being made wards.  \n\n(i) The extent to which officers in the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department were aware \nof the possible adverse emotional or psychological consequences for children separated from their families\n\n882 Mr Maine was asked about his knowledge of an influential paper published in 1951 and written by John Bowlby \non the effects on young children of separation from their mothers.[1117] Mr Maine explained that Mr Bowlby's paper \nwas the product of  an extensive study in the postwar years that examined the after effects of separating children \nfrom their primary carer who is usually the mother, and it made clear that in nearly all cases this is a traumatic \nexperience for the child and the child is likely to suffer some longterm effects of it.[1118]\n\n883 As I have already observed, Mr Maine was asked whether the implications for children separated from their \nfamilies were known by the staff of the Child Welfare Department in the 1950s. Mr Maine's evidence was that \nknowledge of the impact of separation was 'generally known [at that time] but not with the same strength that it \nbecame [known]'.[1119]  \n\n884 There was also some evidence to suggest that staff of the Department of Native Welfare had a general \nawareness of the potential adverse impacts on children as a result of separation from their parents. Mr Long \ndeposed that he did not have any anthropological training, nor did he receive any specific training from the \nDepartment.[1120] However, he deposed that the Commissioner issued each departmental officer with a copy of a \npublication which Mr Long said was entitled 'Child Care and the Growth of Mother Love' by John Beilby. (This \nappears very likely to have been a reference to a book in fact written by John Bowlby and published in 1953 entitled \n'Child Care and the Growth of Love'. Counsel for the plaintiffs referred to the 1953 work as a republication of \nBowlby's 1951 paper.) Mr Long deposed that this book was provided to departmental officers 'as a general guide to \nthe principles of avoiding institutional placement of neglected children'.[1121]  \n\n885 Also in evidence was a memorandum dated 20 November 1959 from the District Officer for the Central District \nof the Department of Native Welfare to the Director, on the topic of 'juvenile delinquency'.[1122] In the \nmemorandum, the District Officer noted:  The obvious physical advantages of having the children raised and \neducated in the Missions, instead of the squalor and neglect of the camps, has, I am afraid, tended to overshadow \nthe tremendous psychological disadvantage to the individual children of denying them the emotional security of \nfamily love and acceptance.\n\n\n\n886 Mr Maine confirmed that he agreed with this general statement and that he would have agreed with the \nsentiment in 1959 as well.[1123]  \n\n887 There was evidence to indicate that over time there was an increase in the awareness of departmental officers \nof the possible adverse emotional impact on children as a result of separation from their parents increased over \ntime. Mr Maine was asked about when and how this increase in knowledge came about and he said:  Well, it didn't \nhappen in a particular year. It was something that happened as knowledge about the traumatic effects of separation \nwas gained by staff as a result of training sessions with staff, as a result of policy directions in the department. A lot \nof influences would have gradually firmed up and strengthened the expectation that ... the child's connections with \nhis parents should be retained as much as possible unless there was something adverse about them. That would \nhave been, I think, a viewpoint that grew in strength over quite a number of years.[1124]\n\n888 As Mr Maine explained, part of this increase in knowledge within the Child Welfare Department can be \nattributed to an increase in the number of psychologists and social workers employed in the Department. Mr Maine \nexplained that in 1958 there was no tertiary training in social work available in Western Australia[1125] so \nconsequently, when he started with the Department:  [T]here was ... only one social worker in the department and it \ntook some time for that to change as a result of trained social workers and others, psychologists, coming out from \nuniversities and also as a result of our recruitment programs to recruit staff from other states and other countries \nand as a result of our internal training program that took experienced staff and sent them to university for the \nnecessary qualification in social work and by the end by the time I retired, the great majority of field staff would have \nbeen professionally trained.[1126]\n\n889 The limited training for staff in child welfare institutions in Western Australia in the 1960s was confirmed by \nsome correspondence which was in evidence concerning the establishment of the Longmore Remand Centre. In a \nletter to a colleague in South Australia in late 1964, Mr Maine (who at that stage was a clinical psychological with \nthe Child Welfare Department) noted that there were several ideas incorporated into Longmore which were not \nusually found in Australian detention homes, including the ability to undertake assessment and treatment of \npsychological and behavioural issues within the institution itself. Group workers were expected to contribute in the \nassessment and treatment of the children, particularly in so far as their judgments and opinions would be taken into \naccount, and the staff were to undertake training at technical college or university to enable them to contribute in \nthis way.[1127]  \n\n890 Having regard to all of this evidence, I find that in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, officers of the \nDepartment of Native Welfare, and of the Child Welfare Department, had a general awareness that removing \nchildren from their families could have adverse emotional and psychological impacts on those children. I also find \nthat the extent of this knowledge within the Departments, and the knowledge possessed by individual officers of the \nsignificance of those potential adverse consequences, increased gradually over the years as a result of an increase \nin the number of trained psychologists and social workers being employed in those Departments, and as a result of \ngreater staff training in these matters.  \n\n(ii) Whether such knowledge impacted on decisions by departmental officers as to whether children should be taken \ninto care\n\n891 The evidence established that in the late 1950s and the 1960s, it was accepted within the Child Welfare \nDepartment, and within the Department of Native Welfare, that in some cases it would be necessary to remove \nneglected children from their home environment, notwithstanding the potentially adverse emotional consequences \nfor those children of doing so. That point was made very clearly by Mr Maine in his evidence. He said:  There are \nsome circumstances in which in spite of that principle it is necessary to remove a child. This can be necessary if \nyou cannot bring to bear supportive services that might assist the mother, or whoever is caring for the child, to care \nfor it in a proper and sufficient way. That would be the circumstance in most of the cases that the department would \nget involved in. There were not general services available in the community that could be brought in to assist a \nparent in those circumstances, assuming your parent would have accepted them. In many cases parents in that \nsituation won't acknowledge that their care is insufficient and would resent somebody coming in, so there needs to \nbe available people who are properly trained to handle the complexities of that situation. And that's a reality the \ndepartment has to work with. If there are no support services available, as there generally wasn't during those \n\n\n\nyears, they have developed since, then the department had to accept that it might be necessary to remove the child \nfrom the parents' care. The alternative way, if the child was left there, it was likely that the child would suffer further \nharm and in some cases perish.[1128]\n\n892 The memorandum from the District Officer in the Department of Native Welfare to the Director dated 20 \nNovember 1959, to which I referred at [845], made the same point. Having acknowledged the psychological \ndisadvantages for children in removing them from their families, the officer noted:  I am convinced that the answer \ndoes not lie in removing native children from their home environments, bad as they sometimes are, but in raising \nthe general social standards of the complete native families.\n\n The first, most obvious steps (and those most difficult to accomplish) are to break the vicious circle of restricted \nseasonal rural employment, and stabilise the families by raising their economic standards and providing them with \nadequate housing. At the same time it is desirable to augment the already effective programme of child education \nbeing conducted by the Education Department with education of the adults in social usages and responsibilities. ...\n\n Despite these measures, however, it is distressingly frequently necessary due to urgency to remove native children \nfrom the environment which gives rise to their neglect and supplant their care and custody by their parents with \ncare, custody, and control by State authority.\n\n ...\n\n Where possible the facilities of this Department are used and the present emphasis is to use selected foster \nhomes, particularly with single children (as opposed to family groups) in preference to institutions, to promote the \ndevelopment of individual personality.[1129]\n\n(iii) Whether such knowledge impacted on decisions by departmental officers as to the kind of care into which \nchildren should be placed after being made wards\n\n893 As the latter memorandum suggests, the recognition that a child's removal from his or her family would \nsometimes be necessary notwithstanding the adverse psychological consequences in doing so, resulted in a \nchange in thinking within the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department, over time, about \nhow best to provide care for wards in a way which secured and promoted their emotional and psychological \nwellbeing, as well as their physical wellbeing.  \n\n894 Mr Maine confirmed that this change in thinking did not happen at a particular point in time. His evidence as to \nthe way that this change in thinking came about was as follows:  The changes that we have been talking about are \nchanges that occurred gradually as knowledge of the broader field of child placement became more widespread, as \nthere was a deeper understanding of the effects upon a child's development in its growth and development \naccording to where it was placed, whether an institution or a family home. As that kind of knowledge widened, then \npeople's focus in making a placement became more influenced by the desirability of placement that met the \nrequirements of possible contact with a parent, maintaining family connections and so on. If you went back 50 or 60 \nyears, it would have been people whose first choice would have been an institution because they believe that in an \ninstitution you will find certain things the children would need by way of discipline, regular meals or care and so on \nand they would have been less mindful of the emotional sides of children's development. It has only been in the \nyears since the influence of psychology and social work and research that the importance of the emotional \nattachment is a primary one, and as that viewpoint has become more dominant, then when making a placement \nthat's the first thing that people think of.[1130]\n\n895 I find that from the late 1950s through to the late 1970s, there was a gradual shift within the Department of \nNative Welfare and the Child Welfare Department in relation to the merits of institutional care versus foster care for \nwards. I find that this change in thinking manifested, over time, in a preference for foster care rather than \ninstitutional care, and in the context of institutional care manifested in a preference for smaller, community based \nhostels, rather than large scale institutional care.  \n\n\n\n896 That this shift in thinking took place over a lengthy period can be discerned from the memorandum from the \nDistrict Officer dated 20 November 1959 referred to at [845], and was confirmed in Mr Maine's evidence. He was \nasked about the position in 1968, and observed that by then there had been a 'longstanding policy' within the Child \nWelfare Department that 'where a child can be placed out in the care of a relative or related person and that person \nis suitable, then that placement should be used'.[1131] He made clear that that change in policy was not confined to \nfoster care by family members, but pertained to the use of foster arrangements as opposed to institutional \ncare.[1132] I accept Mr Maine's evidence.  \n\n897 However, the use of foster care was not always possible, as Mr Maine noted in his evidence:  When it became \nnecessary to place a child in foster care, the officer making the place would have looked at what is available and \nthe placement of preference would have been a placement with people who were relatives if that was feasible.\n\n ... In some cases relatives have bad relations with one another and it's impractical to do that.\n\n ... So if that was not possible, the placement with relatives, then they would have looked at other alternative \nplacements.[1133]\n\n898 Quite apart from the practical difficulties associated with placing wards in foster care with family members, \nthere was also a shortage of foster care places. Mr Terence Mulroney deposed that as a social worker in the Child \nWelfare Department in the early 1970s he was involved in the selection of foster families. His evidence was that:  I \ncan recall there was always a shortage of foster parents. It was a large responsibility, and not financially attractive. \nWe tended to select people who had demonstrated success in raising and caring for their own family.[1134]\n\n899 I find that during the period of the wardships, despite an increasing recognition that foster care was the \npreferable form of care for wards, it was not always possible to place all wards in foster care (not least because of a \nshortage of foster carers) and consequently, there remained a need for alternative forms of residential care for \nwards.  \n\n900 The change in thinking about the desirability of smaller, community based institutional care, rather than large \nscale institutional care was evident by the early 1970s. In a memorandum written in early 1972 by Mr Maine, then \nthe Director of the Child Welfare Department, to the Commissioner, Mr Maine discussed plans by the Board of \nSister Kate's to replace the existing facilities at Sister Kate's with modern cottage homes and to add a kindergarten, \ncultural centre and other facilities. Mr Maine observed:  As one cottage is already completed, the Board appears to \nbe committed to the project. This is unfortunate because current thinking on child care does not favour the concept \nof cottage homes grouped together to form a large institution for long term residential care, other than in special \ninstances where the care of children with certain handicaps is involved. Young children require living conditions as \nnear as possible to a normal home and community environment. We have never considered that a hostel provides \na complete substitute for family home life. However, hostels located in the community approximate this. The \nchildren are then easily able to use the local facilities available to normal families and they are able to more \nnaturally intermingle and interact with the general population with whom they have the opportunity to identify. The \ngreatest advantage is that they are enabled to see themselves as part of the larger, total community rather than \nmembers of a segregated group.\n\n When hostels are clustered together, they form no less than an institution, with all the undesirable factors than \nemanate from institutional life.\n\n Nowadays the only circumstances under which such a plan would be justified is when the occupants of the hostels \nrequire a degree of protection or control that is not available to them in the community.\n\n\n\n ... It is our intention to progressively place out from institutions all those children whose social and develop mental \nneeds can be better met by alternative arrangements. Such a policy will have regard to all of the factors affecting a \nchild's total welfare and the capacity of existing and new facilities in the community to absorb children.\n\n Other child care organisations in this State are expanding and modernising their facilities by building scattered \nhomes in the community. The Native Welfare Department's own hostels are disbursed throughout the metropolitan \narea. ...[1135]\n\n901 Mr Maine's understanding was that at that time (that is, 1972) the Salvation Army, Methodist Church and the \nAnglican Church in Western Australia also proposed to establish decentralised cottages in the community when \nfurther child care facilities were required.[1136]  \n\n902 Following on from that correspondence, in June 1972 Mr Maine sent the superintendent of Sister Kate's some \nextracts from journal articles and text books in relation to the 'desirable policy of decentralising institutional facilities \nso that the majority of children requiring substitute home care are placed in the community'.[1137] The tenor of the \npublications extracted was to highlight the physical, mental and social disadvantage of children in large institutions, \nand the need for accommodation that resembled, as closely as possible, normal family living in the community, \nwhether in foster homes or in cottage homes located in the community.[1138]  \n\n903 There was also evidence that a related factor considered in relation to the placement of wards was the \ndesirability of keeping siblings together. Another aspect of John Bowlby's work was his view that in the context of \ngroup care for children it was important that siblings be kept together to give each other comfort and support, and \nthat separating siblings and dividing children into care groups by age and sex could be destructive for their mental \nhealth. Mr Maine confirmed that he agreed with this general sentiment.[1139] He was also asked whether this was \nknown in the 1950s, and he said:  I don't know that it would have been known in the sense of the way you have just \nread it out but most people would have known that you should seek to give the child what comfort you can ... \n.[1140]\n\n904 The evidence suggested that even by the 1970s, there was no formal policy within the Child Welfare \nDepartment that wards who were siblings should be kept together in whatever care arrangement was made for \nthem. However, there was, by that stage, a general acceptance within the Child Welfare Department that efforts \nshould be made to ensure siblings were kept together. Mr Monson provided a witness statement in which he \ndeposed that he could not recall a formal policy document being in place in 1969 1970 that articulated an emphasis \non siblings being placed together. However, his evidence was that he would try and ensure siblings remained \ntogether on placements where possible, although this was often difficult to achieve.[1141] Mr Desmond Semple \ndeposed in his witness statement that 'during his time as a social worker [the] prevailing thought [was] that siblings \nshould be kept together wherever possible'.[1142] Similarly, Mr Terence Mulroney, recalled 'a general philosophy in \nthe Department that siblings should be kept together where possible'[1143] although he could not recall any written \npolicy that dictated siblings should be kept together.[1144]  \n\n905 However, it was not always possible to place siblings together in either foster care placements, or in \ninstitutional care. Mr Maine was asked about the feasibility, in 1961, of finding a place where eight siblings might \nlive together. He said that the challenges in doing so:  would have been extreme. It would be well, it obviously was. \nThe fact [was] that there were no placements available that could take eight children no foster placements \navailable. The only placements available would have been an institution and then you would have had to \nacknowledge that the children might be separated to some extent by the institution's policies on placement.[1145]\n\n906 The fact that institutions such as Sister Kate's did permit siblings to be kept together was acknowledged by Mr \nMulroney in his witness statement, where he said:  In the early 1960s, group homes, including 'cottages' such as \nthose at Sister Kate's were beginning to open up, and a cottage mother and father would be able to take a number \nof children and care for them on a residential basis.\n\n There were also department owned residences which employed livein carers on a contractual basis.\n\n\n\n These group facilities were somewhat helpful in my experience as a social worker in the early 1970s in trying to \nkeep siblings groups together.[1146]\n\n907 However, in his evidence, Mr Maine said that his understanding was that Sister Kate's did not place children in \ncottages by reference to their family relationships:  ... I think the policy on placement of children within the individual \ncottages was governed more by the ages of the children than it was by their family relationships ... but most of the \nchildren siblings would have been on the same campus, so there would have been adequate opportunity for \nchildren siblings to have contact relations with one another, but I gather that the policy of placing children more \naccording to age was as much as anything due to the skills and abilities of the cottage mothers. Some cottage \nmothers are good at managing little children, others are good are managing adolescents and it makes it easier for \noverall management if given that there are usually eight to 12 or more children in each cottage, if the placements \nare done according to that practice, but I don't I'm not an expert on the placement policies of children Sister Kate's \nplacement of children.[1147]\n\n908 Mr Maine acknowledged that the Child Welfare Department did not become involved in the placement of \nchildren within an institution such as Sister Kate's:  That was a matter for the manager of the institution to decide on \ntheir practices as far as the placement of children was concerned. Generally, I don't think the department interfered \nwith that, but staff in these institutions would have been, like everybody else, developing a new awareness of the \nmain important things to sustain when children are moved out of their own homes and there would always, I think in \nmost cases, be a bit of a conflict between whether you place them according to broad age bands or whether you \nplace them according to their existing relationships and in an institution like Sister Kate's, I would believe it would \nbe possible to achieve the desired outcome, given that the institution in one way or another catered for both those \nthings.[1148]\n\n909 By 1974, the Child Welfare Department had adopted a policy that foster care was the preferred form of \nplacement, but if that was not open, cottage homes located in the community, rather than in large institutional \nsettings, were the preferable placement option. The development of this policy position, and the rationale for it, was \ndiscussed by Ms Susan Booth, a social worker and later social work supervisor with the Child Welfare Department \nin the 1970s, in the witness statement she prepared in these proceedings. Ms Booth said:  Until 1973 when the \nChild Placement Service was established, there was limited formal policy or advice to departmental officers on the \nplacement of children who had been committed to the care of the State, or were otherwise under the supervision of \nthe Department. Foster care was a major form of outofhome placement of wards and other nonward children unable \nto live with their own families. There was also a low level of supply of foster carers relative to the level of demand \nfor placements of children considered as requiring fostering.\n\n ... Foster placement breakdown was a common occurrence, and many children required multiple foster \nplacements, or a sequence of foster and institutional placements. ...\n\n Sister Kate's and other residential child care institutions such as Mofflyn and Parkerville provided group homes with \napproximately eight to ten children in a household, called a 'cottage', under the care of a married couple, called \n'cottage parents' and usually located on a single campus site. This style of care had a more structured, institutional \nfeatures than foster care, but, most commonly, provided a more stable form of care with less risk of placement \nbreakdown. It also allowed for siblings to be more readily placed together than foster placements.[1149]\n\n910 Ms Booth went on to depose:  In December 1974 the corporate executive of the Department approved a policy, \nwhich I had prepared in consultation with others, for the development of agencyoperated group homes and \nadditional funding for 'scatter cottages' operated by the nongovernment residential child care agencies. These \ngroup homes were to be located in the community and staffed by paid 'houseparents' receiving support from social \nworkers and psychologists. This policy was aimed at providing:(a) The benefits of personalised, communitybased \nand familystyle care;\n\n (b) More stability and less risk of placement breakdown than traditional foster care;\n\n\n\n (c) More capacity for employed houseparents to cope with the adjustment difficulties faced by the children in care;\n\n (d) Increased opportunity for siblings to remain together in outofhome placement;\n\n (e) More opportunity for family contact between children and their parents and other relatives, and increased \npotential for the child/children's return to the care of their family without the exclusion factor commonly associated \nwith foster care; and\n\n (f) More culturally sensitive and appropriate care for aboriginal children and families.[1150]\n\n(p) Knowledge of cultural implications of removing aboriginal children from their families  \n\n911 The evidence established that in the 1950s and 1960s, there was very little training for the staff of the \nDepartment of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department in relation to aboriginal culture. Mr Cornish \nprovided a witness statement in which he deposed that when he joined the Department in 1956  there were no \ntraining courses available in Australia for anyone working with aboriginal people. Other than a basic induction to \nDepartmental procedures my initial training came from my earlier experience at Mogumber [the Mogumber Native \nMission], the District Officer, and selfarranged interactions with health, education, legal and other relevant personal \ncontracts such as a few universitybased anthropologists resident in the Eastern States.[1151]\n\n912 Mr Long also deposed that he did not have any anthropological training, nor did he receiving any specific \ntraining from the Department.[1152]  \n\n913 Mr Maine confirmed that within the Child Welfare Department at the time, there was little understanding of \naboriginal culture:  I don't know that many staff would have been knowledgeable about traditional ways of aboriginal \ncare. It depends what their experience might have been and how sensitive they were to that as a factor in the \nraising of the child. It improved as time went by and staff were better trained and there were professional officers \nand there was an improved awareness in the community overall, as well as staff, about the relevance of the child's \ncultural background to how it was growing up and how it was going to fit into the general community. I think that \nwas that wasn't a piece of instant knowledge. It was something that just took a long time to develop.\n\n914 According to Mr Maine, even from the late 1950s, there was some degree of awareness within the Department \nof the desirability of maintaining connections between aboriginal wards and their families, by placing aboriginal \nwards with members of their family or with members of the aboriginal community, in preference to placing them \nwith nonaboriginal carers, and of the desirability of maintaining contact between aboriginal wards and their families. \nIt was Mr Maine's evidence that from as early as 1958, when he started work in the Child Welfare Department:  \nthere was probably always in the minds of the placement officers the field officers, the hope that they would be able \nto place aboriginal wards with their aboriginal families, but given the general shortage of housing of aboriginal \nfamilies and the rarity of families that had empty beds that other children could be placed in, realistically those \npossibilities weren't very high. Therefore, the department would try to place alternatively children with relatives or \nothers who may have some connection to the aboriginal family. If not, then we used general foster parent services \nof the department and did what we could to maintain connections between the child and his family. That varied and \nit seemed ... was successful depending on the family and its stability and the extent to which it was able to follow \nsome plan or organisation to see the children on particular occasions and varied with their attitude towards the \nwardship.\n\n ... most welfare staff would have followed [this approach], that they should try to unless there was something really \nunhealthy about the whole family situation and you didn't want to retain connections, they would generally try to \nplace the child in a situation where parental contact was possible and you would have the expectation that \nhopefully the child could be moved back to the parents' care, and usually some plan would be developed to provide \nthe necessary services and support for that to happen.[1153]\n\n\n\n915 Mr Maine's evidence was that although this approach would have been applied from as early as 1958, it 'would \nhave been intensified as we obtained more professional staff and as knowledge of the harmful effects of separation \nfrom the parents became more widespread'.[1154] However, he acknowledged that this approach was not set out in \na formal policy in the same way that formal policies exist within the Department of Community Welfare today.[1155]  \n\n916 That accords with the evidence given by Ms Stephanie Keating. She deposed that at that time, if the Children's \nCourt made an order for the removal of a child from his or her family there was no policy to try to place indigenous \nchildren with an indigenous family.[1156]  \n\n917 Similarly, Ms Susan Booth said in her witness statement that  Until 1973 when the Child Placement Service \nwas established, there was limited formal policy or advice to departmental officers on the placement of children who \nhad been committed to the care of the State, or were otherwise under the supervision of the Department. ...\n\n ... As I recall, there was no particular policy of placing aboriginal children with aboriginal foster families.[1157]\n\n918 Despite there being some awareness on the part of officers within the Department of Native Welfare and the \nChild Welfare Department in the late 1950s and 1960s that it was desirable to place aboriginal children in foster \ncare with members of their extended families or with members of the aboriginal community, this was often not \npossible, in part because many aboriginal people at the time lived in impoverished conditions. Mr Maine noted that:  \nas housing for aboriginal people improved more possibilities were opened up with relatives or others that might take \nthe care of the children, but most aboriginal families who had space available would extend their family help to \nothers as well as children.[1158]\n\n919 Mr Maine acknowledged that the increase in the availability of placements with aboriginal families was a very \ngradual one.  \n\n920 If aboriginal wards were not able to be placed with extended family or members of the aboriginal community, \nthen alternative placement arrangements had to be made. The evidence established that there was limited \navailability of foster care for aboriginal children at the time when the Children were wards. Mr Strover, a Social Work \nSupervisor with the Child Welfare Department from 1967 to 1975, alluded to this problem in his witness statement, \nwhere he said:  it was very difficult to find people who were willing to be foster carers of aboriginal children. As a \nresult many aboriginal children remained in institutions after they were made wards. It was common for aboriginal \nchildren from large families to become scattered, with some in foster homes, where available, and others in \ninstitutions.[1159]\n\n921 Ms Kathleen BrentonCoward provided a witness statement in which she deposed:  For the most part in the \nmetropolitan region, advertisements for foster parents did not specifically ask for aboriginal persons to take care of \naboriginal children.\n\n Persons were selected on the basis of being financially viable and motivated to providing a long term home for a \nchild in a warm family environment.\n\n aboriginal children who could not fit into such an environment could be difficult to manage and it was not \nuncommon for foster parents to request removal of the child, in which case the child was moved to another foster \nhome.[1160]\n\n922 By the late 1970s, this gradual increase in the understanding of the potential adverse implications of the \nremoval of aboriginal children from their families, and of their placement in institutional or foster care, manifested \nitself in policies adopted by governments at the Commonwealth and State levels to deal with child welfare issues in \nrelation to aboriginal children.  \n\n923 In early 1977, the then Commonwealth Minister for aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, circulated to Commonwealth, \nState and Territory Ministers with responsibility for child or aboriginal welfare a draft paper on aboriginal adoption \nand fostering.[1161] The paper had been prepared following discussions at a meeting of the Council of Social \nWelfare Ministers of Australia in 1976. Although 'Ministers generally supported the philosophy contained in the draft \n\n\n\nguidelines [they] noted that they did not sufficiently take into account the specific legal and administrative \ncircumstances of particular States'.[1162] Accordingly, a revised paper was prepared by the Department for \naboriginal Affairs for further consideration at the Interim Conference of Social Welfare Administrators in November \n1977. That revised paper reflected a number of principles on which there was 'general agreement amongst welfare \nMinisters'.[1163] Those principles were described as being:  (a) emphasis on prevention; provision of family support \nservices to minimise need for alternative care;\n\n (b) children should only be removed from their families as a last resort;\n\n (c) aboriginal children should be fostered or adopted with aboriginal families wherever possible; aboriginal \ncommunity fostering practices should be recognised and supported wherever possible;\n\n (d) Advice should be sought on a regular basis from aboriginal advisory bodies on adoptions and fostering \nprocedures as well as on specific placements;\n\n (e) Employment of aboriginal child welfare officers and appropriate training for nonaboriginal officers dealing with \naboriginals.\n\n924 By January 1978 the Commonwealth Department of aboriginal Affairs had published a set of guidelines on \naboriginal adoption and fostering policy, and sought the agreement of relevant State agencies to those guidelines \n(the proposed Commonwealth guidelines).[1164] The proposed Commonwealth guidelines noted:  The first and \nmost important principle governing aboriginal adoption and fostering policy should be the maintenance of the \naboriginal child with his or her family and community environment. Removal of the child should be a last resort.\n\n The disproportionately high incidence of aboriginal children in nonparental care or custody is probably related to \nthe social, economic and environmental disadvantages suffered by aboriginal families and their typical isolation \nfrom community and legal services, nevertheless, it is viewed with concern. There is no reason to believe that \naboriginal children will necessarily benefit from being removed from parents despite the living conditions; they could \nbe ultimately penalised by it.[1165]\n\n925 The proposed Commonwealth guidelines advocated a preventive focus for policy in relation to the welfare of \naboriginal children:  A preventative policy is also associated with a positive approach to aboriginal child care and \ndevelopment. In this connection welfare authorities should support the development of family services and benefits \nfor aboriginals in such a way as to:  Retain each aboriginal child in environments which are consistent with his/her \nracial and community identity; ...  Encourage the growth of aboriginal family support organisations and service \ndelivery personnel.[1166]\n\n926 In those cases where it was necessary to commit an aboriginal child to State care, the proposed \nCommonwealth guidelines proposed:  Where action to commit and aboriginal child to care appears necessary, \nState Government Departments and voluntary welfare organisations concerned with fostering programs will attempt \nto follow these procedures:  Attempt to develop adequate care by the parents by attempting to develop adequate \nsupport services; or  Foster the child with aboriginal relatives or with other aboriginal foster parents preferably in the \nsame aboriginal community.Where such placement is not possible or not in the best interests of the child then other \nalternatives should be developed that will enable the best possible retention of the child's relationship with his \nparents and community, where these are conducive to his welfare.\n\n927 It appears that although the proposed Commonwealth guidelines were not formally applied across the \nCommonwealth, there was development at the State level of policies aimed at maintaining aboriginal children within \ntheir extended families and communities, and involving aboriginal communities or agencies in decision making. In \nhis evidence, Mr Semple recalled that in 1978 he participated in a National Working Party for aboriginal Child \nPlacement. Mr Semple noted that:  The Working Party focused on the principles that should apply whenever an \nofficer was assessing whether an aboriginal child needed to be removed from their home.\n\n\n\n The principles formulated and discussed by the Working Party were eventually enshrined in legislation and formal \npolicy in Western Australia. ...\n\n In essence, the principles arrived at by the Working Party were that before a child was to be removed, every other \npossible avenue of support should first be identified and investigated.\n\n This would involve a thorough search for all relatives of the child, or anyone who knew or understood the culture of \nthe child and their community, and the family dynamics.\n\n The principles were reasonably comprehensive.\n\n The principles also stipulated that longer term placement of an Indigenous child with a nonIndigenous family ought \nto be as a last resort; after all other enquiries into Indigenous placement options had been exhausted.\n\n This was designed to effectively force practitioners to work as hard as possible to find Indigenous persons \ninterested in acting as foster carers for Indigenous children.\n\n It was also designed to ensure all attempts were made by officers to assist another family member, for example a \ngrandparent, perhaps with additional supports, who was capable and willing of caring for the child if the parents \nwere unable (sic).[1167]\n\n928 An indication of the development that was taking place in understanding the implications of the removal of \nchildren can be seen in a submission which appears to have been made in early 1979 on behalf of the ALS and the \naboriginal Medical Service to the Department of Community Welfare in relation to the Department's approach to the \nfostering and adoption of aboriginal children.[1168] That submission noted that:  It has been the experience of \naboriginal Legal Service Field Officers representing aboriginal children in Court that the majority of children \nappearing have a background of being in nonaboriginal care; that is, in institutionalization (sic), repeated fostering \nor adoption by white families. (In Community Welfare institutions the child is isolated because all the staff and the \nmajority of the children are nonaboriginal.)\n\n Extended family ties are vital, and aboriginal children in nonaboriginal placements will run away to look for their \nfamilies. It is most often the case that it is during this period of absconding that the offences occur: for example, the \nchild steals a car to travel to the family's place of residence or he/she breaks into a house and steals food and \nmoney to provide the necessaries for the travel.[1169]\n\n929 The submission also identified the importance of maintaining aboriginal cultural identity:  On a community level, \nthe Government's policy of selfdetermination has given impetus to the development of a strong aboriginal identity. \naboriginal people are trying now to retain their cultural differences and rebuild a cohesive aboriginal society within \nthe dominant white society. An important factor in this cultural development is seen to be the need for aboriginal \nchildren to grow proud of their identity as aboriginal, and to pass on their cultural heritage to future \ngenerations.[1170]\n\n930 The submission advocated that the paramount goal of any placement programme involving aboriginal children \nshould be 'the maintenance of the aboriginal child with the immediate or extended family, or at least with aboriginal \ncaretakers of the same cultural grouping as the child's family'.[1171]  \n\n931 In June 1983 the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators (which appears to have comprised the \nheads of State and Territory social welfare departments) convened a working party to review State and Territory \nprinciples, policies and practices in relation to the fostering and adoption of aboriginal children. That report was \nendorsed by the Standing Committee in October 1983, with a view to its presentation to the Council of Social \nWelfare Ministers at their meeting in 1984. The report of the working party noted:  Community awareness of \naboriginal culture, values and heritage has accelerated in recent years. This awareness, heightened by an \n\n\n\nincreasingly vocal and articulate aboriginal lobby and complemented by consistent research findings on the \ninequalities of equal treatment has led to  A questioning of past and present practices in relation to aboriginal \npeople.  A recognition of the role, value and importance of aboriginal cultural heritage and social, family, tribal and \ncommunity relationships in the life of aboriginal people.  A sense of shame and embarrassment over the historical \ntreatment of aboriginals.  A determination to recognise, respect and reflect aboriginal culture, customs and opinions \nin Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation and practices.The issue of the fostering and adoption of aboriginal \nchildren is one of the more public and visible issues.\n\n There is no denying that historically aboriginal children have been (and still are) over represented in government \nand nongovernment welfare services and programmes.\n\n Past practice frequently reflected and assumption that removal of an aboriginal child to white foster or adoptive \nparents would be in the child's best interest. Little recognition was given to the opinions of the aboriginal \ncommunity.\n\n In recent years all Australian States and Territories have attempted to redress past practices through developing \nprinciple and policies for the fostering and adoption of aboriginal children.\n\n The majority of these principles and policies emphasised the importance of:\n\nRetaining and supporting wherever possible an aboriginal child in his or her extended family or accepted \ncommunity.  \n\n932 Consulting with the child's community or an aboriginal agency before any decision to place an aboriginal \nchild.[1172]  \n\n933 Among the recommendations made by the working party were recommendations in relation to the fostering of \naboriginal children, and in relation to the training for welfare agency staff:  That in the foster placement of an \naboriginal child a preference be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with:\n\nA member of the child's extended family;  \n\nOther members of the child's aboriginal community who have the correct relationship with the child in accordance \nwith Aboriginal customary law;  \n\nOther aboriginal families living in close proximity.  \n\n...  That each State and Territory welfare department:(a) provide training and discussion programmes for all staff \nworking with aboriginal children on the principles, policies and procedures of aboriginal child placement;\n\n (b) provide training and discussion programmes for staff involved in these matters on aboriginal culture, family \nnetworks and customary law.[1173]\n\n934 The working party's report also summarised the policies applied in across the States. In relation to Western \nAustralia, the report noted:  The Department of Community Welfare practice in recent years has affirmed an \nunderstood principle that aboriginal children should wherever possible, be placed with aboriginal families or \ncommunities. This has resulted in a reduction in the number of aboriginal child in nonaboriginal placements.\n\n In order to ensure a strict adherence to the principles the Department is current formulating a statement of policy \nwhich after consultation with appropriate aboriginal organisations and groups, will be implemented.[1174]\n\n935 On 6 April 1984, the Council of Social Welfare Ministers endorsed a recommendation that each State develop \nits own aboriginal Child Placement Principles and that this be done through further consultation with aboriginal \ncommunities and agencies.[1175]  \n\n\n\n936 By 1985, the Department of Community Welfare was in the process of formally implementing principles, \nprocedures and guidelines on aboriginal child placement.[1176] In a memorandum to staff, Mr Semple, by then the \nDirector General of the Department, noted that 'the objective of formalizing the policy is to standardize placement \npractices in respect of aboriginal children so that they are consistent with policy.' Attached to Mr Semple's \nmemorandum were copies of the Principles, Procedures and Guidelines to be applied in the placement of aboriginal \nchildren. A covering note in relation to the Principles explained that:  In 1984 State and Commonwealth Ministers \nmade an agreement to implement and support a policy regarding the placement of aboriginal children. The main \ntheme of this policy was that placements were to ensure cultural consistency.\n\n The Minister for this department concurred with the other State and Federal Ministers on implementation of such a \npolicy. Consequently this department has undertaken the task to implement the aboriginal Child Placement \nPrinciples.\n\n ... It is a massive task, which is compounded by the fact that it is a radical move away from present placement \npractices.\n\n937 The guidelines subsequently adopted by the Department of Community Welfare provided:  As a general policy, \nthese guidelines should be strictly adhered to by all persons arranging placement for welfare purposes of all \naboriginal children, be they under the guardianship of the Department or not.  The Child and the Natural Family.\n\n1.1 The maintenance of aboriginal children with their own family and community environments is to be the first \npriority.  \n\n...  \n\n1.3 Should removal of child/ren be unavoidable, services to the natural family should continue with the intention of \nreturning the children at the earliest possible time.  \n\n...    aboriginal Children Requiring Placement.\n\n2.1 Cultural consistency and family linkage are considered more important than material standards.  \n\n2.2 Where possible aboriginal children should be placed within the extended family, with other aboriginal families, \nor in another form of culturally consistent care.  \n\n...  \n\n2.4 [T]he following principles should be considered in placement selection:  \n\n(a) The placement should contribute to the best possible retention of the child's relationship with his parents and \ncommunity, including regular contact.  \n\n(b) Siblings should be placed together, but where this is not possible, regular sibling contact is to be maintained.  \n\n...  \n\n2.5 Following an initial case conference, each child, his sibling group and his natural family shall be formally \nreviewed on a minimum six monthly basis.[1177]  \n\n938 Quite apart from issues specific to aboriginal children who were made wards, changes were being seen in the \napproach of welfare authorities to related issues, particularly accommodation for aboriginal people. In a discussion \npaper prepared for the Director in July 1981, it was noted that accommodation had been identified as a special area \nof need for aboriginal people, and the Department of Community Welfare had pursued several programs including \nupgrading reserve accommodation (such as by upgrading electricity and hot water supplies, and constructing \nablution and laundry facilities) or closing reserves and rehousing families in conventional housing (a process which \nwas eventually managed by the State Housing Commission).[1178]  \n\n939 Having regard to all of the evidence, I find that in the late 1950s and 1960s, there was some awareness on the \npart of officers of the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department of the desirability of \nmaintaining contact between aboriginal wards and their families, by placing those children with extended family or \nmembers of the aboriginal community, and by maintaining contact between the children and their families. \n\n\n\nHowever, it is not possible to quantify the extent of that knowledge, and it should not be overstated, given the lack \nof any training for departmental staff at the time in relation to aboriginal culture. However, very gradually, an \nincrease in qualified staff and in training for staff, resulted in increased knowledge of the potential adverse \nimplications of removing aboriginal children from their families. By the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, this \nknowledge was manifested in the development of formal departmental policies.  \n\n940 Furthermore, I find that although departmental officers were aware of the desirability of placing aboriginal \nchildren in foster care with aboriginal carers, this was frequently not possible, given the very limited availability of \naboriginal foster carers, and the impoverished conditions in which many aboriginal people lived at the time. Again, \nvery gradually, as the living conditions of aboriginal people improved, aboriginal foster care opportunities increased.  \n\n941 I find that at the time when the Children were made wards, there were limited foster care placements available \nwith nonaboriginal people willing to foster aboriginal children, and that that remained the position during their \nwardships.  \n\n942 I find that in 1958 and 1961 when the Children were made wards, and during their wardships, it was not \npossible to place all of the Children, or all of the Siblings, into one foster placement, as none were available to cater \nfor nine or eight children.  \n\n943 As I have already found, from the late 1960s, some of the Siblings were placed in foster care from the late \n1960s. At that point, however, the Siblings were, for the most, part individually fostered.  \n\n(q) Was the return of the Children to Don and Sylvia considered by the Child Welfare Department, and why were \nthe Children not returned?  \n\n944 All of the Siblings were eventually permitted to return to live with Don and Sylvia, prior to the conclusion of their \nwardships. The return of the Siblings was considered on a number of occasions during their wardships, but officers \nof the Department of Native Welfare, or the Child Welfare Department, formed the view that the Siblings should not \nbe returned on those occasions.  \n\n945 In addition, there was evidence that Ellen's return to Don and Sylvia was considered in 1959 but it was decided \nthat she should not be returned to their care. It is convenient to start by considering the evidence in relation to that \ndecision.  \n\n(i) Consideration of Ellen's return\n\n946 In accordance with the recommendation of the Children's Court when Ellen was made a ward, the Department \nof Native Welfare took steps to review Ellen's wardship in late May 1959.[1179]  \n\n947 Mr WrightWebster made a report to the Commissioner in relation to Ellen on 29 May 1959[1180] in which he \nnoted:  Collard and his wife who were both inveterate drinkers have, I believe, turned over a new leaf and have \nceased drinking according to Ms Jones. I have told her that I intend to recommend the return of the baby to its \nparents if Collard would make a few small improvements to his accommodation. She is to arrange this, and in due \ncourse, I will report again.\n\n948 Sylvia denied that she and Don were long time drinkers at around the time of the Report[1181] and she had no \nrecollection that she and Don made any change to their around the time of the report and she had no recollection \nthat she and Don made any change to their lifestyle around this time.[1182] Sylvia also had no recollection of Ms \nJones telling her that Mr WrightWebster intended to recommend Ellen's return if they made a few improvements to \ntheir accommodation.[1183] It is unnecessary to make any findings in relation to the accuracy of Mr \nWrightWebster's observations. Rather, it suffices to find that in May 1959 the Department's District Officer was \nfavourably disposed to the return of Ellen.  \n\n949 Mr Long made a report to Mr WrightWebster dated 14 July 1959.[1184] In it, he noted that he had visited Don \nand Sylvia's home and that he spoke to them, and that he had also spoken to Ms Jones, about Ellen's return. He \nwent on:  Both the Collards and Miss Jones of the Brookton Mission Church made strong representations to me to \nassist in having this child returned to them from its foster home ... .\n\n\n\n During the last few months the social behaviour of the Collards has undergone a most welcome improvement and \nthis young couple do seem to have pulled themselves together and started life anew. Whether the change is a \npermanent one, of course, remains to be seen. Both attend chapel very regularly, and have not touched alcohol in \nweeks. They appear pleasant and well mannered, and Const Wall of Brookton reports favourably on them.\n\n Collard has a permanent job with Mr T. Yeo, and occupies an asbestos cottage which is clean and tidy, and \nadequately furnished. A good meal was in the process of cooking when I called, and the six other children look \nhealthy and well nourished. There are three bedrooms and a kitchen, plus verandah, for their use and, as the case \nwas due to be reviewed at the expiration of the committal order, on 13/3/59, I would, with your approval, \nrecommend that Ellen be returned to the Collards with the proviso that this Department check her living conditions \nfrom time to time.\n\n950 Prior to his death, Mr Long made a witness statement for these proceedings in which he deposed that he had \nno recollection of this report but had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information contained in that \ndocument.[1185]  \n\n951 I find that the contents of the report are an accurate reflection of what Mr Long had observed and what he had \nbeen told by Constable Wall, Ms Jones and Don and Sylvia, for three reasons. First, in his statement, Mr Long did \nnot express any doubt about the accuracy of the information in the report. Secondly, although Sylvia had no \nrecollection of Mr Long[1186] and also said that she did not recall anyone coming to inspect their accommodation at \nBrookton in around June of 1959, she did appear to accept that sometimes officers from the Department of Native \nWelfare would come up to Bessie's block.[1187] Thirdly, Sylvia also accepted that some aspects of Mr Long's report \nwere accurate, such as the fact that at around this time, the family was living in accommodation at Mr Yeo's farm \nwhile Don worked for Mr Yeo.[1188] It is difficult to envisage any reason why Mr Long would include inaccurate \ninformation, as well as accurate information in his report.  \n\n952 In his statement, Mr Long deposed that it was the usual practice for a report such as the one he had prepared \nto be forwarded by the District Officer to the Commissioner, for the Commissioner to consult the District Officer, and \nfor the Commissioner then to make a decision as to whether or not the child in question ought be returned to their \nparents.[1189] The evidence establishing that process was followed in this case.  \n\n953 Mr WrightWebster wrote to the Commissioner on 14 July 1959 endorsing Mr Long's recommendation that Ellen \nbe returned to Don and Sylvia.[1190] No response appears to have been received to that correspondence and Mr \nWrightWebster wrote to the Commissioner again on 10 September 1959 in which he observed:[1191]  ... I have \nbeen receiving enquiries from the parents and from Miss Jones of Brookton which I am unable to answer, as I am \nunaware of the reason why the child has not been returned even after the good report provided from this office. I \nfeel very strongly that this is a case in which this infant should be returned to its parents, and request that the matter \nbe taken up with the Child Welfare Departments for early finalisation.\n\n Kindly advise what transpires, as the mother called at my office today and I promised to let her know the position. \nShe appeared most anxious and upset at the lack of decision in the matter.\n\n954 On 5 October 1959 the Commissioner approved Mr WrightWebster's recommendation that Ellen be returned to \nDon and Sylvia and made a submission to that effect to the Director.[1192] On 22 October 1959, the Acting Director \nadvised that he agreed with that recommendation.[1193]  \n\n955 However, a file note which was in evidence indicated that in the interim, the Commissioner was contacted by \nMs Jones,[1194] who provided him with information which caused the Commissioner to reverse his decision about \nEllen's return. On 12 November 1959 the Commissioner wrote to Mr WrightWebster[1195] and advised the \nfollowing:  As previously advised your recommendation concerning the return of the abovenamed child to its parent \nwas referred to the Director of Child Welfare who now states that he is in agreement with your recommendation.\n\n However, in the meantime Ms Jones of the Brookton Mission has discussed this matter with the Commissioner and \nadvised that Mrs Collard is gambling heavily.\n\n\n\n It has therefore been decided that no action will be taken in respect to the return of Ellen to her parents until further \nadvice is received from Ms Jones.\n\n956 On 14 December 1959 an Investigation Officer (whose identity was not apparent from the document) wrote a \nmemorandum to the Commissioner in relation to the question of Ellen's return.[1196] The officer reported:  Miss \nJones advised that since her last report to this office on the 15th October, 1959 that Mrs Collard was gambling \nheavily, she is unable to give any further information re the behaviour of the Collards, as Don and Sylvia Collard \nhave not been living regularly in Brookton. Up until a month ago they were travelling between Brookton and \nBoddington where Don Collard has been working on and off. During this period the children of school age were left \nwith her mother so that they may attend school.\n\n For the last month the whole family has been living in Narembeen where Collard is now working. Miss Jones does \nnot know who he is working for or the conditions under which he has housed his family.\n\n Under the circumstances it is suggested that no further action be taken in the matter until such time as a further \nrequest is made by Sylvia Collard for custody of the child, when the District Officer could be requested to report \nagain.\n\n957 There was no other evidence to suggest that Ellen's return received further consideration at any later stage, \nand in all of the circumstances I infer that the Investigation Officer's Recommendation was accepted.  \n\n958 I make the following findings. First, the only information the Department of Native Welfare received to the effect \nthat Sylvia was gambling heavily, was one oral report provided by Ms Jones to the Commissioner between 5 \nOctober 1959 and 12 November 1959.  \n\n959 Secondly, Ms Jones did not provide any further evidence to substantiate that information.  \n\n960 Thirdly, there was no evidence that at any stage officers of the Department of Native Welfare made their own \nenquiries to ascertain whether Sylvia had been gambling, or (more to the point) whether she and Don were in a \nposition to properly care for Ellen.  \n\n961 The conclusion that Ellen should not be returned to her parents if Sylvia was gambling appears to have been a \nmoral judgment rather than the result of any appraisal of what the implications of gambling might be on Don and \nSylvia's ability to properly care for Ellen.  \n\n962 Finally, I note that in her evidence in these proceedings Sylvia denied that she had ever gambled,[1197] and as \nI have already found, there was no other evidence, apart from this one reference to information from Ms Jones, to \nsuggest that Sylvia had been gambling heavily.  \n\n963 The approach taken by the officers of the Department of Native Welfare in relation to Ellen's return was very \nodd, to say the least. If alleged gambling on the part of a parent was such a serious consideration as to warrant a \ndecision not to return Ellen to Don and Sylvia's care, it is difficult to see why the Departmental officers did not \nconsider it necessary to make enquiries about the welfare of Don and Sylvia's other children, of whom they were \nwell aware. In addition, it is far from clear why the Department's Investigation Officer recommended that no further \naction be taken unless Sylvia again requested Ellen's return.  \n\n964 On the other hand, the information in the Investigation Officer's Report of 14 December 1959 was significant. \nThat document indicated that Don and Sylvia were no longer living on the Yeo's farm, and that Don was engaged in \ncasual farm work (as I have found was the pattern of his working life more generally in the 1950s and 1960s). In so \nfar as the family's accommodation and Don's employment were concerned, the position in December 1959 \ntherefore appears to be not materially different from that which existed in March 1958, when Ellen was taken into \ncare. The improvements in Don and Sylvia's accommodation and the fact that Don was in permanent employment, \n\n\n\nwere important considerations in Mr WrightWebster's initial recommendation that Ellen be returned to Don and \nSylvia.  \n\n965 The Investigation Officer's Recommendation that no action be taken to return Ellen appears to have resulted \nfrom the fact that in December 1959, the Department did not have any information as to where Don and Sylvia were \nliving or in what conditions and whether Don was employed.  \n\n(ii) Consideration of the return of the Siblings to Don and Sylvia\n\n966 The return of the Siblings to Don and Sylvia was considered by officers of the Child Welfare Department in two \ndifferent contexts. First, there was some evidence that the Siblings, or some of them, were permitted to visit Don \nand Sylvia for Christmas on occasion. There was also some evidence as to the circumstances which officers of the \nChild Welfare Department would have been expected to take into account in determining whether wards should be \npermitted to have a short term visit with their parents. Secondly, there was evidence that officers of the Child \nWelfare Department considered the return of individual Siblings to Don and Sylvia on a number of occasions, and \nrecommended the return of some of the Siblings.  \n\nChristmas visits to Don and Sylvia\n\n967 Sylvia gave evidence that she and Don 'frequently' requested that the Children be permitted to come home for \nChristmas. She said their requests were usually refused on the basis of their living conditions or on the basis of \nreports that they were drinking excessively.[1198] There was evidence that Don and Sylvia requested that the \nSiblings be permitted to spend Christmas with them on two occasions, and that this request was granted on one \noccasion and refused on the other. I will deal with the circumstances of these requests in a moment.  \n\n968 I accept that Don and Sylvia requested the return of the Siblings on these two occasions. It is, however, not \npossible to make any finding as to whether or not Don and Sylvia requested the return of the Siblings for Christmas \non other occasions, or 'frequently', for the following reasons. First, the absence of any evidence that Don and Sylvia \nmade other requests for the return of the Siblings or that such requests were refused, does not permit an inference \nto be drawn that they did not make such requests. As I have already explained, the documents in evidence are \nclearly not complete, and this is particularly evident in relation to the years during which the Siblings lived at Sister \nKate's and Burnbrae. In addition, there was no evidence as to whom Sylvia and Don made their requests. Had they \nmade oral, informal requests to inspectors of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department, \nwritten records may not have been kept of those requests. Secondly, Sylvia's evidence that they made frequent \nrequests for the return of the Siblings for Christmas was vague, and it was not clarified in the course of her oral \nevidence.  \n\n969 I turn to deal with the evidence in relation to Don and Sylvia's requests that the Siblings be permitted to spend \nChristmas with them.  \n\n970 In evidence was a copy of a letter dated 14 December 1965, from the Child Welfare Department to Don in \nwhich he was advised that his request that the Children spend the Christmas holidays with him and Sylvia had been \nrefused on the basis of the accommodation in which Don and Sylvia were then living.[1199] A file note from the \nDepartment's file indicated that this refusal was based on information provided to a departmental officer by the \nBrookton Police, namely that the visit was not recommended because Don and Sylvia were 'living in a shed'.[1200] \nI find that Don requested that the Children be permitted to visit for Christmas in 1965, and that this request was \nrefused on the basis of the accommodation in which Don and Sylvia were living at the time.  \n\n971 I have already referred at [658] to [660] to the evidence that in November 1970, District Officer White of the \nChild Welfare Department visited Don and Sylvia where they were then staying in Kondinin, to ascertain whether \nBeverley, Glenys and Eva should be permitted to spend Christmas with their parents. Officer White inspected \nwhere they were living, recommended that the girls be permitted to visit, and the visit was approved.  \n\n972 In each case, it is apparent that the decision whether to permit the Siblings to return home was made by \nreference to the conditions in which Don and Sylvia were then living.  \n\n\n\n973 For completeness, I note that as I found at [383] to [384], in late 1966, after Don had collected Donald and \ntaken him back to Brookton, Constable Wall spoke to Donald, and subsequently suggested to officers of the Child \nWelfare Department that Donald be permitted to remain with his parents over Christmas. Approval was given for \nDonald to remain in Brookton with Don and Sylvia over Christmas.  \n\n974 There was also evidence in relation to the Department's process for considering requests from parents for \nhome visits by their children. In his evidence, Mr Maine said that in ascertaining whether a home visit by a ward \nshould be permitted, a number of checks would be made, including with the police. He indicated that if an officer of \nthe Child Welfare Department was based in a town then that person would be contacted, but in many country towns \nthere was no departmental office, and in those cases other sources of information would be pursued.[1201]In 1965 \nand 1966, the Child Welfare Department received information from the local police about Don and Sylvia's living \nconditions and, in 1970, Mr White inspected Don and Sylvia's home. I find that the approach taken in determining \nwhether the Siblings should be permitted to visit their parents on each of these occasions was consistent with the \ngeneral practice adopted within the Department for considering applications for home visits by wards.  \n\nApplications that the Siblings be permitted to return to live with Don and Sylvia\n\n975 The evidence established that officers of the Child Welfare Department gave consideration, on several \noccasions, to whether individual Siblings should be permitted to return to live permanently with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n976 As I found at [383] to [384], in April 1967, Mr Hill recommended that Donald be permitted to remain with Don \nand Sylvia at Brookton. Although he concluded that 'this home is not a suitable place for this boy to stay in' he \nacknowledged that there was little point trying to force Donald to return to his apprenticeship in Perth when he was \nnot prepared to do so, and when he insisted that he wanted to stay at home with his parents. In those \ncircumstances, approval was given for Donald to return to live with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n977 As I found at [392] to [401], in August 1967, Don and Sylvia collected Darryl and Bonnie from Burnbrae for a \nvisit and did not return them. That prompted the Director to request that an officer of the Department of Native \nWelfare investigate, and 'if the conditions are satisfactory' for the Commissioner to consider whether he would be \nprepared to supervise the children if they were released to their parents. Although Darryl and Bonnie were returned \nto Burnbrae before that investigation could begin, Darryl continued to run away, or to leave with his father on other \noccasions. As I found at [402], by late 1967, officers of the Child Welfare Department had concluded that there was \nlittle point trying to prevent Darryl from remaining with his family, and decided that the better course was to permit \nhim to remain, but for his welfare to be monitored by officers of the Child Welfare Department and the Department \nof Native Welfare.  \n\n978 As I found at [417] in March 1969, Don collected Bonnie from Mrs Farmer's house where she was then living, \nand returned with her to Brookton. Officers of the Child Welfare Department then decided to release Bonnie into the \ncare of her parents in Brookton, and this was confirmed in a letter sent to Sylvia by Ms Hobcroft.  \n\n979 As I found at [430], after running away from Sister Kate's and other institutions on several occasions, and after \nhaving been collected by Don on 18 March 1969 (along with Bonnie), William was released to the care of his \nparents on 18 March 1969. That was confirmed in the letter sent to Sylvia by Ms Hobcroft of the Child Welfare \nDepartment in April 1969.  \n\n980 As I found at [446] to [447], Beverley ran away from Sister Kate's in March 1969 and returned to live with Don \nand Sylvia in Brookton. A file note made by Ms Hobcroft of the Child Welfare Department on 10 April 1969 indicated \nthat she had concluded that it was 'pointless to insist on this child's return to Sister Kate's as she will most likely \nabscond again'. Beverley was then permitted to remain with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n981 As I found at [466], in June 1969, Don and Sylvia collected Glenys and Eva from Sister Kate's and took them \nback to Brookton. Ms Hobcroft recommended that in the circumstances, Glenys and Eva should be released to Don \nand Sylvia, and they were permitted to remain with their parents at that stage. This was despite the fact that in Ms \nHobcroft's letter of 4 April 1969,[1202] in which she agreed that Bonnie and William should return to Brookton, she \nhad advised that as Sylvia did not have an adequate home at the time, her younger children should remain at Sister \nKate's. (Sylvia denied having seen a letter to that effect,[1203] but given the time which has passed it is clearly \npossible that Sylvia did receive that letter and had simply forgotten about it.  \n\n\n\n982 As I found at [450], following a visit to the humpy in September 1969, Mr Moulton recommended that the \nyounger girls be placed in foster care in Perth, and as I found at [514], by October 1969, Beverley, Glenys and Eva \nhad been placed in emergency placements in Perth.  \n\n983 As I found at [486] arrangements were made by officers of the Child Welfare Department for Glenys to return to \nlive with Don and Sylvia in Brookton at the end of 1971, and she did so briefly, before running away.  \n\n984 In December 1971, Don and Sylvia approached the Child Welfare Department and requested that Wesley be \npermitted to return to live with them. However, following an inspection by the District Officer at Narrogin, who \nreported that 'home conditions were not suitable for the return of the Children', that request was refused in January \n1972. A memorandum dated 6 January 1972 by Miss Page, a Social Worker within the Child Welfare Department, \nto her supervisor, and to the District Officer at Narrogin, explained the background to Don and Sylvia's application \nas follows:  Mr and Mrs Collard, parents of Wesley, called at this office on 13th December 1971 to enquire as to the \nreturn of Wesley to their care.\n\n They informed me that they now have a house at Brookton and have somewhere where the children can live. They \nsaid that Glenys (13) had been returned to them recently. They were very vague about the other children, at first \nimplying that they were all with them, but on further questioning they admitted that the other children are still in their \nrespective foster homes or Sister Kate's.\n\n ...\n\n Mr and Mrs Collard told me that the reason the children were taken away from them was because they didn't have \na house and now they do. Apparently they have been living in their present accommodation for the past six weeks \nand intend to remain there.\n\n ACTION The District Officer at Narrogin was contacted re the home situation of the Collards and he reported that \nhome conditions were not suitable for the return of the children.[1204]\n\n985 A handwritten file note at the bottom of this memorandum, which appears to have been made by Miss Page, \nindicated that the District Officer at Narrogin was to forward a written report on the parents' situation. However, no \nsuch document was in evidence.  \n\n986 No evidence was given by Don and Sylvia in relation to the matters referred to in this document. There was \nalso no evidence as to where, and in what conditions, Don and Sylvia were living in Brookton in December 1971. \nHowever, as I explain below, Don and Sylvia rented a Homeswest house in Kondinin in 1970, they were living in \nKondinin when Wesley was finally permitted to return to live with them in 1975, and (as I note below) they \npurchased a home in Kondinin in 1978. Within that context, it is far from clear how Don and Sylvia came to be living \nin a house in Brookton in 1971, as is indicated in Miss Page's memorandum.  \n\n987 I note, however, the evidence to which I have already referred, suggests that by the end of 1971, it is more \nlikely than not that none of Don and Sylvia's children were living at home on a permanent basis. The three youngest \nchildren, Joseph, Philip and Ashley, were living with Jean Collard at that time, Eva was at Sister Kate's, Glenys had \nbriefly returned to her parents but was living an itinerant life at that time, Beverley was in foster care, Bonnie had \nhad her first child and was living in Pingelly, William was working and does not appear to have been living with his \nparents, at least on a full time basis, Darryl's wardship had finished and he had been working for some time and \nliving out of home for some of the time, and Donald was deceased.  \n\n988 I am left in the position where Miss Page's memorandum suggests that information was provided to her by the \nDistrict Officer to suggest that conditions at Don and Sylvia's home were not suitable for the return of their children. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that that report was not reliable, or that Miss Page or other officers of the \nDepartment should not have relied upon the information provided by the District Officer.  \n\n\n\n989 For completeness, I note that Mr Maine was cross-examined, by reference to Miss Page's memorandum, about \nthe matters which would have been considered by officers within the Child Welfare Department for the purpose of \ndetermining whether a child should be permitted to return to his or her family to live, as at 1972.[1205]Mr Maine's \nevidence was that he would not have regarded the fact that the parents had accommodation as a sufficient \nassessment to determine whether a child should return to live with his or her parents. His evidence was that:  The \nofficer would have to assess whether or not the family situation was satisfactory for the child to be returned or to \nhave a short stay, and that would mean that the officer needed to assess the available space for the child, the state \nof the family at the time, what other children were being cared for, what the quality of that care was like.[1206]\n\n990 Mr Maine's evidence makes clear that the fact that Don and Sylvia had a house would not have been sufficient, \nof itself, to warrant the return of Wesley. The District Officer's assessment was that 'home conditions' were not \nsuitable for the return of Don and Sylvia's children. That general description leaves open the possibility that other \nconsiderations apart from Don and Sylvia's accommodation were in contemplation but it is simply not clear on the \nevidence.  \n\n991 As I found at [502], in September 1975, Don collected Wesley from school in Perth and took him home to \nBrookton. Officers of the Child Welfare Department then decided that Wesley should be permitted to live with his \nparents at Kondinin.  \n\n992 I find that the decisions by officers of the Child Welfare Department to permit Donald, Darryl, Bonnie, William \nand Beverley to return to live with Don and Sylvia, prior to, or during, 1969, were based on two considerations. First, \non each occasion, the child in question refused to remain in foster or institutional case, and insisted on returning to \nDon and Sylvia. Secondly, each of the children had reached the age where they were able to, and had, run away \nfrom where they were living and returned to Brookton, or alternatively, had been collected by Don and returned to \nBrookton. In each case, the Department's officers concluded that there was little point trying to force the child to \nreturn to Perth, notwithstanding the officers' apparent continued misgivings about the conditions in which Don and \nSylvia lived.  \n\n993 I find that in the case of Glenys and Eva, the Department's decision to permit them to return to Don and Sylvia \nin 1969 was based on two considerations. First, the girls had been taken by Don back to Brookton, and secondly, \nall of the remaining Siblings (except for Wesley) were by then living in Brookton with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n994 However, officers of the Child Welfare Department continued to have concerns about Don and Sylvia's living \nconditions, and those concerns were reflected in the fact that the Siblings' living conditions continued to be \nmonitored after their return to Don and Sylvia, through inspections by welfare officers. As I have already found, the \nyounger Siblings Beverley, Glenys and Eva were returned to foster care, or Sister Kate's, after their initial return to \nDon and Sylvia in 1969.  \n\n995 I find that following Don and Sylvia's request for Wesley's return in 1972, officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment made enquiries to ascertain whether the conditions in Don and Sylvia's home were suitable for his \nreturn. That was consistent with the practice within the Department at the time for considering the return of wards to \ntheir parents. The outcome of that enquiry was that Don and Sylvia's 'home conditions' were not suitable for \nWesley's return, and there is no evidence to suggest that that information was not reliable.  \n\n996 I find that the decision to permit Wesley to return to live with Don and Sylvia in 1975 was based on three \nconsiderations: he had also been taken by Don to live with him and Sylvia in Kondinin, Wesley no longer wished to \nlive with the Stephensons and was of an age where there was little point trying to force him to do so, and by the \ntime of Wesley's return, Don and Sylvia were living in a house in Kondinin.  \n\n(r) Attempts by State authorities to obtain housing assistance for Don and Sylvia  \n\n997 As is apparent from the findings I have already made, one of the most significant contributing factors to the \nChildren being taken into care, and the decisions made by the Department of Native Welfare and Child Welfare \nDepartment as to whether they should be returned to Don and Sylvia's care, was Don and Sylvia's living conditions. \nOne of the main reasons for their inadequate living conditions was the fact that they lived in the humpy with no \nelectricity, gas or water supply, and no sanitation facilities.  \n\n998 In this section of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n\n\n\n(i) when Don and Sylvia obtained a house;  \n\n(ii) Don and Sylvia's difficulties in obtaining satisfactory accommodation;  \n\n(iii) the difficulties experienced by aboriginal people in Western Australia in obtaining housing during this period.  \n\n(i) When Don and Sylvia obtained a house\n\n999 As I have already found, although they spent some time each year living in farm accommodation during periods \nwhen Don was working on farms away from the Brookton area, Don and Sylvia's permanent home until August \n1970 was the humpy on Bessie's block. Don and Sylvia obtained a State Housing Commission (SHC) house at 9 \nRankin Street Kondinin at the end of August 1970.[1207] Sylvia confirmed that they rented a house in Kondinin in \nthe early 1970s, although she could not recall for how long they lived there.[1208]  \n\n1000 Don and Sylvia were able to purchase their first home, at 20 Rankin Street Kondinin, in April 1978. They sold \nthat property in August 1980.[1209]  \n\n1001 Don then purchased a house at 56 Graham Street Kondinin in July 1980. He sold that property in June 1988 \nto his son Darryl and his wife Linda.[1210]  \n\n1002 In April 1988, Don and Sylvia purchased a house at 18 Rankin Street Kondinin. They sold that property on or \nabout 25 January 2006.[1211]  \n\n1003 Don, Sylvia and Rachel Collard (who I gather is their granddaughter) purchased a house at 22 Howlett St \nKondinin in October 1993. In September 2001 they gifted that property to Darryl and his wife Linda.[1212]  \n\n1004 Don and Sylvia continue to live in Kondinin.  \n\n(ii) Don and Sylvia's difficulties in obtaining satisfactory accommodation\n\n1005 Sylvia's evidence was that after the Siblings were made wards, she and Don tried to get State housing, but  \nno matter how many times we applied and no matter how much we were earning, we were never offered a state \nhome by the authorities.\n\n ...\n\n Don also made lots of housing applications on the family's behalf. While the children were in care, we always had \nsome form of housing and accommodation and we continuously applied for state housing as a permanent base as \nwell, but we were always rejected.\n\n1006 I accept Sylvia's evidence that Don applied for state housing on a number of occasions (how many does not \nmatter) but were unable to obtain state housing. There was little evidence in relation to such applications, but such \nevidence as there was gives some insight as to the reasons why Don and Sylvia were unable to obtain an SHC \nhouse.  \n\n1007 On 18 May 1962, a Manager at the SHC wrote to the Commissioner in relation to an application by Don for \nhousing assistance from the SHC. The SHC requested the Department investigate Don's suitability as a rental \ntenant, and advise the SHC as to Don's prospects of receiving a transit property from the \nDepartment.[1213]Inquiries were made by Mr Wright-Webster. By memorandum dated 7 August 1962, Mr Wright-\nWebster advised that having regard to Don's circumstances he would be unsuitable for consideration for SHC \naccommodation.[1214]That conclusion was reached by reference to the following circumstances:  An inspection of \nthis applicant's living conditions and standards at the present time leaves much to be desired before any \nconsideration could be given in support of a State Housing project.\n\n The applicant lives in a camp constructed of iron and timber with no furniture other than a bed.\n\n The applicant is a seasonal worker with a not very impressive record.\n\n The applicant and his wife are addicted to liquor.\n\n\n\n On 8.12.61 the applicant's eight children were made wards of the State.\n\n1008 (The reference to the camp appears to be a reference to the humpy at Bessie Ninyette's block.) This advice \nwas relayed to the SHC, which subsequently advised Don that the SHC would not be able to assist him with a \nhouse.[1215]  \n\n1009 I find that this correspondence indicates the basis on which Don's application for state housing assistance \nwas refused on one occasion.  \n\n1010 Why the standard of Don and Sylvia's accommodation at the time of their application was considered a factor \nadverse to whether they should be considered for SHC assistance is not immediately apparent. However, the fact \nthat it was taken into account reveals the 'catch 22' that Don and Sylvia found themselves in. They were unable to \nobtain SHC assistance at least in part because of the impoverished accommodation in which they lived at the time, \nyet until they obtained State assistance to find a house they were unlikely to be able to improve the accommodation \nin which they were living.  \n\n1011 This difficulty was compounded by the classifications to which Don, Sylvia and the Children were subject \nunder the Native Welfare Act. I have already alluded to the fact that one of the difficulties caused by the \nclassification of aboriginal people as 'natives' or 'quadroons' was the impact that this classification had on their \nentitlement to enter onto aboriginal reserves. This created a very real problem for Don and Sylvia. Because Sylvia \nand the Children were classified as 'natives', they were entitled to live on the Brookton Reserve, but because Don \nwas classified a 'quadroon' he was not permitted to live on the Reserve. This state of affairs continued until well into \nthe 1960s. In a file note dated 10 April 1967, the Child Welfare Department's District Officer at Narrogin, Mr Hill, \nnoted that housing remained an acute problem for Don. Mr Hill noted that Don:  was living in a rough iron hut on the \nedge of the Native Reserve where (on the reserve) several new Native Welfare Dept aluminium houses were \nalmost completed. It was suggested that he see the [Native Welfare] officers on the next occasion they visited the \nReserve and see if they would give him one of the [Native Welfare] houses in Brookton or on the Reserve. I \npromised that I would see Mr H.I Tilbrook and speak with Mr D.H. Roberts, and put in a good word for him. This I \ndid, but both officers told me that they had not been asked for a house, but in any case had none to give to this man \nand his family.\n\n ...Actually this man is a quadroon, and his wife and his children are looked upon as Natives. For this reason, he \nbeing the breadwinner can get our [Maintenance Assistance] but not [Native Welfare] housing.[1216]\n\n1012 In a file note dated 11 January 1968, Mr Hill noted:  One of the biggest troubles in this case is that Mrs \nCollard, and all her children are classed as Native whilst her husband is deemed to be a quadroon. Because of this \nthe Department of Native Welfare will not give the husband a house on a Native Reserve, whilst he is not in the \nrace to get a State Rental, because he would not be classed as a good enough risk, and in any case could not the \ndeposit even if a house was allocated to him.[1217]\n\n1013 I find that by virtue of their classifications under the Native Welfare Act, Don and Sylvia were, until at least \n1968, ineligible to obtain a house on the Brookton Reserve.  \n\n1014 In Mr WrightWebster's memorandum of 7 August 1962, he noted that Don and Sylvia's children were wards of \nthe State. There was no reference to, nor apparently any appreciation of, the fact that Don and Sylvia's living \nconditions and accommodation were key factors in the decisions to make the Children wards, and would be key \nfactors in any decision as to whether the Children should be permitted to return to their parents. That there was no \nsuch appreciation is particularly regrettable given that it was the advice of Mr WrightWebster a person no doubt \nacutely aware of the difficulties faced by aboriginal people generally, and by the Collards in particular which very \nclearly was the basis for the decision by the SHC to refuse Don's application for housing assistance.  \n\n1015 It is difficult to resist the conclusion that had Don and Sylvia been able to obtain a conventional house much \nearlier than they did, their lives in general, and their prospects of securing the early return of the Children, may have \nbeen very different. However, there was no evidence as to whether the availability of public housing in Western \n\n\n\nAustralia at the time was such that Don and Sylvia would necessarily have been able to secure an SHC property \neven if their application had had the support of the Department of Native Welfare or the Child Welfare Department.  \n\n(iii) The difficulties experienced by aboriginal people in Western Australia in obtaining housing during this period\n\n1016 During the period of the Children's wardships, neither the Department of Native Welfare, nor the Child Welfare \nDepartment, had statutory responsibility for providing housing for aboriginal people.[1218] Instead, the SHC had \nresponsibility for the provision of state housing generally.[1219]  \n\n1017 Mr Maine's evidence, which I accept, was that the Child Welfare Department liaised with the SHC to try to \nensure that aboriginal clients had suitable housing. However, Mr Maine's evidence indicates that the problems \nexperienced by Don and Sylvia in obtaining SHC assistance were similar to those experienced by many aboriginal \npeople at the time. His evidence was:  many of the [aboriginal] clients had an unsatisfactory record with the housing \ncommission for rental payment and property maintenance and things like that, so there continued for a long time to \nbe a number of families in the main country towns who were accommodated, continued to be accommodated on \nthe reserves where there was a fairly primitive form of housing. Those families remained there. Some of them were \ntried again in state housing accommodation, but there were a number who the State Housing Commission wasn't \nprepared to try with any more because of their past record ... .[1220]\n\n1018 In 1969, Mr Terence Long, a Community Liaison Officer for the Department of Native Welfare, and previously \nbeen a Patrol Officer for the Southern District, published a paper entitled 'The Role of the Department of Native \nWelfare for Western Australia'.[1221] In his paper, Mr Long discussed housing for aboriginal people in Western \nAustralia, and provided a useful summary of the position in the mid to late 1950s through to the late 1960s. He said:  \nHousing, of course, remains one of the greatest single problems.\n\n In the mid1950s the Government, through the State Housing Commission, inaugurated a scheme of specially \ndesigned housing for Aborigines in Western Australia. The house was a compromise design with a central \nkitchencumliving room, with verandah sleepouts surrounding this area. They were unlined, and cold and \nuncomfortable in winter. The families placed in these houses were those that were quite unready to make the move \nfrom corrugatediron and hessianbag shanties to life in an unfamiliar town environment. About 100 of these homes \nwere built, but the people either failed to comply with the tenancy agreement, or were evicted because of neglect \nand damage to the property, overcrowded and antisocial behaviour, or nonpayment of rent. About 30 per cent of the \ntenants, however, remained. The houses were improved and are lived in today, so the scheme could be called a \npartial success. Following the lessons learnt from this somewhat abortive, though wellintentioned, attempt at \naboriginal housing, a threestage transitional scheme was launched by the Department of Native Welfare in 1959.\n\n Stage 1: This is called the primary transitional stage. It provides basic shelter in twoand threeroomed dwellings on \ncamping reserves, with communal toilet and laundry facilities. Approximately 500 of these units have been built, and \nthis stage has now been completed. ... The intention here was to eliminate the unsightly, unhygienic humpies in \nwhich so many Aborigines lived ten years or so ago.\n\n Stage 2: This is termed the standard transitional stage because the designs comply in all respects with the \nStandard Building ByLaws. The houses are built on town lots and are selfcontained with their own toilet and laundry \nfacilities ... . They are slightly smaller than a conventional home and are of a fairly robust construction. \nNevertheless, they do have a pleasing appearance, and the main advantage to the Department is the fact that they \nare a little cheaper than conventional housing and can be built from the Revenue Vote. ... Today, 280 of these \nhomes have been built or authorised, but growing opposition from local authorities to the presence in their towns of \nthis type of housing is inhibiting this stage of the scheme.\n\n The Department believes that construction will now taper away in favour of conventional housing, which is:\n\n Stage 3: These are conventional homes, either obtained through the State Housing Commission or provided by \nthis Department. It is estimated that some 130 families already occupy State homes, with an undetermined number \n\n\n\nprivately rented and owned. Another 35 live in Native Welfare Department builtandowned conventional homes, and \na further 21 of these are authorized for 1968. It is in this field that the Commonwealth Government can render \nimmediate effective assistance, should it decide to make funds available on a realistic scale ... .[1222]\n\n1019 There was evidence that officers within the Child Welfare Department in the 1950s and 1960s were aware of \nthe need for special measures to be taken to obtain housing for aboriginal people. Mr Maine's view was that an \nimprovement in the wellbeing of aboriginal people depended on their being able to obtain suitable housing, and that \nlife on native reserves was damaging for them.[1223] He explained that in response to the difficulties aboriginal \npeople faced in obtaining SHC housing, the Child Welfare Department:  sought funds from the Commonwealth \ngovernment to provide housing ourselves, and we then worked with those families intensively over several years, \ninvolving them in the actual construction of the homes, the fitting out of the homes and the preparation of the \ngrounds. That was done mainly through the use of homemaker services, some of who were aboriginal people \nthemselves. Those families then were moved into what I think were about 30 homes scattered throughout the \nsouthwest, and the department then continued to work with them for 12 months and then, because we did not have \na statutory obligation to provide housing, we negotiated with the housing commission to hand those homes over to \nthe State Housing Commission. As far as I'm aware, those families continued with the good record that they had by \nthe end of the 12 months during their tenancy with the housing commission.[1224]\n\n1020 However, he made clear that this programme resulted from the injection of significant Commonwealth funding \nduring the period of the Whitlam government in the early 1970s, which enabled the construction of the 30 \ntransportable homes to which he referred in his evidence.[1225]  \n\n1021 The evidence clearly established in the 1950s and 1960s that there was a significant need for state housing \nassistance for aboriginal people and limited resources to meet that need.  \n\n(s) Maintenance orders made in relation to the care of the Children  \n\n1022 On 13 March 1958, the Children's Court at Beverley made an order that Don pay maintenance in the sum of 1 \npound per week for Ellen.[1226] Initially the order required that Don pay the maintenance to the \nDirector.[1227]However, as the Department of Native Welfare had responsibility for Ellen (and later the Siblings) \nuntil 1964, the Department of Native Welfare applied for the transfer of the maintenance order to it, and an order to \nthat effect was made on 19 November 1958.[1228]  \n\n1023 When the Children's Court at Brookton ordered that the Siblings be made wards, Don was not present in \nCourt, and an order for the payment of maintenance could not be obtained.[1229] Instead, a separate application \nfor an order for the payment of maintenance was made by officers of the Department of Native Welfare.[1230] On 1 \nMarch 1962, that application was heard by the Magistrate at Brookton, and from 2 March 1962, Don was ordered to \npay the Department of Native Welfare the total sum of 5 pounds per week for the maintenance of the \nSiblings.[1231]In other words, from 2 March 1962, Don was obliged to pay 6 pounds per week for maintenance for \nthe Children. (After the introduction of decimal currency in 1966, that equated to an obligation to pay $12 per week \nin maintenance.)  \n\n1024 Although Don made maintenance payments, he did not always keep up to date and he quickly accumulated a \nlarge sum in arrears.[1232] There were in evidence a number of documents which indicated that Court action was \ntaken to enforce the maintenance orders,[1233] and on a number of occasions, Don served time in custody in lieu \nof payment of outstanding maintenance.[1234]  \n\n(t) Injuries and causation  \n\n1025 It is appropriate to record my findings in relation to the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs and as to the \ncausation of those injuries, so that if it were necessary to assess the equitable compensation payable to the \nplaintiffs, that could be done without the need for further evidence, or at least with minimal further evidence.  \n\n1026 I find that each of the plaintiffs suffers from a psychiatric injury, and that that injury was caused by the \nseparation of the Children from Don and Sylvia (by virtue of the Children being placed in institutional or foster care, \naway from their parents). The psychiatric evidence in this case clearly established that that was so, and the State \ndid not dispute it.[1235] In the case of Beverley and Glenys, the evidence established (and it was not disputed) that \ntheir psychiatric injuries were also caused by the sexual assaults to which they were subjected, and I make that \nfinding.  \n\n\n\n1027 It is appropriate to briefly set out my findings in relation to the psychiatric injury suffered by each of the \nplaintiffs, by reference to the expert evidence. Each of the plaintiffs was examined by psychiatrists called by the \nplaintiffs and the State. Those experts then conferred and in the case of each plaintiff, a joint report was tendered, \nwhich set out the matters on which the expert witnesses agreed. My findings are drawn from those joint expert \nreports in relation to each plaintiff.  \n\nDon\n\n1028 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Tanney and Dr Smith, I find that Don is suffering from a \nmental disorder, with symptoms of unresolved feelings of shame and guilt, which meets most but not all of the \ncriteria for a 'Disorder of Extreme Stress'.[1236] For the first six years after the Children lived in care, this disorder \nwould have been likely to meet the criteria of PostTraumatic Stress Disorder.[1237] The disorder remains a \nsubstantial and sustained mental disorder.[1238] Having regard to the joint report of Dr Tanney and Dr Smith, I find \nthat Don's mental disorder impairs his capacity to fully function and find enjoyment in his marital and parental roles, \nand makes him feel 'ineffective'.[1239] Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Tanney and Dr Smith, I find \nthat while Don's injury can be treated, a return to full emotional health is unlikely.[1240] I accept their evidence that \nDon's symptoms should be treated by culturally appropriate counselling and support services, followed by family \ntherapy.[1241]  \n\nSylvia\n\n1029 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I find that Sylvia suffers from a \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder or mixed anxiety and depression.[1242] I accept the evidence of Dr Davison and Dr \nFitch that Sylvia has suffered repeated adjustment disorders in the past, which have now developed into a chronic \nmental illness.[1243] I find that the effects of the mental illness from which Mrs Collard suffers include considerable \ndistress, sadness, anxiety and hypervigilance.[1244]  \n\n1030 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I find that Sylvia is likely to suffer \nsymptoms for the foreseeable future and possibly for the rest of her life, and will be vulnerable to exacerbations of \nthe symptoms in the event of suffering any future losses (such as a death of a family member).[1245] I accept the \nevidence of Dr Davison and Dr Fitch that Sylvia's symptoms would benefit from culturally appropriate counselling, \neither individually or with her family.[1246]  \n\nDarryl\n\n1031 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Tanney and Dr Smith I find that Darryl does not currently \nhave a mental illness, but does suffer from psychological impairment which meets most of the criteria for a 'Disorder \nof Extreme Stress'.[1247] That impairment is clinically significant in that it is substantial and sustained,[1248] and it \nmanifests in difficulties with trust and intimacy, that strongly impact upon Darryl's capacity to fulfil filial, family and \nparental roles.[1249] I accept the evidence of Dr Tanney and Dr Smith that Darryl will continue to suffer symptoms \nfor the foreseeable future.[1250]  \n\n1032 Having regard to the evidence of Dr Tanney and Dr Smith, I accept that Darryl could benefit from individual \nsupportive psychotherapy and family systems therapy.[1251]  \n\nBonnie\n\n1033 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Fitch and Dr Davidson, I find that Bonnie suffers a psychiatric \ninjury, namely Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder[1252] which causes her considerable \ndistress, reduces her enjoyment of life, and has had a negative impact on her relationships, including her \nrelationships with her children.[1253]  \n\n1034 I accept the evidence of Dr Fitch and Dr Davidson that Bonnie is likely to suffer symptoms for the foreseeable \nfuture and that her symptoms may worsen in the event that she suffers any future losses (such as a death of a \nfamily member).[1254] I also accept their evidence that Bonnie would benefit from both antidepressant treatment \nand individual cognitive behaviour therapy with a psychologist,[1255] and that she may need indefinite access to \ntreatment.[1256]  \n\nBeverley\n\n1035 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Smith and Dr Fitch I find that Beverley suffers from a Major \nDepressive Disorder which is recurrent and moderately severe,[1257] and which manifests in persistent and \n\n\n\nsignificant symptoms of anxiety and distress. Dr Fitch characterised Beverley's disorder as a PostTraumatic Stress \nDisorder, whilst Dr Smith characterised her disorder as dysthymia.[1258] I accept their evidence that Beverley's \ndisorder has had a profound effect on her enjoyment of life.[1259]  \n\n1036 Having regard to the evidence of Dr Smith and Dr Fitch I find that although Beverley's condition is not curable, \nshe may benefit from antidepressant medication and cognitive behaviour therapy or dialectical behaviour therapy \nwith a psychologist,[1260] and that she would need indefinite access to such treatment.[1261]  \n\nEllen\n\n1037 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Smith and Dr Fitch, I find that Ellen is suffering from an \n'emotionally unstable personality disorder',[1262] and that she has an affective (mood) disorder. Dr Fitch says this \nfits the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, whilst Dr Davidson says it is best characterised as \ndysthymia.[1263]Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Smith and Dr Fitch, I find that Ellen's mental \nhealth disorders have a continuing significant and disabling effect upon her daily life.[1264] She has a poor sense of \nself, considerable emotional pain, social dislocation, isolation, and tends to endure unhealthy relationships rather \nthan being alone.[1265]  \n\n1038 Dr Smith and Dr Fitch agreed that Ellen's disorders were not curable but were amenable to treatment.[1266] I \naccept their evidence that Ellen will require antidepressant medication indefinitely,[1267] and that she would benefit \nfrom culturally appropriate psychiatric treatment and psychological counselling[1268] which may be required for \nmany years.[1269]  \n\nGlenys\n\n1039 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I find that Glenys is suffering from \nserious psychological damage, which has in turn affected her personality development.[1270] Dr Fitch described \nher condition as 'complex posttraumatic stress disorder' whilst Dr Davidson called it 'enduring personality change \nafter catastrophic experience', but they agreed that they were describing the same set of symptoms.[1271] I also \naccept their evidence that Glenys suffers from an affective (mood) disorder. Dr Fitch characterised this as a major \ndepressive disorder, whilst Dr Davidson said it best fitted the diagnosis of generalised anxiety \ndisorder.[1272]Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I find that the sexual abuse \nGlenys endured has also contributed to the development of a chronic pain disorder,[1273] and that she depends on \nprescription drugs to help her manage the pain.[1274]  \n\n1040 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I find that the accumulated effect of \nthese psychiatric conditions upon Glenys' daily life is profound and disabling,[1275] affecting her ability to work, and \nto bond with her children. I accept their evidence that Glenys is likely to suffer symptoms for many years and will be \nvulnerable to exacerbations of those symptoms in the event of suffering any future losses (such as a death of a \nfamily member).[1276]  \n\n1041 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, I accept that Glenys' injuries would \nbenefit from culturally appropriate psychological treatment. In the view of Dr Davison and Dr Fitch, Glenys may be \nassisted by the intervention of a third party to coordinate the many medical services she requires, and to liaise with \nmedical staff in the future, so that she receives the treatment she requires.[1277] However, this aspect of treatment \nwould need to be explored further before any assessment of its financial implications could be made.  \n\nEva\n\n1042 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Fitch and Dr Davidson, I find that Eva has suffered from a \nMajor Depressive Disorder (which is currently in remission), and that she suffers from Panic Disorder, and \npersonality problems[1278] which Dr Fitch described as 'enduring personality change after catastrophic \nexperiences' and Dr Davidson described as 'mixed personality disorder with features of anxious personality disorder \nand emotionally unstable personality disorder'.[1279]  \n\n1043 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Fitch and Dr Davidson, I find that Eva's mental disorders have \nhad a significant and considerable impact on her life over time[1280] and that she has had difficulties in trusting \nothers and in dependence on others, no sense of identity, feelings of anger and not belonging, and difficulties in \nrelation to parenting[1281] her own children as a consequence of not having fully attached to her parents prior to \nher separation from them.[1282]  \n\n\n\n1044 While I accept the evidence of Dr Fitch and Dr Davidson that at present Eva's disorders do not seriously \nimpact upon her quality, and reasonable enjoyment, of life[1283] I also accept their evidence that Eva is likely to \nhave symptoms in the foreseeable future, and that she will remain vulnerable to exacerbations of her depression \nduring times of stress and loss. I also accept their evidence that Eva would benefit from psychological treatment in \neither an individual setting or with her family,[1284] and that such treatment may be required for many years.[1285]  \n\nWesley\n\n1045 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Tanney and Dr Smith I find that Wesley suffers from a \nchronic, persistent and severe mental disorder,[1286] which Dr Smith characterised as 'emotionally unstable \npersonality disorder',[1287] and which Dr Tanney characterised as Dysthymia.[1288] Both agreed that the disorder \nhad an early onset and continued chronic presentation.  \n\n1046 I accept the evidence of Dr Tanney and Dr Smith that Wesley's mental disorder markedly impacts upon his \nlife, as it results in difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships, and difficulties with regulating his moods \nand controlling his impulses.[1289] His symptoms include low selfesteem, pessimism and chronic fatigue, which \ndistort and damage all of his relationships with other people,[1290] including his relationships with his children \nwhich have been particularly affected.[1291]  \n\n1047 Having regard to the joint report prepared by Dr Tanney and Dr Smith I find that Wesley's mental disorder is \nunlikely to be cured, and his condition is likely to deteriorate.[1292] I accept their evidence that it is possible that \nWesley may benefit from supportive counselling aimed at healing family bonds, but with the qualification that \nWesley's motivation to participate, willingness to accept help, capacity to establish a therapeutic relationship, and \nalcohol and substance abuse, may be limiting factors in the success of any treatment.[1293]  \n\n(u) Actions taken by the plaintiffs in pursuit of their claims  \n\n1048 It is appropriate to record my findings in relation to the evidence adduced in support of the State's defence of \nlaches. I do so despite my decision, explained below, to refrain from making a determination on the legal issues \npresented by the defence.  \n\n1049 A large number of documents were tendered by consent in relation to the laches defence. Those documents \ndisclosed the actions taken by or on behalf of the plaintiffs from July 1993. I make the following factual findings, \ndrawn from the content of those documents.  \n\n1050 In or shortly before July 1993, Don and Sylvia appear to have contacted the ALS seeking that the ALS \ninvestigate the circumstances in which Ellen was removed from them.[1294] In July 1993, draft statements were \ntaken from Don and Sylvia and Ellen. Enquiries were then made to obtain access to all relevant documents in the \npossession of the Department for Community Development,[1295] and at least some of those appear to have been \nprovided by November 1993.[1296]  \n\n1051 By late 1994 or early 1995, Glenys, Wesley, Beverley, Bonnie and Darryl had indicated that they also wanted \nan investigation of what had happened to them, and consented to relevant information being obtained about \nthem.[1297]  \n\n1052 It was agreed between the parties that during 1994 and 1995, the ALS was provided with copies of a large \nnumber of documents by the Department for Community Development.[1298] It was also agreed between the \nparties that while those documents did not include every document which was tendered in evidence in these \nproceedings, nevertheless all of the significant documents necessary to understand what happened to the plaintiffs, \nincluding documents from the files of the Child Welfare Department and the Department of Native Welfare, were \nprovided to the plaintiffs' solicitors in 1994 and 1995.[1299]  \n\n1053 Following the receipt of those documents, solicitors from the ALS then commenced an analysis of the \nstatutory and factual history.[1300]  \n\n1054 In April 1995, the ALS published 'Telling our Story' which set out some details of the stories of aboriginal \npeople who had been removed from their families in various circumstances. As I noted at [700] one of the families \nreferred to in that document (albeit under pseudonym) appears to have been the Collard family.  \n\n1055 By June 1995, investigations into the facts were sufficiently far advanced (including the preparation of proofs \nof evidence from each of the plaintiffs[1301]) that the ALS was in a position to brief Ms Christine Wheeler QC to \nprovide advice.[1302]  \n\n\n\n1056 I should mention at this point that solicitors from the ALS were also acting on behalf of other aboriginal people \nwho had been removed from their families. They appear to have been considering the Collards' case along with a \nnumber of others as part of a project the ALS referred to as the 'Removal of Children' project.[1303] A later \ndocument suggests that the ALS was representing over 700 clients in relation to this project.[1304]  \n\n1057 On 21 December 1995 Ms Wheeler QC provided a comprehensive opinion in relation to the various causes of \naction that might be pursued by aboriginal people who, as children, had been removed from their families up until \nthe 1960s, and by aboriginal people whose children were taken from their care. Relevantly for present purposes, \nher opinion addressed the bases for a possible action for a breach of fiduciary duty by the State, the application of \nthe Crown Suits Act 1947 (WA), and the need for evidence of compensable damage which had been suffered by \nany plaintiffs.  \n\n1058 In May 1996, the ALS made a submission to the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal Children \nfrom their Families (the Stolen Generation Inquiry).[1305] For present purposes, that document is significant \nbecause it contained a discussion of the causes of action children removed from their families might be able to \nbring against the State, including an action for a breach of fiduciary duty. The submission also made \nrecommendations that the State government introduce legislation to amend the Limitation Act 1935 and the Crown \nSuits Act to permit actions to be commenced by aboriginal people to provide legal redress for the injuries, pain and \nsuffering caused to them by their removal. I infer that the solicitors in the ALS who were working on the Removal of \nChildren Project were aware of the potential difficulties in bringing any action as a result of limitations periods, and \nthe requirements of the Crown Suits Act.  \n\n1059 In 1996 and 1997, the solicitors from the ALS turned their attention to attempting to secure funding for a test \ncase on the removal of children from their families.[1306] Applications for funding or financial assistance were made \nto a number of bodies,[1307] including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission,[1308] and to a \nnumber of prominent Australians and business people.[1309] Attempts were also made to establish a working \ngroup of prominent individuals from business, media, sporting and entertainment areas, to increase public \nawareness of the issue of the removal of aboriginal children from their families, and to act as a focus for fund raising \nto finance a number of test cases.[1310] It appears that attempts to secure funding were unsuccessful.  \n\n1060 By this time, Ms Wheeler QC had been appointed a judge of this Court, and the ALS then briefed Mr Nicholas \nMullany, a barrister, to provide advice as to the suitability of a number of the ALS' clients to be included as plaintiffs \nin a test case in relation to their removal from their families as children.[1311] By January 1997, Glenys had given \nher consent to the use of her case as a test case in any such litigation.[1312]  \n\n1061 By March 1997, it appears that proceedings had been commenced for one client against the Minister for \nCommunity Welfare.[1313]  \n\n1062 At the same time, the ALS took steps to engage psychiatrists to provide expert evidence in relation to the \npsychiatric injury suffered by potential participants in a test case.[1314]  \n\n1063 On 18 June 1997, Mr Mullany provided advice in which he confirmed a list of suitable plaintiffs for inclusion in \na test case. Those potential plaintiffs included Don and Sylvia, Glenys, Eva and Ellen. He also addressed some \npotential difficulties in relation to their claims.[1315] An internal ALS memorandum dated 18 June 1997 indicated \nthat as a result of Mr Mullany's advice, 13 possible plaintiffs, and potentially four additional plaintiffs, had been \nidentified, and that the legal officers within the ALS 'hope to file the action in the Supreme Court within the next \nthree weeks'.[1316]  \n\n1064 On 1 July 1997, Mr Mullany was instructed to draft a statement of claim for that litigation.[1317] By 1 August \n1997, he had further refined the list of plaintiffs for that intended action. He also provided advice that steps should \nbe taken to obtain psychiatric evidence in respect of each of those persons. In addition, Mr Mullany noted that \nnotice would be required to be given pursuant to the Crown Suits Act, and that this should be done once the \nStatement of Claim was finalised.[1318]  \n\n1065 By 25 August 1997, the absence of funding for a test case had resulted in a decision to defer filing a \nstatement of claim 'until adequate funding has been obtained to finance the entire litigation'.[1319] Mr Mullany \nprovided further advice at that time in which he enclosed a draft statement of claim (which was incomplete in \nrelation to some factual matters) and which included Ellen, Glenys and Eva (amongst others) as plaintiffs,[1320] \n\n\n\nand in which he emphasised that 'efforts to obtain adequate funding must be made immediately given the limitation \nof action difficulties which we already face'.[1321]  \n\n1066 In September 1997, Mr Mullany provided further advice in which he reiterated that 'funding must be obtained \nas a matter of urgency in the light of the limitation of action difficulties which we already face. Proceedings must be \ninstituted as soon as possible. Success on the limitation of action arguments must not be compromised by \navoidable delay in relation to decisions on funding'.[1322]  \n\n1067 The lack of funding for a test case meant that by December 1997, the ALS was no longer in a position to \nretain counsel to act.[1323]  \n\n1068 By January 1998, attempts were being made to obtain the assistance of Slater and Gordon to act pro bono in \na test case[1324] and information was provided to that firm (including in relation to Glenys, Eva and Ellen) to enable \nit to assess the possible action.[1325]  \n\n1069 By May 1998, the ALS had received a modest grant from ATSIC to pursue work on the test cases.[1326] In \nview of that grant, Mr Ross Lonnie, a barrister, was engaged to undertake some work in relation to those matters, \nparticularly in relation to the matter which had been commenced in the Supreme Court (which did not involve any of \nthe plaintiffs).[1327] Amongst other things, Mr Lonnie was briefed to advise on the suitability of particular persons \nas plaintiffs in a test case (including the plaintiffs in this action), to advise on causes of action which were open, to \nadvise on psychological evidence which was required, and to prepare a statement of claim.[1328]  \n\n1070 Mr Robert Pringle QC was also briefed to work on the matters. At that stage, Mr Pringle QC offered to work on \nthe matter pro bono if the ALS ran out of funding.[1329]  \n\n1071 Mr Pringle QC and Mr Lonnie provided detailed advice and five draft statements of claim (including one in \nrelation to Glenys) on 26 June 1998.[1330]  \n\n1072 In February 1999, Mr Lonnie wrote to the ALS and noted that he had not received any response to the advice \nand draft statements of claim which he and Mr Pringle QC had provided in June of the previous year.[1331]  \n\n1073 In May 1999, Mr Robert Richardson provided advice to the ALS in respect of a test case or cases, in light of \nthe decision in Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia.[1332]  \n\n1074 No further substantive work appears to have been done in relation to a possible test case involving the \nplaintiffs between then and December 2007.  \n\n1075 In evidence were letters from the ALS to Beverley, and to Glenys, dated 12 December 2007, in which they \nwere advised that the ALS was  not in a position to commence any litigation and we note that we do not represent \nto you that we will commence litigation on your behalf. If you are not satisfied with this position, then you may wish \nto seek independent legal advice from another law firm.[1333]\n\n1076 By April 2008, Lavan Legal had agreed to review the ALS' client files to determine whether civil action was \nviable.[1334]  \n\n1077 In mid2008, the ALS assisted some of the plaintiffs to make an application to the Redress WA \nscheme,[1335]and those applications were submitted during the first half of 2009.[1336]  \n\n1078 I find that by the end of December 1995, the plaintiffs had knowledge of the facts sufficient to commence their \naction. I find that by August 1997, having received detailed advice from Ms Wheeler and from Mr Mullany, and a \ndraft statement of claim from Mr Mullany, which dealt specifically with the claims of Glenys, Eva and Ellen, the \nplaintiffs were in a position to commence their action. The actual knowledge that the plaintiffs had as to their causes \nof action against the State was confirmed in June 1998 when further advice was provided by Mr Pringle QC and Mr \nLonnie, including a draft statement of claim in relation to Glenys' claim.  \n\n1079 The present action was commenced on 26 May 2010.  \n\n1080 There was therefore a delay of over 14 years between the time when the plaintiffs had knowledge of the facts \nsufficient to commence their action, and when they actually commenced their action.  \n\nFacts relevant to the State's claim of prejudice\n\n\n\n1081 The wardships commenced in 1958 and 1961, that is, between 55 and 52 years ago. The wardship of the \neldest of the surviving Children, Darryl, concluded 43 years ago, in September 1970. The wardship of the youngest \nof the Children, Wesley, concluded 34 years ago, in March 1979.  \n\n1082 I find that the persons referred to in Annexure A, who are noted as being deceased, all died before the \nplaintiffs' action was commenced, save for Mr Long, who died after the action was commenced. Those persons \nincluded some persons with a significant involvement in the events the subject of this action, including Miss Jones, \nMr Tilbrook, Mr Waghorne, Mr Wright-Webster, Constable Wall, Constable Brennan, Mrs Jean Collard, and Mr and \nMrs Daniel.  \n\n1083 I find that the persons referred to in Annexure A, who are there noted as being unable to give evidence due to \nphysical or mental infirmity, were unable to give evidence in these proceedings for that reason. Those two persons, \nnamely Mrs Victoria Lewis (nee Hobcroft) and Mr Moulton, had a significant involvement in the events the subject of \nthis action.  \n\n1084 A number of the persons who provided witness statements in these proceedings indicated in their witness \nstatements that they had no independent recollection of the plaintiffs or of events relevant to the action. I accept \nthat evidence. I infer that their inability to recollect those events has either been the result of, or was significantly \nattributable to, the lengthy period of time between the events in question, and the commencement of this action. \nThose persons included Mr Humphries and Constable Whitney, both of whom had a significant role in the events \nthe subject of this action.  \n\n1085 Finally, in respect of the persons listed in Annexure A who are noted as unable to be located, having regard to \nthe affidavits of Mr Pudovskis[1337] and Ms Young.[1338] I find that reasonable efforts have been made to locate \nthose persons but that they have been unable to be found. Some of those persons, such as Mrs McIntyre, had a \nsignificant involvement in the events the subject of this action.  \n\n1086 Annexure A is not intended to be a complete list of all of those persons involved in these proceedings. Other \npersons not included in that list have either died, or are unable to be located despite the State's enquiries. However, \nit is unnecessary to list all of those persons for present purposes.  \n\n1087 Finally, I have already made findings in relation to the incomplete documentary record at [46] to [55] above. I \ninfer that those documents which cannot be located have either been lost or destroyed, and that it is more likely \nthan not that that incomplete documentary record has resulted from, or is significantly attributable to, the lengthy \nperiod of time between the events to which those documents pertained and the commencement of this action.  \n\n4. WAS THE STATE UNDER A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE CHILDREN DURING THEIR WARDSHIPS?  \n\n1088 The core of the plaintiffs' case is that the State owed them fiduciary duties. Two kinds of fiduciary duties were \nalleged against the State: duties owed to the plaintiffs while the Children were wards (the primary fiduciary duties) \nand secondary fiduciary duties which were said to continue to apply to the State. In this section of my reasons, I \ndeal with the question whether a fiduciary relationship existed between the plaintiffs and the State, and then \naddress the reasons why I am not persuaded that the State owed the primary fiduciary duties alleged by the \nplaintiffs. Later in my reasons I explain why the State also did not owe the secondary fiduciary duties alleged by the \nplaintiffs.  \n\n1089 The fiduciary duties the State is alleged to have owed the plaintiffs were said to have arisen by virtue of the \nexistence of a relationship of guardian and ward between the State and the Children, or by virtue of the relationship \nwhich existed between the State and the aboriginal people of Western Australia following European settlement.  \n\n1090 Having carefully considered the legislative framework, the facts in relation to the Children's wardships, and the \nauthorities, I have reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims of the existence of fiduciary duties on the part of \nthe State must fail, for four reasons. I explain those reasons in detail below, but in summary they are as follows.  \n\n1091 First, the application of the established principles in relation to the existence of fiduciary duties does not \nsupport the conclusion that the State owed or owes a fiduciary duty to all aboriginal people in Western Australia. \nThe recognition of fiduciary duties by the executive government to indigenous peoples in other jurisdictions provides \nno support for finding a fiduciary duty in this case.  \n\n\n\n1092 Secondly, having regard to the statutory framework governing the Children's wardships, it cannot be said that \nthe State itself occupied the position of a trustee or a guardian with respect to the Children during their wardships, \nnor can it be said that the maintenance payments Don made for the maintenance of the Children were impressed \nwith a trust, requiring that money to be used in the care and maintenance of the Children.  \n\n1093 Thirdly, the authorities in relation to fiduciary duties do not support the conclusion that the role of the Director \nof the Child Welfare Department as the guardian of the Children during their wardships gave rise to any fiduciary \nduty to the plaintiffs.  \n\n1094 Fourthly, the nature and content of the duties the plaintiffs claim were owed to them by the State militates \nagainst the conclusion that those duties can properly be said to be fiduciary in nature, having regard to the existing \nstate of the law in relation to fiduciary duties.  \n\n1095 Accordingly, in this section of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n\n(a) the pleaded bases for the fiduciary duties the State is alleged to have owed to the plaintiffs;  \n\n(b) whether the State owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs arising from a fiduciary duty owed to all aboriginal \npeople;  \n\n(c) whether the State occupied the position of a trustee or a guardian with respect to the Children;  \n\n(d) whether the role of the Director of the Child Welfare Department as guardian of the Children gave rise to a \nfiduciary duty to the Children on the part of the State; and  \n\n(e) whether the duties said to be owed to the plaintiffs are duties of the kind owed by a fiduciary.  \n\n(a) The pleaded bases for the fiduciary duties the State is alleged to have owed to the plaintiffs  \n\n1096 In the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the State owed the Children duties as a trustee, \nor as a guardian, which gave rise to a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests and welfare of the Children. Further, \nor in the alternative, the plaintiffs alleged that the State owed fiduciary duties to Don and Sylvia in their dealings with \nthe Children, and owed fiduciary duties to the Children in exercising the powers of a guardian, not to fail to act in the \nbest interests of the Children with respect to their custody, maintenance and education, and in particular not to \ndisregard the best interests of the Children in the benefits of an upbringing within the family unit of their natural \nparents and siblings.  \n\n1097 The source of the fiduciary duties was pleaded, in the alternative, as arising from the existence of a \nrelationship of trust and confidence, a relationship of guardian and child, or a fiduciary relationship more generally. \nIn the course of his submissions counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the plaintiffs' case against the State was \nbased solely on the existence of a fiduciary relationship which in turn was founded on guardianship.[1339] \nHowever, the plaintiffs' case in relation to the fiduciary duty said to be owed to Don and Sylvia was based primarily \non the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the State and aboriginal people since European settlement of \nthe colony of Western Australia. The existence of a guardianship relationship between the State and the Children \nwas relied upon as a secondary basis for the existence of a duty to Don and Sylvia.[1340]  \n\n1098 Although counsel for the plaintiffs did not seek to amend the Statement of Claim, nor did he formally abandon \nthe alternative bases pleaded as giving rise to the fiduciary duty, the plaintiffs' case at trial was run on the more \nconfined bases outlined by counsel for the plaintiffs. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to deal with the \nalternative bases relied upon by the plaintiffs as giving rise to a fiduciary duty.  \n\n1099 The fiduciary duty allegedly owed by the State to the plaintiffs was said to have two bases.[1341]  \n\n1100 First, the plaintiffs pleaded that upon the acquisition of British sovereignty in the Colony of Western Australia, \nthe Crown assumed duties and powers in relation to the aboriginal inhabitants of Western Australia and that that \ngave rise to a fiduciary duty to the aboriginal inhabitants with respect to their welfare. The plaintiffs pleaded that the \nassumption of that fiduciary duty was manifested in the enactment of the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA), the \nAborigines Act 1897 (WA), the Aborigines Act 1905, the NW Acts, and the aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act \n1972 (WA). Each of these Acts was said to have established boards, departments or offices charged with the duty \nof protecting or maintaining the aboriginal people, or promoting their welfare, and in the case of the NW Act, \nproviding that the Commissioner on behalf of the State was the legal guardian of every aboriginal person and \nhalfcaste.[1342]  \n\n\n\n1101 In the case of the Department of Native Welfare, the plaintiffs pleaded that it was the duty of the Department \non behalf of the State to provide for the custody, maintenance and education of the children of aboriginal persons, \nand to exercise such general supervision and care in respect of all matters affecting the interests and welfare of \naboriginal persons as the Minister considered fit, to assist their economic and social assimilation, and to protect \nthem against injustice, imposition and fraud.[1343]  \n\n1102 The plaintiffs pleaded that by virtue of the provisions of the NW Act the State was the guardian at law of the \nChildren at all relevant times, the Commissioner (on behalf of the State) was the statutory legal guardian of the \nChildren at all times from their birth, and the application to have the Children committed to the care of the Child \nWelfare Department was made pursuant to the powers of the State, and of the Commissioner on behalf of the \nState, pursuant to that guardianship relationship with the Children.[1344]  \n\n1103 Secondly, the plaintiffs relied on the fact that the Children were committed to the care of the Child Welfare \nDepartment pursuant to the Child Welfare Act.[1345] The plaintiffs also relied on various provisions of the Child \nWelfare Act (namely those which vested the care, management and control of the person and property of wards in \nthe Director, permitted neglected or destitute children to be detained and taken into care, permitted the Children's \nCourt to make orders committing a child to the care of the Child Welfare Department, and gave the Child Welfare \nDepartment a general supervision over all wards detained in any institution) and the Community Welfare Act (which \nprovided that the functions of the Department of Community Welfare were to coordinate and assist and encourage \nthe provisions of social welfare services to the community).[1346]  \n\n1104 The plaintiffs pleaded that by virtue of all of these matters, the State owed fiduciary duties to Don and Sylvia in \ntheir dealings with the Children, and owed fiduciary duties to the Children in exercising the powers of a guardian, \nnot to fail to act in the best interests of the Children with respect to their custody, maintenance and education, in \nparticular by disregarding the best interests of the Children, in the benefits of an upbringing within the family unit of \ntheir natural parents and siblings.[1347]  \n\n1105 The State denied that it owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs.[1348] In so far as the factual bases for these \nfiduciary duties are concerned, the State denied that the Department of Native Welfare, or the Commissioner, acted \non behalf of the State.[1349] Further, although the State admitted that the Commissioner was the guardian of each \nof the Children at all times from their birth until they were committed to the care of the CW Department, the State \npleaded that any person could make an application to have a child declared neglected,[1350] and in Ellen's case, \nthe application for her committal was made by an officer of the CW Department.[1351]  \n\n(i) Formulation of the fiduciary duties\n\n1106 In the Amended Statement of Claim, the fiduciary duties said to arise from a relationship of trust and \nconfidence, and from the guardianship relationship between the State and the Children, were described slightly \ndifferently a duty to safeguard the interests and welfare of the Children, or a duty to act in the best interests and for \nthe proper custody, maintenance and education of the Children, or alternatively not to disregard their best interests. \nHowever, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was not intended to be any difference in the content of the \nfiduciary duties pleaded on these alternative bases.[1352]  \n\n1107 Accordingly, I have proceeded on the basis that the primary fiduciary duties the plaintiffs claim were owed by \nthe State were the duties described in par [105] of the Amended Statement of Claim, namely a duty 'not to fail to act \nin the best interests of the Children with respect to their custody, maintenance and education, in particular by \ndisregarding the best interests of the Children, in the benefits of an upbringing within the family unit of their natural \nparents and siblings'.[1353] Paragraph [105] is set out in Annexure B to these reasons.  \n\n1108 Those primary fiduciary duties were elaborated upon in par [106] of the Amended Statement of Claim. That \nparagraph of the pleading is set out in Annexure D to these reasons.  \n\n1109 In par [107] of the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs then set out further fiduciary duties which were \nsaid to have been owed by the State as fiduciary. These duties were apparently intended to be understood as more \nspecific instances of the primary fiduciary duties pleaded in more general terms in par [105] and [106] of the \nAmended Statement of Claim. Paragraph [107] of the Amended Statement of Claim is set out in Annexure D to \nthese reasons.  \n\n1110 The State denied that it was subject to the duties pleaded as a fiduciary.[1354]  \n\n\n\n(b) The State did not owe fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs arising from a fiduciary relationship between the State and \nall aboriginal people  \n\n(i) The plaintiffs' submissions\n\n1111 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the State's fiduciary duties to aboriginal people in Western Australia \nderived from its assumption of duties in the nature of fiduciary duties to aboriginal people. He submitted that on \nsettlement of the colony of Western Australia in 1829, the Crown's representatives assumed various duties and \npowers with respect to aboriginal people which gave rise to a fiduciary duty with respect to their welfare. He \nsubmitted that there was a 'gradually accumulating manifestation in legislative provisions' and in conduct and in \nproclamations which provided the underpinning for this broader assumption of a duty of protection.[1355] Counsel \nfor the plaintiffs submitted that the statutory provisions and executive conduct and action to which he pointed did not \ncreate, but rather reflected, the existence of the fiduciary duty.  \n\n1112 In support of that submission, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed, first, to the proclamation of the First Lieutenant \nGovernor, Captain James Stirling, on 18 June 1829, in which he said:  Whereas the protection of the Law doth of \nright belong to all People who come to be within the territory aforesaid, I do hereby give notice that if any person \nshall be convicted of behaving in a fraudulent cruel or felonious manner to the aboriginal race of inhabitants of this \nCountry, such person shall be prosecuted and tried for the offence as if the same had been committed against any \nother of His Majesty's Subjects.[1356]\n\n1113 Counsel for the plaintiffs also pointed to the attitude to aboriginal people which he submitted was reflected in \nlegislation concerning aboriginal people. He pointed to the debate on the Aboriginal Native Offenders Bill \n1883(WA), in the course of which he submitted that the then Premier, John Forrest, said that aboriginal people were \n'to a great extent like children', and that rather than increasing penalties under the Bill, it would be 'kinder' and 'more \nefficacious' to 'chastise them ... like one would whip a bad child'.[1357] Counsel for the plaintiff also submitted that \nSir Paul Hasluck observed that the effect of the Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1936 (WA) (which amended the \nAborigines Act 1905 (WA) and was to be read as one with that Act[1358]) was that it confined Western Australian \naboriginal people within a 'legal status that has more in common with that of a born idiot than any other class of \nBritish subject'.[1359] The import of counsel's submission was that the enactment of this legislation reflected a \nrecognition by the Parliament that aboriginal people were vulnerable and dependent on the intervention of the \nState, and that the State had assumed a duty to act on their behalf.  \n\n1114 Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that confirmation that the State had assumed duties in the nature of \nfiduciary duties to aboriginal people could be seen in the passage of legislation which imposed what he described \nas duties of a fiduciary nature on agencies of the State. He pointed to a number of examples of such legislation. \nFirst, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that colonial legislation in relation to 'aboriginal natives' was first enacted in \nWestern Australia in the 1840s, and related to restrictions on the presence of aboriginal people in towns and their \naccess to alcohol, while colonial legislation in the 1870s provided for 'protection' in employment, and for special \nprocedures for aboriginal accused persons in criminal cases.[1360] No specific references to the legislation in \nquestion were provided.  \n\n1115 Secondly, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA) which, according to its \nlong title, was 'An Act to provide for the better protection and management of the aboriginal Natives of Western \nAustralia'. The duties of the Board included the distribution of moneys granted by the Legislative Council for the \nbenefit of the Aborigines, the distribution of blankets, clothes and other relief to aboriginal people, and for the supply \nof medicines, medical attendance rations and shelter to sick, aged and infirm aboriginal people, to manage and \nregulate the use of reserves set aside for aboriginal people and 'to exercise a general supervision and care over all \nmatters affecting the interests and welfare of the Aborigines and to protect them against illtreatment, imposition and \nfraud'.[1361]  \n\n1116 Thirdly, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to s 70 of the Constitution Act 1889 (WA) which provided that five \nthousand pounds per year (and later 1% of the colony's gross revenue per year) was to be appropriated from the \nconsolidated revenue fund for the welfare of the aboriginal people, and expended in providing them with food and \nclothing, in promoting the education of aboriginal children, and in assisting generally to promote the preservation \nand wellbeing of aboriginal people.  \n\n\n\n1117 Fourthly, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to the Aborigines Act 1897 (WA) which provided for the repeal of s \n70 of the Constitution Act 1889 (WA) and established an Aborigines Department with duties to distribute relief and \nmedical care to needy aboriginal people, to manage aboriginal reserves, to provide for the education and \nmaintenance of aboriginal children, to protect aboriginal people from injustice and fraud, and to exercise a general \nsupervision over all matters affecting aboriginal people in the State.  \n\n1118 Fifthly, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to the Aborigines Act 1905 (WA) which provided that it was the duty of \nthe Aborigines Department to exercise a general supervision and care over all matters affecting the interests and \nwelfare of Aborigines, and to protect them against injustice, imposition and fraud,[1362] and which provided for the \nmaking of regulations for the control, care and education of Aborigines in institutions.[1363] The provisions of this \nAct were described as being necessary 'to provide for the full measure of protection of the natives'.[1364]Counsel \nfor the plaintiffs submitted that the Aborigines Act 1905 (WA) was a manifestation of an assumption by the State of \na fiduciary duty of promoting the welfare of aborigines, because s 4 of the Act established a department, called the \nAborigines Department, with a special duty (which he characterised as a fiduciary duty) to provide for the custody, \nmaintenance and education of the children of aboriginal people.[1365]  \n\n1119 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the nature of the duty assumed by the State in enacting the Aborigines \nAct 1905 (WA) was a duty of guardianship in respect of the children of aboriginal people, which was not delegable \nbut which could be carried out by the agents of the State.[1366] He submitted that the State had (pursuant to s 8 of \nthat Act) assigned to the Chief Protector of Aborigines the duty of acting as the legal guardian of aboriginal children, \nand that duty was, under the NW Act, assigned to the Commissioner save in respect of aboriginal children who \nwere made wards, in respect of whom the duty was assigned to the Director, in accordance with the provisions of \nthe Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1120 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the way the fiduciary duty arose in this case was as follows:  There \nwas always ... an inchoate responsibility in the State which might crystallise into trusteeship arising out of that \nlegislative history ... and it's only when the State identifies a situation where it ought to come in and exercise the \npower of a guardian that the responsibility arises. So it always had that power to be the guardian of all aboriginal \npeople in the sense that the statute appears to have given it that power. The actual choice of exercising it really \ncrystallises the nature of that relationship.[1367]\n\n1121 In summary, the plaintiffs' case was that since the colony of Western Australia was established, the State had \nassumed various duties and powers with respect to aboriginal people which were in the nature of fiduciary duties. \nThe assumption of these duties was reflected in the attitudes and actions of the executive government which \nviewed aboriginal people as in need of protection, and was manifested in various statutes containing provisions \ndirected to the protection and welfare of aboriginal people. The assumption of such duties and powers by the State \nwas said to have given rise to a fiduciary relationship because the State was able to exercise powers capable of \naffecting the legal position of aboriginal people, and because aboriginal people were in a disadvantageous or \nvulnerable position with respect to the State.  \n\n1122 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, a fiduciary relationship \nakin to the relationship of guardian and ward has been held to exist between the government of those countries and \nthe indigenous people of those countries. Counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to the decision in The Cherokee Nation v \nThe State of Georgia[1368] as representing 'the genesis of the concept of the fiduciary relationship of government \nwith indigenous peoples'.[1369]  \n\n1123 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that although the Courts in the United States, Canada and New Zealand  \ndo seem to have gone off in a somewhat different direction on fiduciary duty from the direction in which Australia is \nyet seeming to go ... certainly the genesis of the concept does come from those sources and we say at least in this \nlimited fact situation, the general duties are applicable.[1370]\n\n1124 He submitted that it was not necessary for the Court to come to a view about whether the full notion of the \nfiduciary relationship of government to indigenous peoples which has been accepted in the United States, Canada \nand New Zealand necessarily applies here in Australia, because all the Court needed to do was to conclude that  \nwhen it comes to the issue of guardianship, given the statutory history in Western Australia relating to the \nassumption of responsibility by the state for aboriginal people and aboriginal children in particular, that at least the \n\n\n\nnotion of guardianship is one which is well based in the law, even though it may be a relatively narrow part of the \nnotion of the broader fiduciary relationship.[1371]\n\n(ii) Why the plaintiffs' submissions must be rejected\n\n1125 Counsel for the plaintiffs made merely a fleeting reference to the position in the United States, Canada and \nNew Zealand. There was no reference to any authority, save for The Cherokee Nation v The State of \nGeorgia.[1372]He made no attempt to offer any explanation of how the courts in those jurisdictions had discerned \nthe existence of a fiduciary relationship, or how the cases to which he alluded (but did not identify) otherwise \nprovided support for the existence of a fiduciary relationship in this case. I have set out the totality of the oral and \nwritten submissions of counsel for the plaintiffs in relation to this aspect of the plaintiffs' case.  \n\n1126 In the end it was not entirely clear whether the fleeting references by counsel for the plaintiff to the position in \nthe United States, Canada and New Zealand amounted to anything more than a submission the Court could take \ncomfort in the fact that fiduciary relationships had been found to exist between the state, or executive government, \nof other nations and indigenous peoples.  \n\n1127 It is not the Court's role to attempt to guess what a party's case is, or to envisage the arguments which might \nhave been advanced by that party's counsel had the argument been developed. From that perspective, one \nresponse to the submission by counsel for the plaintiffs, in so far as it relies upon developments in the United \nStates, Canada and New Zealand, is to say that the submission is simply not made out. However, given the \nsignificance of this submission to the existence of the alleged fiduciary duty on the part of the State to Don and \nSylvia, I have attempted to deal more substantively with it.  \n\n1128 I have therefore proceeded on the basis that the plaintiffs' case is, first, that in the United States, Canada and \nNew Zealand it has been accepted that the state is in a fiduciary relationship with the indigenous peoples of those \ncountries, and that that fiduciary relationship relies on a characterisation of the relationship between the state (or \nthe executive government) and indigenous people, as analogous to that of guardian and ward. The next aspect of \nthis part of the plaintiffs' case appears to be that the relationship between the State and aboriginal people in \nWestern Australia since the colony of Western Australia was established has been of a similar kind, so that the \ndecisions in the United States, Canada and New Zealand provide general support for the conclusion that in this \ncase the State was in the position of a fiduciary in relation to aboriginal people in Western Australia, including the \nplaintiffs, and subject to fiduciary duties to them of the kind pleaded here.  \n\n1129 I have endeavoured to test this aspect of the plaintiffs' case by considering some of the leading cases \nidentified by counsel for the State in their helpful outline of submissions, and as a result of my own research. Given \nthe volume of case law, a comprehensive review of all of the authorities has not been practicable, nor, in the \ncircumstances, necessary. I have confined my consideration to leading cases from the United States Supreme \nCourt, from the Supreme Court of Canada, and to a leading New Zealand decision.  \n\n1130 I have reached the conclusion that this aspect of the plaintiffs' case cannot be accepted, for three reasons:  \n\n(A) the bases on which a fiduciary relationship has been found to exist in the United States, Canada and New \nZealand do not exist, or are not directly applicable in the Australian context;  \n\n(B) in so far as the developments in the United States, Canada and New Zealand have been considered in the \nAustralian courts, the principles applied in those jurisdictions have not been applied in Australia;  \n\n(C) the plaintiff has not established a basis for the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the State and \naboriginal people generally, which could found the existence of fiduciary duties to aboriginal people.  \n\n(A) The bases on which a fiduciary relationship has been found to exist in the United States, Canada and New \nZealand do not exist, or are not directly applicable in the Australian context  \n\nThe case law in the United States\n\n1131 It is something of an understatement to say that there have been numerous cases in the United States which \ndeal with the nature of the relationship between the Indian people and the federal government, and the powers and \nobligations of the latter to the former. There have been a number of cases in which the relationship between the \nfederal government and Indian people has been likened to that of a guardian and ward. But observations to that \neffect cannot be considered in isolation. When context is considered, it is apparent that to the extent that the \n\n\n\nanalogy of guardian and ward has been used, the relationship so described (that is, between the federal \ngovernment and the Indian people) has not, of itself, been the foundation for the recognition or imposition of \nfiduciary obligations of the kind asserted in this case.  \n\n1132 By way of example, some of the early cases explored the basis on which the United States entered into treaty \nobligations with Indian tribes. From 1871, Congress began to exercise legislative power with respect to the Indian \npeople. Prior to that time, however, the United States government primarily dealt with the Indian people through \ntreaties. Those treaties were entered into on the basis that Indian tribes had sufficient 'sovereignty' to enter into \ntreaties with the United States government. A number of cases explored the 'sovereignty' of the Indian tribes, and it \nis in that context that observations were made likening the relationship of the United States and Indian people as \nakin to that of guardian and ward. In The Cherokee Nation v The State of Georgia[1373], Marshall CJ observed that \nthe people of the Cherokee Nation were  in a state of pupillage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of \na ward to his guardian.\n\n They look to our government for protection; rely on its kindness and its power; appeal to it for relief to their wants; \nand address the president as their great father.[1374]\n\n1133 However, the case concerned whether the Cherokee Nation were a 'foreign state' so that a dispute between \nthe Cherokee and the United States fell within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the Constitution \nof the United States. In referring to the analogy to the relationship of guardian and ward, Marshall CJ was \ndiscussing how it was that the Indian people enjoyed limited sovereignty to enter into treaties with the United \nStates, while nevertheless being under its sovereignty.[1375]  \n\n1134 Other cases have considered Congress' power to make laws with respect to the Indian people, despite the \nsovereignty of the Indian tribes recognised in earlier cases. In this context, reference was made to the vulnerable \nand dependent position of the Indian people for the purpose of explaining the basis for federal legislative power with \nrespect to them.[1376]  \n\n1135 Further cases have dealt with the question whether the United States government is able to interfere with the \nproperty rights of the Indian people. It has been established that the United States cannot simply take land in which \nthe Indian people have title, without the payment of just compensation.[1377] Observations in those cases that such \na taking would not be an exercise of guardianship but of confiscation[1378] do not support the existence of the \nfiduciary duty said to exist in this case.  \n\n1136 In these cases the relationship between the United States and Indian peoples, was likened to the relationship \nof guardian and ward, in order to explain the source of, and some limits on, federal legislative and executive power \nwith respect to the Indian people. However, although it appears that these cases have been viewed as recognising \na relationship akin to a 'fiduciary' relationship between the United States and the Indian people, none of these cases \nactually involved the express recognition of a fiduciary duty of any kind (much less of the kind asserted in this case), \nor of a duty analogous to any of the fiduciary duties asserted in this case. Furthermore, even to the extent that \nthese cases use the analogy of guardian and ward, the basis for that description of the relationship lies in the \nparticular historical position of the Indian tribes in the United States, and cannot readily be translated to the \nAustralian landscape.  \n\n1137 In United States v Mitchell,[1379] a 'fiduciary relationship' between the United States and the Quinault Indian \npeople, in relation to the management of forests on a Quinault reserve, was expressly recognised and it was \naccepted that the breach of such a duty may be actionable in a claim against the United States for damages. \nHowever, although the relationship analogous to guardian and ward between the federal government and Indian \npeoples was relied upon to 'reinforce'[1380] the existence of this fiduciary relationship, it was not determinative of \nthe existence of this relationship. That fiduciary relationship, and the duties it gave rise to, were held to be \nestablished and defined by extensive statutory provisions which prescribed comprehensive responsibilities of the \nfederal government in managing the harvesting of Indian timber.[1381]  \n\n1138 In so far as decisions in the United States have referred to the relationship between the federal government \nand the Indian people as akin to the relationship between a guardian and ward, the different historical and legal \nposition of the American Indian tribes means that those decisions cannot readily be translated into the Australian \n\n\n\nlegal context. Even in so far as a fiduciary relationship was held to exist in Mitchell, that relationship and the duties \nto which it gave rise were referable to the extensive statutory provisions which had been enacted. That particular \nfactual context means that Mitchell does not provide direct support for the plaintiffs' case.  \n\nThe Canadian cases\n\n1139 A fiduciary duty has been held to exist between the Crown and the Indian people in Canada.  \n\n1140 In Guerin v The Queen[1382] the Canadian Supreme Court held that the Crown was subject to a fiduciary \nduty to deal with land, in which the Canadian Indians held aboriginal title, for their benefit. Dickson CJ (with whom \nBeetz, Chouinard and Lamer JJ agreed) held that this fiduciary duty had its roots in the concept of native or Indian \ntitle, but that interest in land did not give rise to the fiduciary duty. Instead, the fiduciary duty was referable to an \nassumption by the Crown of the role of an intermediary between Indian people and prospective purchasers and \nlessees of their land, so as to prevent them from being exploited.[1383] The Crown's assumption of that role could \nbe traced to a Royal Proclamation in 1763, and had more recently been manifested in the Indian Act RSC 1985 \n(Indian Act) which prohibited the transfer of Indian land to a third party without its first being surrendered to the \nCrown, after which time the Crown, pursuant to s 18 of the Indian Act, acted on behalf of the Indian people to \ndetermine whether the proposed use of the land would be for their benefit.[1384]  \n\n1141 Wilson J (with whom Ritchie and McIntyre JJ agreed) held that while s 18(1) of the Indian Act did not of itself \ncreate a fiduciary obligation in the Crown with respect to Indian reserves, it recognised the existence of such an \nobligation.[1385] Her Honour held that s 18 reflected the historic reality that the Indian people had a beneficial \ninterest in their reserves and the Crown had a responsibility to protect that interest and make sure that any purpose \nto which reserve land was put would not interfere with it. Accordingly, she held that while the Crown did not hold \nreserve land under s 18 of the Indian Act in trust for the Indian people, it held the land subject to a fiduciary \nobligation to protect and preserve the bands' interests from invasion or destruction.[1386]  \n\n1142 A broader fiduciary relationship was held to exist in R v Sparrow.[1387] That case considered the meaning \nand effect of s 35(1) of the Constitution Act 1982[1388] which provided that 'the existing aboriginal and treaty rights \nof the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognised and affirmed'. The case concerned whether a fisheries \noffence provision was invalid because it purported to limit an aboriginal right to fish for food, which was said to be a \nright recognised by s 35(1).  \n\n1143 The Court held that the decision in Guerin (amongst others) provided a general guiding principle for s 35(1) \nwhich was that  the government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to aboriginal \npeoples. The relationship between the government and aboriginals is trustlike, rather than adversarial, and \ncontemporary recognition and affirmation of aboriginal rights must be defined in light of this historic \nrelationship.[1389]\n\n1144 However, that relationship, manifested in the duty in s 35(1), had to be reconciled with the existence of federal \nlegislative power with respect to the Indian people. The Court held that the best way to achieve that reconciliation \nwas to demand the justification of any government regulation that infringed upon or denied aboriginal rights, as \nsuch scrutiny would be consistent with the concept of holding the Crown to a 'high standard of honourable dealing \nwith respect to the aboriginal peoples of Canada as suggested by Guerin v The Queen.'[1390]This test of \njustification requires an assessment of whether the infringement 'is consistent with the special fiduciary relationship \nbetween the Crown and the aboriginal peoples'.[1391]  \n\n1145 The Canadian jurisprudence does not assist the plaintiffs to make out their case that the State owes a \nfiduciary duty to aboriginal people in Western Australia, and thus the plaintiffs, for at least two reasons. First, and \nmost importantly, the existence of the fiduciary duty in Canada is referable to the Canadian historical and \nconstitutional context and to the particular statutory provisions involved (namely s 18 of the Indian Act and s 35 of \nthe Constitution Act), the content of which is not reflected in the statutory framework relied upon by the plaintiffs in \nthis case.  \n\n1146 Secondly, the fiduciary duty has been found to exist in very different contexts to that in which it is asserted in \nthis case. In Guerin the fiduciary duty was found to exist in relation to the Crown's use of property in which the \nIndian people had an interest. In Sparrow the fiduciary relationship was relied upon as the basis for limiting federal \nlegislative power by virtue of the operation of s35 of the Constitution Act. In neither case did the recognition of the \n\n\n\nfiduciary relationship, or fiduciary duty, result in the imposition of a fiduciary duty of a kind similar to the duty \nasserted in the present case.  \n\nThe New Zealand position\n\n1147 In New Zealand, the relationship between the Maori people and the Crown has been held to give rise to \nresponsibilities which are 'analogous to fiduciary duties'.[1392] In New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney \nGeneral,[1393] the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered the question whether the StateOwned Enterprises Act \n1986 permitted the Crown to transfer land (which was subject to land claims brought by Maori tribes) to State \nenterprises established under the Act. (That transfer would mean that that land could not be returned to the Maoris \nif a recommendation was made to do so to resolve their land claim.) Section 9 of the StateOwned Enterprises Act \n1986 provided that nothing in that Act permitted the Crown to act in a manner that was inconsistent with the \nprinciples of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Court granted a declaration that the transfer of assets, without any \nconsideration of whether such transfer would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Treaty, would be unlawful.  \n\n1148 Cooke P held that the Treaty signified 'a partnership between races' and that 'the relationship between the \nTreaty partners creates responsibilities analogous to fiduciary duties. ... [T]he duty of the Crown is not merely \npassive but extends to the active protection of Maori people in the use of their lands and waters to the fullest extent \npracticable'.[1394] Accordingly he held that s 9 of the StateOwned Enterprises Act required that the Crown,  as a \npartner acting towards the Maori partner, [should act] with the utmost good faith which is the characteristic \nobligation of partnership, to ensure that the powers in the StateOwned Enterprises Actare not used inconsistently \nwith the principles of the Treaty.[1395]\n\n1149 The other members of the Court each expressed similar views.[1396]  \n\n1150 For present purposes, it suffices to note that the relationship between the Crown and the Maori people which \ngave rise to duties analogous to fiduciary duties derived from the Treaty of Waitangi. Secondly, the nature of the \nrelationship found to exist was analogous to a partnership. Thirdly, the State was subject to the duty because of the \nobligation on the Crown in s 9 of the StateOwned Enterprises Act. These legal and factual differences mean that \nthe approach taken in New Zealand does not assist the plaintiffs to establish the fiduciary duties they assert in this \ncase.  \n\n1151 In Fejo v Northern Territory Kirby J cautioned about the use of authorities from other jurisdictions  because of \nthe peculiarities which exist in each of them arising out of historical and constitutional developments, the \norganisation of the indigenous people concerned and applicable geographical and social considerations.[1397]\n\n1152 The same observations are apt here. Further, quite apart from the factual and statutory features of those \ncases which distinguish them from the present case, the law in relation to fiduciary duties in Australia has \ndeveloped differently from the law on fiduciary duties in the United States and Canada.[1398] Courts in those \njurisdictions have adopted a more expansive approach to the when fiduciary duties will arise, and have been \nprepared to find fiduciary duties exist in contexts where such duties have not been found to exist in Australia such \nas in cases which do not involve economic interests.[1399] Accordingly,  a degree of caution must be observed in \nrelying upon Canadian and United States authorities concerning the expansion of per se fiduciary relationships or \nfactual circumstances in other relationships that are said to combine to impose fiduciary obligations.[1400]\n\n1153 The differences to which I have referred mean that the authorities from the United States, Canada and New \nZealand do not assist the plaintiffs in this case.  \n\n(B) Consideration by the High Court of the United States and Canadian authorities  \n\n1154 The approach taken to the imposition of fiduciary duties by the State to indigenous peoples in the United \nStates and Canada (in particular) has not attracted the support of a majority of the High Court.[1401] Such \nconsideration as there has been of a fiduciary relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples has mostly \noccurred within the native title context, in dealing with questions concerning interests in land.  \n\n1155 In Mabo v Queensland (No 2) the plaintiffs sought a declaration that the State of Queensland was under a \nfiduciary duty to the Meriam people, including the plaintiffs, to recognise and protect their rights and interests in the \nMurray Islands. They argued that such a duty arose by reason of annexation, the relative positions of power of the \nMeriam people and the Crown in right of Queensland with respect to their interests in the Islands, and the course of \ndealings by the Crown with the Meriam people and the Islands since annexation.[1402] Toohey J found a fiduciary \n\n\n\nrelationship existed, Dawson J found that no such relationship existed, and the remaining members of the Court \neither did not deal with the issue at all or did not decide it.  \n\n1156 Toohey J held that if the Crown in right of Queensland had the power to alienate land the subject of the \nMeriam people's traditional rights and interests, and the result of that alienation was the loss of their traditional title, \nand if the Meriam people's power to deal with their title was restricted in so far as it was inalienable, except to the \nCrown, then the Crown's power and the corresponding vulnerability of the Meriam people gave rise to a fiduciary \nobligation on the part of the Crown. His Honour found that the fiduciary relationship arose 'out of the power of the \nCrown to extinguish traditional title by alienating the land or otherwise'.[1403]  \n\n1157 Dawson J also considered the question of fiduciary duties. However, his Honour concluded that because \naboriginal title did not survive the annexation of the Murray Islands, there was no room for the application of any \nfiduciary or trust obligation, drawing on the approach in Guerin, or of a broader nature. That was because a \nfiduciary obligation of that kind was dependent upon the existence of an aboriginal interest existing in or over the \nland.[1404]  \n\n1158 Brennan J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) acknowledged the possibility that if native title were \nsurrendered to the Crown in expectation of a grant of tenure to the indigenous title holders, the Crown may be \nsubject to a fiduciary duty to exercise its discretionary power to grant a tenure to satisfy that \nexpectation.[1405]However, his Honour concluded that it was unnecessary to consider the existence or extent of \nsuch a fiduciary duty in that case.  \n\n1159 Deane and Gaudron JJ did not discuss the fiduciary duty, although they noted that actual or threatened \ninterference with the enjoyment of native title could in appropriate circumstances attract the protection of equitable \nremedies.[1406]  \n\n1160 In Wik Peoples v State of Queensland Brennan CJ rejected a claim that a fiduciary duty could be owed by the \nCrown to the holders of native title in the exercise of a statutory power to alienate land, whereby their native title in \nor over that land was liable to be extinguished without their consent and contrary to their interests.[1407] In that \ncase the fiduciary duty was said to arise by virtue of the vulnerability of native title, the Crown's power to extinguish \nit, and the position occupied for many years by the indigenous inhabitants vis a vis the Government of the State. \nBrennan CJ held that these factors did not, by themselves, create a freestanding fiduciary duty. He noted that the \nexercise of statutory powers (in that case, to alienate land) 'characteristically affects the rights or interests of \nindividuals for better or worse' and in that case, it was 'impossible to suppose that the repository of the power shall \nso act that the beneficiary might expect that the power will be exercised in his or her interests', because 'the \nimposition on the repository of a fiduciary duty to individuals who will be adversely affected by the exercise of the \npower would preclude its exercise'.[1408]  \n\n1161 For completeness, I note that broader claims to the existence of a fiduciary duty owed by the executive \ngovernment (of either the Commonwealth or a State) to aboriginal parties, drawing on the jurisprudence in other \njurisdictions, have been struck out.[1409]  \n\n1162 Accordingly, the case law from the United States, Canada and New Zealand, to which I have referred, does \nnot assist to support the conclusion that the State is subject to a fiduciary duty or duties, of the kind asserted in the \npresent case, to aboriginal people in Western Australia, including the plaintiffs.  \n\n(iii) The plaintiff has not established a basis for a fiduciary duty by the State to aboriginal people generally\n\n1163 In Australia, fiduciary duties are identified as a result of a twostage test. The first is to identify whether the \nnature of the relationship between two parties is one characterised by a duty, and corresponding expectation, of \nloyalty from one party (the fiduciary) towards the other (the beneficiary). Once a relationship of that kind is \nidentified, the second stage of the enquiry is to ascertain which duties \u2013 of all of those duties which may be owed by \nthe fiduciary to the beneficiary as incidents of their relationship \u2013 are integral to preserving the loyalty on which the \nrelationship is based. Those duties are fiduciary duties. The breach of those duties will be amenable to equitable \nremedies.  \n\n1164 In Australia, fiduciary obligations have been held to exist in the context of certain relationships, including as \nbetween partners, principal and agent, director and company, employer and employee, solicitor and client, and \nguardian and ward (to which I will return in a moment).[1410] The relationship between a state and its indigenous \n\n\n\npeople is not one of those well recognised categories of relationship in which fiduciary obligations have been held to \nexist. However, the categories of relationships within which fiduciary obligations will be held to exist are not \nclosed.[1411]  \n\nIndicia of a fiduciary relationship: Australian position\n\n1165 Outside these wellestablished categories of relationship determining whether fiduciary obligations arise will \ndepend on the application of the principles identified in the case law as indicative of the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship. The law on fiduciary duties in Australia is not yet settled so that there is no precise or comprehensive \nset of circumstances or criteria by reference to which fiduciary obligations will be imposed.[1412]  \n\n1166 The circumstances which may point towards a fiduciary relationship include: the existence of a relationship of \nconfidence, inequality of bargaining power, the scope for one party to unilaterally exercise a discretion or power \nwhich may affect the rights or interests of another, and a dependence or vulnerability on the part of one party that \ncauses that party to rely on another.[1413] None of these circumstances or criteria is individually determinative of \nthe existence of a fiduciary duty.[1414]  \n\n1167 However, a critical feature which must be present is that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on \nbehalf of another person, in the interests of that other person, in the exercise of a power or discretion which will \naffect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense, and to the exclusion of the fiduciary's own \ninterest.[1415] Professor Finn (as he then was) described the circumstances of the relationship between the parties \nas being such that one is entitled to expect that the other will act in his interests in and for the purposes of the \nrelationship. The fiduciary's role in this relationship 'must so implicate that party in the other's affairs or so align him \nwith the protection or advance of that other's interests that foundation exists for the 'fiduciary expectation'.'[1416]  \n\n1168 This was confirmed in the decision of the Full Federal Court in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2).[1417]  \n\n1169 As Beech J pointed out in Red Hill Iron Ltd v API Management Pty Ltd[1418] the indicia of a fiduciary \nrelationship which have been identified in the cases focus both on the alleged fiduciary and on the position of the \nalleged beneficiary. In the former case the question is:  Whether the alleged fiduciary has, in an objective sense, \nagreed or undertaken to act in the interests of another in the exercise of a power. The question identified in News \nLtd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd focuses on the position of the other party. It asks whether that party is \nentitled, in an objective sense, to expect that the other will act in his or her interest in and for the purposes of the \nrelationship. Such an entitlement will arise from an understanding.\n\nThe facts relied upon by the plaintiffs do not establish a fiduciary relationship between the State and aboriginal \npeople in Western Australia\n\n1170 The submission that the State itself as opposed to a particular office holder or agency within the State is in a \nfiduciary relationship with all aboriginal people in the State, and apparently in a general sense (instead of within any \nparticular context) is a novel one. However, given that the categories of fiduciary relationship are not closed, and \ngiven that a fiduciary relationship between the Crown and indigenous people has been held to exist in some \ncircumstances in other jurisdictions, the possibility of such a relationship cannot be excluded.  \n\n1171 The matters on which the plaintiffs relied did not support the conclusion that the State undertook, or agreed, to \nact for or on behalf of aboriginal people in Western Australia, and in their interests, in the exercise of a particular \npower or discretion which would affect their interests in a legal or practical sense, and to the exclusion of the State's \nother interests, so as to support the conclusion that give rise to a fiduciary relationship exists between the State and \naboriginal people. I have reached that conclusion for five reasons.  \n\n1172 First, I do not accept that the colonial legislative provisions to which counsel for the plaintiff referred, amount \nto evidence of an undertaking or agreement by the colonial government, and subsequently the State, to act on \nbehalf of the aboriginal people, in their interests, in the exercise of particular powers or discretions. Although \ncounsel for the plaintiffs referred to colonial legislation in relation to 'Aboriginal natives' in the 1840s and 1870s, he \ndid not identify the legislation, or specific provisions within it. I do not give any weight to this vague and general \nsubmission.  \n\n1173 Secondly, I do not accept that the matters which the plaintiffs submitted constituted evidence of attitudes of \nthe executive government to aboriginal people at the time of settlement and throughout the 1800s support the \n\n\n\nconclusion that the State undertook the responsibility for acting on behalf of aboriginal people, and in their interests, \nin the exercise of particular powers or discretions, and to the exclusion of the State's other interests. Even if \nmembers of the colonial government considered that aboriginal people did not have the same legal capacity or legal \nstatus as members of the white population or required special protection, that is not sufficient to establish that the \nState undertook to act on behalf of aboriginal people, and in their interests, to the exclusion of the State's own \ninterests.  \n\n1174 Thirdly, in so far as the plaintiffs relied upon the enactment of particular legislation which made provision for \nthe welfare of aboriginal people, the terms of the legislation do not support the conclusion that the State undertook \nto act on behalf of the aboriginal people, in their interests, to the exclusion of its own interests. The creation of \nBoards or Departments with responsibility to distribute welfare to the aboriginal people, and to exercise supervision \nand care over matters affecting their interests is not, in my view, sufficient to establish that the State had assumed a \nresponsibility of that kind. Nor did the allocation of funds from consolidated revenue for expenditure on the welfare \nof the aboriginal people evidence the assumption by the State of such a responsibility.  \n\n1175 The enactment of the legislation to which counsel for the plaintiffs referred certainly reflected a recognition by \nthe Parliament that aboriginal people were in need of welfare, and that they may be vulnerable to exploitation. \nHowever, the steps taken by government to provide for the welfare and protection of aboriginal people whether \nthrough the allocation of funds from consolidated revenue, or by the provision of services offered by government \ndepartments or boards are of the same nature as steps which are commonly undertaken by governments to provide \nfor disadvantaged members of their communities and do not support the conclusion that the State assumed an \nobligation to act in the interests of aboriginal people to the exclusion of its own interests.  \n\n1176 One of the features of the legislation to which the plaintiffs referred was that various officers were said to be \nthe legal guardian of aboriginal children in Western Australia. Like the numerous other restrictions on the rights of \naboriginal people as to where they lived, and who they might reside with, or marry \u2013 the underlying assumption of \nthose provisions was that aboriginal people did not have the same legal capacity to make decisions about their own \nwellbeing. But that does not support the conclusion that the State undertook to act on behalf of all aboriginal \npeople, and in their best interests, to the exclusion of the State's interests.  \n\n1177 Fourthly, the plaintiffs' contention that the State was under a general fiduciary duty to act in the best interests \nof aboriginal people failed to grapple with the implications of the assumption of such a general and undefined duty \nby a State in a pluralist society where different vulnerable groups need access to the same pool of resources \nfinancial and otherwise which the State may be able to make available. Equity requires that a fiduciary should not \nput himself or herself in a position where selfinterest and duty conflict or, if a conflict is unavoidable, the fiduciary \nshould resolve that conflict in favour of his or her duty.[1419] The position of an executive government, however, is \nquintessentially concerned with balancing competing interests. Within that context, a conflict between various \ninterests which the State may seek to protect is inevitable. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' contention failed to grapple \nwith the additional potential problem that a fiduciary duty on the part of the State to act in the best interests of \naboriginal people generally may result in a conflict between the State's duty to one aboriginal person and its duty to \nanother aboriginal person. I have dealt with this issue further at [1478] below.  \n\n1178 Fifthly, a submission almost identical to the plaintiffs' submission in this case appears to have been advanced \n(by the same counsel), and rejected by the Court, in Bodney v Westralia Corporation Pty Ltd,[1420] for reasons \nwhich are, in my view, plainly correct. That decision also supports the conclusion that the plaintiffs' submission must \nfail.  \n\n1179 Sixthly, in so far as the Children are concerned, I am not persuaded that equity would intervene to impose \nfiduciary duties on the State in relation to the Children, on the basis of the existence of a fiduciary relationship \nbetween the State and all aboriginal people. Ordinarily equity will not intervene to impose fiduciary obligations if the \nlaw adequately protects the interests to which the fiduciary obligations would apply. In the present case, under the \nNW Act, the Commissioner was the legal guardian of the Children. Once they became wards pursuant to the Child \nWelfare Act, the care, management and control of the Children was vested in the Director, who was the guardian of \nthe Children. In each case, the legislation gave the Commissioner and the Director respectively, powers and \ndiscretions to deal with the care of the Children. The fiduciary duties said to have been owed by the State to \naboriginal people in the present case would overlap to a very considerable extent with the statutory powers and \n\n\n\nduties of those officers under the legislation. In those circumstances, I am not persuaded that equity would \nintervene to impose fiduciary duties in addition to the statutory duties to which those officers were already subject.  \n\nConclusion in relation to the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the State and aboriginal people generally\n\n1180 The plaintiffs have not made out their case for the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the State and \nall aboriginal people in Western Australia, so as to found the existence of a fiduciary duty on the part of the State to \nact in the best interests of aboriginal people, and thus of the plaintiffs. In so far as the plaintiff's case with respect to \nDon and Sylvia rests on the existence of this fiduciary relationship, that part of the plaintiffs' case must fail.  \n\n(c) Whether the State occupied the position of a guardian with respect to the Children  \n\n1181 I turn, then, to the alternative basis for the fiduciary duty or duties which the plaintiffs claim the State owes to \nthem, namely the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the State and the plaintiffs by virtue of the Children's \nwardships. The plaintiffs' case is that the State itself owed fiduciary duties to the Children. This is not a case where, \nfor example, it is alleged that the State knowingly participated in a breach by the Director of the Director's fiduciary \nduty.[1421] Instead, the fiduciary duties were said to be owed directly by the State itself to the Children.  \n\n1182 In so far as a fiduciary relationship is said to have existed between the State on the one hand, and Don and \nSylvia on the other hand, by virtue of the Children's wardships, this was said to be a secondary consequence of the \nState's fiduciary relationship with the Children.  \n\n1183 The relationship of guardian and ward falls within the established categories of fiduciary \nrelationships.[1422]The fact that a guardianship relationship arises by virtue of statute poses no obstacle to that \nconclusion.[1423] If the State was the guardian for each of the Children under the Child Welfare Act, that would \nsupport the plaintiffs' case that the State was in a fiduciary relationship with the Children. However, the plaintiffs' \ncontention that the State was in a fiduciary relationship with them, by virtue of the Children's wardships, must fail \nbecause the State itself was not the guardian of the Children under the Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1184 As I have already noted, when Ellen was made a ward, and later when the Siblings made wards, the Child \nWelfare Act provided that the Director had the 'care, management and control of the persons and property of all \nwards'.[1424] Whether or not the Director's responsibilities, power and authority encompassed all of the \nresponsibilities, power and authority of a guardian need not be determined. It suffices to say that the Director's \npower was sufficiently analogous to that of a guardian as to place the Director in the same position as a guardian \nwith respect to each of the children.[1425] In any event, by 1962 the Child Welfare Act had been amended to make \nclear that the Director was the guardian of all wards.  \n\n1185 That conclusion also derives support from the fact that the NW Act was amended in 1954 to provide that the \nCommissioner for Native Welfare was the guardian of an aboriginal child, except when that child became a ward \nunder the Child Welfare Act. Clearly the Parliament contemplated that the role of guardian would, upon an \naboriginal child being made a ward under the Child Welfare Act, fall to the Director under that Act.  \n\n1186 The plaintiffs' case is that the State was the guardian of the Children, and that the Director simply acted as the \nState's agent in carrying out the role of guardian. I am unable to accept that argument.  \n\n1187 The Child Welfare Act gave responsibility to the Director, personally, for making decisions concerning the \ncare, management and control of the persons and property wards, although clearly it would have been open to the \nDirector to perform that duty through other officers within the Department.[1426] The Director was not simply an \nemployee of the State working in the Child Welfare Department and carrying out the administrative functions of the \nDepartment. Furthermore, it is not difficult to envisage the rationale for making one officer the guardian of all wards. \nThe office of Director was a specific office established under the Child Welfare Act, and appointed by the Governor. \nThe impact of decisions made by a guardian on the lives of the wards concerned warranted the allocation of \nresponsibility to a particular officer charged with that responsibility.  \n\n1188 Had it been the Parliament's intention that the State itself be the guardian of all wards, there would have been \nno need to vest the powers of care, management and control of wards in a particular office. Rather, any employee \nof the State within the Child Welfare Department could have carried out such tasks as were necessary to perform \nthe role of a guardian in relation to a ward as and when the need arose.  \n\n\n\n1189 There are two possible counterarguments to the conclusion I have reached. The first is that under the Child \nWelfare Act, the Director was subject to the direction of the Minister in dealing with the care, management and \ncontrol of wards. That might be thought to indicate that the State (through the Minister) retained ultimate control \nover wards, and thus that the State occupied the role of guardian, which it exercised through the Director. Had that \nbeen the intention, however, it is difficult to see why it was necessary for the Parliament to expressly give power to \nthe Director personally. The better explanation may be that historically the Minister had particular powers under the \nChild Welfare Act in relation to certain matters affecting wards. Making clear that the Director was subject to the \nMinister's direction removed any doubt about the Director's obligation to act in accordance with those directions.  \n\n1190 The second counter argument is that under the Child Welfare Act, the Child Welfare Department retained a \ngeneral supervision over all wards detained in an institution or placed out. That might be viewed as consistent with \nthe role of the State as guardian. However, such a power would not seem to have been necessary if the State had \nbeen the guardian of all wards, because the State (acting through its officers and agents) would necessarily have \nbeen responsible for supervising wards. However, because the Director personally stood in the position of the \nguardian of all wards, then in order to ensure that employees in the Child Welfare Department (in addition to the \nDirector) had authority to exercise a supervisory role in relation to wards in institutions, or who were placed out, it \nwas necessary for the Child Welfare Act to make that clear.  \n\n1191 The fact that the Director occupied the position of guardian of the Children under the Child Welfare Act from \n1962, and stood in a position at least analogous thereto from the date when each of the Children was made a ward, \nmeans that the Director (and not the State) was in a fiduciary relationship with the Children once they were made \nwards.  \n\n(d) Whether the Children's wardships gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between the State and Don and Sylvia  \n\n1192 As I have noted, the plaintiffs' case was that the State stood in a fiduciary relationship to Don and Sylvia and \nthis was said to be a secondary consequence of the State's fiduciary relationship with the Children. This argument \nalso fails because the State was not in a fiduciary relationship with the Children.  \n\n1193 However, quite apart from that difficulty, counsel for the plaintiffs did not point to any authority for the novel \nproposition that a fiduciary relationship between two parties may arise solely as a consequence of the fiduciary \nrelationship that the fiduciary has with another party.  \n\n1194 Furthermore, applying the ordinary principles concerning fiduciary relationships, as outlined above, I am \nunable to see how it could be said that either the State, or the Director, stood in the position of a fiduciary with \nrespect to Don and Sylvia, by virtue of the fact that their children were made wards. I do not see any basis for \nconcluding that upon becoming the guardian of a child pursuant to the Child Welfare Act, the Director undertook to \nact on behalf of the parents of that child, and in their interests, in the exercise of the Director's powers or discretions \nas a guardian of the child. The Director had no powers or discretions with respect to the parents of a child who was \na ward. The decision to make a child a ward was vested in the Children's Court under the Child Welfare Act. The \nDirector's powers under the Child Welfare Act pertained solely to the care, management and control of a child, and \nnot to other persons.  \n\n1195 Furthermore, if the Director stood in a fiduciary relationship not only to a child who was a ward, but to that \nchild's parents, it seems likely that there would arise a conflict between the Director's fiduciary obligations. The best \ninterests of a child who is a ward may not coincide with the best interests of that child's parents. In my view, equity \nwould not intervene to recognise a fiduciary relationship between a guardian, and the parents of a ward, in those \ncircumstances.  \n\n(e) Whether the primary fiduciary duties said to be owed to the plaintiffs are fiduciary duties  \n\n1196 Even if I am wrong in concluding that there was no fiduciary relationship between the State and the plaintiffs, \nin my view, the plaintiffs' claim in relation to the primary fiduciary duties must fail for five additional reasons:  \n\n(i) fiduciary relationships usually serve to protect economic interests, but no economic interests are involved in this \ncase;  \n\n\n\n(ii) the primary fiduciary duties the plaintiffs claim were owed by the State are not in the nature of fiduciary duties \ncustomarily imposed by equity;  \n\n(iii) similar claims based on the existence of fiduciary duties within a guardianship context have been dismissed in \nother cases; and  \n\n(iv) the plaintiffs' interests were adequately protected by existing legal remedies, and there is no need for equity to \nintervene to provide additional remedies;  \n\n(v) recognition of a fiduciary duty owed by the State to Don and Sylvia would be very likely to give rise to a conflict \nbetween that duty, and the fiduciary duties said to be owed to each of the Children.  \n\nI will consider the position with respect to the secondary fiduciary duties below.  \n\n(i) Fiduciary relationships usually serve to protect economic interests, but no economic interests are involved in this \ncase\n\n1197 In Australia, fiduciary obligations have traditionally been imposed to protect economic and proprietary \ninterests.[1427] The usual fiduciary duties which will be imposed are concerned with preserving those interests, \nnamely by ensuring a fiduciary does not make an unauthorised profit or take an unauthorised commercial \nadvantage vis a vis a beneficiary.[1428]  \n\n1198 In this case, the primary fiduciary duties the plaintiffs claim were owed by the State were not directed to \nprotecting the economic interests of the plaintiffs. The fact that economic interests are not involved suggests that \nthe duties claimed by the plaintiffs should not be characterised as fiduciary duties.  \n\n1199 Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged this difficulty. However, he submitted that if an economic right or \ninterest is required to found the imposition of a fiduciary obligation, then that right existed in the plaintiffs' 'chose in \naction giving rise to the right to take legal action'.[1429] In other words, the plaintiffs' economic right or interests lay \nin their entitlement to bring legal action against the State for its breach of fiduciary duty or its failure to provide them \nwith legal advice about its possible breach of that duty. I do not accept that argument. It was circular. The alleged \nduty to obtain legal advice or representation for the plaintiffs (which I consider below) was said to be a continuing \nduty on the State, which arose out of (and necessarily was dependent upon the existence of) the primary fiduciary \nduties which the plaintiffs contended were owed by the State.  \n\n(ii) The primary fiduciary duties the plaintiffs claim were owed by the State are not in the nature of the fiduciary \nduties ordinarily imposed by equity\n\n1200 The existence of a fiduciary relationship does not mean that a fiduciary duty will attach to every aspect of the \nfiduciary's conduct.[1430] Accordingly, even if I am wrong in my conclusion that no fiduciary relationship existed or \nexists between the State and the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs' claims in relation to the primary fiduciary duties should fail. \nThose alleged duties should not be characterised as fiduciary duties, for three reasons:  \n\n(A) The primary duty of a fiduciary is loyalty, and the alleged fiduciary duties do not serve to ensure the loyalty of \nthe State, as a fiduciary, to the plaintiffs as beneficiaries;  \n\n(B) Ordinarily, equity will impose proscriptive and not prescriptive duties on a fiduciary, whereas the alleged \nfiduciary duties in this case are prescriptive in nature;  \n\n(C) A duty to exercise care and skill in carrying out a fiduciary's powers is not a fiduciary duty.  \n\n(A) The duties alleged do not facilitate loyalty of the State as a fiduciary  \n\n1201 The fiduciary obligations owed by a fiduciary will depend upon all of the circumstances of the case, and the \nduty will be moulded according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the case. Accordingly, the \nobligations or duties owed by a fiduciary will vary with the nature, and foundation for, the relationship from which the \nfiduciary obligations are derived.[1431] By way of example, although a fiduciary relationship may coexist with other \nrelationships, such as a contractual relationship, in the latter case the fiduciary relationship must accommodate \nitself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them.[1432] In some cases, a \ncontractual term may be so precise in its regulation of what a party may do that there is no scope for the creation of \na fiduciary duty.[1433] Similarly, if a fiduciary relationship is founded on a relationship established by statute, the \n\n\n\nobligations of a fiduciary must accommodate themselves to the terms of the statute.[1434] A fiduciary obligation \ncould not modify the operation or effect of statute. (A contrary conclusion would give equity supremacy over the \nsovereignty of the Parliament.[1435])  \n\n1202 Generally speaking, however, the key obligation that equity demands of a fiduciary is loyalty.[1436] That \nrequirement for loyalty, applied in circumstances where the economic interests of a beneficiary require protection, \nwill ordinarily manifest itself in two fiduciary duties: a duty not to obtain an unauthorised benefit from the \nrelationship, and a duty not to be in a position of conflict between the fiduciary's duty (namely the functions or \nresponsibilities the fiduciary has undertaken to perform for or on behalf of the beneficiary)[1437] and the fiduciary's \npersonal interest.[1438] These fiduciary duties are thus concerned to maintain the fiduciary's loyalty, by avoiding \nthe misuse of the fiduciary position, and by avoiding conflicts of duty and interest, or conflicts of duty and duty, \nwhich arise by virtue of the fiduciary's position.[1439]  \n\n1203 The primary fiduciary duties which the plaintiffs claim were owed to them by the State were, with one \nexception, entirely different from duties of this kind they were not concerned with obtaining an unauthorised benefit, \nand they were not concerned with a conflict between the State's interests and the interests of the plaintiffs. There is \nscope for argument about the extent to which the primary fiduciary duties alleged could be said to facilitate the \nloyalty demanded of a fiduciary, so that the duties might properly be described as fiduciary duties, particularly when \nthe Director's guardianship of the Children was regulated by the Child Welfare Act 1945.  \n\n1204 The one exception is the alleged duty of the State (in par [107.9] of the Amended Statement of Claim) not to \nput itself into a position of conflict between its interest in housing the Children in a facility or home readily available \nto the State, and the Children's interest in being provided with a home environment within the family unit of their \nnatural family or within the aboriginal community (or its duty to act in the Children's best interests by providing them \nwith a home environment of that kind).[1440] However, even in respect of this alleged duty, other factors militate \nagainst the conclusion that the asserted duty constitutes a fiduciary duty.  \n\n(B) The alleged duties are, with one exception, prescriptive rather than proscriptive in nature  \n\n1205 The present state of the law in Australia is that prescriptive fiduciary duties will not ordinarily be imposed on a \nfiduciary, particularly a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of the beneficiary.[1441] As Gummow J observed in \nBreen v Williams.[1442]  it would be to stand established principle on its head to reason that because equity \nconsiders the defendant to be a fiduciary, therefore the defendant has a legal obligation to act in the interests of the \nplaintiff so that failure to fulfil that positive obligation represents a breach of fiduciary duty'.\n\n1206 The proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy has been observed in many cases, including State of South Australia \nv LampardTrevorrow.[1443]  \n\n1207 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there have been occasions on which duties expressed in positive \nterms have been characterised as fiduciary duties. He relied on Farah Constructions v SayDee Pty Ltd,[1444] in \nsupport of this proposition. In that case, the High Court held that Farah had a duty to disclose to SayDee \ninformation (which Farah had acquired in its capacity as a fiduciary) about the attitude of a Council to a proposed \nland development. However, as the Court made clear the duty on Farah to make that disclosure was the practical \nmanifestation of its fiduciary duty to avoid a conflict between its own selfinterest and its duty to SayDee.[1445]There \nwas no discussion of the proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy.  \n\n1208 Counsel for the plaintiffs also referred to Kennon v Spry in which Gummow and Hayne JJ[1446] (with whom \nFrench CJ agreed[1447]) referred to a 'fiduciary duty' on the part of a trustee to consider whether and in what way \nthe trustee should exercise the power conferred under a trust document. However, the reference to that duty as a \n'fiduciary duty' was a passing one, and was not accompanied by any discussion which expressly suggested any \ndeparture from the proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy.  \n\n1209 More recently, the decision in Westpac Banking Corporation v Bell Group Ltd (in liq) (No 3)[1448] cast some \ndoubt on the strict application of the dichotomy. The Court of Appeal held that the duties of a company director to \nact bona fide in the interests of the company, and to exercise the director's powers for proper purposes, were \nfiduciary duties. However, that conclusion need not be seen as inconsistent with the proscriptive / prescriptive \ndichotomy if it is borne in mind that at first instance Owen J had reached the conclusion that the same duties were \nfiduciary duties, but on the basis that they could be understood as constituting proscriptive obligations, as a duty not \n\n\n\nto exercise the director's powers in the interests of a party other than the company or in a way that was not in the \nbest interests of the company.[1449]  \n\n1210 In my view, despite some question marks about the application of the principle, the position in Australia \nremains that ordinarily, fiduciary duties will prohibit rather than prescribe conduct.  \n\n1211 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy could be avoided simply by \ndrafting prescriptive duties in a negative form, as had been done in the Amended Statement of Claim in this case. \nHowever, if the proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy remains the law, as I think it does, then the approach \nadvocated by counsel for the plaintiff would ultimately represent the triumph of form over substance, an approach \nentirely antithetical to equity.[1450] Moreover, the submission is not supported by the authority on which counsel \nrelied.  \n\n1212 In support of his submission, counsel for the plaintiffs relied on Friend v Brooker.[1451] In that case, a duty \ninitially formulated as a prescriptive fiduciary duty was, by the time the matter was heard in the High Court, \nexpressed as a proscriptive duty by expressing it in a negative form. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the \nHigh Court did not comment adversely on the formulation of the duty.[1452] The decision in Friend does not \nsuggest any departure from the well established principle that fiduciary duties are limited to proscriptive obligations. \nIn Friend the duty said to have been owed by Mr Brooker and Mr Friend to each other was described as 'a fiduciary \nobligation to be equally and personally liable to each other for losses flowing from personal borrowings'.[1453] In \nthe course of outlining the argument which had been advanced, the plurality observed that the appellant had \ncorrectly emphasised that the prescriptive formulation of the fiduciary duty 'went beyond the imposition of \nproscriptive obligations, a limitation emphasised in decisions of this Court'.[1454] The plurality (with whom Heydon J \nagreed on this point[1455]) did not need to deal with the fact that the alleged duty was expressed in prescriptive \nterms, because they concluded that the undisturbed findings of the trial judge precluded any argument that the \nparties were in a partnership or engaged in dealings in the nature of a joint venture, so that no question of a \nfiduciary obligation arose. The parties had instead deliberately chosen to utilise a company as the vehicle for their \nbusiness enterprise, and it was not appropriate for equity to intervene to outflank the consequences of that \nchoice.[1456]  \n\n1213 In my view, the decision in Friend v Brooker provides no support for the plaintiffs' contention, and supports the \nconclusion that the proscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy remains the law in Australia.  \n\n1214 At first blush, observations by Owen J in Bell also appear to support the plaintiff's submission. As I have \nalready observed, Owen J concluded that the duties said to have been owed in that case, which were expressed in \nprescriptive terms to act in the best interests of the company, and to exercise the director's powers only for proper \npurposes were properly to be understood as proscriptive in nature. That is, the asserted duties did not prescribe \nwhat a director must do, but rather indicated what a director could not do.[1457] In reaching that conclusion, \nhowever, his Honour did not simply take the view that any duty could be recast in negative terms and thus avoid the \nproscriptive / prescriptive dichotomy. Rather, his Honour looked to the substance of the asserted duties.[1458]  \n\n1215 I turn to the duties alleged in this case. The primary fiduciary duties are initially expressed in general terms as \na duty not to fail to act in the best interests of the Children with respect to their custody, maintenance and \neducation, in particular by disregarding the best interests of the Children in the benefits of an upbringing within the \nfamily unit of their natural parents and siblings. This general duty is then broken down into a series of more \nparticular duties, all of which are expressed, or expressed in the alternative, in proscriptive terms.  \n\n1216 However, when the substance of the primary fiduciary duties alleged is considered, it is clear that with one \nexception they constitute positive duties to act for example, to provide accommodation and support to the \nplaintiffs,[1459] to ascertain whether members of the Children's family, or members of the extended aboriginal \ncommunity, could look after the Children,[1460] and to remove the Children from any foster home which carried a \nrisk of harm to them.[1461] The duties alleged thus do not set out the parameters of what the State, as a fiduciary \nwas obliged not to do. Moreover, the duties alleged were not directed to ensuring that the State as a fiduciary did \nnot act in a way inconsistent with the loyalty expected of a fiduciary.  \n\n1217 The one exception pertains to the alleged duty on the State not to put itself into a conflict between its interest \n(which was said to be to house the Children in a facility or home which was readily or conveniently available to the \n\n\n\nState) and the Children's interest in being provided with a home environment within their natural family, or within the \nbroader aboriginal community. That is a duty which, in substance, is proscriptive in that it clearly indicated that the \nState was obliged not to act in its own interest, in order to avoid any departure from the loyalty which would be \nexpected of the State as a fiduciary.  \n\n(C) A duty to exercise care and skill in carrying out a fiduciary's powers is not a fiduciary duty  \n\n1218 In some contexts (such as company directors and trustees) a person acting as a fiduciary may be under a \nduty to exercise care and skill in carrying out his or her powers. However, the law in Australia is that a duty to \nexercise care and skill will not be characterised as a fiduciary duty. In the case of company directors, the Full Court \nof this State in Permanent Building Society (in liq) v Wheeler held that although a director is under a duty to \nexercise care, skill and diligence, that duty (although an equitable, as well as a legal, duty) is not a fiduciary \nduty.[1462] The observations in that case drew on the same principle established in relation to trustees.[1463]  \n\n1219 The principle has been cited with approval in many cases.[1464] However, questions have also been raised \nabout the basis for, or limits of, the principle.[1465] In Bell, Lee AJA doubted the proposition that the duty of a \ncompany director to exercise care and diligence was not a fiduciary duty,[1466] but it was not necessary to resolve \nthat issue.[1467] Carr AJA did not share that doubt,[1468] while Drummond AJA did not deal with the point. A \nnumber of commentators have also questioned the principle established in Wheeler.[1469]  \n\n1220 I am of the view that I am bound to apply the principle in Wheeler in this case, for three reasons. First, as a \nmatter of principle, there does not appear to be any reason why the proposition stated in Wheeler should be \nconfined solely to directors and trustees, rather than to any person in the position of a fiduciary. Secondly, counsel \nfor the plaintiffs did not cite any Australian appellate court authority in support of the proposition that the principle in \nWheeler should be confined only to directors and trustees. Thirdly, counsel for the plaintiffs did not identify any \nAustralian authority since Wheeler was decided in which a general duty of care imposed on a fiduciary has been \ncharacterised as a fiduciary duty. Accordingly, in so far as the principle in Wheeler can be said to be one of general \napplication to all fiduciaries, then the principle established in Wheeler remains binding on a single judge of this \nCourt.  \n\n1221 Turning to the present case, the striking characteristic of almost all of the primary fiduciary duties whether \nthose expressed in general terms, or those expressed with greater particularity is that they are in the nature of \nduties to exercise care in particular aspects of the State's exercise of power in relation to the plaintiffs. That would \nsuggest that the duties asserted should not be characterised as fiduciary duties. In addition, as I have already \nobserved, the nature of the duties said to be owed is not such as to further the loyalty expected of the State as a \nfiduciary. That is an additional reason why the duties alleged should not be characterised as fiduciary duties.  \n\n(iii) Similar claims of fiduciary duties within a guardianship context have been dismissed in other cases\n\n1222 Having regard to the general principles discussed above, the fact that a guardian and ward are in a fiduciary \nrelationship does not mean that everything done by the guardian is the subject of a fiduciary duty.[1470] As Blow J \npointed out in Tusyn v Tasmania, a distinction needs to be drawn 'between moral duties, nonfiduciary duties \nimposed by law, and fiduciary duties'.[1471]  \n\n1223 There have been a number of cases in other jurisdictions in which plaintiffs have contended that guardians \nowe duties, amounting to duties to exercise care, and that those duties are fiduciary duties. In each case, the \nplaintiffs' claims have been dismissed, either at an interlocutory stage, or following trial, on the basis that the duties \nalleged are not fiduciary duties.  \n\n1224 In Paramasivam v Flynn the plaintiff brought an application for an extension of time to commence an action \nagainst his guardian for breach of a fiduciary duty, alleged to have occurred as a result of the sexual assault of the \nplaintiff by the guardian. The Court accepted that refraining from inflicting personal injury upon one's child was no \ndoubt a fundamental aspect of the obligation of a parent and guardian, and one that should be protected by law. \nHowever, the Court did not accept that that obligation should be given the label of a fiduciary obligation, or that \nequitable intervention was necessary, appropriate or justified by any principled development of equity's \ndoctrines.[1472] Accordingly, the Court concluded that the plaintiff's claim was 'most unlikely to be upheld by \nAustralian courts'[1473] and consequently dismissed the application for an extension of time.  \n\n\n\n1225 In Williams v Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983[1474] the plaintiff, who had been a ward of the \nAborigines Welfare Board of New South Wales for virtually her entire childhood, brought an action against the \nBoard alleging, amongst other things, negligence and a breach of fiduciary duty by the Board, arising out of the \nconduct of the Board in placing the plaintiff at various missions and children's homes during her childhood. \nAmongst other things, the plaintiff claimed that she had been denied the opportunity to form a close bond with any \ncaring adult, suffered from maternal deprivation, and had been denied the opportunity to have contact with her \nfamily or with members of the aboriginal community. Abadee J held that the defendant did not owe a common law \nduty of care to the plaintiff, and there had been no breach of duty established. In addition, while he assumed that \nthe relationship of guardian and ward gave rise to a fiduciary relationship, he held that no breach of any fiduciary \nduty had been established. His Honour observed that there had been  no allegation in terms of good faith, \nomission, nor is there any loyalty question or issue of conflict between duty and interest arising. Additionally, ... \nthere are no economic interests at stake. In such circumstances, I ... do not see why a fiduciary duty should be \nfound to convert an unsustainable claim at common law, based on the same facts, into a sustainable one in \nequity.[1475]\n\n1226 In Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia the plaintiffs were two aboriginal people who had been removed from \ntheir families as children pursuant to welfare legislation. The Directors of Native Affairs and Welfare were the legal \nguardians of the plaintiffs under legislation. The plaintiffs brought proceedings against the Commonwealth for false \nimprisonment, breach of statutory duty, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs alleged that the \nCommonwealth was subject to a fiduciary duty to supervise any institution or person into whose care they were \nplaced, and to a fiduciary duty to advise them to obtain independent legal advice, and that the Commonwealth had \nknowingly participated in the Directors' breaches of their fiduciary duties. At first instance, the actions were \ndismissed.[1476]  \n\n1227 An appeal against that decision was dismissed. The Full Federal Court held that even if there was a fiduciary \nrelationship between the Commonwealth and the plaintiffs, their case that the Commonwealth owed fiduciary duties \nfaced 'two insurmountable obstacles'.[1477] First, the primary judge was not satisfied that Mrs Cubillo's removal \nwas not authorised by legislation, the consequence of which was that no fiduciary duty could forbid what legislation \npermitted. In the case of Mr Gunner, the primary judge found that Mr Gunner's removal was at the request and with \nthe consent of his mother, and that the Director had not participated in his removal. Consequently, there could be \nno breach of fiduciary duty by the Director.[1478] Secondly, the plaintiffs' claims of breach of fiduciary duty were \ncoextensive with their claims in tort, and there was no scope for equity to superimpose fiduciary duties on common \nlaw duties.[1479]  \n\n1228 In Tusyn v Tasmania[1480] Blow J struck out that part of the plaintiff's claim based on alleged breaches of \nfiduciary duties, by virtue of alleged incidents of sexual abuse of the plaintiff by his guardian, on the basis that the \nclaim could not succeed, having regard to the state of the law in Australia.  \n\n1229 In Webber v New South Wales Dunford J concluded that a parent or guardian does not act on behalf of, or \nexercise a power or discretion affecting the interests of, a child or ward in a legal or practical sense, except when he \nor she deals with assets or property on behalf of the child or ward.[1481] His Honour held that when failing to \nprovide proper care, nurture or supervision of the child or ward, the parent or guardian was not exercising a power \nor discretion affecting the interests of the child or ward, and accordingly no fiduciary obligation attached to that \naspect of the responsibilities of the parent or guardian.[1482] The duty of the guardian was a duty of care in tort, not \na fiduciary duty, and his Honour therefore struck out so much of the plaintiff's claim as involved allegations of the \nbreach of fiduciary duties.  \n\n1230 In SB v New South Wales, Redlich J dismissed that part of the plaintiff's claim which was based on an alleged \nbreach of fiduciary duty by the State of New South Wales, as a result of the conduct of the Minister for Child \nWelfare (who was the plaintiff's statutory guardian) and the relevant government department. The plaintiff's case \nwas that the defendant failed to take reasonable or proper care of her as a ward. His Honour held that it was not \npossible to characterise any of the conduct of the defendant as falling within the purview of the doctrines of equity:  \nthe defendant has not put itself in a position of either accruing a benefit from or being in conflict with the plaintiff. \nIntentional, negligent and/or wrongful conduct may be appropriately compensated by common law principles. It \n\n\n\nfollows that in this case, the claim for equitable compensation as a consequence of a breach of fiduciary duty must \nfail.[1483]\n\n1231 Finally, in State of South Australia v LampardTrevorrow, Mr Trevorrow sued the State of South Australia for \nmisfeasance in public office, false imprisonment, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, said to have occurred \nwhen he was placed into foster care by the Aborigines Protection Board (APB). The trial judge appears to have \nfound that the State owed fiduciary duties to Mr Trevorrow to act in his best interests and in good faith, to protect \nand assert his economic and proprietary rights and interests, and not to place itself in a position of conflict with, or \nstand to benefit at the expense of, the plaintiff's economic and proprietary rights and interests.[1484] However, he \nwent on to summarise the fiduciary duty owed in far narrower terms, as a duty on the State to ensure Mr Trevorrow \nwas provided with full information in relation to his removal, and to provide him with independent legal advice.[1485]  \n\n1232 The Full Court of South Australia upheld an appeal against the trial judge's decision.[1486] The Court \naccepted that by assuming the power to remove Mr Trevorrow from his family, and thus to act as his guardian in \nplace of his parents, the APB might, in particular circumstances, be subject to a fiduciary duty to Mr \nTrevorrow.[1487] However, the Court held that that did not mean that wideranging fiduciary duties would be \nimposed on the APB. The Court held that the imposition of such duties would involve the imposition of prescriptive, \nrather than proscriptive duties, which were not founded in a situation or relationship which would usually attract a \nfiduciary duty, and which would be inconsistent with the legislation pursuant to which the APB operated.[1488] In \naddition, the Court held that if the APB had acted wrongly in removing Mr Trevorrow from his parents and placing \nhim into care, that wrong did not involve a failure to observe a fiduciary relationship of loyalty, and that that wrong \ncould be resolved by consideration of the tort of misfeasance in public office or negligence. In those circumstances, \nequity would not intervene to impose a fiduciary duty.[1489]  \n\n1233 No doubt the result in each of these cases depended in large part upon the particular legal and factual \ncontext. Nevertheless the consistent rejection of the characterisation of a guardian's duty of care as fiduciary duties \nalso supports the conclusion that the plaintiffs' contentions of fiduciary duties of care in this case should not be \nupheld.  \n\n(iv) The plaintiffs' interests were adequately protected by existing legal remedies, and there is no need for equity to \nintervene to provide additional remedies\n\n1234 Most of the primary fiduciary duties which the plaintiffs say the State owed to them such as the duty to not to \nplace the Children in foster placements which carried a risk of harm,[1490] or the duty not to fail to take reasonable \nsteps to protect the physical and mental health of the Children[1491] are duties which would arguably have been \nactionable at common law. It appears that the plaintiffs seek to advance those duties as fiduciary duties because \nany cause of action they may have for an action in tort is now timebarred as a result of the Limitation Act 1935 \n(WA).  \n\n1235 It is well established that it is not appropriate for the courts to superimpose an equitable classification on facts, \nsimply because to do so would afford better or larger remedies to a plaintiff who appears to have suffered some \nwrong.[1492] The cases to which I have referred illustrate that the courts will not extend equity's intervention for this \nreason, and have concluded that the wide ranging duties said to be owed by guardians (even within a context of a \nfiduciary relationship) are not properly characterised as fiduciary duties.[1493]  \n\n1236 In the present case, it is not appropriate to characterise the primary fiduciary duties said to be owed by the \nState as fiduciary duties, in order that the plaintiffs might have some recourse for the wrongs which they claim were \ndone to them. The plaintiffs' claim that the alleged duties were fiduciary duties also fails for this reason.  \n\n(v) Recognition of a fiduciary duty owed by the State to Don and Sylvia would be very likely to give rise to a conflict \nbetween that duty, and the fiduciary duties said to be owed to each of the Children\n\n1237 In so far as the plaintiffs claim that the State owed a general primary fiduciary duty to Don and Sylvia, that \nduty is described in general terms as a fiduciary duty  to Don and Sylvia in their dealings with the Children ... in \nexercising the powers of a guardian not to fail to act in the best interests of the Children ... by disregarding the best \n\n\n\ninterests of the Children, in the benefits of an upbringing within the family unit of their natural parents and \nsiblings.[1494]\n\n1238 Most of the particularised primary fiduciary duties are expressed as duties owed directly to the Children. \nHowever, two of them appear to pertain equally to Don and Sylvia, and to the Children.  \n\n1239 First, the plaintiffs plead that  the Defendant was obliged not to fail to promote the interests of the plaintiffs in \nthe preservation and wellbeing of the family unit of the plaintiffs including the provision of accommodation and \nsupport to assist in the preservation of the family unit, alternatively not to disregard the importance to the interests \nof the plaintiffs of the preservation and wellbeing of the family unit of the plaintiffs.[1495]\n\n1240 Secondly, the plaintiffs plead that  the Defendant was obliged not to fail to take adequate steps to facilitate \ncontact between the Children and the Children's parents, Don and Sylvia, alternatively not to fail to facilitate contact \nbetween the Children and Don and Sylvia.[1496]\n\n1241 It is not at all difficult to envisage that a conflict could have arisen between meeting these duties to Don and \nSylvia, on the one hand, and to the Children on the other hand, or between meeting these duties to Don and Sylvia, \nand meeting the range of other primary fiduciary duties the State is said to have owed to the Children. For example, \nif Don and Sylvia were unable to provide care for the Children sufficient to sustain the Children's physical health \nand wellbeing, then the State's duty to act in the best interests of the Children by ensuring their physical health and \nwellbeing (for example, by placing the children in care where those needs could be met) may have conflicted with \nthe State's duty to Don and Sylvia in maintaining their family unit.  \n\n1242 As I have already observed, fundamental to the fiduciary relationship is the loyalty owed by the fiduciary to the \nbeneficiary. That loyalty ordinarily results in the imposition of a fiduciary duty to avoid a conflict between the \nfiduciary's duty to the beneficiary, and the fiduciary's selfinterest or any other duty. The imposition of fiduciary duties \non the State of the kind asserted in this case would be to accept an inherent potential conflict in the State's duty to \nDon and Sylvia, and to the Children, which the State could not avoid. That prospect strongly militates against the \nconclusion that the State owed the primary fiduciary duties to Don and Sylvia, as well as to the Children.  \n\nConclusion in relation to the imposition of the primary fiduciary duties\n\n1243 For these reasons, in my view, the State was not in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, but even if it \nwas, the primary fiduciary duties alleged by the plaintiffs were not, in my view, fiduciary duties at all. The plaintiffs' \nclaim must fail for this reason.  \n\n5. DID THE STATE BREACH ALLEGED FIDUCIARY DUTIES OWED TO THE PLAINTIFFS?  \n\n(a) The standard  \n\n1244 In view of my conclusion that the State was not in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs and that the duties \nasserted by the plaintiffs did not constitute fiduciary duties, it is not necessary to go on and consider whether (had I \nreached a contrary view) the plaintiffs would have established their case of a breach or breaches of those fiduciary \nduties. However, such a large volume of the evidence at the trial, and of the submissions of counsel, were devoted \nto this question, that it is, I think, incumbent on me to make findings as to whether any breach of duty would have \nbeen established.  \n\n1245 However, I have to admit to some considerable reservations about embarking on this course. As I explain \nbelow, those reservations are attributable to the fact that the plaintiffs' case involves such a significant departure \nfrom the established principles in relation to fiduciary duties that there are no guiding principles as to how a breach \nof duty should be assessed in a case of this kind.  \n\n1246 As I have noted above, the defining feature of fiduciary relationships is the undivided loyalty the fiduciary owes \nto the beneficiary. Ordinarily, that obligation of loyalty is reflected in two fiduciary duties: a duty not to use the \nfiduciary's position to his own or a third party's possible advantage, and a duty to avoid any conflict between the \nfiduciary's personal interest, and his or her duty to the beneficiary, unless the beneficiary gives informed consent to \nthe fiduciary's conduct, or that conduct is authorised by law.  \n\n1247 These duties are expressed in proscriptive and absolute terms, and they are capable of being, and generally \nspeaking are,[1497] applied strictly. Consequently, establishing a breach of fiduciary duty does not require proof of \nfraud, or of an absence of good faith on the part of the fiduciary.[1498] The purposes of the strict application of the \n\n\n\nduties include ensuring that fiduciaries generally conduct themselves 'at a level higher than that trodden by the \ncrowd'.[1499] The strictness with which these fiduciary duties are applied may sometimes have results which \nappear to be unfair, such as that an errant fiduciary will be required to account for profits which the beneficiary \ncould never have obtained.[1500]  \n\n1248 Given the prescriptive nature, and ambiguous content, of the fiduciary duties alleged in this case, most of \nthose duties are simply not capable of being applied in the same way as traditional fiduciary duties. That \nconsideration gives rise to two issues. The first concerns whether the State should be held to the same strict \nstandard as would apply in the application of orthodox fiduciary duties, or whether a different standard should be \napplied in determining whether the State has breached the alleged primary fiduciary duties, and if so, what that \nstandard should be. The second concerns whether the acts or omissions of the State should be assessed by \nreference to contemporary attitudes to the care of children, and to standards of living in 2013, or by references to \nattitudes and standards in the late 1950s and the 1960s.  \n\n1249 In this section of my reasons, I deal with the following issues:  \n\n(i) possible rationales for the application of a different standard in relation to the performance of the fiduciary duties \nin this case;  \n\n(ii) the parties' submissions as to the standard which should be applied;  \n\n(iii) three points of reference for an alternative standard in relation to the performance of the fiduciary duties in this \ncase;  \n\n(iv) are community standards in the 1950s and 1960s, or contemporary community standards, relevant?  \n\n(v) what standard should be applied in assessing whether there has been a breach of the fiduciary duties in this \ncase?  \n\n(i) Possible rationales for the application of a different standard in relation to the performance of the fiduciary duties \nin this case\n\n1250 Four considerations suggest that in assessing a breach of the fiduciary duties in this case, the standard \napplied should accommodate scope for the fiduciary to make a judgment as to what would be in the child's best \ninterests having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.  \n\n1251 First, the content of many of the alleged fiduciary duties is highly nebulous. By way of example, in par [107.6] \nof the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs plead that the State was obliged 'not to fail to take adequate steps \nto facilitate contact' between the Children and Don and Sylvia, and at par [108.6] they plead that the State 'failed to \ntake any or any adequate steps to facilitate contact' between the Children and Don and Sylvia. No particular kind, \nor frequency, of contact was specified by the plaintiffs. The pleading assumes that unrestricted contact between a \nparent and a ward is necessarily in the ward's best interests. But it is not difficult to envisage cases (and the present \nis not one of them) where any contact between a ward and his or her parents would not be in the ward's best \ninterests. Clearly what is in the child's best interests, in relation to the frequency of contact with a parent, and the \ncircumstances in which that contact will be permitted, will be a conclusion which must be reached having regard to \nall of the circumstances of the case.  \n\n1252 Secondly, the specific duties in [106] and [107] of the Amended Statement of Claim are, in effect, conclusions \nas to what was in the best interests of the Children in the circumstances of this case. By way of example, the \nfiduciary duties owed by the State are said to encompass a duty 'not to disregard the best interests of the Children \nin the benefits of an upbringing within the family unit of their natural parents and siblings'. The expression of the \nduty in that manner carries with it the assumption that it is always in a child's best interests to be raised within the \nfamily unit of their natural parents and siblings. Expressed in such absolute terms, the flaw in that contention is \napparent. To use an extreme example (which is not drawn from this case) it could not be said that if a child was \nbeing physically abused by a parent to such an extent as to place the child's life in danger that it would be in the \nchild's best interests to be raised within the family unit comprising that parent.  \n\n1253 Thirdly, whether there has been a breach of the primary fiduciary duty 'not to fail to act in the best interests of \nthe Children with respect to their custody, maintenance and education'[1501] or 'not to fail to promote the interests \nof the plaintiffs in the preservation and wellbeing of the family unit of the plaintiffs'[1502] or 'not to fail to take \n\n\n\nadequate steps to facilitate contact between the Children and the Children's parents',[1503] for example, will be \nquestions over which reasonable minds may differ. The fact that there are very diverse parenting styles in our \nsociety illustrates that this is so.  \n\n1254 Fourthly, the nature of the fiduciary should be taken into account. The Director under the Child Welfare \nActwas the guardian of all wards in the State during the period of the Children's wardships. Addressing the best \ninterests of one ward cannot be done in isolation when the same person is responsible for addressing the best \ninterests of all wards. This is particularly so having regard to the finite resources available to meet all of those \ninterests.  \n\n1255 These considerations suggest that in assessing a breach of the fiduciary duties in this case, the test applied \nshould accommodate scope for the fiduciary to make a judgment as to what would be in the child's best interests \nhaving regard to all of the circumstances of the case.  \n\n(ii) The parties' submissions as to the standard which should be applied\n\n1256 In the course of the hearing, I invited submissions from counsel for the parties about the standard by which \nthe conduct of the State in relation to the alleged breaches of the fiduciary duties in this case should be assessed. \nCounsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the State's position as a guardian with respect to the Children should be \ntreated as analogous to the position of a parent with respect to his or her child. Accordingly, he submitted that the \nCourt would 'not permit that to be done with a child which a wise, affectionate and careful parent wouldn't do'.[1504] \nHe also submitted that in the present context that approach would be applied as a test of what a 'reasonable person \nacting as a guardian in a fiduciary relationship' would do.[1505] In support of that proposition, counsel relied upon \nauthorities in relation to the fiduciary duties of trustees and company directors,[1506] and submitted that 'while the \nrequirement imposed on a trustee is strict, it is neither absolute nor a counsel of perfection. Rather it is an objective \nstandard which recognises the importance of the position'.[1507]  \n\n1257 Later, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the plaintiffs' case was that the test to be applied was what he \ndescribed as an 'objectively reasonable standard'.[1508] However, he then explained what he meant in the \nfollowing way:  ... when I say 'objectively reasonable' we're effectively applying the Wednesbury test of \nreasonableness, so that's the test by which we suggested ... your Honour can judge the conduct, and it's of course \nto be judged in the circumstances at the time.[1509]\n\n1258 I understood counsel's reference to the Wednesbury test of reasonableness as drawing on the statement by \nLord Greene MR in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp[1510] where his Lordship, in \ndiscussing judicial review of a discretionary decision, said that 'if a decision on a competent matter is so \nunreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it, then the courts can interfere.' \nTheWednesbury standard is quite different from the standard of what a reasonable person in the same \ncircumstances would have done.  \n\n1259 Ultimately, however, the position adopted by counsel for the plaintiffs was that whichever of these tests was \napplied, the same outcome would be reached in this case.[1511] Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that if there \nwas a tension between meeting a child's physical needs on the one hand, and his or her emotional needs on the \nother hand, a weighing process would need to be carried out to determine what a reasonable person acting as a \nguardian would do.[1512] However, he submitted that in this case, there was no evidence that a weighing exercise \nwas carried out.[1513] It appears that this is why counsel submitted that the same result would be reached, \nwhichever test were applied.  \n\n1260 Counsel for the State submitted that that the test which should be applied to the conduct of a guardian said to \nhave breached a fiduciary duty was a subjective test, but with a 'reasonableness' qualification. That is, he submitted \nthat the test is whether the guardian acted in what the guardian considered to be the best interests of the child, \nsubject to a qualification that even had the guardian done so, if his or her conduct was so unreasonable that no \nreasonable guardian would have acted in that way, that would constitute a breach of the guardian's fiduciary \nduty.[1514]  \n\n1261 Counsel submitted that this test should be adopted for three reasons. First, counsel for the State submitted \nthat the imposition of a solely objective test what a reasonable guardian in the same position would have done \n\n\n\nwould impose an impossible task on a guardian because in many situations the question 'what is in the best \ninterests of a child' will be one over which reasonable minds will differ. Accordingly, he submitted, an objective test \nwould give rise to too much uncertainty over a guardian's potential liability for a breach of fiduciary duty. He \nsubmitted that that would be particularly so in the child welfare context where alternative choices of conduct open to \na guardian may each carry with them the potential for adverse consequences for a ward.[1515]  \n\n1262 Secondly, counsel for the State submitted that a number of the specific fiduciary duties to which the State was \nsaid to subject in this case were expressed in absolute terms, and it would impose an unreasonable obligation on a \nguardian to impose duties of that kind by reference to an objective standard.[1516]  \n\n1263 Thirdly, counsel for the State sought to draw some support from the approach developed by the courts in \nrelation to the duties of company directors, particularly in relation to the exercise by a director of his or her powers \nfor an improper purpose.[1517] He submitted that in the present factual context, the motivating purpose of the \nguardian should be the determining factor in assessing an alleged breach of the guardian's fiduciary duty.[1518]  \n\n(iii) Three points of reference for an alternative standard in relation to the performance of the fiduciary duties in this \ncase\n\n1264 If a different standard were to be applied to a fiduciary in the position of a guardian performing a fiduciary duty \nto act in the best interests of a ward, the question is what should that standard be. There appear to be three points \nof reference which could inform the answer to that question. First, the Director (and the employees and agents of \nthe State involved in making decisions in relation to the Children in this case) exercised powers under the Child \nWelfare Act. As a fiduciary duty imposed within a statutory framework must conform to that statutory framework, the \nmanner in which those statutory powers were required to be exercised must be taken into account. Secondly, some \nof the fiduciary duties owed by company directors are expressed in terms which are not dissimilar to the primary \nfiduciary duties said to have been owed by the State in this case. Consideration of the standard to which company \ndirectors are held in the performance of these duties may also assist in discerning the standard in the present \ncontext. Thirdly, the primary fiduciary duties are in many respects closely analogous to the duty of care owed by a \nguardian to a ward. Reference to the standard of that duty of care may also assist in discerning the standard \napplicable in this case. I deal with each of these in turn.  \n\n(A) The statutory framework for the conduct of the Director or officers or agents of the State in this case  \n\n1265 As I have already explained, the fiduciary duty in this case is not said to derive from the Child Welfare Act. \nThe duty, as I have observed, is said to derive from the relationship between the State and aboriginal people \nhistorically, or from the relationship of guardian and child which existed once each of the Children was made a ward \nunder the Child Welfare Act. However, the powers exercised by the Director, or officers or agents of the State in \nrelation to the Children during the wardships derived from the Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1266 Some of the acts or omissions said to give rise to breaches of the primary fiduciary duties were acts or \nomissions of the Commissioner or officers of the Department of Native Welfare. To the extent that acts or omissions \nof those officers prior to the commencement of the wardships were relied upon, the source of the power of the \nofficers may have derived from the NW Act. After the wardships commenced, decisions made and action taken with \nrespect to the Children relied on the powers of the Child Welfare Act. For the reasons which follow, it does not \nmake any practical difference to the outcome of this case whether the acts or omissions of the Commissioner or \nofficers of the Department of Native Welfare relied upon the powers they had under the NW Act, or powers granted \nunder the Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1267 Whether or not the fiduciary duty existed by virtue of the existence of a relationship of guardian and ward, or \nby virtue of the State's relationship with aboriginal people, the content of the fiduciary duty in this case must \nconform with the requirements of the Child Welfare Act because a fiduciary obligation cannot modify the terms of a \nstatute.[1519]  \n\n1268 Accordingly, the starting point in assessing the alleged conduct said to be in breach of the fiduciary duties in \nthis case is that that conduct was governed by the provisions of the Child Welfare Act. I outlined the powers given \nto the officers of the Child Welfare Department and the Director under the Child Welfare Act at [172] to [173]. It is \nunnecessary to repeat that discussion here, save to recall three matters. First, one of the objectives of the Act was \nto make provision for the care of destitute and neglected children. Secondly, the Director had the 'care, \n\n\n\nmanagement and control of the persons and property of all wards', and from 1962, the Director was also described \nas the guardian of all wards, although the Department retained a general supervision over all wards detained in an \ninstitution or placed out. Amongst other things, the Director had power to place a ward in a range of institutions or \naccommodation, for such period as the Director thought fit, and wards could be transferred from one institution to \nanother. Thirdly, the only specific, prescriptive requirement imposed on the Director under theChild Welfare Act, \nwhich is of present relevance, was that the Director was required to cause all wards placed out to be visited once \nevery six months by an officer of the Department, to ensure that their treatment, education and care was \nsatisfactory.  \n\n1269 Apart from the latter requirement to visit all wards every six months, the other powers of the Director to which \nI have already referred conferred a very wide discretion on the Director or officers of the CW Department. None of \nthose powers was expressly conditioned on the formation of an opinion by the Director that the exercise of power \nwas necessary or desirable in the best interests of the ward in question.[1520] However, having said that, the \nprovisions of the Child Welfare Act which conferred powers on the Director should be construed in a manner which \nis consistent with the objects of the Child Welfare Act as a whole,[1521] save in so far as the words in the \nprovisions themselves suggest a clear contrary meaning.[1522] The objects of the Child Welfare Act can be \ndiscerned from its long title, which provided that it was an Act  to consolidate and amend the law relating to the \nmaking of better provision for the protection, control, maintenance and reformation of neglected and destitute \nchildren.\n\n1270 In my view, the powers of the Director under the Child Welfare Act should be understood as intended to \nenable the Director to protect, control, maintain or reform wards.  \n\n1271 For completeness, the same point can be made in relation to the powers of the Commissioner under the NW \nAct, which I outlined above at [129] to [137]. The long title to the NW Act referred to its objective of providing for the \nwelfare of the 'native inhabitants of Western Australia'. Under the NW Act (between 1958 and 1963) the Department \nof Native Welfare was charged with the duty of promoting the welfare of the natives, and generally assisting in the \npreservation and wellbeing of the natives'[1523] and its duties included providing for the custody, maintenance and \neducation of the children of natives.[1524] The Commissioner was responsible for the execution of the Act, and \nofficers could be appointed with such powers and functions as were considered necessary or convenient for \neffectually carrying out the provisions of the Act. The Commissioner was also the legal guardian of every native \nchild (other than children who were wards under the Child Welfare Act).[1525] The Commissioner's power to \nexecute the Act appears to have imported a very wide measure of discretion, both because the Commissioner's \npower to execute the Act was not expressly limited by reference to particular criteria, and because the duties of the \nDepartment were expressed in very general terms.  \n\n1272 In so far as the Child Welfare Act and the NW Act conferred discretionary powers on the Director, or officers \nof the Child Welfare Department, or on other authorised persons, the Parliament is taken to have intended that \nthose powers would be exercised reasonably.[1526] There have been many cases in which the courts have \nendeavoured to explain this standard of 'reasonableness', most recently discussed by members of the High Court in \nMinister for Immigration & Citizenship v Li.[1527] Starting with an identification of the subject matter, scope and \npurpose or object of the statute,[1528] a range of considerations may inform a conclusion that the exercise of \ndiscretion was unreasonable in the relevant sense. These include cases where no specific error in reasoning can \nbe identified, but nevertheless the decision can be said to be irrational, and thus so unreasonable that no \nreasonable person could have arrived at it,[1529] or that the decision was one which 'no sensible authority acting \nwith due appreciation of its responsibilities'[1530] would have made, or that the decision 'lacks an evident and \nintelligible justification'.[1531] In other cases, a specific error of reasoning may permit, or contribute to, a conclusion \nthat the decision was unreasonable in the relevant sense, such as where the decision maker failed to give adequate \nweight to a relevant factor of great importance, or gave excessive weight to an irrelevant factor of no \nimportance.[1532]  \n\n1273 What is clear, however, is that judging reasonableness in this context does not simply involve what might be \ndescribed as a 'reasonable person' test \u2013 namely what a reasonable person in the position of the decision maker \nwould have done \u2013 nor does it involve the court substituting its own view of how a discretion should have been \nexercised for that of the decision maker. The reasonableness standard which is implied in the context of \n\n\n\ndiscretionary powers respects the fact that the Parliament has conferred a discretion on the decision maker. \nAccordingly:  review by a court of the reasonableness of a decision made by another repository of power 'is \nconcerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making \nprocess' but also with 'whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are \ndefensible in respect of the facts and law.[1533]\n\n1274 These cases are, of course, concerned with assessing the lawfulness of a decision within a judicial review \ncontext. Nevertheless, their starting point is to discern the bounds within which the Parliament intended a statutory \npower should be exercised. For that reason, the analysis is of some assistance. If one were to be guided by a \nsimilar approach here, it can be said that the Parliament intended that the Director, or of officer or agents, of the \nState should act in a way that that officer considered necessary or desirable to protect, maintain, control or reform a \nward, or was for the welfare of the ward, subject to the qualification that the Parliament could not have intended to \nauthorise conduct which was so unreasonable that no reasonable person in that officer's position would have \nengaged in it (having regard to community standards at the time). Conduct within those boundaries could not \nconstitute a breach of the duties the plaintiffs submit were owed to them.  \n\n(B) The standard applied to the fiduciary duty of company directors  \n\n1275 An additional point of reference for identifying the test or standard which should be applied to fiduciary duties \nof the kind asserted in this case are the expectations of company directors in relation to the performance of their \nfiduciary duties. Some of the fiduciary duties owed by company directors are expressed in terms which are not \ndissimilar to the primary fiduciary duties said to have been owed by the State in this case.  \n\n1276 A director's duty of loyalty to the company manifests itself in a number of fiduciary duties including the duty to \nact in good faith in the interests of the company, and the duty to act for proper corporate purposes.[1534] The duty \nto act in good faith in the interests of the company requires that a director act 'bona fide in what they consider \u2013 not \nwhat the court may consider is in the interests of the company'.[1535] The test involves a factual enquiry that \nfocuses on the state of mind of the directors. Although the test is a largely subjective one, it is not entirely so. In \norder to ascertain the state of mind of the directors, the court may look at the surrounding circumstances and other \nmaterials which throw light on the directors' state of mind so as to show whether they were honestly acting in \ndischarge of their powers in the interests of the company.[1536] The purpose of looking objectively at these \nsurrounding circumstances is not to decide whether the court considers the decision to have been in the best \ninterests of the company, but to determine whether the court should accept or discount the assertions made by the \ndirectors about their subjective beliefs.[1537] And if, on that inquiry, the conduct is plainly unreasonable or irrational, \nor fails to have any regard to obligations the company must meet, a breach of duty may be found.[1538]  \n\n1277 In contrast, the duty of a director not to exercise his or her powers for an improper purpose involves an \nobjective test.[1539] It involves ascertaining the purposes for which the power may or may not be exercised (having \nregard, for example, to the company's memorandum and articles of association), and determining whether the \npurpose for which the power was exercised was within the scope of those permissible purposes.[1540] Although \nstatements by directors about their subjective beliefs will be relevant to the enquiry, the subjective belief of a \ndirector that the conduct was carried out for a proper purpose does not prevent a finding of a breach of duty.[1541]  \n\n1278 Finally, company directors are subject to a duty to exercise care and diligence. That duty is not regarded as a \nfiduciary duty. However, in Westpac Banking Corporation v Bell Group (in liq) Lee AJA expressed doubt about the \naccuracy of the statement that a director's duty to exercise care and diligence is not a fiduciary duty.[1542] If that \nduty were to be regarded as a fiduciary duty, then the test for a breach of that duty may also be relevant in the \npresent context. Lee AJA noted that  the duty imposed on a director (by equity) to exercise care and diligence in the \nmanagement of a corporation, the standard of care applied is reasonable care. That is not 'all possible care' but the \ncare expected of an ordinary person exercising an ordinary degree of prudence in respect of his own affairs. \nLiability of a director for a breach of that duty only arises when the director commits 'gross or culpable negligence'. \nPut another way, it is conduct by a director that is so plainly imprudent and unreasonable in the circumstances that \nit is conduct not to be expected of any reasonable person exercising an ordinary degree of prudence in his or her \naffairs.[1543]\n\n1279 The duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, and the duty to exercise care and diligence, \nare not dissimilar in nature from the fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the plaintiffs which are said to \n\n\n\narise in this case. That similarity supports the conclusion that a similar test or standard should be applied in respect \nof the conduct said to give rise to a breach of the primary fiduciary duties in this case, namely a subjective belief on \nthe part of the guardian, subject to an overriding unreasonableness qualification, or alternatively a test whether the \nconduct is so plainly unreasonable in the circumstances that it is conduct not to be expected of any reasonable \nperson exercising an ordinary degree of prudence.  \n\n(C) The duty to exercise reasonable care at common law  \n\n1280 A final point of reference in identifying the standard by reference to which the conduct of the officers and \nagents of the State should be assessed draws on the fact that the primary fiduciary duties are in many respects \nclosely analogous to the duty of care owed by a guardian to a ward.[1544] A guardian is required to exercise \nreasonable care in carrying out his or her powers of guardianship[1545] assessed by reference to what a \nreasonable person in the same position would have done.  \n\n1281 On one view, it would be somewhat surprising if, in the performance of a fiduciary duty, a guardian were held \nto a less stringent standard than would be expected of the guardian in the exercise of a common law duty of care.  \n\n(iv) Are community standards in the 1950s and 1960s, or contemporary community standards, relevant?\n\n1282 It is well accepted that within the judicial review context the Parliament is taken to have intended that the \nreasonableness of the exercise of statutory discretions should be assessed by reference to community standards at \nthe time of the exercise of the discretion. Consequently, a step taken in the purported exercise of a power will not \nbe held to have been taken unreasonably and without authority 'if the unreasonableness appears only from a \nchange in community standards that has occurred since the step was taken'.[1546]  \n\n1283 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that social mores in relation to parentchild relationships have not changed \nover time, and that there has always been a 'universal understanding' of the importance of the relationship between \na natural parent and a child. Accordingly, he submitted that it did not matter whether the facts of this case were \nviewed by reference to attitudes and standards in the late 1950s and the 1960s, or 2013, because society's \nattitudes and standards with respect to the care that a parent should give to a child have not changed over \ntime.[1547]  \n\n1284 In some respects it could not be doubted that the rights and entitlements of children are matters on which \nthere could be no dispute: in order to reach their full potential as adult human beings, children need to grow up in \nan environment where their physical needs for proper nutrition, shelter, exercise and play, and safety are met, and \nwhere their emotional needs are met with love, care and a secure environment. Children also need education and \nthe opportunity to develop their intellectual, social and spiritual selves. But views as to how some of these needs \ncan best be met have changed over time. One obvious example which is no longer relevant in this case is whether \nchildren should be physically disciplined to correct inappropriate behaviour. This was quite common 30 to 40 years \nago, but is far more contentious today.  \n\n1285 Many aspects of this case demonstrate that society has changed considerably since the 1950s and 1960s. To \nsee that that is so, one need go no further than the marked change in the manner in which the rights and welfare of \naboriginal people were dealt with in the NW Act and the 1963 NW Act, as compared with the position today. As \nO'Loughlin J observed in Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2):[1548]  It is a truism that we live in changing \ntimes. What was accepted yesterday is rejected today. What would not be tolerated yesterday is accepted today. \nThere are moral and social issues that have in the past divided, and continue today to divide, sections of the \ncommunity.\n\n1286 In assessing the conduct of officers of the State, in the exercise of their powers in the performance of the \nprimary fiduciary duties to which the State is said to have been subject, it is necessary to do so by reference to the \nposition in the 1950s and 1960s, rather than by reference to what might be considered 'plainly unreasonable' today.  \n\n(v) What standard should be applied in assessing whether there has been a breach of the fiduciary duties in this \ncase?\n\n1287 All of these considerations lead me to the view that in assessing the conduct of the Director and officers or \nagents of the State in the performance of the primary fiduciary duties in this case the standard should be whether \n\n\n\nthe particular officer of the State exercising power with respect to the child acted in good faith in what he or she \nconsidered to be the best interests of the child.  \n\n1288 However, given that the statutory powers of the Director and officers of the Child Welfare Department under \nthe Child Welfare Act must be exercised reasonably, an overriding reasonableness limitation must be applied. If the \nconduct of the State's officers was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable person in that position and at that \ntime would have acted in the same way, then that would suggest a failure to perform the fiduciary duty to the \nstandard which is to be expected of a fiduciary. I will refer to this qualification, in shorthand, simply as whether the \nconduct was 'plainly unreasonable'.  \n\n(b) Have the plaintiffs established that the State breached the primary fiduciary duties it is said to have owed to the \nplaintiffs?  \n\n1289 As I have already observed, in the Amended Statement of Claim, the primary fiduciary duties said to be owed \nby the State to the plaintiffs were described in general terms in par [105] and then elaborated upon in [106] and \n[107].  \n\n1290 Elaborated upon in that way, the primary fiduciary duties can be summarised by reference to the following \nthemes:  \n\n(i) the preservation of the Collards' family unit;  \n\n(ii) placement with family members or members of the aboriginal community;  \n\n(iii) assessment and supervision of foster placements;  \n\n(iv) facilitate contact between the Children and Don and Sylvia, and members of their extended family or members \nof the aboriginal community;  \n\n(v) protect the Children's physical and mental health; and  \n\n(vi) avoid a conflict between the State's interest in housing the Children in a facility readily available to the State and \nthe Children's interest in being provided in a home environment with their family or the aboriginal community.  \n\n1291 At par [108] of the Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiffs allege that the State breached its fiduciary duty \nor duties to them in various ways. Paragraph [108] is set out in Annexure D. How these breaches related to the \nprimary fiduciary duties was not entirely clear on the face of the pleading.  \n\n1292 It was not entirely clear, on the face of the Amended Statement of Claim, whether particular alleged breaches \npertained to particular alleged duties in the Amended Statement of Claim. In addition, in his closing submissions, \ncounsel for the plaintiffs submitted that some of the allegations pleaded as breaches in the Amended Statement of \nClaim were not relied upon as discrete breaches of the fiduciary duty to which the State was said to be subject. A \nnumber of them were described as 'evidentiary or particular manifestations'[1549] of the damage which the plaintiffs \nsuffered as a result of the separation of the Children from Don and Sylvia. At one point, counsel for the plaintiffs \nagreed that if the State did not breach its fiduciary duty when the Children were first made wards, and they were \nplaced into care rather than placed with Don and Sylvia, then that would be the end of the matter and there would \nbe no need to consider the other breaches which were pleaded.[1550]  \n\n1293 The written closing submissions by counsel for the plaintiff further muddied the waters because they dealt with \nthe breaches of duty by reference to events or subjects (eg 'taking of Ellen', 'separation of Siblings from parents and \nadmission to Sister Kate's') which were then linked to multiple paragraphs in the Amended Statement of Claim \nrelating to the alleged duties or breaches of duty.  \n\n1294 Doing the best that I can, and using the broad themes for the primary fiduciary duties set out above, I have \nidentified the alleged primary fiduciary duties which I understand the plaintiffs say give rise to a breach of those \nduties, having regard to par [108] of the Amended Statement of Claim and to the oral and written submissions of \ncounsel for the plaintiff.  \n\n1295 Before doing so, it is convenient to mention some matters that counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed were not \nrelied upon in relation to the alleged breaches by the State of the primary fiduciary duties it is said to have owed. In \nhis opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that  the role of the guardian diminishes as children \nmature, and that by the time the children were young adults or older teenagers and were absconding ... we don't \n\n\n\nseek to contend that the department should have been ... trying to find them and controlling them and dragging \nthem back. In fact, we of course would support them being back with their family.[1551]\n\n1296 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed that the plaintiffs' case primarily focused on the \nperiod between 1958 and the late 1960s, while the Siblings were at Sister Kate's. The only alleged breach identified \nby counsel for the plaintiff as extending beyond this time was the allegation that the State failed to place the \nChildren in foster care with family members, or members of the aboriginal community. Counsel submitted that \n'aside from that there were no other breaches which are alleged in that period, effectively from when each of them \nleft Sister Kate's ... around the late 60s'.[1552] For that reason, almost all of the evidence on which the plaintiffs \nrelied in support of their allegations of breach of the primary fiduciary duties pertained to acts or omissions of the \nState's officers or agents in the period between either 1958 or 1961 (when the Children became wards) and 1969 \n(when all of the Children, with the exception of Ellen and Wesley, had returned to live with Don and Sylvia, albeit \nonly temporarily in some cases).  \n\n1297 In addition, it appeared that the plaintiffs did not advance four aspects of the alleged duties pleaded in the \nAmended Statement of Claim. First, at par [108.1] it was pleaded that the State breached its fiduciary duty to the \nplaintiffs in that it failed to assist Don and Sylvia to obtain appropriate accommodation 'or other support' to maintain \nthe family unit. Counsel for the plaintiffs did not advance any claim in respect of the 'other support' which should \nhave been provided. I understood with this aspect of the plaintiffs' case to be confined to a claim that the State \nshould have assisted Don and Sylvia to obtain accommodation.  \n\n1298 Secondly, at par [108.2] of the Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiffs plead that the State breached its \nfiduciary duty to them in that it failed 'to ascertain whether there were members of the plaintiffs' extended family, \nrelatives or other members of the aboriginal community who could look after the Children'. The plaintiffs did not \nsuggest that there was a member of the plaintiffs' extended family, or any member of the aboriginal community, \nwho was in a position to have fostered the Children. Rather, the plaintiffs' case was that no enquiries were made to \nascertain whether such persons could have fostered the Children.  \n\n1299 Thirdly, the alleged duty 'not to disregard the best interests of the Children to provide financially and in other \nways for the Children' (par [106.3] of the Amended Statement of Claim) was not relied upon in relation to any \nconduct said to constitute a breach of the State's fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.  \n\n1300 Fourthly, the Amended Statement of Claim contained a number of references to the maintenance payments \nDon was required to pay, pleaded that those payments were subject to a trust, and pleaded that the State was \nsubject to a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs to 'use the Maintenance Payments to promote the proper custody, \nmaintenance, education and well-being of the Children' the plaintiffs did not pursue those aspects of the case. The \nplaintiffs' case in relation to the maintenance payments, as I understood it, was confined to the alleged breach of \nfiduciary duty in par [108.10] of the Amended Statement of Claim, namely that the State chose to seek the \nMaintenance Payments from Don (rather than choosing not to pursue maintenance payments at all) with the result \nthat Don and Sylvia did not have the benefit of the use of that money, which they could have put towards obtaining \nbetter accommodation for themselves and their family.  \n\n1301 Counsel for the plaintiffs also confirmed that the plaintiffs did not contend that there was any breach of \nfiduciary duty by the State in relation to the sexual abuse Glenys suffered when she was living in Beaufort \nPark.[1553]  \n\n(i) Evidence as to good faith\n\n1302 It is convenient at this point to set out a finding which applies to of each of the alleged breaches of fiduciary \nduty. The allegations of breach of fiduciary duty pertain to various decisions or actions (including decisions not to \ntake any action) by the Director, the Commissioner and various officers and employees of the Child Welfare \nDepartment or the Department of Native Welfare, pursuant to powers under the Child Welfare Act. There was no \nevidence that any of those decisions or actions were made, or taken, other than in the belief by the officer or \nemployee concerned, in good faith, that those decisions or actions were necessary in the best interests of the \nChildren, or any one of them.  \n\n\n\n1303 In the discussion which follows, I focus on whether the evidence established that any of those decisions or \nactions said to constitute a breach of fiduciary duty constituted conduct which was so plainly unreasonable that no \nreasonable decision maker in the same position, at the same point in time, would have acted in the same way, and \nalternatively, whether a reasonable person in the same position would have acted in the same way.  \n\n(ii) The alleged breaches\n\n(A) The preservation of the Collards' family unit  \n\n1304 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duty included:  [107.1] As a trustee and a fiduciary the \nDefendant was obliged not to fail to promote the interests of the plaintiffs in the preservation and well-being of the \nfamily unit of the plaintiffs including the provision of accommodation and support to assist in the preservation of the \nfamily unit,\n\nalternatively not to disregard the importance to the interests of the plaintiffs of the preservation and well-being of the \nfamily unit of the plaintiffs;  \n\n1305 The plaintiffs' primary case in relation to the breach of this fiduciary duty appeared to be their allegation in par \n[108.1] of the Amended Statement of Claim, which alleged that in breach of its fiduciary duty, the State  \n\n[108.1] did not assist Don and Sylvia in obtaining appropriate accommodation or other support to maintain the \nfamily unit but rather removed and detained each of the Children from the care of Don and Sylvia and applied for \nand obtained a Court order that Don make the Maintenance Payments from his income, which could otherwise \nhave contributed to the maintenance of the Children in a home environment comprised of a family unit of their \nnatural parents and siblings.  \n\n1306 However, in so far as the duty to preserve the Collard's family unit was concerned, the plaintiffs also alleged \nother breaches of duty arising from that conduct, including those in par [108.2], [108.5], [108.6], [108.9], \n[108.10].[1554]  \n\n1307 In his opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiff made clear that the alleged breaches of this duty focused \non the following acts or omissions:[1555]  \n\n(A) The State's failure to assist Don and Sylvia to obtain appropriate accommodation or other support to maintain \ntheir family unit;  \n\n(B) The decision to apply for the Children to be made wards and to maintain their separation from Don and Sylvia;  \n\n(C) The State's failure to ensure the Children stayed together when they were removed from Don and Sylvia's care;  \n\n(D) The decision to apply for a maintenance order against Don in respect of the maintenance of the Children.  \n\n1308 The plaintiffs' case was that once the Children were made wards, the State should have returned the Children \nto live with Don and Sylvia, and in that event should have assisted Don to obtain public housing, and refrained from \nseeking maintenance payments so that Don could put that money towards accommodation.[1556]  \n\n(B) The State's alleged failure to assist Don and Sylvia to obtain appropriate accommodation or other support to \nmaintain their family unit  \n\n1309 As I understood it, the plaintiff's argument in essence was that, rather than applying for the Children to be \nmade wards, the better course of action in all of the circumstances would have been to leave the Children with Don \nand Sylvia, but to endeavour to obtain appropriate accommodation for them through public housing. Counsel for the \nplaintiffs submitted that although the Director was the guardian of the Children, and even though he did not have \nresponsibility for State housing, the State as a whole had a responsibility to take action, particularly in \ncircumstances where it had knowledge that Don and Sylvia were in need of assistance to obtain \naccommodation.[1557]  \n\n1310 Two difficulties arise in relation to this aspect of the plaintiffs' case. First, it is apparent from the evidence \ngiven to the Children's Court in 1958 and 1961, in respect of Ellen and the Siblings respectively, that officers of the \nChild Welfare Department believed that the Children were being neglected. In relation to Ellen, the information \nprovided to the officers of the Child Welfare Department by the Beverley Hospital was that Ellen was suffering from \nmalnutrition, and an inspection of the humpy revealed that Don and Sylvia and their children, including Ellen, lived \nin extremely impoverished circumstances. In the case of the Siblings, the information available to the officers of the \nChild Welfare Department in 1961 as a result of their inspections of the humpy, was that the Siblings lived in \n\n\n\nextremely impoverished accommodation, without any basic facilities (such as a water supply, electricity, and \nbathroom and toilet facilities, at the humpy) and the absence of food in the humpy suggested that the Siblings may \nnot have been getting enough to eat.  \n\n1311 The circumstances in which the Children were living when they were the subject of an application to be made \nwards, and the obvious implications of those circumstances for the physical health and welfare of the Children, \nwere such that it would have been plainly unreasonable for officers of the Child Welfare Department to have left the \nChildren in that environment (rather than to make and application to the Children's Court) either at all or for more \nthan a very short period of time.  \n\n1312 The question, then, is whether it would have been possible to obtain other housing for Don and Sylvia and the \nChildren, in a short period of time, as an alternative to applying to have the Children made wards. There was no \ndirect evidence as to the availability of State housing at the time. However, such evidence as there was in relation \nto public housing suggests that the demand for State housing exceeded the supply of it, so that not everyone who \nsought accommodation could obtain it. The evidence in relation to the provision of housing for aboriginal people \n(particularly the report of Mr Long, in 1969, to which I referred at [1018]) confirmed that in the 1950s and 1960s \nthere was a significant demand for State housing for aboriginal people. That evidence also suggested that in the \nsame period the supply of State housing for aboriginal people was limited. There were attempts to provide more \npublic housing, especially for aboriginal people, but these were slow in coming to fruition, and there was very limited \nhousing available other than on the reserves, where the accommodation was extremely basic indeed. These \ninferences point to the conclusion that even had greater efforts been made to obtain State housing assistance for \nDon and Sylvia, there was no guarantee that such housing could have been found in the immediate future.  \n\n1313 I find that it was not plainly unreasonable for the officers and agents of the State to make an application that \nthe Children be made wards rather than to leave the Children in Don and Sylvia's care and to try to obtain housing \nfor them.  \n\n1314 Even if the appropriate test were what a reasonable person would have done in the same circumstances, in \nmy view a reasonable person in the same position would have made the decision to apply to the Children's Court, \nin preference to leaving the Children in circumstances where they were considered to be neglected, or trying to \nobtain State housing for them, but without any guarantee that that could be secured at any stage in the immediate \nfuture.  \n\n(C) The decision to apply for the Children to be made wards and to maintain their separation from Don and Sylvia  \n\nThe decision to apply for Ellen to be made a ward\n\n1315 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff pointed to the following matters as aspects of this alleged \nbreach of the fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiffs by maintaining their family unit:    The State \nforcibly separated Ellen from Don and Sylvia, maintained that separation, and collected maintenance payments \nfrom Don and Sylvia, in circumstances where:     It had conducted an inadequate investigation of Don and Sylvia's \nliving conditions, so that it did not rely on a reasonably based conclusion as to Ellen's accommodation and its effect \nupon her health;[1558]   The State's decision to remove Ellen, and its maintenance of her separation from Don and \nSylvia, relied on Don and Sylvia drinking alcohol excessively, yet that allegation was not based on any \nevidence.[1559]    \n\n1316 I do not accept these submissions for two reasons.  \n\n1317 First, the information available to the officers of the Child Welfare Department indicated that Ellen was a \nneglected child. The information provided by the Beverley Hospital was that Ellen was suffering from malnutrition \nwhen she was brought to the hospital by Don and Sylvia. Secondly, an inspection of the humpy by officers of the \nChild Welfare Department - which I have found was Don and Sylvia's home, even if they did not live there every day \nof the year - revealed that Don and Sylvia and their children, lived in extremely impoverished circumstances, \nwithout any basic facilities (such as a water supply, electricity, and bathroom and toilet facilities) at the humpy. That \ninformation supported the conclusion reached by the officers that Ellen was a neglected child, having regard to the \nmeaning of that term in the Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1318 I do not accept that the investigation conducted by officers of the Child Welfare Department was 'inadequate \n... so that it did not rely on a reasonably based conclusion as to Ellen's accommodation'.[1560] The basis for that \n\n\n\nsubmission was that the humpy was not Ellen's home, and that at the time when she was made a ward, Don and \nSylvia were in fact living on the McLean's farm, and that they lived on various other farms at other times during the \nyear.[1561] As I have found that the humpy was Don and Sylvia's permanent home, even if they did not live there \nevery day of the year. Although Don and Sylvia were staying at the McLean's farm when they took Ellen to the \nBeverley Hospital, that accommodation was of a temporary duration for as long as they were working on the \nMcLean's farm. When Don and Sylvia went to collect Ellen from the Hospital, their work on the McLean's farm had \ncome to an end, and they were intending to return, with Ellen, to the humpy.  \n\n1319 Secondly, as for the submission that the officers of the Child Welfare Department relied on Don and Sylvia's \nexcessive drinking, as a basis for bringing the application in relation to Ellen, there was no evidence to suggest that \nthis was a basis for the application made by the officers of the Child Welfare Department to the Children's Court in \nrespect of Ellen.  \n\n1320 In his file note of 13 March 1958, Mr Waghorne indicated that  I considered it would be detrimental and in fact \ndangerous to [Ellen's] welfare to allow [her] to be returned to such filthy conditions so I decided to make application \nto the Court.[1562]\n\n1321 Having regard to that evidence, I find that Mr Waghorne's decision to make an application to the Court with \nrespect to Ellen was not 'plainly unreasonable', having regard to the information Mr Waghorne had received that \nEllen was suffering from malnutrition, and having regard to the living conditions at the humpy, which he had \nobserved, all of which pointed to the conclusion that Ellen was a neglected child.  \n\n1322 The same conclusion follows even if an objective or reasonable person test is applied. In my view, a \nreasonable person in the same position in 1958 would have made the decision to apply for Ellen to be made a \nward, in preference to leaving her in circumstances where it appeared that she had been neglected to such an \nextent that she had suffered from malnutrition.  \n\n1323 In any event, I do not see how Mr Waghorne's decision to make an application to the Children's Court in \nrespect of Ellen could be considered a breach of any fiduciary duty owed by the State in circumstances where the \nChildren's Court found that Ellen was a neglected child. The fact that the order was made indicates that the Court \nwas satisfied that the application was supported by sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that Ellen was a \nneglected child.  \n\n1324 The decision reached by the Children's Court to order that Ellen be made a ward could not be said to \nconstitute any breach of fiduciary duty by the State, at the very least because that decision was authorised by the \nChild Welfare Act. Given that an order of the Court could only have been made in respect of an application, it is \ndifficult to see how any breach of fiduciary duty could be said to have arisen by virtue of that application being made \nin the first place. However, it is unnecessary to resolve that question in view of my conclusion that there was no \nbreach of fiduciary duty on the part of the State by virtue of Mr Waghorne's decision to bring that application, having \nregard to the information on which he relied in doing so.  \n\nThe decision to apply for the Siblings to be made wards\n\n1325 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff pointed to the following matters as aspects of this alleged \nbreach of the fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiffs by maintaining their family unit:    The State \nforcibly separated the Siblings from Don and Sylvia, it maintained that separation, it collected maintenance \npayments from Don and Sylvia, and it decided to house the Siblings at Sister Kate's, in circumstances where the \ninformation available to the State was insufficiently reliable to enable the State to make an objectively reasonable \ndecision that the Children be removed or kept from their care, in that:     The State failed to take into account that \nthe investigation into the Collards' living conditions in late 1959 had concluded that those conditions were adequate \nfor the proper welfare of a child;[1563]   The accommodation in which the Siblings lived was regarded by the State \nas justifying the removal of the Siblings when that accommodation was equal to, if not better than, accommodation \noccupied by aboriginal people on the Reserve at Brookton;[1564]   The State failed to conduct a proper \ninvestigation of the living conditions of the Collard family prior to making the application to the Court that the \nSiblings be made wards;[1565] and   The State's decision to remove the Children, and its decisions not to return the \nChildren, relied on Don and Sylvia drinking alcohol excessively, yet that allegation was not based on any \nevidence.[1566]    \n\n\n\n1326 At the outset, I note that officers of the State did not in fact remove the Siblings from Don and Sylvia's custody \nand take them to Sister Kate's. The decision to place the Siblings at Sister Kate's was made by Don and Sylvia, \nand the Siblings were taken to Sister Kate's with their authority, by Ms Jones. For that reason, I have understood \nthe plaintiffs' submissions in relation to the State's 'removal of the Siblings' to pertain to the decision made by Mr \nWrightWebster to make an application to the Children's Court for the Siblings to be made wards, and the decision \nwhich was, in effect, made by the Director of the Child Welfare Department on or after 8 December 1961 when the \nSiblings were placed in his care, custody and control, to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's. In effect, that was a \ndecision to refrain from exercising the power the Director had under s 10(2) of the Child Welfare Act to remove the \nSiblings from Sister Kate's and to place them elsewhere (such as with Don and Sylvia).  \n\n1327 The application to the Children's Court was made by Mr WrightWebster, and Mr Humphries and Constable \nWall gave evidence in support of that application. I have found that Mr Humphries' evidence to the Court reflected \nthe contents of the 1961 Informative Report, and that his evidence was based on his observations of the humpy on \ntwo or three occasions before the application was made to the Court. Mr Humphries' inspection of the humpy which \nI have found was Don and Sylvia's home revealed that Don and Sylvia and the Siblings, lived in extremely \nimpoverished circumstances at the humpy, without any basic facilities (such as a water supply, electricity, and \nbathroom and toilet facilities). Mr Humphries had also found no food in the humpy at the time of his visits, and \nobserved that Don and Sylvia drank heavily. This information pointed to the conclusion that each of the Siblings \nwas a neglected child, having regard to the meaning of that term in the Child Welfare Act.  \n\n1328 The inference which can be drawn from Mr WrightWebster's memorandum dated 12 December 1961 to the \nDirector is that the decision of the Director not to remove the Siblings from Sister Kate's and to return them to Don \nand Sylvia's care was based on the contents of the 1961 Informative Report, together with the order made by the \nChildren's Court. I note that the Children's Court order contained a recommendation that the Siblings be retained at \nSister Kate's until their parents could afford them proper and appropriate accommodation, and so that the Siblings \ncould be kept together in one place.[1567]  \n\n1329 I do not accept the plaintiffs' contention that the State failed to conduct a proper investigation of the living \nconditions of the Collard family prior to make the application to the Children's Court. That contention was not \nsupported by the evidence. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the evidence of Don and Sylvia did 'not indicate \nany build up to the visits of Constable Wall and Ms Jones in the several days prior to 7 December 1961'. I am \nunable to accept that submission. I found (at [334]) that Mr Humphries visited the humpy two or three times prior to \nmaking the application to the Court in respect of the Siblings. I also found that the observations contained in the \n1961 Informative Report reflected what Mr Humphries saw during his visits to the humpy and formed the basis for \nthe evidence he gave to the Children's Court in support of the application that the Siblings be made wards.  \n\n1330 The underlying premise for this aspect of the plaintiffs' contentions was that the humpy was not Don and \nSylvia's home, and that had further inquiries been made, officers of the Child Welfare Department would have \nascertained that that was so. In view of my findings at [343] that the humpy was Don and Sylvia's permanent home \nat which they spent a substantial portion of time each year, and to which they returned in between seasonal work \nelsewhere, this contention must be rejected.  \n\n1331 In addition, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the 1961 Informative Report was superficial in many \nrespects, and indicated that the State's investigation of the Collards' living conditions was inadequate. He submitted \nthat 'the form was not constructed with a high expectation of detailed content', that 'no information [was] obtained \nfrom the parents of the [Siblings] or the Principal of the School' and reached a number of conclusions 'which it could \nnot reasonably have come to'.[1568] He also submitted that there had clearly been no consideration given to the \nfact that limited food may have been stored in the humpy because the food the family ate was of a kind which was \nlikely to be obtained and eaten immediately, and that although there was no water or sanitary facilities, the plaintiffs \nused those at the Reserve.  \n\n1332 I am not persuaded by these submissions to conclude that the information on which both Mr Wright-Webster, \nand the Director, relied was inadequate, for four reasons. First, as I have found, the evidence given by Mr \nHumphries at the hearing before the Children's Court reflected that which was set out in the 1961 Informative \n\n\n\nReport. However, there was no evidence as to what was actually said by Mr Humphries. He may well have given \nmore expansive evidence at the hearing than what is set out in the 1961 Informative Report. In addition, I note that \nConstable Wall also gave evidence to the Children's Court. There was no evidence before me as to what the \ncontent of his evidence was, but as Mr WrightWebster indicated in his memorandum of 12 December 1961, 'Mr \nHumphries and Constable Wall gave evidence of squalid conditions and drunkenness by the parents'.[1569]  \n\n1333 Secondly, the submission that the investigation was inadequate because the 1961 Informative Report did not \ncontain information from Don and Sylvia, or from the Principal of the school, should be rejected. The enquiries \nactually made by Mr Humphries in preparing that Report are not specified on the face of the Report. Although Mr \nHumphries did not have any recollection of the Report, his unchallenged evidence was that his usual approach \nwhen visiting a home to investigate a possible neglect case was to 'check such things as the condition of the child, \nwhether there was food in the house, and whether the parents were drunk. If the parents were present we would \ntalk to them.'[1570] Some of the information set out in the 1961 Informative Report for example in relation to Don's \nincome seems most likely to have been obtained by Mr Humphries as a result of speaking with Don. In view of this \nevidence, it cannot be concluded that Mr Humphries did not make enquiries of Don and Sylvia in conducting his \ninvestigation.  \n\n1334 A further reason why counsel's submission must be rejected is that it appears to draw on contemporary \napproaches to child welfare investigations. The evidence suggested that during the 1950s and 1960s, far less \nextensive investigations were undertaken before determining whether an application should be made for a child to \nbe made a ward. As I found at [868] the approach taken by Mr Humphries in relation to his investigation of the \nSiblings' living conditions, and by Mr Wright-Webster in making the application to the Children's Court, reflected \ndepartmental practices at the time. As I found at [867] it was not until the 1970s that officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment began undertaking more extensive investigations before consideration would be given to whether a \nchild should be taken into care.  \n\n1335 Thirdly, I am unable to accept counsel's submission that the 1961 Informative Report was inadequate \nbecause Mr Humphries failed to give sufficient consideration to an alternative explanation for the absence of food in \nthe humpy, and to the fact that water and sanitary facilities were available on the Brookton Reserve. As I noted at \n[363], even allowing for the fact that Don and Sylvia did not have electricity, did not own a refrigerator, that most of \ntheir food came from fresh supplies, and that they did not live continuously at the humpy throughout the year, the \nabsence of any food in the humpy would clearly have been a matter of concern to welfare authorities. Furthermore, \neven though water and sanitary facilities were available at the Reserve, that does not detract from the fact that the \nhumpy where the Siblings lived was not equipped with basic utilities like electricity, a water supply, and bathroom \nand toilet facilities. The absence of those facilities, particularly for a family with eight children, some of whom were \nbabies or toddlers, would inevitably have created concerns for the welfare of the Siblings.  \n\n1336 Fourthly, the submission that the 1961 Informative Report reached a number of conclusions to which it could \nnot reasonably have come (such as that Don and Sylvia had 'nil' interest in their children) must also be rejected, in \nview of my finding that the content of the 1961 Informative Report reflected Mr Humphries' observations in his visits \nto the Collards prior to 7 December 1961. In any event, the meaning of valueladen observations in that Report \ncannot now be clarified. For present purposes, it suffices to note that there was sufficient information before Mr \nWrightWebster, and in turn the Director, to support the conclusion that the Siblings were being 'neglected'.  \n\n1337 I am also unable to accept the plaintiffs' contention that the State's decision to remove the Siblings relied on \nan allegation, unsupported by any evidence, that Don and Sylvia were drinking alcohol excessively. Mr \nWrightWebster's memorandum dated 12 December 1961 indicated that in support of the application to the \nChildren's Court in respect of the Siblings, 'Mr Humphries and Constable Wall gave evidence of squalid conditions \nand of drunkenness by the parents'.[1571] In addition, in the 1961 Informative Report, Mr Humphries noted that \n'both parents drink heavily'.[1572] I have found that the observations in the 1961 Informative Report, and thus the \nevidence Mr Humphries gave at the hearing, reflected what he had seen on the two or three occasions on which he \nhad visited the Collards at the humpy. As I explained at [357] there was nothing to suggest that that information \nwas not reliable.  \n\n\n\n1338 As for the plaintiff's contention that the State failed to take into account that the investigation into the Collards' \nliving conditions in late 1959 had concluded that those conditions were adequate for the proper welfare of a child, \nthere was no direct evidence as to whether or not this fact was taken into account by Mr WrightWebster. However, \nMr WrightWebster was the author of the report to the Commissioner on 29 May 1959,[1573] in which he \nrecommended that Ellen be returned to her family if Don made some changes to their accommodation. At [949] to \n[951] I found that Mr Long subsequently inspected the Collards' accommodation at the Yeo's farm, where Don and \nSylvia were then living, and where Mr Long understood that Don was permanently employed, and recommended \nthat Ellen be returned to her family. I also found that Mr Wright-Webster then endorsed Mr Long's recommendation. \nIt is highly unlikely that Mr WrightWebster, as the District Officer for the Department of Native Welfare, would have \nforgotten this course of events, or not taken it into account, in considering whether an application should be made to \nthe Children's Court in respect of the children. More importantly, the information available to Mr WrightWebster \nsupported the conclusion that Don and Sylvia's living conditions were not the same as they had been when Mr \nWrightWebster recommended Ellen's return in May 1959. In particular, by late 1961, when the decision was made \nto apply to the Children's Court for the Siblings to be made wards, the information available to Mr WrightWebster \n(based on the observations of Mr Humphries and Constable Wall) was that Don and Sylvia were living at the humpy \nin conditions which were not materially different from those when Ellen was made a ward in 1958.  \n\n1339 As I found at [890], since the 1960s there has been an increasing awareness within the Child Welfare \nDepartment of the potential adverse consequences of separating children from their parents, especially their \nmothers, at a very young age, and a corresponding increasing emphasis in departmental policy that the removal of \na child should be a last resort when other options have failed. Accordingly, it may be arguable that a child welfare \nofficer, acting in 2013, might not necessarily have applied to remove the Siblings from Don and Sylvia's care, \nparticularly as there was no evidence of other signs of neglect, such as signs that the Siblings were suffering from \nmalnutrition, or that they were not attending school. However, that serves to emphasise the fact that it is necessary \nto view the facts of this case within the context of all the circumstances at the time. When those circumstances are \ntaken into account, in my view, it cannot be said that either the decision by Mr WrightWebster to apply for the \nSiblings to be made wards, or by the Director to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's once they were made wards, \nrather than to immediately return them to their parents, was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable person \nwould have acted in the same way.  \n\n1340 Furthermore, the information available to the Director was that the Children's Court had found that the Siblings \nwere neglected children. Given that that neglect had arisen from the circumstances in which they were living with \nDon and Sylvia, the suggestion by counsel for the plaintiffs that it was open to the Director to return the Siblings to \ntheir parents is, with respect, patently untenable. Moreover, the Children's Court had recommended that the \nSiblings be retained at Sister Kate's until such time as Don and Sylvia were able to afford proper and appropriate \naccommodation. That is all the more so given that Sylvia and Don had placed the Siblings at Sister Kate's \nthemselves.  \n\n1341 Having regard to the content of the 1961 Informative Report, which summarises the information which was \nthen available to Mr WrightWebster, in my view it cannot be said that his decision to make an application to the \nChildren's Court in respect of the Siblings was so 'plainly unreasonable' that no reasonable person in the same \nposition, and with the knowledge then available to officers of the Child Welfare Department, would have acted in \nthat way. Similarly, in view of the information which was before the Director, it cannot be said that the decision not \nto remove the Siblings from Sister Kate's and return them to Don and Sylvia's care was so 'plainly unreasonable' \nthat no reasonable person in the same position would have acted in that way.  \n\n1342 Furthermore, even if an objective or reasonable person test were applied, in my view, a reasonable person in \nthe same position in 1961 would have made the decision to apply for an order that each of the Siblings be made a \nward, in preference to leaving them in their parents' care, having regard to the information which indicated that they \nwere being neglected. Similarly, a reasonable person in the same position as the Director in 1961 would have made \nthe decision to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's, at least for the time being, rather than return them to Don and \nSylvia's care once they had been made wards.  \n\n\n\n1343 As I observed above at [1321] in relation to the application made to the Children's Court with respect to Ellen, \nI do not see how Mr Waghorne decision to make an application to the Court in respect of the Siblings could be \nconsidered a breach of any fiduciary duty owed by the State in circumstances where the Children's Court \nsubsequently found that each of the Siblings was a neglected child. The fact that the order was made indicates that \nthe Court was satisfied that the application was supported by sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the \nSiblings were neglected. The same can be said of the decision made by the Director not to return the Siblings to \nDon and Sylvia's care.  \n\n1344 The plaintiffs also contended that the State's application for the Siblings to be made wards constituted a \nbreach of its fiduciary duty because the accommodation in which the Siblings were living was equal to, if not better \nthan, accommodation occupied by aboriginal people on the Reserve at Brookton. As I found at [372], the conditions \non the Brookton Reserve were not markedly different from those in which Don and Sylvia lived at the humpy. Mr \nMaine's evidence established that officers of the Child Welfare Department regarded aboriginal reserves as \nunhealthy environments in which to raise children, and officers of that Department applied the same approach to \ndetermining whether a child should be placed in care, whether or not the child lived on a reserve.  \n\n1345 In my view, it cannot be said that either Mr WrightWebster's decision to make the application to the Children's \nCourt, or the Director's decision not to immediately return the Siblings to Don and Sylvia's care, was 'plainly \nunreasonable' solely by virtue of the fact that aboriginal people lived on the Brookton Reserve in similar conditions \nto those in which the plaintiffs were living. I find that it was not plainly unreasonable for those officers to act as they \ndid.  \n\n1346 Further, even if the appropriate test for a breach of fiduciary duty in a case of this kind were to consider what a \nreasonable person would have done in the same circumstances, in my view, a reasonable person would not have \nbeen deterred from making an application to the Court in respect of the Siblings, or from deciding that the Siblings \nshould remain at Sister Kate's after they were made wards, solely by virtue of the fact that other aboriginal people \nhad the similar misfortune to live in circumstances of dire poverty on the Brookton Reserve. That fact did not render \nunreasonable the actions of Mr WrightWebster, or of the Director, in relation to the Siblings.  \n\nThe State's conduct in maintaining the separation of each of the Children from Don and Sylvia\n\n1347 I have understood the plaintiffs' case to be that the State breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs to \nmaintain their family unit by failing to return the Children to Don and Sylvia's care for some time after each of them \nbecame wards (and in Ellen's case, she was not returned to the care of her parents at all during her wardship).  \n\n1348 The plaintiffs' submissions did not focus on a particular decision by any officer of the State not to return each \nof the Children to Don and Sylvia's care. The argument was instead approached on the basis that the State's \nomission to return the Children to Don and Sylvia, for so long as it occurred, constituted a breach of its fiduciary \nduty. However, as I have found, on a number of occasions between 1962 and 1970, officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment or Department of Native Welfare, who inspected Don and Sylvia's living conditions, considered whether \nthose conditions were suitable for the return of the Siblings. These are noted below. In addition, each of the \nChildren, other than Ellen, was permitted to return to Don and Sylvia's care prior to the end of his or her wardship.  \n\n1349 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff pointed to the following matters as aspects of the State's \nalleged breach of the fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiffs by maintaining their family unit by \nfailing to return Ellen, or the Siblings, to Don and Sylvia's care:    Notwithstanding departmental recommendations \nthat Ellen should be returned, the State did not permit Ellen's return to Don and Sylvia on the basis of an allegation \nof gambling by Sylvia, the accuracy of which, and the impact of which on Ellen's welfare, was not \ninvestigated;[1574]  The State's decision to remove the Children, and its decisions not to return the Children, relied \non Don and Sylvia drinking alcohol excessively, yet that allegation was not based on any evidence,[1575]  Even if \nDon was frequently drunk and violent towards Sylvia that was not a reasonable basis for removing, and keeping the \nChildren from the custody of Sylvia;[1576] and  There was no evidence of any conduct by Sylvia sufficient to \nwarrant the Children being removed from her care;[1577]\n\n1350 In addition, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the State's child welfare decision-making authorities had \ninsufficient reliable information concerning Don and Sylvia's behaviour and circumstances, including their housing, \n\n\n\ntheir drinking patterns, domestic violence, gambling or other behaviour which would enable them to make an \nobjectively reasonable decision that their Children be kept from their care.[1578]  \n\n1351 Furthermore, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that between 1961 and the late 1960s (when the Siblings \nbegan to return to live with Don and Sylvia) the State failed to make any enquiries as to Don and Sylvia's ability to \nlook after the Children.[1579]  \n\n1352 I deal with each of these matters in turn.  \n\nAllegations of gambling\n\n1353 At [958] to [962] I set out my factual findings in relation to the consideration given by officers of the \nDepartment in 1959 to the return of Ellen to Don and Sylvia. As I found, in July 1959 Mr WrightWebster wrote to the \nCommissioner endorsing Mr Long's recommendation that Ellen be returned. In making that recommendation, Mr \nLong noted that Don had a permanent job on the Yeo's farm, that Don and Sylvia and their family were living in a \nthree bedroom asbestos cottage on the farm, which was clean, tidy and adequately furnished, and that the Siblings \nwere healthy and well nourished.[1580] The Commissioner approved that recommendation on 5 October 1959 and \nthe Acting Director of Child Welfare agreed with the recommendation on 22 October 1959. However, before Ellen \ncould be returned to Don and Sylvia, the Commissioner reversed his decision on the basis of a report from Ms \nJones that Sylvia was 'gambling heavily'.[1581] In view of that report, in November 1959 the Commissioner \ndetermined that no action should be taken to return Ellen to Don and Sylvia until further advice was received from \nMs Jones.  \n\n1354 While there was nothing to suggest that that decision was not made in good faith, in my view, it was so plainly \nunreasonable that no reasonable decision maker in the same circumstances would have acted the same way. As I \nfound at [959] to [961], the report to the Commissioner from Ms Jones was oral, it was not subsequently \nsubstantiated by any evidence from Ms Jones, and the concern about gambling appears to have been based on \nmoral considerations. Further, there was no evidence of any investigation by officers of the Department of Native \nWelfare, or the Child Welfare Department, in relation to whether Sylvia had in fact been gambling. More importantly, \nthere was no evidence that any officer of either Department had given consideration to whether gambling by Sylvia \n(even if it had occurred) had any implication for whether Sylvia and Don were in a position to care for Ellen. In \nNovember 1959, the other information in the possession of the Departments was that Don and Sylvia had \npermanent accommodation in a cottage on the Yeo's farm, that that accommodation was clean and comfortable, \nand that the Siblings were being fed and were well maintained. In other words, all of the available information, save \nfor an unsubstantiated allegation of gambling which was, on its face, probably irrelevant to Don and Sylvia's ability \nto care for Ellen, pointed to the conclusion that she should be returned to her parents' care without delay.  \n\n1355 I find that it was plainly unreasonable for the Commissioner and the Director to refuse to permit Ellen's return \nto her parents in November 1959.  \n\n1356 However, that was not the end of the matter. Further enquiries were then made, and in December 1959, the \nCommissioner appears to have reached a decision that no further action should be taken to return Ellen until such \ntime as Sylvia made a further request for her return, at which point the District Officer would be requested to report \nagain.[1582] The Director appears to have concurred in that decision because Ellen was not returned to Don and \nSylvia in 1959.  \n\n1357 The basis for that decision was set out in a memorandum dated 14 December 1959 from an investigation \nofficer in the Department of Native Welfare to the Commissioner. The content of that memorandum is set out above \nat [956]. That memorandum revealed that the information available to the Commissioner in December 1959 was \nthat Don was no longer permanently employed by Mr Yeo, and that Don and Sylvia were no longer living in the \ncottage on the Yeo's farm. Instead, Don and Sylvia had resumed their itinerant seasonal work in and around \nBrookton. The Siblings who were of school age had been living with Bessie Ninyette so that they could attend \nschool, although during November and December, the family had been living in Narembeen. The information \navailable to the Department (from Ms Jones) in December 1959 was that she did not know the conditions in which \nthe family was then living.  \n\n\n\n1358 The evidence established that further information was received by the Commissioner for Native Welfare in \nDecember 1959. The key relevance of that information for present purposes was that it revealed that Don and \nSylvia had resumed seasonal work in and around Brookton. Further, that information indicated that some of the \nSiblings had been living with Bessie Ninyette, and that in turn suggested that those Siblings were again living in the \nhumpy on Bessie Ninyette's block. The information available to the State, as at December 1959, was either that \nDon and Sylvia's living conditions were unknown, or that Don and Sylvia's employment and accommodation were \nnot materially different from what they had been in March 1958 when Ellen was made a ward. It is not entirely clear \nfrom the information before the Commissioner in December 1959 whether alleged gambling by Sylvia remained of \nany concern, because the focus of the information put before the Commissioner at the time was on Don and \nSylvia's employment and accommodation.  \n\n1359 In view of these findings, I find that the decision by the Commissioner in December 1959 not to return Ellen to \nDon and Sylvia's care was not so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decisionmaker in 1959, in the same \ncircumstances, and with same information, would have made it. I have reached that conclusion because the \ninformation before the Commissioner indicated either that Don and Sylvia's living conditions were unknown so that \nto approve Ellen's return to Don and Sylvia would be to return her in circumstances in which it was not known \nwhether her living conditions would be suitable for the care of a child. The alternative implication of the information \navailable to the Commissioner in December 1959 was that the humpy had become Don and Sylvia's permanent \nhome base again, in which case Ellen would have been returned to living conditions which were not materially \ndifferent from those from which she had been removed in 1958.  \n\n1360 I find that it was not plainly unreasonable for the Commissioner (and, in turn, the Director) to act as he did in \nDecember 1959 in declining to return Ellen to her parents at that stage.  \n\n1361 Even applying a reasonable person test, I have concluded that a reasonable person in the same position \nwould have reached the conclusion that because Don and Sylvia's employment and living conditions in December \n1959 were either unknown, or not materially different from those in March 1958, it was not in Ellen's best interests \nto be returned to her parents' care at that time.  \n\nAllegation of excessive drinking by Don and Sylvia\n\n1362 Counsel for the State submitted that the State's decision not to return the Children to Don and Sylvia relied on \nthem drinking alcohol excessively, but that allegation was not based on any evidence.[1583]  \n\n1363 I am unable to accept that submission, for two reasons. First, as I found at [558], officers of the Department of \nNative Welfare and the Child Welfare Department visited Don and Sylvia on a number of occasions between 1961 \nand 1970, recorded their observations about Don and Sylvia's living conditions, and on a number of occasions \nmade recommendations as to whether those living conditions were suitable for the return of the Children. In Mr \nWright-Webster's report of August 1962, Constable Wall's report of December 1966, Mr Hill's reports of 11 January \n1968 and 11 February 1968, and Mr Moulton's report of 30 September 1969, all officers made reference to Don (or \nDon and Sylvia) engaging in excessive drinking, being drunk at the time of the visit, or being addicted to liquor.  \n\n1364 They were not the only reports which came to the attention of the State which suggested that Don had \nengaged in excessive drinking. When she applied for assistance to care for Joseph, Philip and Ashley in October \n1969, Mrs Jean Collard advised the Child Welfare Department that when she took the boys into her care, Don was \n'in a drunken stupor'.[1584] As I noted at [572] it is difficult to envisage any reason why Mrs Jean Collard would \nhave made a false report about Don's drinking. Similarly, as I found at [573] in September 1973, a Relief Officer \nmade notes in connection with an application by Sylvia for financial relief, and noted Sylvia's information that Don \nwas an alcoholic and had left her to go drinking.[1585]  \n\n1365 As I found at [611] there was nothing in the circumstances in which any of these reports were received to \nsuggest that the information as to Don's (or Don and Sylvia's) drinking was unreliable, so as to indicate that the \nState should not have relied on that information.  \n\n1366 Secondly, the information in the possession of the State throughout this period included information as to \nDon's convictions for alcohol-related offences. As I noted at [583] to [593], between 1961 and 1973, Don was \nconvicted on 11 occasions for alcoholrelated offences. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no \n\n\n\nevidence that information in relation to Don's convictions was expressly taken into account by any relevant child \nwelfare authority, or was relevant to any decision by any child welfare authority, as to any decision in relation to the \nplacement of the Children.[1586] That is so. However, in considering whether the State's failure to return the \nSiblings to Don and Sylvia's care at any stage was unreasonable it is appropriate to have regard to the information \nin the State's possession and that information included information as to Don's conviction for alcoholrelated \noffences.  \n\nWhether excessive drinking on Don's part, and violence towards Sylvia, was a reasonable basis for keeping the \nChildren from Sylvia's custody\n\n1367 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that even if Don was frequently drunk and violent towards Sylvia that was \nnot a reasonable basis for keeping the Children from the custody of Sylvia,[1587] and that there was no evidence of \nany conduct by Sylvia sufficient to warrant the Children being kept from her care.[1588]  \n\n1368 This submission must fail for three reasons. First, apart from some relatively short periods of separation \nbetween 1967 and 1969, Don and Sylvia lived together for the entire time during which the Children were wards. It \nis not open to the plaintiffs to contend that the Children could have been returned to the care of Sylvia alone.  \n\n1369 Secondly, I do not accept the submission that even if Don was frequently drunk and violent towards Sylvia, \nthat that was not a reasonable basis for keeping the Children from Sylvia's custody. The information the State \nreceived as to the occurrence of domestic violence in Don and Sylvia's relationship, which was so serious as to \nresult in physical injury to Sylvia, was clearly a consideration highly relevant to the emotional or psychological \nwelfare of the Children, simply by virtue of their being exposed to physical violence in their parents' relationship.  \n\n1370 Thirdly, the information received by the State as to Don's excessive consumption of alcohol, and his domestic \nviolence towards Sylvia, were not the sole concerns of officers of the State who considered whether Don and \nSylvia's living conditions between 1961 and 1970 were suitable for the return of the Children. Throughout that \nperiod, officers of the State observed those living conditions, and received information from third parties about other \naspects of Don and Sylvia's ability to care for the Children, which cast doubt on whether their home environment \nwas suitable for the return of the Children. I turn to deal with these considerations.  \n\nDid the State's failure to return the Children to the care of Don and Sylvia at any stage during their wardships \nconstitute a breach of fiduciary duty?\n\n1371 As I found at [569] Don and Sylvia continued to live at the humpy between 1961 and 1970, and the living \nconditions at the humpy remained largely unchanged during that period. In other words, throughout that period, Don \nand Sylvia continued to live in the same highly impoverished circumstances, and in accommodation without basic \nfacilities like electricity, water or bathroom and toilet facilities. Those conditions were not materially different from \nthe living conditions at the humpy when the Siblings were made wards.  \n\n1372 I am unable to accept the submission by counsel for the plaintiffs that between 1961 and the late 1960s (when \nthe Siblings began to return to live with Don and Sylvia), the State failed to make proper enquiries about whether \nDon and Sylvia were able to look after the Children. The evidence established that officers of the State had regard \nto Don and Sylvia's ability to look after the Children, and to the fact that one of the key factors in the Children having \nbeen taken into care namely Don and Sylvia's accommodation and living conditions \u2013 remained unchanged \nthroughout this period. The inadequacy of Don and Sylvia's living conditions for the return of the Children was noted \nin a number of reports by officers of the Child Welfare Department and Department of Native Welfare who visited \nDon and Sylvia during this period, particularly Mr WrightWebster's report of August 1962,[1589]Constable Wall's \nreport of December 1966,[1590] Mr Hill's report of April 1967,[1591] Mr Tilbrook's report of September 1967,[1592] \nMr Hill's report of January 1968,[1593] Mr Hill's report of February 1968,[1594] and Mr Moulton's report of \nSeptember 1969.[1595]  \n\n1373 In addition, during this period, the State also had information in relation to other matters which did not support \nthe return of the Children to Don and Sylvia. Between 1968 and 1969, the State received information which \nsuggested that Don and Sylvia were not able to care for their three youngest sons, as a result of the deterioration in \ntheir relationship. As I found at [639], in January 1968 Mrs Janet Hayden advised the Child Welfare Department that \nDon had left Ashley in her care after Sylvia left him.[1596] In October 1969, the Child Welfare Department received \ninformation that Joseph, Philip and Ashley were being cared for by Mrs Jean Collard, as Don was unable to look \n\n\n\nafter them and Sylvia had left him.[1597] As I found at [647], the three boys remained with Mrs Jean Collard until \nOctober 1975 when they returned to live with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n1374 A further piece of information in the State's possession which was of concern to officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment, and the Department of Native Welfare, in relation to whether the Children could return to live with their \nparents, was Don's casual employment, and periods of unemployment. At various times, departmental officers who \ninspected the Collards' living conditions, noted that Don was out of work. As I found at [651] the fact that Don was \nengaged in seasonal farm work meant that it was more likely than not that he was out of work, or between jobs, on \nat least some occasions during the year.  \n\n1375 As I found at [531] to [536], despite the existence of these concerns, between 1967 and 1969, all of the \nChildren, except Ellen and Wesley, had returned to live with Don and Sylvia in Brookton with the permission of \nofficers of the Child Welfare Department. However, after that occurred, officers of the Child Welfare Department \nreceived information which suggested that Don and Sylvia were unable to look after some of the Siblings, and that \nthey should be returned to Sister Kate's or to foster care. As I found at [453], on about 7 October 1969, Don and \nSylvia left Beverley, Glenys and Eva with Ms Jones in Brookton, which necessitated their return to foster care, and \nto Sister Kate's. Furthermore, as I found at [481] in January 1971, after Beverley, Glenys and Eva were permitted to \nspend Christmas with Don and Sylvia, officers of the Child Welfare Department received information that Don and \nSylvia had been drinking and brawling, and that the girls eventually ran away from home on 15 January 1971. (That \ninformation was consistent with other information in the State's possession at the time, namely that Don and Sylvia \nwere convicted of being drunk in public on 24 December 1970.)  \n\n1376 As I found at [999], it was not until August 1970 that Don and Sylvia obtained a SHC house in Kondinin. By \nDecember 1971, Don and Sylvia applied for the return of Wesley. As I found at [984] after an investigation of their \nliving conditions in early 1972, an officer of the Child Welfare Department reported that Don and Sylvia's home \nconditions were not suitable for the return of the Children. I found at [987] it is more likely than not that none of Don \nand Sylvia's children were living at home with their parents on a permanent basis at that time.  \n\n1377 Wesley was permitted to return to live with Don and Sylvia in September 1975, when Don and Sylvia were \nliving in a house in Kondinin. By that stage, Wesley was old enough to have decided that he no longer wished to \nlive with the Stephensons. Further, by then he was the only one of the Children (who were still wards) who was still \nliving in foster care.  \n\n1378 It cannot be said that the failure by officers of the State to return all of the Children to Don and Sylvia's care \nbefore the end of their wardships, and especially between 1961 and 1970, was so plainly unreasonable that no \nreasonable person in the same position would have failed to return the Children, having regard to the information \nwhich was in the State's possession during that period, and particularly to:    the observations of officers of the Child \nWelfare Department and the Department of Native Welfare which confirmed that Don and Sylvia continued to live at \nthe humpy, in the same impoverished conditions, until 1970;  Reports from officers of those Departments or from \nthird parties that Don, or Don and Sylvia, were drunk at various times between 1962 and 1970;  information in the \nState's possession concerning convictions incurred by Don (and, in December 1970, by Sylvia) for alcoholrelated \noffences;  Don's casual employment in seasonal farming work;  information provided to officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment (including by Sylvia herself) of incidents of domestic violence which were sufficiently serious to cause \nphysical injury to Sylvia;  information provided to officers of the Child Welfare Department which indicated that in \n1969, Don and Sylvia were unable to look after Beverley, Glenys and Eva, and that Don and Sylvia were unable to \nlook after Joseph, Philip and Ashley for several periods during 1967 1969, and during the years between 1969 and \n1975; and  observations by officers of the Child Welfare Department that in early 1972 Don and Sylvia's home \nconditions (in a house in Kondinin) were not suitable for the return of the Children.\n\n1379 The provision of this information to the State between 1962 and 1970 pointed to the conclusion that the living \nconditions which formed the basis for the order that the Siblings be made wards, continued to exist, without any \nimprovement.  \n\n1380 In so far as the Siblings are concerned, once they became old enough to leave their placements and return to \nDon and Sylvia's care of their own volition, officers of the Child Welfare Department recognised that despite their \n\n\n\nconcerns about their living conditions if they lived with Don and Sylvia, there was little that could be done to compel \nthe Siblings to return to foster or institutional care without their willing cooperation.  \n\n1381 In relation to Ellen, in addition to the information set out above, the State had an additional piece of \ninformation, namely that her childhood in foster care had been very stable. She lived with the Dwyers from the age \nof six months, had never run away or sought to return to live with Don and Sylvia, and the information available to \nthe Department suggested that she was happy and well cared for.  \n\n1382 Taking all of these matters into account, I find that it was not plainly unreasonable for the officers or \nemployees of the State not to permit the Children to return to live with Don and Sylvia at any time prior to the dates \non which approval was given for that to occur.  \n\n1383 Having regard to the considerations set out above, even if the test for a breach of a fiduciary duty in the \npresent context were what a reasonable person in the same position would have done, in my view, the outcome \nwould be no different.  \n\n(D) The State's failure to ensure the Children stayed together when they were removed from Don and Sylvia's care  \n\n1384 In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff pointed to the following matters as further aspects of the \nalleged breach by the State of its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiffs by maintaining their family \nunit:    The State determined to place the Siblings at Sister Kate's notwithstanding that it had knowledge of the \npotential adverse psychological effects of that separation on them,[1598] and without any attempt to kept the \nSiblings together while at Sister Kate's;[1599] and  The State placed the Children in placements in nonaboriginal \nfamilies, or in institutions with nonindigenous carers (that is, Sister Kate's).[1600]\n\n1385 As I understood the plaintiffs' case, the decisions or conduct of officers of the State which were the subject of \nthis alleged breach of the fiduciary duties were the decisions which were made to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's \nafter they were made wards, and the various decisions on different dates, by which Ellen and some of the other \nSiblings were placed into foster care placements with nonindigenous families (and from which it appears that the \ninference is invited that the State failed to consider an alternative placement with an aboriginal family).  \n\n1386 I am unable to accept these submissions. The Siblings were not placed at Sister Kate's by the Director. They \nhad already been placed there by Ms Jones, with Don and Sylvia's authority. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted \nthat once the Children's Court ordered that the Siblings be made wards, it was open to the State to have \ndetermined that they should be placed with their parents.[1601] Accordingly, I have understood the plaintiffs' \ncontention to be that the State determined that the Siblings should remain at Sister Kate's after they became wards, \nrather than that they should be returned to Don and Sylvia's care or placed in foster care with family members or \naboriginal families.  \n\n1387 The decisions to place some of the Children in placements in nonaboriginal families, were made by officers or \nemployees of the Child Welfare Department at the various times I have noted in the course of my factual findings \nabove.  \n\n1388 I am not persuaded that those decisions were so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker in \nthe same circumstances in 1961 would have reached the same decisions, for six reasons.  \n\n1389 First, as I found at [890], in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, there was a general awareness by officers \nof the Department of Native Welfare and the Child Welfare Department that removing children from their families \ncould have adverse psychological impacts on those children. However, the extent of that knowledge should not be \noverstated. As I found at [890], the extent of this knowledge, and of the significance of those potential adverse \nconsequences, increased gradually over the years. At the time the Children were made wards, there was clearly not \nthe same awareness of these adverse implications as might be expected of child welfare officers today. It was only \nby the 1970s that there can be seen an increasing emphasis within the Child Welfare Department on thorough \ninvestigations into the situation of a child suspected to be neglected, and on identifying the best course for the \nfuture care and protection of that child which involved minimum disruption to that child's life. Those developments \n\n\n\nmeant that applications for children to be made wards became less common, and periods of wardship became \nshorter.  \n\n1390 Secondly, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence that the State considered the \nplacement of the Siblings into foster care at any time before 1964.[1602] However, the evidence was that it had \nbeen a longstanding policy within the Child Welfare Department that where a child could be placed with a relative \nthat would be done. There was no evidence to suggest that a foster placement with a family member was an option \nin this case, at least before the mid1960s. From that time on, I note that some of the Siblings were placed with Mrs \nJean Collard (Don's sister in law) at various times. I have dealt with this point in further detail below at [1408].  \n\n1391 Thirdly, there was no evidence that between December 1961 and 1970, there was any alternative institution, \nor foster care placement, where all of the Siblings could have been placed together. The evidence of Mr Maine to \nwhich I referred at [899] above was that there were no foster placements that could have taken all of the Siblings.  \n\n1392 Fourthly, the information available to the Director included the fact that Don and Sylvia had placed the \nSiblings at Sister Kate's. The decision to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's accorded with the preference shown by \ntheir parents for that institution.  \n\n1393 Fifthly, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence that there was any acknowledgement of \nthe desirability of keeping the Siblings together in the one cottage at Sister Kate's, or to encourage interaction \nbetween the Siblings outside the cottages in which they were placed.[1603] I am unable to accept that submission. \nSister Kate's was a private institution, it was not open to the State to dictate the placement of children within the \ninstitution. Mr Maine's evidence (to which I referred at [908]) was that those placements were a matter for the \nmanager of the institution. However, as the evidence of Mr Mulroney (to which I referred at [906]) demonstrated, \nSister Kate's was one of the institutions where sibling groups could be kept together, within a cottage home \nenvironment. The evidence established that some of the Siblings were placed in the same cottages at Sister \nKate's. Donald, Darryl and Bonnie were together for much of their time at Sister Kate's and Burnbrae. Similarly, for \nmost of their time at Sister Kate's prior to 1969, Beverley, Glenys and Eva lived in the same cottage. Furthermore, \nas I found at [848] there were opportunities for the Siblings to see each other on their way to and from school, and \nduring play, while they lived at Sister Kate's.  \n\n1394 Sixthly, as I found at [895] although there was a shift in thinking within the Department of Native Welfare and \nthe Child Welfare Department between the late 1950s and the late 1970s in relation to the merits of institutional \ncare versus foster care, this change was a slow and gradual one. Although Sister Kate's was a large institution, it \nused the cottage home model, and at the time when the Siblings were made wards, that was the preferable model \nfor institutional care. As I found at [900], it was not until the early 1970s that the gradual shift in thinking moved \naway from a preference for large institutions like Sister Kate's to smaller, community based cottage homes.  \n\n1395 Even if the test for a breach of fiduciary duty in the present context were what would have been done by a \nreasonable person in the same position as the Director or the officers or employees concerned, the outcome would \nbe no different.  \n\n1396 Turning next to the decisions made by officers of the Child Welfare Department to place some of the Children \ninto foster care, when those foster care placements were not with indigenous families, there is nothing to suggest \nthat those decisions were made other than in the belief by the officers concerned that the foster care placement \nwas in the best interests of the child concerned. I am not persuaded that any one of those decisions was so plainly \nunreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have reached them, for two reasons.  \n\n1397 First, although there was some awareness on the part of officers of the Department of Native Welfare and \nChild Welfare Department, from the late 1950s, of the desirability of maintaining connections between aboriginal \nwards and their families, by placing them in foster care placements with members of their extended family or of the \naboriginal community, in preference to nonaboriginal carers, the extent of this knowledge at the time when the \nChildren were taken into care was not extensive. As I found at [939] there was no policy in the Child Welfare \nDepartment to achieve this objective until 1973, and it was not until the mid to late 1970s that the Commonwealth \n\n\n\nand State governments developed policies recognising the importance of placing aboriginal wards with extended \nfamily, or with members of the aboriginal community.  \n\n1398 Secondly, as I found at [920], there were very limited foster care placements with aboriginal families at the \ntime the Children were made wards, and this remained an issue throughout the period of the wardships.  \n\n1399 In both respects, the submission that the placement of the Children in foster placements with nonaboriginal \nfamilies constituted, or contributed to, a breach of the State's fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs is one which reflects \nexpectations drawn from contemporary child welfare policies. When the circumstances which existed in the late \n1950s and the 1960s are taken into account, as they must be, the submission that these factors contributed to a \nbreach of fiduciary duty by the State cannot be accepted.  \n\n1400 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position as the officers of the Department of \nNative Welfare and Child Welfare Department would have done in relation to foster care placements for the \nChildren, the result in my view, would be no different.  \n\n(E) The decision to apply for a maintenance order against Don in respect of the maintenance of the Children  \n\n1401 As I found at [1022] to [1023], on 13 March 1958 and 1 March 1962, orders were made by the Children's \nCourt at Brookton requiring Don to pay maintenance in respect Ellen and of the Siblings.  \n\n1402 The plaintiffs' case was that the State chose to place Ellen in foster care, and the Siblings in Sister Kate's, \nand to obtain maintenance payments from Don, rather than to leave the Children with their parents, which would \nhave enabled Don and Sylvia to spend an amount equivalent to the maintenance payments on the Children directly \nor on obtaining accommodation for their family.[1604]  \n\n1403 This submission cannot be accepted, for two reasons. First, as the orders for the payment of maintenance \nwere made by the Children's Court pursuant to the terms of the Child Welfare Act, no breach of a fiduciary duty \ncould arise from the making of those orders. Further, as I noted at [195], it was open to officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment and the Department of Native Welfare under the Child Welfare Act to make an application for an order \nfor the payment of maintenance by any near relative of a child, and was the necessary precursor for the making of \norders by the Court. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how a breach of a fiduciary duty could arise from \nany application for such an order.  \n\n1404 Secondly, and in any event, inherent in the submission by counsel for the plaintiffs was that it could be \ninferred that the payment of the maintenance made a significant difference to Don and Sylvia's ability to obtain and \nprovide a home for the Children, and thus to their prospects of securing the return of the Children to their care. The \nevidence does not permit an inference of that kind to be drawn. As I noted at [1022] to [1033], from 13 March 1958 \nuntil 1 March 1962, Don was obliged to pay 1 pound per week in maintenance for Ellen, and from 2 March 1962 \nDon was obliged to pay 6 pounds per week in maintenance for the Children. (After decimal currency was \nintroduced, this amounted to approximately $12 per week.) As I noted at [652], Don and Sylvia's evidence was that \nDon earned 'good money', or approximately $50 per week for most of the year, and approximately $80 $90 during \nthe shearing season. Because they lived in the humpy, without access to basic utilities, they also had very little in \nthe way of ordinary living expenses other than for a contribution to the rates for Bessie Ninyette's block, and the \ncost of clothing and food (at least some of which was obtained free of charge from the farms on which Don worked). \nOn the other hand, clearly Don and Sylvia lived in extremely impoverished conditions in the humpy. As I observed \nat [664] the evidence did not permit a finding to be made as to the cause of this impoverishment. The same problem \nmeans that it is not possible to make a finding that if Don had not had to pay maintenance, that he would have put \nthe same amount towards establishing and maintaining a home for his family, and that that additional modest sum \nof money per week would have enabled him to obtain a home for his family.  \n\n1405 A further impediment to accepting the submission by counsel for the plaintiffs is that it assumes that Don \nmade all of the maintenance payments required of him. As I found at [1024] Don did not always keep up to date \nwith his maintenance payments, and he served time in custody in lieu of payment of arrears of maintenance \npayments on a number of occasions.  \n\n\n\n1406 In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the decisions by officers of the Department of Native Welfare \nand the Child Welfare Department to seek an order that Don pay maintenance for Ellen, and for the Siblings, were \nso plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have acted in that way.  \n\n1407 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position as the officers would have done, the \nresult in my view, would be no different.  \n\n(F) Placement with family members or members of the aboriginal community  \n\n1408 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duties included:  [107.2] In the event that the Defendant formed \nthe view that Don and Sylvia could not adequately care for any of the Children, and that any of the Children should \nbe removed from the care of Don and Sylvia as a trustee and a fiduciary the Defendant was obliged:\n\n[107.2.1] not to fail to ascertain whether there were members of the Children's extended family, relatives or other \nmembers of the aboriginal community who could look after the Children,  \n\n[107.2.2] alternatively, not to place the Children elsewhere if there were members of the Children's extended family, \nrelatives or other members of the aboriginal Community who could look after them.  \n\n1409 The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of its fiduciary duties, the State  [108.2] failed at the time of the Respective \nDates of Committal and thereafter to ascertain whether there were members of the plaintiffs' extended family, \nrelatives or other members of the aboriginal community who could look after the Children;\n\n [108.3] failed to ensure that the foster families selected were suitable placements and thus placed the Children \nthereafter in a group home under the control of foster families which were unsuitable;\n\n [108.5] failed to take steps to avoid exposure of the Children to the risk of physical or emotional harm.\n\n1410 In his opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs initially submitted that the reference to 'suitable' \nplacements in par [108.3] of the Amended Statement of Claim meant 'safe' placements.[1605] However, later in his \nopening, he clarified his position and confirmed that the reference to 'suitable' foster families was intended to be a \nreference to non-indigenous families,[1606] and that this applied to the placement of the Siblings at Sister Kate's as \nwell as to the placement of some of the Children in foster care.[1607]  \n\n1411 I largely dealt with the plaintiffs' contentions in relation to this aspect of the fiduciary duty in the course of \ndealing with the alleged breach of the fiduciary duty to act in the plaintiffs' best interests by preserving the plaintiffs' \nfamily unit. It is necessary only to make the following additional observations.  \n\n1412 In so far as the breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the placement of the Children with nonaboriginal families \nis said to have arisen by virtue of the State's failure to consider whether indigenous foster care placements were \navailable or to place the Children with indigenous families, this allegation of a breach or breaches of duty must fail \nbecause of a lack of evidence, for three reasons. First, there was no evidence as to the considerations specifically \nundertaken by officers of the State in determining where the Children should be placed in a foster placement. The \ndocuments in evidence simply indicated that some of the Children were placed in foster placements, without \nindicating any or all of the considerations which led to the selection of that particular placement. It is not possible to \ninfer, from the absence of documents, that officers of the State did not give consideration to the availability of family \nmembers, or members of the aboriginal community, who might have been able to foster some of the Children. \nFurthermore, there was some evidence that some of the Siblings' foster carers were family members. By way of \nexample, as I noted at [482] to [483] and [437], Glenys and William lived with Mrs Jean Collard for periods of time. \nThat evidence permits the inference that when the State had information to suggest that there were family members \nwho were in a position to provide adequate care for at least some of the Children, those persons were asked to \nprovide care for them.  \n\n1413 Secondly, although it was apparent that Mr and Mrs Dwyer, and Mr and Mrs Stephenson, were not aboriginal, \nthere was no evidence in relation to whether most of the other individuals or families with whom those Siblings were \nplaced were either related to the plaintiffs, or were aboriginal people. Accordingly, other than in relation to Ellen's \n\n\n\nplacement with Mr and Mrs Dwyer, and Wesley's placement with Mr and Mrs Stephenson, it is not possible to make \nany finding that the State failed to place the Children with non-aboriginal foster carers.  \n\n1414 Thirdly, even if it could be said that the State failed to ascertain whether there were family members or \nmembers of the aboriginal community who could have fostered the Children when they were made wards, there \nwas no evidence that there were any family members (apart from Mrs Jean Collard) or members of the aboriginal \ncommunity who were in a position to foster the Children at any relevant time. Had there been family members or \nrelatives of the plaintiffs who were in a position to have fostered the Children, one would have expected the \nplaintiffs to have given evidence as to who those persons were, and if those persons were still living, one would \nhave expected those persons to be called to give evidence. At no stage did Don and Sylvia give such evidence.  \n\n1415 Accordingly, for these reasons, and for the reasons set out above at par [1396] to [1400], the plaintiffs have \nnot established that the State failed, at the time when the Children were made wards, and thereafter, to ascertain \nwhether there were members of the plaintiffs' extended family, relatives or other members of the aboriginal \ncommunity who could look after the Children, or that the State failed to place the Children with family members or \nmembers of the aboriginal community when that was an option which was open to it.  \n\n1416 Further, having regard to the evidence, and for the reasons set out above and at [1396] to [1400], I am not \nsatisfied that the decisions by officers of the Child Welfare Department and Department of Native Welfare to place \nthe Siblings at Sister Kate's, and to place Ellen and Wesley in foster care with nonindigenous families, were so \nplainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker in the same circumstances would have reached the same \ndecision.  \n\n1417 Even if the test for a breach of fiduciary duty were what a reasonable person in the same circumstances \nwould have done, the outcome in my view would be no different.  \n\n(G) Assessment and supervision of foster placements  \n\n1418 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duties included the following duties:  [107.3] As a trustee and a \nfiduciary the Defendant was obliged:\n\n[107.3.1] not to fail to ensure that any foster family selected was a placement which avoided or limited a risk of \nharm to any of the Children,  \n\n[107.3.2] alternatively, not to place the plaintiffs within foster placement which carried a risk of harm to any of the \nChildren.  [107.4] As a trustee and a fiduciary the Defendant was obliged:\n\n[107.4.1] not to fail to supervise the foster family group home into which any plaintiff was placed sufficiently to \ndetect a risk of harm to any of the Children,  \n\n[107.4.2] alternatively, not to leave the foster family group into which any plaintiff was placed unsupervised or \ninadequately supervised to detect a risk of harm to any of the Children;  [107.5] As a trustee and a fiduciary the \nDefendant was obliged:\n\n[107.5.1] not to fail to remove any of the Children from a foster home which carried a risk of harm to any of the \nChildren,  \n\n[107.5.2] alternatively, not to let any of the Children remain in a foster home which carried a risk of harm to any of \nthe Children.  \n\n1419 The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of these fiduciary duties, the State:  [108.4] failed to adequately assess \nand supervise the foster family group homes;\n\n [108.5] failed to take steps to avoid exposure of the Children to the risk of physical or emotional harm;\n\n [108.8] failed to take any reasonable steps to protect the physical and mental health of the Children.\n\n\n\n1420 At the outset it is necessary to be clear about the matters upon which the plaintiffs relied as the basis for the \nalleged breaches of the State's fiduciary duties. Initially, counsel for the plaintiffs suggested that that the Siblings \nwere required to do excessive manual labour, and were subjected to excessive physical discipline, and that this \nconstituted a breach by the State of its fiduciary duty to assess and supervise the Children in foster care.[1608] The \nevidence did not support this contention, and in closing, counsel for the plaintiffs expressly abandoned it.[1609]  \n\n1421 In his submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs made clear that the reference to 'foster family group homes' was \na reference to the cottage homes at Sister Kate's, and thus confirmed that the alleged breach of fiduciary duty to \nassess and supervise the foster family group homes pertained only to the sexual abuse suffered by Beverley and \nGlenys at Sister Kate's.[1610]  \n\n1422 To the extent that the duties alleged referred to removing the children from foster homes (other than foster \nfamily group homes), counsel for the plaintiffs did not contend that any of the Children were placed in foster homes \nwhich were unsuitable, in the sense that the Children were at risk of harm, so that the State should have removed \nthose children.[1611]  \n\n1423 However, in his opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs referred to inadequate assessment and \nsupervision of foster homes as occurring in relation to shortterm weekend and holiday placements while the \nSiblings were at Sister Kate's.[1612] He submitted that the alleged failure to take steps to protect the physical and \nmental health of the children pertained to the abuse of Beverley and Glenys during weekend and holiday care from \nSister Kate's.[1613]  \n\n1424 Accordingly, I have understood the plaintiffs' case in relation to this alleged breaches of the fiduciary duties it \nis said to have owed to pertain to the sexual abuse suffered by Beverley and Glenys which took place at Sister \nKate's, and which also occurred in the course of shortterm weekend placements while Beverley and Glenys were \nliving at Sister Kate's.  \n\n1425 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the State breached these duties by placing Beverley and Glenys in \nan institutional setting (Sister Kate's) where the effects of sexual abuse on Glenys were not observed or attended \nto,[1614] and where they were deprived of the nurturing environment of their natural parents without the provision of \nan equivalent level of care, protection and nurturing.[1615] The plaintiffs' case was that if the State had ensured that \nthe Siblings were placed in a nurturing environment, and where their welfare was monitored, Glenys' symptoms \nwould have been noticed, and attended to.  \n\n1426 Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the Director failed to comply with his statutory duty under the \nChild Welfare Act (to which I referred at [190]) to ensure that all wards were visited at least once every six months \nto ascertain whether the treatment, education and care of each ward was satisfactory.  \n\n1427 In addition, I understood the plaintiffs' case to be that the alleged breach also lay in the failure to have in \nplace any system for an assessment as to the suitability (that is, the safety) of persons with whom the Siblings \nmight be placed.  \n\n1428 I deal with each of these submissions in turn. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to consider one of the \npremises for the plaintiff's contentions, namely that Glenys manifested signs of sexual abuse while she lived at \nSister Kate's.  \n\n1429 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that 'Dr Jane Fitch notes in her report on Glenys that the effects of the \nsexual abuse on her were evident at Sister Kate's. That evidence includes chronic bed wetting and inability to eat \nsolid food.'[1616] The evidence given by Glenys at the trial as to the physical signs that she had been sexually \nabused was limited. Her evidence was that because of the sexual abuse she had difficulty eating and swallowing, \nand she particularly hated eating fish (which was what they had for dinner every Friday) because she associated it \nwith the sexual abuse she suffered.[1617] Glenys did not give evidence that she wet the bed while she was at \nSister Kate's, and I place no weight on that part of Dr Fitch's report where she relies on Glenys' bed wetting as a \nsign that she had experienced sexual abuse.  \n\n\n\n1430 However, the limited evidence gives rise to the question whether Glenys' behaviour should have alerted \nofficers of the State responsible for her care in the early 1960s to the fact that she was being sexually abused. \nThere was no evidence as to whether in the 1960s it was known whether within the body of knowledge then extant \nin relation to child welfare, or psychology that symptoms like those exhibited by Glenys were commonly seen in \nvictims of sexual abuse. Dr Fitch did not address this issue in her report, and none of the other psychologists' \nreports which were in evidence addressed the issue. At the same time, there was no evidence as to whether \nsymptoms of that kind might result from other causes, such as a child's anxiety at being separated from family, \nwhich would have been relevant to the question whether the Siblings' carers could have been expected to \nrecognise Glenys' symptoms that she had suffered sexual abuse.  \n\n1431 Having regard to Glenys' evidence, and to Dr Fitch's evidence, I accept that Glenys' difficulties in eating and \nswallowing were symptoms of the trauma she had suffered as a result of the sexual abuse she had experienced \nwhile living at Sister Kate's. However, the evidence does not permit a finding that that link was known within the \nbody of knowledge of child welfare authorities or psychologists in the 1960s, so as to permit a finding that the State \nshould have been alerted to the sexual abuse as a result of those symptoms.  \n\n1432 There was no evidence that Beverley manifested similar signs of trauma as a result of the sexual abuse she \nexperienced while she lived at Sister Kate's.  \n\nWhether there was any, or any adequate, system of supervision of the welfare of the Siblings while they were at \nSister Kate's.\n\n1433 The plaintiffs' case was that the State was under a duty to replicate an environment of the kind which the \nSiblings would have had in the care of their parents, and in which Beverley and Glenys would have had a nurturing \nfigure to whom they could report the sexual abuse or who could protect them from that sexual abuse, and that the \nState did not provide this system of supervision.  \n\n1434 In addition, the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence that the Siblings were the subject of welfare \nchecks between 1961 and 1964, and that this established that they had not been supervised as the Child Welfare \nAct required. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the records in evidence demonstrated that the State 'was at \nbest sporadic in its compliance with its statutory obligations to ascertain whether their care was satisfactory and did \nnot comply with its statutory obligations'[1618] in relation to Beverley and Glenys during the period when they were \nsexually assaulted.  \n\n1435 I am unable to accept these submissions for seven reasons.  \n\n1436 First, the Child Welfare Act required that the Director conduct checks of each ward at least once every six \nmonths to ascertain whether the treatment, education and care of each ward was satisfactory. Counsel for the \nplaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence that those checks were conducted on Beverley and Glenys prior to \nAugust 1964, and that it could therefore be inferred that no such checks were made during that period. For the \nreasons I have already set out at [780], I do not accept that that inference is open.  \n\n1437 Secondly, as I found at [759] to [761], Beverley was seen by a welfare officer or a doctor on two occasions in \n1964, on three occasions in 1965, on three occasions in 1966, on three occasions in 1967, and once in 1968 before \nshe left Sister Kate's to return to Don and Sylvia. Glenys was seen by a welfare officer or a doctor on two occasions \nin 1964, on three occasions in 1965, three occasions in 1966, on 4 occasions in 1967, on 2 occasions in 1968 and \nonce in 1969 before she left Sister Kate's to live with Don and Sylvia. This supervision was in addition to the \nimmediate supervision which Beverley and Glenys received from the staff of Sister Kate's. Neither Beverley nor \nGlenys disclosed the abuse they had suffered during these checks.  \n\n1438 Thirdly, the evidence suggested that having regard to the resources available to the Child Welfare Department \nand the Department of Native Welfare during the period up to 1968 and 1969 while Beverley and Glenys lived at \nSister Kate's, a more intensive supervision system than that which was in place could not reasonably have been \nimplemented. The evidence established that at the time when the Siblings were made wards, there were very few \npersons within the Child Welfare Department or Department of Native Welfare who had any training in psychology \nor social work. There were not sufficient staff with training of that kind to supervise all of the children in care, much \n\n\n\nless to do so on a regular basis so as to permit the development of a close relationship with each ward, in the \nmanner contemplated by the plaintiffs.  \n\n1439 Fourthly, in addition to the supervision mechanisms it implemented itself, the State was entitled to take into \naccount the fact that the welfare of the Siblings was also supervised by the staff of Sister Kate's. Moreover, the \ncottage parent system which was used at Sister Kate's was within the constraints of an institutional setting the \nresidential arrangement which most closely replicated that of a family environment for the wards who lived there. \nHowever, neither Beverley nor Glenys disclosed the sexual abuse to any of their cottage parents at Sister Kate's. \nAlthough the evidence suggested that one of their cottage parents knew the two males who had sexually abused \nBeverley and Glenys, the girls were not in the care of that cottage parent for the entire time during which they lived \nat Sister Kate's prior to 1968 and 1969. Nor did Glenys ever disclose the sexual abuse to Mrs Cross, a cottage \nmother with whom she formed a close attachment.  \n\n1440 Fifthly, the underlying premise of the plaintiffs' submission was the assumption that if the environment in \nwhich a child is placed replicates as closely as it can a family environment, the child will disclose the abuse, or \nalternatively any symptoms of abuse that the child may manifest will be identified as resulting from sexual abuse. I \ndo not accept that that is so. Even if an arrangement replicating a family environment were in place, its success in \nreplicating the intimacy of a parentchild relationship between the carer and ward would inevitably depend on \nnumerous incalculables, such as the time which would necessarily be required to build up a relationship of trust \nbetween the child and the carer, the compatibility of the personalities of the carer and the child, the extent to which \nthe child had been psychologically affected by the abuse or by the circumstances leading to the child being taken \ninto care in the first place, the circumstances in which the abuse was committed (for example, the environment of \nsecrecy or shame in which the abuse was conducted, and whether the abuser had threatened the child with \nconsequences if the abuse were to be disclosed), whether the person who committed the abuse was known to the \ncarer, and the training or qualifications of the carer to recognise the symptoms which might manifest as a result of \nsexual abuse.  \n\n1441 Sixthly, although I found that Don and Sylvia visited the Siblings regularly while they were living at Sister \nKate's prior to 1968 and 1969, neither Beverley nor Glenys disclosed to Don and Sylvia during the period of their \nwardships the fact that they had been the victims of sexual abuse.  \n\n1442 Seventhly, as I found at [716] Beverley and Glenys decided not to tell anyone about the sexual abuse they \nhad experienced while on weekend placements. In fact, the evidence suggested that they did not tell anyone about \nthe abuse they had suffered until they were adults. Having made that deliberate decision, and having not even told \ntheir parents, it is difficult to see how any system of supervision might have led them to report the abuse.  \n\nThere was no system of assessment of the carers responsible for the care of the Siblings while they lived at Sister \nKate's\n\n1443 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence of any system to assess the persons who had \nthe care of the Siblings while they lived at Sister Kate's at least up until 1964,[1619] and that it could therefore be \ninferred that there was no system for the assessment of carers. I understood that the assessment contemplated \ninvolved checks or enquiries directed to ascertaining whether the carer posed any risk to the welfare of the Siblings.  \n\n1444 I am unable to accept the plaintiffs' submission.  \n\n1445 As I found at [786] to [791] there was little evidence in relation to whether there was any system in place for \nchecking the suitability of permanent or occasional foster carers, or of the staff of institutions such as Sister Kate's. \nAs I noted at [787], Mr Maine's evidence was that the Child Welfare Department had no role to play in the selection \nof staff at institutions like Sister Kate's. Although Mr Maine confirmed that the Child Welfare Department had \nresponsibility for licensing institutions like Sister Kate's, and would have been concerned to confirm that Sister \nKate's met the basic requirements for satisfactory care of the children who lived there, and that an institutions \nofficers within the Department was required to visit all of the institutions licensed by the Department, there was no \nsuggestion in his evidence that such oversight extended to assessing and checking staff or weekend carer in the \nmanner contemplated. Having regard to the evidence, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that no checks or \n\n\n\nenquiries were carried out by officers of the Child Welfare Department or Department of Native Welfare in relation \nto whether the staff of institutions like Sister Kate's, or of weekend or occasional carers who were engaged by the \nstaff of Sister Kate's, posed any risk to the welfare of the Children who lived at Sister Kate's.  \n\n1446 Although Mrs Patullo gave some evidence about her understanding of how the suitability of weekend carers \nwas assessed at Sister Kate's, I found at [788] that her evidence did not permit conclusions to be drawn as to what \nchecks (if any) were conducted by the staff responsible for the management of Sister Kate's. The dearth of \nevidence means that it is not possible to make a finding that no checks of the staff of Sister Kate's, or of weekend \nor occasional carers, were carried out by those responsible for the management of Sister Kate's.  \n\n1447 More to the point for present purposes, however, there was no evidence as to what checks or assessments \ncould have been conducted in the early 1960s. For example, there was no evidence as to whether criminal record \nchecks of the kind which are now commonly carried out in the workforce were able to be obtained in the early \n1960s. Furthermore, there was no evidence that even if a system of checking or assessment of staff or carers had \nbeen in place for example, a criminal record check, or referee checks that such a system would have identified the \nrisk that the Siblings might have been exposed to sexual abuse, so as to have enabled the State to take steps to \nprotect the Siblings from that risk. There was no evidence, for example, as to whether any of the persons who \nassaulted Beverley and Glenys had any criminal record, or any history of sexual offending of any kind.  \n\n1448 I am not persuaded that the approach taken by officers of the Child Welfare Department in relation to the \nsupervision of the staff of, or carers engaged by Sister Kate's, or in relation to the welfare of the Children more \ngenerally while they were at Sister Kate's was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have \nadopted the same approach.  \n\n1449 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position as the officers of the Child Welfare \nDepartment would have done, I am not persuaded having regard to the matters set out above that the result of that \ntest would be any different.  \n\n(H) Facilitate contact between the Children and Don and Sylvia, and members of their extended family or members \nof the aboriginal community  \n\n1450 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duty included:  [107.6] As a trustee and a fiduciary the \nDefendant was obliged:\n\n[107.6.1] not to fail to take adequate steps to facilitate contact between the Children and the Children' parents, Don \nand Sylvia,  \n\n[107.6.2] alternatively, not fail to facilitate contact between the Children and Don and Sylvia.  [107.7] As a trustee \nand a fiduciary the Defendant was obliged not to fail to take adequate steps to facilitate contact between the \nChildren and members of the Children's extended family or other members of the aboriginal community.\n\n1451 The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of its fiduciary duty, the State:  [108.5] failed to take steps to avoid \nexposure of the Children to the risk of physical or emotional harm;\n\n [108.6] failed to take any or any adequate steps to facilitate contact between the Children and Don and Sylvia;\n\n [108.7] failed to take any or any adequate steps to facilitate contact between the Children and the members of the \nplaintiffs' extended family or other members of the aboriginal community.\n\n1452 Counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed that the reference to 'extended family and other members of the aboriginal \ncommunity' in relation to the breach alleged in [108.7] of the Amended Statement of Claim was intended to mean \ngrandparents, uncles and aunts and cousins.[1620]  \n\n1453 In his written closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the State breached these duties \nbecause Don and Sylvia's attempts to visit the Siblings at Sister Kate's were often frustrated and their visits were \nnot facilitated by the staff at Sister Kate's.[1621]  \n\n1454 I am unable to accept the plaintiffs' case in respect of this alleged breach of fiduciary duty, for four reasons.  \n\n\n\n1455 First, as I noted at [793] to [794], the policy of Sister Kate's during the period when the Siblings lived in the \n1960s appears to have been that weekend leave and visits by family were allowed once a month, and that this was \nnot out of the ordinary for institutions of the kind at the time. I found at [829] that while the Siblings were living at \nSister Kate's, Don and Sylvia visited regularly, sometimes as often as every few weeks, but otherwise at least once \nevery month or two, and that sometimes other relatives, such as the Siblings' grandparents, visited as well. I also \nfound (at [830]) that there was no evidence to suggest that the staff of Sister Kate's or any officer of the Child \nWelfare Department or Department of Native Welfare, sought to make it more difficult to Don and Sylvia to visit the \nSiblings, or to discourage their visits.  \n\n1456 In other words, the evidence established that the policy at Sister Kate's in relation to family visits for wards \ndoes not appear to have been out of the ordinary for the time, that Don and Sylvia visited on a regular basis, and \ntheir visits were not prohibited or discouraged by the staff of Sister Kate's, or by any officer of the Child Welfare \nDepartment or Department of Native Welfare. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the State failed \nto facilitate contact between the Children and their extended family or other members of the aboriginal community. \nMembers of the Children's extended family (such as their grandparents) did visit them, and there was no evidence \nthat they were restricted in visiting when they wished to do so.  \n\n1457 Secondly, I found at [815] that until Ellen was about four years old, Don and Sylvia were able to visit her by \narrangement with the Department of Native Welfare, provided that they gave the Department some prior notice so \nthat it could arrange the visit. I also found that once Don and Sylvia found out where Ellen was living, the Dwyers \ndid not prevent Don and Sylvia from visiting Ellen at their home. I found (at [816]) that officers of the Department of \nNative Welfare and the Child Welfare Department did not impede contact between Ellen and Don and Sylvia, or the \nother members of her family.  \n\n1458 To the extent that Don and Sylvia were required to visit Sister Kate's at certain times, or to telephone in \nadvance of a visit either to Sister Kate's or to see Ellen (before she was four years old) I am not persuaded that \nthose requirements constituted unreasonable restrictions on Don and Sylvia's ability to see the Children. As I noted \nat [830], prior notice permitted the staff of Sister Kate's to ensure that the Siblings would be at Sister Kate's at the \ntime of their parents' visit. Similarly, in the early years of Ellen's wardship, prior notice of a visit by Don and Sylvia \nwas required to enable staff of the Department of Native Welfare to arrange for Ellen to be collected from the \nDwyers and taken to meet with Don and Sylvia.  \n\n1459 It is also not difficult to envisage the good sense from the perspective of the welfare of a child ward of a \nrequirement for prior notice of a visit by a ward's parents or for visits at particular times. Such arrangements would \nundoubtedly have served to ensure certainty for the child involved, avoiding disappointment and distress to the \nchild, for example as a result of unmet expectations if the parents did not attend during the usual visiting hours, or \nif the parents visited at a time when the child was out so that the child missed seeing them.  \n\n1460 Thirdly, when viewed in the context of the knowledge of the time, I am not persuaded that the State should \nhave facilitated more contact between Don and Sylvia, and the Children. This is another aspect of the case in which \nit is important to assess the facts not by reference to contemporary standards, but by reference to the knowledge \nand understanding in the 1950s and 1960s of the psychological implications of foster or institutional care. As I noted \nat [890], during the 1950s and 1960s the staff of the Child Welfare Department had some awareness of the \nimportance of maintaining a relationship between a child in foster care, and the child's biological parents, and the \nimportance of encouraging visits to promote that relationship. However, the degree of understanding by staff of the \nimportance of that connection increased over time.  \n\n1461 Fourthly, it was not entirely clear whether this aspect of the plaintiffs' case relied on a claim by the plaintiffs \nthat Don and Sylvia were denied home visits by the Siblings. For completeness, I should indicate that I am not \npersuaded that the State failed to facilitate contact between Don and Sylvia by refusing their requests for home \nvisits by the Siblings. As I noted at [967] to [972], Don and Sylvia requested the return of the Siblings for Christmas \non two occasions, and in each case the decision whether to permit the visit was made by reference to the \nconditions in which Don and Sylvia were then living.  \n\n\n\n1462 I am not persuaded that the approach generally taken, or any decision made, by officers of those departments \nin relation to the contact between the Children and Don and Sylvia, or with their extended family, or with members \nof the aboriginal community, was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have reached the \nsame view.  \n\n1463 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position as the departmental officers would have \ndone, I am not persuaded having regard to the matters set out above \u2013 that the outcome of that test would have \nbeen any different.  \n\n(I) Protect the Children's physical and mental health  \n\n1464 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duty included:  [107.8] As a trustee and a fiduciary the \nDefendant was obliged:\n\n[107.8.1] not to fail to take reasonable steps to protect the physical and mental health of the Children,  \n\n[107.8.2] alternatively, not to disregard the physical or mental health of the Children;  \n\n1465 The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of its fiduciary duty, the State:  [108.5] failed to take steps to avoid \nexposure of the Children to the risk of physical or emotional harm;\n\n [108.8] failed to take any reasonable steps to protect the physical and mental health of the Children.\n\n1466 It was not entirely clear how this aspect of the plaintiffs' pleading was relied upon by the plaintiffs. In his \nopening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs indicated that the plaintiffs did not rely on par [108.5] of the Amended \nStatement of Claim as asserting an independent breach of duty.[1622]  \n\n1467 However, elsewhere in his opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the alleged failure of \nthe State to take reasonable steps to protect the physical and mental health of the Children pertained to the \nplacement of the children in weekend and holiday care during their time at Sister Kate's.[1623] In that respect, the \nalleged breach was said to relate to the harm alleged suffered by Beverley and Glenys when they were the victims \nof sexual abuse during these placements.[1624] The alleged breach lay in the failure to have in place any system \nfor making any assessment as to the suitability (that is, the safety) of persons with whom the Siblings might be \nplaced for a weekend or holiday placement.[1625]  \n\n1468 In his written closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs also appeared to rely on the following matters as \nsupporting the alleged breach by the State of the duty to protect the physical and mental health of the Children:    \nThe decision to remove Ellen, to maintain her separation from Don and Sylvia and to maintain that \nseparation;[1626]  The failure to return Ellen to Don and Sylvia's care, notwithstanding departmental \nrecommendations that Ellen should be returned, and on the basis of an allegation of gambling by Sylvia, the \naccuracy of which, and the impact of which on Ellen's welfare, was not investigated;[1627]  The State's decision to \nforcibly separate and maintain the separation of the Siblings from Don and Sylvia.[1628]  The State's removal of the \nChildren from Don and Sylvia notwithstanding knowledge of the potential adverse effects of doing so;[1629]  The \nState's placement of the Siblings at Sister Kate's, which involved their separation;[1630]  Placement of Beverley \nand Glenys in an institutional setting (Sister Kate's) where:     the effects of sexual abuse on Glenys were not \nobserved or attended to;[1631]   they were deprived of the nurturing environment of their natural parents and lived \nin an environment where they were deprived of an equivalent level of care, protection and nurturing.[1632]      The \nloss of culture which the Children suffered as a result of their separation from Don and Sylvia, and their placement \nwith nonaboriginal families.[1633]\n\n1469 The discussion of these other alleged breaches (above) adequately addresses the matters relied upon to \nestablish of the alleged breach of duty by the State in failing to avoid exposure of the Children to the risk of physical \nor mental harm, and the alleged failure to take reasonable steps to protect the Children from such harm.  \n\n1470 For completeness, however, there is a further matter with which I should deal. In his written closing \nsubmissions counsel for the plaintiffs dealt with 'Noncompliance with statutory duty under the Child Welfare Act \n1947 (WA)'.[1634] Under that heading, he noted that the Child Welfare Act required the Director to cause all wards \nto be visited at least once every six months, by an officer of the Department or a person appointed for that person \nby the Director, to ascertain whether the treatment, education and care of the child was satisfactory. Counsel then \n\n\n\nset out list of the occasions on which the Children were seen during their wardships. I have already dealt with \ncounsel's submissions on this issue, in relation to Beverley and Glenys and the allegations pertaining to their sexual \nassaults. However, in addition, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the evidence established that the Child \nWelfare Department did not comply with its statutory obligations in relation to Ellen (for the period between 30 \nSeptember 1958 and 3 June 1960, and between 3 June 1960 and 15 September 1964) in relation to Bonnie (for the \nperiod from 8 December 1961 to 3 January 1968) and in relation to Darryl, the plaintiffs' counsel submitted that he \nwas not seen at all, but was only reported on between 2 October 1969 and 24 February 1970.  \n\n1471 The purpose to which these submissions were directed was not clear from counsel's written submissions. In \nhis closing oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the failure by the State to check on the \nChildren (other than Beverley and Glenys, in their early years at Sister Kate's) every six months 'wouldn't result in \nany breach in relation to them'.[1635] However, it was not clear whether this submission was directed to the \nquestion whether the Children suffered any harm as a result of an alleged failure to adequately supervise \nthem.[1636]  \n\n1472 Given this uncertainty, and in case counsel for the plaintiffs had intended to claim that the State breached a \nfiduciary duty to take reasonable steps to protect the Children from physical and mental harm by failing to visit \nthem at least once every six months, as required by the Child Welfare Act, it is appropriate for me to deal with that \nclaim. I do not accept that that claim is made out, for three reasons.  \n\n1473 First, for present purposes, the statutory requirement to visit each ward once every six months should be \nunderstood as a reflection of the Parliament's intention that wards should be regularly monitored to ensure that their \ntreatment, education and care was satisfactory. A failure to ensure that these six monthly inspections were \nconducted could not, of itself, constitute a failure by the State to take reasonable steps to protect the physical and \nmental health of the Children. An inperson meeting with a ward would be one important means, but not the only \nmeans, by which a guardian could ascertain whether a ward's physical and mental needs were being met.  \n\n1474 Secondly, at [751] I set out my findings in relation to the occasions on which the Children were seen, either by \nwelfare officers, or doctors. It is clear that not all of the Children were seen at least once every six months in every \nyear of their wardships. However, for the reasons explained above at [780] the absence of records for the period \nbetween 1961 and 1964 in respect of the Children does not permit the conclusion to be drawn that no inspections \nwere conducted during this period. After 1964, the evidence established that generally speaking while they lived in \ninstitutional or foster care the Children were seen regularly, and in most cases, were seen approximately every six \nmonths. The occasions on which they were seen are set out in [751] to [778].  \n\n1475 Thirdly, the evidence of Mr Maine, and of the other welfare officers which I noted above at [750], confirmed \nthat sometimes staff shortages, and the demands of more urgent cases, meant that it was not possible to ensure \nthat welfare checks were conducted for all wards at least every six months. Those resourcing issues must be borne \nin mind in assessing the reasonableness of the conduct of the officers and agents of the State.  \n\n1476 I am not persuaded that the approach taken by officers of the Child Welfare Department of Department of \nNative Welfare in relation to welfare checks on the Children, having regard to the available resources of those \nDepartments, and in all of the circumstances (including the age of the Children, and where they were living at \nvarious times) was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have acted in the same way.  \n\n1477 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position would have done, I am not persuaded \nthat the outcome of that test would be any different.  \n\n(J) Avoid a conflict between the State's interest in housing the Children in a facility readily available to the State and \nthe Children's interest in being provided in a home environment with their family or the aboriginal community  \n\n1478 The plaintiffs alleged that the State's fiduciary duty included:  [107.9] As a trustee and a fiduciary the \nDefendant was obliged not to put itself into a conflict between its interest in housing the Children in a facility or \nhome readily or conveniently available to the State and the Children's interest in being provided with a home \nenvironment:\n\n[107.9.1] within the family unit of their natural parents and siblings;  \n\n\n\n[107.9.2] within the aboriginal community; and  \n\n[107.9.3] which contributed, in a balanced way, to a consistent cultural up-bringing, and to their mental wellbeing \nand physical safety.  \n\n1479 The plaintiffs alleged that in breach of its fiduciary duty, the State:  [108.9] preferred its interest in housing the \nChildren in preference to the Children' interests;\n\n [108.10] sought from Don the Maintenance Payment instead of, and at the expense of, assisting Don to become \nable to support the Children within the family unit.\n\n1480 In his opening submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the essence of this alleged breach was \nthat the State had an interest in housing the Children in facilities such as Sister Kate's which were readily and \nconveniently available to it, as opposed to an interest in providing them with a home environment within their family \nunit or within the aboriginal community.[1637]  \n\n1481 I do not accept that the State had any conflict of interest in relation to housing the Children. For the reasons I \nhave already outlined, when the Siblings were made wards, the Director had to determine where they should live, \nand clearly gave consideration to the recommendation made by the Children's Court, to the fact that placement of \nthe Siblings at Sister Kate's complied with Don and Sylvia's wishes that they live there, and to the fact that the \nSiblings' continued residence at Sister Kate's would enable them all to live in the one institution. Implicit in the \nplaintiffs' case is the contention that there were other accommodation options open to the State, apart from the \nSiblings' continued residence at Sister Kate's. There was no evidence that that was so, much less that it was in the \nState's interest to accommodate the Siblings at Sister Kate's rather than in some other alternative accommodation, \nso that it might be said that the State was in a position of a conflict between its interest and its duty to the interests \nof the Siblings.  \n\n1482 As I noted above, the decision to leave the Siblings at Sister Kate's was not so unreasonable that no \nreasonable decision maker would have acted in the same way.  \n\n1483 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position would have done, I am not persuaded \nthat the result would have been any different.  \n\n1484 In so far as the collection of maintenance payments is concerned, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that this \nwas a 'subset' of the claim under [108.9] of the Amended Statement of Claim that the State acted with a conflict of \ninterest.[1638] The plaintiffs' case was that the State chose to place the Siblings in Sister Kate's and obtain \nmaintenance payments from Don, rather than to leave them with their parents, which would have enabled Don and \nSylvia to spend an amount equivalent to the maintenance payments on the Children directly.[1639]  \n\n1485 I dealt with the plaintiffs' contentions in relation to the payment of maintenance by Don at [1402] to [1405]. I do \nnot accept that the State was in a position of a conflict of interest when its officers or agents sought that the Court \nmake an order for the payment of maintenance from Don. If that were so, the State would have had a conflict of \ninterest in every case in which it sought a maintenance payment in respect of a child ward, because in every case \nthe making of such an order would be to the State's financial advantage (however miniscule that advantage might \nbe within the context of the State's fiscal position overall). Furthermore, when an application for a maintenance \norder is expressly permitted by the Child Welfare Act I do not accept that such an application could be capable of \ngiving rise to a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by the State by virtue of a conflict between the State's interest in \nobtaining the order and any duty to act in the interests of a ward.  \n\n1486 For these reasons, and those set out at [1401] to [1407], I am not persuaded that the decisions by officers of \nthe Child Welfare Department or the Department of Native Welfare to seek an order that Don pay maintenance for \nEllen, and for the Siblings, were so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have acted in \nthat way.  \n\n1487 Even if the test were what a reasonable person in the same position would have done, the result would be no \ndifferent.  \n\n\n\n6. THE SECONDARY FIDUCIARY DUTIES  \n\n1488 The plaintiffs allege that the State owes them secondary fiduciary duties of two kinds: first, a continuing duty \nto which I will refer, in shorthand, as a duty to obtain legal advice for the plaintiffs, and secondly, a continuing duty \nto which I will refer, in shorthand, as a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to the \nplaintiffs. For the reasons set out below, the plaintiffs' case in respect of the existence of each of these secondary \nfiduciary duties fails.  \n\n1489 In this section of my reasons, I deal with the following matters:  \n\n(a) the plaintiffs' pleading in relation to the fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice for the plaintiffs;  \n\n(b) whether the duty to obtain legal advice for the plaintiffs is a fiduciary duty;  \n\n(c) whether the duty to obtain legal advice is a continuing duty;  \n\n(d) the plaintiffs' pleading in relation to the duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to \nthe plaintiffs;  \n\n(e) whether a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to the plaintiffs is a fiduciary \nduty;  \n\n(f) whether that duty is a continuing duty.  \n\n(a) The plaintiffs' pleading in relation to the fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice for the plaintiffs  \n\n1490 The plaintiffs pleaded that until they obtained independent legal advice about the State's possible breach of \nthe primary fiduciary duties, they could not reasonably have discovered that they had suffered loss and damage, \nthat such loss and damage was causally connected with the events pleaded, or that they had open to each of them \na cause of action against the State for loss and damage.[1640]  \n\n1491 The plaintiffs pleaded that 'by reason of the matters pleaded herein' (which appears to encompass all of the \npleaded bases for the State's alleged duties as a fiduciary) the State  owed and continues to owe duties to advise \nthe plaintiffs as to their rights and entitlements, including their right to enforce compensation for breach of a \nfiduciary obligation against [the State] and to obtain for the plaintiffs independent legal representation or advice, or \nfor advice for the plaintiffs to seek independent legal advice regarding [the State's] liability to the plaintiffs or their \nentitlement to compensation or damages.[1641]\n\n1492 The State denied that the plaintiffs could not reasonably have discovered that any of them had suffered loss \nand damage or that they had a cause of action against the State, without obtaining independent legal \nadvice.[1642]The State also denied that it was under any obligation to advise the plaintiffs of their rights and \nentitlements or to obtain independent legal representation or advice for them.[1643]  \n\n1493 The plaintiffs claimed that this fiduciary duty continued after the termination of the wardships. I deal with that \naspect of the claim below.  \n\n(b) Whether the duty to obtain legal advice is a fiduciary duty  \n\n1494 The plaintiffs relied on the decision in Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare[1644] as supporting their \nclaim that the State was (and remains) under a fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice for them. However, the decision \nof the High Court in Bennett did not establish that the Minister had acted in breach of a fiduciary duty to obtain legal \nadvice for a beneficiary. Nevertheless, for the reasons outlined below, I accept that a fiduciary may in some \ncircumstances be under a duty to advise a beneficiary to obtain independent legal advice, or to obtain legal advice \nfor a beneficiary and that that may be characterised as a fiduciary duty.  \n\nThe decisions at first instance, and on appeal, in Bennett\n\n1495 Some of the references in the judgment at first instance in Bennett v Minister for Community Welfare suggest \nthat the trial judge found that there existed a fiduciary duty to obtain independent legal advice. Nicholson J found \nthat the Director of Community Welfare and Mr Bennett were in a relationship of guardian and ward, and went on to \nobserve that  the Director owed a fiduciary duty to him; that included in that duty was the obligation to assert rights \non his behalf; that in relation to a possible action for negligence arising from the accident in the premises occupied \nby the guardian, the guardian was in a position of conflict with the plaintiff; and that being in such position it was the \nduty of the guardian to obtain for the plaintiff independent advice.[1645]\n\n\n\n1496 On closer analysis, however, an alternative understanding of his Honour's observation is open, namely that \nNicholson J found that the Director owed Mr Bennett a common law duty care of care as an incident of the \nexistence of that fiduciary relationship. His Honour described the action brought by Mr Bennett as a claim for \ndamages for negligence in breach of that duty of care,[1646] his reasons disclose the application of orthodox \nprinciples in relation to an action for negligence,[1647] and his Honour concluded that the Minister was not liable to \nMr Bennett because the Director's breach of the duty of care was broken by the act of Mr Bennett in seeking and \nobtaining independent advice.[1648]  \n\n1497 In any event, by the time Bennett was appealed the case was approached as an action in negligence, the \nissue on the appeals being whether the causal link between the Director's breach of his common law duty of care, \nand Mr Bennett's damage (namely loss of the opportunity to sue) was broken when Mr Bennett obtained his own \nlegal advice (which was to the effect that he had no cause of action) and acted upon that advice. The matter was \ndealt with on that basis by the Full Court of the Supreme Court,[1649] and the High Court.[1650]  \n\nWhether a duty to obtain legal advice may be characterised as a fiduciary duty\n\n1498 There have, however, been some suggestions in the authorities that a duty to obtain legal advice for a \nbeneficiary may be a fiduciary duty. Some of the members of the High Court in Bennett observed, by way of obiter \ndicta, that although the action was not one for a breach of a fiduciary duty, the Director was subject to a fiduciary \nduty to obtain independent legal advice for Mr Bennett. Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ observed:[1651]  In the \ncourts below, the duty of care appears to have been equated to, even derived from, a fiduciary duty owed by the \nDirector to the appellant arising out of his statutory office as guardian. That fiduciary duty was a positive duty to \nobtain independent legal advice with respect to the possible existence of a cause of action on the part of the \nappellant ... .\n\n ... The common law duty of care arose independently of the fiduciary duty which in no way displaced, qualified or \nderogated from the common law duty.\n\n1499 McHugh J also observed that Mr Bennett may have had an action for a breach of a fiduciary duty:[1652]  \nHaving regard to his Honour's finding that the Minister was in breach of a fiduciary duty, it might have been thought \nthat the action of the appellant was one brought in the exclusive equitable jurisdiction 'to enforce compensation for \nbreach of a fiduciary obligation'. If that jurisdiction had been invoked, there would be much to be said for the view \nthat the Minister could not escape liability to compensate the appellant even if the receipt of the legal advice by the \nappellant in 1976 constituted a novus actus interveniens. ... \n\n However, the case for the appellant was pleaded as an action for damages for common law negligence and not for \nequitable compensation. Moreover, notwithstanding the reference by Nicholson J to a breach of fiduciary duty, his \nHonour decided the case on the basis that it was one involving a claim for damages for breach of a common law \nduty of care.'\n\n1500 In Trevorrow the trial judge held that the APB was under a fiduciary duty to obtain independent legal advice \nfor Mr Trevorrow.[1653] However, the Full Court disagreed that the APB was under any such fiduciary duty.[1654]  \n\n1501 Finally, in Westpac Banking Corporation v Bell Group Ltd (in liq) (No 3)[1655] Lee AJA, in discussing \nprescriptive obligations that may be imposed on fiduciaries, observed that the duty to obtain legal advice which was \nreferred to in Bennett was a duty that 'reflected the core of that fiduciary relationship, namely, that the director, as \nguardian, loyally protect and serve the interests of the ward. It was an obligation of such importance to the fiduciary \nrelationship that it was proper to regard it as a fiduciary duty'.  \n\n1502 If the duty to obtain legal advice for a beneficiary were to be characterised as a fiduciary duty the basis for that \ncharacterisation would appear to be that the duty is an incident of the duty to avoid a conflict between the fiduciary's \nselfinterest and his or her duty to act on behalf of, and in the interests of, the beneficiary, rather than to characterise \nthe duty as a discrete fiduciary duty.  \n\n\n\n1503 It is not necessary for present purposes to determine if the duty to obtain legal advice is a fiduciary duty \nbecause I am not persuaded that the State was obliged to obtain independent legal advice for the plaintiffs in this \ncase.  \n\nWhy the State was not obliged to obtain independent legal advice for the plaintiffs in this case\n\n1504 In my view, the State was not obliged to obtain independent legal advice for the plaintiffs for five reasons.  \n\n1505 First, for the reasons I have already given, the State was not in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs.  \n\n1506 Secondly, even if the State was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, an obligation to obtain \nindependent legal advice for the plaintiffs could only have been imposed on the State in the event that \ncircumstances arose where its duty of loyalty to the plaintiffs required that legal advice to be obtained. The plaintiffs' \nclaim is that the State became subject to this obligation to obtain independent legal advice for the plaintiffs when it \nwas in breach, or potentially in breach, of the primary fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs. (I do not understand the \nplaintiff's case to be that the State's obligation to obtain independent legal advice, consequent on its fiduciary duty \nto the plaintiffs, arose because of a breach by the State of a coexisting common law duty of care to the plaintiffs.) \nFor the reasons I have already given, the State was not subject to a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs in respect of any \nof the primary fiduciary duties alleged by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the State did not become obliged to obtain legal \nadvice to avoid any possible conflict between its selfinterest and its duty to act in the plaintiffs' interests.[1656]  \n\n1507 Thirdly, even if the State was subject to the primary fiduciary duties, the plaintiffs' case is that the duty to \nobtain legal advice arose when the State could reasonably have known that damage had been suffered by the \nChildren as a result of being placed into State care. The plaintiffs' case is that the State should have had in place a \nsystem for supervision of the Children which would have resulted in the State identifying that the Children were \nsuffering harm.[1657] For the reasons set out in [716] to [717], I am not persuaded that the plaintiffs have \nestablished that aspect of their case.  \n\n1508 Fourthly, the imposition of a fiduciary obligation to obtain independent legal advice in this situation would be \nan absurd outcome, having regard to the statutory framework and circumstances.  \n\n1509 It would be an absurd outcome if the State were required to obtain legal advice for the Children in respect of \nthe consequences of their being made wards, and at least initially in respect of the decision that the Siblings should \nlive at Sister Kate's, in circumstances where the decision to make them wards was made by the Children's Court \npursuant to the Child Welfare Act, and where the Siblings resided at Sister Kate's in compliance with a \nrecommendation of the Children's Court. The Full Court in Trevorrow relied upon a similar 'oddity' about the \nproposed duty to obtain independent legal advice in that case.[1658]  \n\n1510 Fifthly, even if the State was under a fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice for the Children in respect of a \npossible breach by the State of its primary fiduciary duties to the Children, there could only ever be a breach of that \nduty if the State had breached the primary fiduciary duties in the first place. Counsel for the plaintiffs accepted that \nthat was so.[1659] For the reasons outlined above, there was no breach of those primary fiduciary duties, save in \nrespect of the decision of the Commissioner in November 1959 that Ellen should not be returned to Don and \nSylvia's care, on the basis of the allegation that Sylvia had been gambling heavily. However, that decision was \nsuperseded by the Commissioner's decision in December 1959 that Ellen should not be returned to Don and \nSylvia's care, having regard to other information, including Don and Sylvia's living conditions.  \n\n(c) Whether the duty to obtain legal advice is a continuing duty  \n\n1511 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the duty to obtain legal advice was a 'continuing' duty \u2013 that is, that \nthe State continued to be subject to that duty notwithstanding the expiration of the wardships and the termination of \nany fiduciary relationship in that sense. The plaintiffs' case was that the duty continued until the commencement of \nany litigation on behalf of the plaintiffs. He conceded that he had no authority for that proposition:  ultimately what \nwe say is that it's an equity of the statute sort of argument, that the State can't say we no longer have liability \nbecause we wish to rely on the statute of limitations and you've run out of time, where if they had carried out their \nduty then we would have had a remedy.[1660]\n\n1512 Counsel for the plaintiffs also conceded that  in a case like this there's a certain amount of bootstraps or \ncircularity about the argument. ... The harm that we are pleading is the harm in the carrying out of the guardianship \n\n\n\nrelationship and it really boils down to the failure to properly inquire and take into account the impact which \nseparation from natural parents would have upon these children by the act of separating them, the application for \nthe committal of these children. So that's the harm, that's the cause of action. That cause of action remains. You \nthen have the duty as part of that fiduciary relationship to advise [of] that cause of action, which didn't occur.[1661]\n\n1513 I am unable to see how the fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice (if it existed in the first place) could be \nregarded as a continuing duty, which endured long past the time when the wardships came to an end, and which \ncontinued to apply to the State until this litigation commenced in 2010. The argument was clearly intended to \nbypass limitation defences. While that may be the explanation for the argument, I am unable to see any principled \njustification for the conclusion that a fiduciary duty continues long past the time when the fiduciary relationship itself \ncomes to an end.  \n\n1514 That is not to say, of course, that no consequences can flow for the breach of a fiduciary duty after a fiduciary \nrelationship has ended. Whether there is a continuing right to obtain a remedy in respect of the breach of a fiduciary \nduty will depend upon the application of any limitation statutes which may apply. In fact, at various stages in the \nargument, it appeared that when counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a 'continuing duty' what he appeared to be \nreferring to was an argument that no limitation period applied to the breach of the fiduciary duties the plaintiffs \nalleged.[1662] I deal with that argument later in these reasons.  \n\n(d) The plaintiffs' pleading in relation to the duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to \nthe plaintiffs  \n\n1515 The plaintiffs plead that  on the termination of the wardships and thereafter the State continued to owe a duty \nto the Children to take all reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss and damage to the plaintiffs \narising out of the breaches of its duties as trustee alternatively its fiduciary duty occurring during the period of the \nwardships.[1663]\n\n1516 The plaintiffs plead that  such reasonable steps included providing the plaintiffs with appropriate education, \ncounselling, psychiatric treatment and access to independent legal advice of the Children's rights arising from their \ncommittals.[1664]\n\n1517 Having already dealt with the continuing duty to obtain legal advice, in the balance of this section of my \nreasons, when I discuss the duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss, I mean to refer to \nthe provision of education, counselling and psychiatric treatment to the plaintiffs.  \n\n1518 The State denies these allegations.  \n\n(e) Whether a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to the plaintiffs is a fiduciary duty  \n\n1519 For the reasons I have already given, I do not accept that the State was subject to a continuing fiduciary duty \nto avoid the occurrence of further loss and damage to the plaintiffs.  \n\n1520 Furthermore, I accept the submission of counsel for the State that this secondary fiduciary duty is of a novel \nkind, for which there was no authority. No sound basis in precedent or principle was advanced by the plaintiffs to \nsupport the conclusion that a breach of a fiduciary duty can, of itself, give rise to a new fiduciary duty to provide \nservices that would ameliorate the adverse effects of that breach. For a fiduciary duty to arise in that way would be \ninconsistent with the authorities which establish that the undertaking by the fiduciary of a duty to act for or on behalf \nof another person, in the interests of that other person, is essential to establish the existence of a fiduciary duty.  \n\n1521 Quite apart from these impediments to establishing the existence of a secondary fiduciary duty of the kind \nalleged, the plaintiffs did not establish that the State had failed to do what the plaintiffs contended it should have, \nnamely to provide any, or any adequate, education, counselling or psychiatric treatment to the plaintiffs. There was \nno evidence that the State had failed to provide the plaintiffs with education, counselling or psychiatric treatment. In \nso far as the question of education is concerned, there was, however, evidence that each of the Children had \nattended school so long as they were willing to do so, and all undertook at least some years of high school. Glenys \nand Ellen have undertaken tertiary education.[1665]  \n\n1522 In so far as the question of counselling or psychiatric treatment is concerned, I take judicial notice of the fact \nthat a public health system operates in Western Australia, and treatment for psychiatric injuries can be obtained \n\n\n\nthrough that system. In addition, there was evidence that some of the plaintiffs Beverley,[1666] Glenys[1667] and \nEllen[1668] have obtained counselling or psychiatric treatment. That is not to say that I do not accept that the \nplaintiffs would benefit from further counselling or psychiatric treatment. The expert evidence clearly established \nthat that was so. The point for present purposes is that the plaintiffs did not establish that the State failed to provide \nthem with the treatment they required.  \n\n7. OTHER DEFENCES AND LACHES  \n\n(a) The State's additional defences  \n\n1523 Apart from its denial of the existence of a fiduciary duty or of any breach of such a duty, the State relied on a \nnumber of other defences. Given the other conclusions I have reached, these additional defences can be dealt with \nvery briefly. The State pleaded that the plaintiffs either have no right of action against it, or that the plaintiffs are \nprecluded from obtaining any relief against it, because the plaintiffs have failed to comply with the requirements of \nthe Crown Suits Act 1947. For the reasons set out below, I accept that this is so.  \n\n1524 Alternatively, the State says that the plaintiffs precluded from obtaining the relief sought because the limitation \nperiods under the Limitation Act 1935 (WA) or the Crown Suits Act 1947 would be applied by analogy in this case. It \nis unnecessary to deal with this part of the State's pleading, in view of my conclusion in relation to the Crown Suits \nAct 1947.  \n\n1525 Finally, the State says that the grant of relief should be denied by the operation of the doctrine of laches. My \nfindings of fact in relation to the laches defence are set out at [1048] to [1087] above. However, in view of my \nconclusion that the plaintiffs' actions must fail, it is not necessary to deal with the State's laches defence.  \n\n1526 For the sake of completeness, I have set out my conclusions in relation to the operation of the Crown Suits \nAct 1947.  \n\n(i) The plaintiffs have failed to comply with the requirements of the Crown Suits Act 1947 (WA)\n\n1527 In this section of my reasons I deal with the following matters:  \n\n(A) The conditions set out in the Crown Suits Act for bringing an action against the Crown;  \n\n(B) The State's case;  \n\n(C) The plaintiffs' case;  \n\n(D) Why the plaintiffs have no right of action against the State, by virtue of the Crown Suits Act.  \n\n(A) The conditions set out in the Crown Suits Act for bringing an action against the Crown  \n\n1528 Since 1947, s. 5 of the Crown Suits Act has provided that, subject to that Act, the Crown may be sued in any \ncourt in the same manner as a subject. However, until 2005 (when the Crown Suits Act was amended) the right to \nsue the Crown was subject to s 6 of the Crown Suits Act which provided that 'no right of action' lay against the \nCrown unless two requirements were met. First, the party proposing to bring the action had to give written notice to \nthe Crown Solicitor of his or her intention to do so, and that notice had to be given as soon as practicable, or within \nthree months, of the cause of action accruing.[1669] Secondly, the action had to be commenced before the \nexpiration of one year from the date on which the cause of action accrued.[1670] In the case of a continuing act, \nneglect or default, subsection 6(1) provided that the cause of action did not accrue until the act, neglect or default \nceased, but the notice could be given and the action commenced while the act, neglect or default continued.  \n\n1529 However, whether or not notice was given, the Attorney General (on behalf of the Crown) was able to consent \nin writing to any action being brought against the Crown, provided that that consent was given before the expiration \nof six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.[1671] Furthermore, notwithstanding the notice \nrequirements, a party wishing to bring an action against the Crown could seek the leave of the Court to do so at any \ntime before the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.[1672]  \n\n1530 As I have already mentioned, s. 6 of the Crown Suits Act was repealed in 2005, but it continues to apply to \ncauses of action that accrued before 15 November 2005.[1673]  \n\n(B) The State's case in relation to the Crown Suits Act  \n\n\n\n1531 The State pleaded that the duties owed to the plaintiffs (if they were owed at all) were not continuing \nduties.[1674] Accordingly, the State pleaded that the plaintiffs have no right of action against it because the \nplaintiffs did not comply with the conditions set out in s. 6 of the Crown Suits Act 1947 (WA) for bringing an action \nagainst the State.  \n\n1532 The State pleaded that the plaintiffs did not give written notice to the Crown Solicitor as soon as practicable or \nwithin three months after their causes of action accrued.[1675] The State also pleaded that the plaintiffs did not \ncommence their action before the expiration of one year from the date on which the causes of action (if any) \naccrued.[1676]  \n\n1533 In so far as any duties are said to have arisen from the committal of the plaintiffs as wards, the State pleaded \nthat any cause of action in respect of those duties accrued on 31 March 1958 when Ellen was made a ward, and on \n8 December 1961 when the Siblings were made wards.[1677] Accordingly, the State's case was that any action \narising from the committal of the Children had to be commenced on or before 31 March 1959 (in respect of Ellen) or \n8 December 1962 (in respect of the Siblings).[1678]  \n\n1534 In so far as any cause of action relates to any duty owed during the period of the wardship, the State pleaded \nthat the latest date on which those duties could have accrued was on the cessation of the \nwardships.[1679]Accordingly, the State's case is that the latest date for commencing any action arising from a \nbreach of duty owed during the period of each wardship was 1 year after the cessation of the wardships.[1680] By \nway of example, in the case of the youngest of the Children, Wesley, the State's case was that the latest date for \ncommencing any action arising from a breach of duty owed during the period of his wardship was 12 March 1980 \n(that is, one year after the end of his wardship).  \n\n1535 The State also pleaded that any cause of action relating to a duty to obtain legal advice or representation for \nthe plaintiffs accrued on the expiration of the limitation period for the primary cause of action, which the State says \nwas six years after the accrual of that cause of action.[1681] In other words, the State's case was that the latest \ndate by which any duty to provide legal advice could have accrued was six years after the date on which each of \nthe Children's wardships ceased. The State's case was that the latest date for commencing any action arising from \nits failure to provide any of the plaintiffs with legal advice was, at the latest, seven years (that is, six years plus one \nyear) after the end of each of the wardships.[1682]  \n\n1536 The State then pleaded that the plaintiffs did not receive the consent of the Attorney General, or the leave of \nthe Court, to bring the action before the expiration of six years from the date on which any of the causes of action \naccrued.[1683] The State pleaded that in the case of any cause of action relating to a duty arising in relation to the \ncommittal of the Children that consent, or leave, had to be obtained on or about 31 March 1964 (in the case of \nEllen) and on or about 8 December 1967 (in the case of the Siblings).[1684]  \n\n1537 In respect of any cause of action relating to any duty arising during the period of the wardships, the State \npleaded that the Attorney General's consent, or the Court's leave, had to be obtained at the latest six years after the \ncessation of the wardships.[1685] By way of example, in the case of Wesley, whose wardship was the last to \nexpire, on the State's case that consent, or that leave, would have to have been obtained by 12 March 1985.  \n\n1538 Finally, in respect of any cause of action arising from a failure by the State to obtain legal advice for the \nplaintiffs, the State pleaded that the Attorney General's consent, or the leave of the Court, had to be obtained within \nsix years of the accrual of that cause of action, or in other words, within 12 years of the cessation of the \nwardships.[1686] Again, by way of example, in the case of Wesley, whose wardship was the last to expire, on the \nState's case that consent, or the Court's leave, would have to have been obtained by 12 March 1991.  \n\n(C) The plaintiffs' case in relation to the Crown Suits Act  \n\n1539 The plaintiffs' case was that the secondary fiduciary duties pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim \nnamely the duties to provide the plaintiffs with legal advice, and the duties to take action to avert further loss and \ndamage, arising from the alleged breach by the State of the fiduciary duties not to fail to act in the plaintiffs' best \ninterests were continuing duties, so that their cause of action has not yet accrued, for the purposes of s 6 of the \nCrown Suits Act. There was no dispute that the requirements set out in s 6 of the Crown Suits Act had not \notherwise been complied with.  \n\n\n\n1540 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the secondary fiduciary duties constituted a continuing omission, or a \ncontinuing default, for the purposes of s 6 of the Crown Suits Act. In support of that submission he referred to \nHammond v Minister for Works[1687] where Ipp J (with whom Rowland J and Owen J agreed) discussed s 47A of \nthe Limitation Act 1935 (WA). That section, like s 6 of the Crown Suits Act, provided that 'for the purposes of this \nsection, where the act, neglect or default is a continuing one, no cause of action in respect of the act, neglect, or \ndefault accrues until the act, neglect or default ceases'. Counsel for the plaintiffs referred, in particular, to the \ndiscussion in Hammond of Huyton and Roby Gas Co v Liverpool Corporation[1688] where Scrutton LJ held that \n'where after the original act there is a legal duty to avert its consequences, neglect of which is a continuing breach \nfrom day to day [there is] a continuance of injury or damage'.  \n\n1541 In relation to the secondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice, the plaintiffs' submission was that  the duty \nnot to fail to disclose the entitlement to be advised of a right to seek a remedy continues for so long as it may be \npossible to obtain that remedy. It could not logically be the case that the Guardian could be entitled to absolve itself \nof a fiduciary duty to warn of a right to a remedy by terminating the Guardianship.[1689]\n\n(D) Why the plaintiffs have no right of action against the State, by virtue of the Crown Suits Act  \n\n1542 Prior to the enactment of the Crown Suits Act, the only way in which an action could be brought against the \nCrown was by a Petition of Right, or by an action brought against the Attorney General as the representative of the \nCrown in cases where no coercive relief was sought.[1690] However, the enactment of s 5 and s 6 of the Crown \nSuits Act together established a State legislative scheme dealing with the subject of the immunity of the Crown from \nsuit. Subject to certain limitations which are not presently relevant,[1691] those provisions defined the \ncircumstances in which any right to proceed against the government of Western Australia existed during the \noperation of those provisions.[1692]  \n\n1543 The effect of s 6(1) is that although a cause of action may have accrued, no right of action lies, and so no \naction may be brought or commenced, unless the requisite notice is given and the stipulated one year period has \nnot expired.[1693] Subsection 6(1) thus imposes conditions which are of the essence in order to establish a right to \nbring an action against the Crown.[1694]  \n\n1544 For these reasons, the Crown Suits Act is not a limitation statute. It confers a right to bring an action against \nthe Crown where none previously existed, and conditions the right of the subject to sue the Crown.[1695]  \n\n1545 The Crown Suits Act clearly applies to this action. Unless the acts, neglects or omissions on which the \nplaintiffs' causes of action are based are continuing ones, the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the preconditions set \nout in s 6(1) of the Crown Suits Act will mean that they have no right of action against the State.  \n\n1546 Section 6(1) of the Crown Suits Act expressly recognises that the act, neglect or default on which a cause of \naction is based may be of a finite or continuing character.[1696] In Hammond, Ipp J (with whom Rowland \nJ[1697]and Owen J[1698] agreed) reached the following conclusion about what was meant by a 'continuing' neglect \nor default[1699]:  In my opinion, it is to be gathered from the history of the legislation and the authorities to which I \nhave referred that a continuing 'neglect', or 'default' within the last paragraph of s 47A(1) is a continuing omission to \ncomply with a continuing duty to act, such that a fresh cause of action is created each day such omission occurs.\n\n The next question is: what is a continuing duty to act? That is not capable of being answered by a ready definition. \nIt all depends on the nature of the duty. In the case of a contractual duty, the parties' intention will be inferred from \nthe nature and terms of the duty; relevant factors are whether it is to be performed within a time capable of \ndetermination, and whether it is capable of being performed over a continuous period.\n\n1547 In Hammond, the Minister for Works was subject to an obligation to refer, to the Governor, an application by a \nperson entitled to apply for an option to purchase land which had been resumed for public works, but which was not \nbeing used for any public work. The Minister had refused to refer the appellant's application to the Governor. The \nquestion before the Court was whether the Minister's failure to refer the application to the Governor was a \ncontinuing default for the purposes of s 47A of the Limitation Act 1935 (WA). The Court in Hammond held that the \nMinister's obligation was to do an act capable of solitary performance, and to do it within a reasonable time.[1700] \n\n\n\nIpp J held that 'once the obligation is to be completely discharged by a single act, the failure to perform gives rise to \nonly one cause of action, although that failure to perform may continue indefinitely'.[1701]  \n\n1548 The plaintiffs' case for compensation rested on the secondary fiduciary duties. Turning first to the secondary \nfiduciary duty to provide legal advice, the plaintiffs' case was that the State's failure to provide the plaintiffs with \nlegal advice constitutes a continuing neglect or default, so that s 6(1) of the Crown Suits Act does not apply. I am \nunable to accept that submission. The question that arises for consideration is whether the provision of legal advice \nto the plaintiffs was something which the State was required to do once (in which case its failure to do so might \nsimply constitute an ongoing breach) or something which the State was required to do on an ongoing, or day to day \nbasis, in which case the cause of action would not accrue until the State's default ceased. In my view, the \nsecondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice is of the former kind, with the result that s 6(1) of the Crown Suits \nAct applied to the secondary fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice. My reasons for that conclusion are as follows.  \n\n1549 The State's secondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice arose only in respect of the State's possible \nbreach of its primary fiduciary duties. Whatever the nature of the acts, neglects or defaults of the State said to give \nrise to a breach of those primary fiduciary duties, those acts, neglects or defaults could only have occurred, or \ncontinued, until the end of each of the wardships. That is, once the wardships ended, the State could no longer \nperform its primary fiduciary duties (if that was what they were) as a guardian with respect to each of the Children. \nFor that reason, the latest date on which the State could be said to have been subject to the primary fiduciary duties \nmust have been the last day of each wardship.  \n\n1550 After that date, irrespective of how many alleged breaches of the primary fiduciary duties had occurred, the \nState's secondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice would have been met by a single act: its engaging a \nsolicitor to act for each of the plaintiffs to provide them with legal advice or representation in respect of any possible \nbreaches of the primary fiduciary duties which had occurred during their wardships. The State cannot be said to \nhave been under a fresh duty, day to day, to provide or obtain that legal advice or representation for the plaintiffs. \nThe ongoing failure of the State to obtain legal advice or representation for the plaintiffs in my view therefore merely \nconstituted a continuing breach of its obligation to do that one thing, rather than the breach of an obligation which \nwas renewed each day.  \n\n1551 That being the case, the preconditions in s 6(1) of the Crown Suits Act had to be met before the plaintiffs had \nany right to commence an action for a breach of the secondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice.  \n\n1552 In my view, it is unnecessary to consider the question the nature of the other secondary fiduciary duties. For \nthe reasons I have already given, there is simply no basis for the plaintiffs' contention that such fiduciary duties \ncould exist. No purpose would be served by going on to consider the possible application of the Crown Suits Actto \nmerely hypothetical causes of action in respect of those duties.  \n\n1553 There was no dispute that if the plaintiffs had to satisfy the preconditions in s 6(1) of the Crown Suits Act in \norder to bring their action that they had not done so. It is now well past the last time by which the plaintiffs could \nhave obtained the consent of the Attorney General or applied for the leave of the Court to bring their action \nnotwithstanding non-compliance with those preconditions. However, for completeness, it is appropriate to briefly \noutline why that is so.  \n\n1554 Because the breach of the secondary fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice is contingent on the breach of the \nState's primary fiduciary duties, it is necessary to start by considering the time frame in which those primary \nfiduciary duties had to be commenced. As I have already explained, the latest date on which the State could be said \nto have been subject to the primary fiduciary duties must have been the last day of each wardship. That being the \ncase, the last date by which the Attorney General's consent, or the leave of the Court, needed to have been \nobtained in order to enable the plaintiffs to bring an action against the State in respect of a breach of the primary \nduties, would have been six years after the end of each wardship.  \n\n1555 Once the time during which an action for a breach of the primary fiduciary duties had passed, there would \nhave been no practical utility in the State providing legal advice to the plaintiffs in respect of a possible action for a \nbreach of that duty. Accordingly, the last day on which the State could have been subject to any duty to provide the \nplaintiffs with legal advice would have been six years after the end of each of the wardships. The cause of action in \n\n\n\nrespect of a breach of the secondary fiduciary duty to provide legal advice (if that duty existed) must have accrued, \nat the latest, 6 years after the end of each of the wardships.  \n\n1556 That being the case, the last date by which the Attorney General's consent, or the leave of the Court, needed \nto have been obtained in order to enable the plaintiffs to bring an action against the State in respect of a breach of \nthe secondary fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice, would have been six years after the cause of action for a breach \nof that duty accrued, namely 12 years after the end of each wardship. Having regard to the expiry of Wesley's \nwardship, the plaintiffs needed to have obtained the Attorney General's consent, or applied for the Court's leave, by \n12 March 1991. Their failure to do so means that none of the plaintiffs have a right of action against the State for a \nbreach of the secondary fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice.  \n\n8. THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM FOR EQUITABLE COMPENSATION  \n\n1557 For the reasons outlined above, the plaintiffs' action cannot succeed. In cases where a plaintiff fails to \nestablish the liability of a defendant at first instance, it will often be appropriate for a trial judge to assess the \nquantum of damages which would have been awarded to a plaintiff had the plaintiff succeeded, so as to avoid the \nneed for a further trial if the trial judge's conclusion on liability is set aside on appeal.  \n\n1558 I have set out my findings in relation to the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs and the cause of those injuries at \n[1025] to [1047]. However, after giving the matter careful consideration in this case, I have determined that it is not \nappropriate to endeavour to assess the equitable compensation I would have awarded had I reached a different \nconclusion in relation to the State's liability in this case, for two reasons.  \n\n1559 First, there remain many uncertainties in relation to the principles applicable to the assessment of equitable \ncompensation for a breach of a fiduciary duty. The overall purpose of the law of fiduciary obligations is to restore \nthe beneficiary to the position he or she would have been in if the fiduciary had complied with his or her fiduciary \nduty, and a beneficiary is entitled to invoke a range of remedies much broader than those typically available at \ncommon law.[1702] Because fiduciary duties have generally been concerned with protecting economic interests, \ncompensation for breach of fiduciary duty has primarily been concerned with economic loss, rather than pain and \nsuffering[1703] or psychiatric injury.  \n\n1560 Further, the principles governing equitable compensation do not necessarily reflect the rules for assessment \nof damages in tort or contract.[1704] It is far from clear whether the measure of compensatory damages in tort and \ncontract should be applied in the context of a breach of fiduciary duty, and whether common law principles of \ncausation, remoteness of damage, and measure of damage should be applied by analogy.[1705]  \n\n1561 Secondly, quite apart from these uncertainties, considerable complexity would arise in relation to any \nassessment of compensation to the plaintiffs in view of the fact that their claims for compensation depended upon a \nbreach of the secondary fiduciary duties, which in turn depended upon a breach of the primary fiduciary duties. The \nassessment of compensation in relation to the plaintiffs' claim to the secondary fiduciary duty to obtain legal advice \nwould involve determining a number of questions about the contingencies for which allowance should be made.  \n\n1562 In addition, some of the plaintiffs Bonnie,[1706] Eva,[1707] Darryl,[1708] Wesley,[1709] Glenys[1710] and \nBeverley[1711]received ex gratia payments from the Western Australian government under the Redress WA \nscheme. Each of them signed an acceptance form which indicated that  it is the Government's understanding that, \nin the event I make a claim for damages against the State in relation to the acts or omissions the subjects of my \nRedress WA application, the amount of the ex gratia payment will ordinarily reduce the amount of any damages \nawarded.[1712]\n\n1563 An additional question which would need to be determined is whether, and if so, how these ex gratiapayments \nshould be taken into account in assessing equitable compensation.  \n\n1564 In all of these circumstances, the utility of attempting to assess compensation at this point is likely to be \nextremely limited.  \n\nCONCLUSION  \n\n1565 For the reasons set out above, the plaintiffs' action should be dismissed.  \n\nANNEXURE A  List of key persons               \n\nName            \n\n\n\nPosition held / Relationship            \n\nOral evidence?            \n\nReason why not called to give evidence                  \n\nDon Collard            \n\nFirst Plaintiff            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nSylvia Collard            \n\nFirst Plaintiff            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nGlen Collard            \n\nSon of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nNo            \n\nDeceased                  \n\nDonald Collard            \n\nSon of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nNo            \n\nDeceased                  \n\nDarryl Collard            \n\nSeventh Plaintiff; Son of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nBonnie Miller (nee Collard)            \n\nEighth Plaintiff; Daughter of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nWilliam Collard            \n\nSon of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nNo            \n\nDeceased                  \n\nBeverley Humphries (nee Collard)            \n\nSixth Plaintiff; Daughter of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nEllen Thomas (nee Collard)            \n\nThird Plaintiff; Daughter of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nGlenys Collard            \n\nSecond Plaintiff; Daughter of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\n\n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nEva Jetta (nee Collard)            \n\nFourth Plaintiff; Daughter of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nWesley Collard            \n\nFifth Plaintiff; Son of Don and Sylvia Collard            \n\nYes        \n\n                   \n\nLynette Boag            \n\nField Worker, Child Welfare Department August 1968 - January 1973            \n\nNo            \n\nStatement tendered.

It \nbecame known as Mofflyn from 1961. It initially operated a dormitory style of residential care but by 1953 had \nmoved to a cottage campus model of accommodation. It was operated by the Methodist Church and subsequently \nby the Uniting Church of Australia. It provided longterm general residential care for children, including wards \ncommitted to the case of the Child Welfare Department and those privately admitted.  \n\nSt Joseph's  \n\nSt Joseph's Girls' Orphanage in Wembley was established in 1901 by the Sisters of Mercy. It provided residential \ncare for girls, including wards of the State, child migrants and girls who were privately admitted.  \n\nChildren's Reception Centre/ Bridgewater Care and Assessment Centre  \n\n\n\nBridgewater Care and Assessment Centre in Applecross (also known as the Children's Reception Centre) was \nestablished in 1969. It was operated by the Child Welfare Department. It provided temporary care for neglected \nchildren or children in need, and short term residential care for children who had been placed for an assessment by \na professional team. It catered for children aged between three and 18 years of age.  \n\nChild Welfare Reception Home  \n\nThe Child Welfare Reception Home (originally known as the Government Reception Home) in Mount Lawley was \nestablished in 1894 and provided temporary accommodation for children who were taken into care, prior to their \nplacement with foster parents or in institutions, and for other children who needed accommodation while awaiting \nmedical or dental treatment in Perth, or who were to appear before the Children's Court.

It was a reformatory for adolescent boys located on a working farm \nproperty. Most boys attended school on the property and also did practical farm work. Although the institution was \ndesigned for adolescent boys, boys as young as nine years of age were resident there. The resident boys were \nchildren committed to the care of the Child Welfare Department, often for committing offences or for truancy. \nHillston was operated by the Child Welfare Department.  \n\nLongmore  \n\nLongmore Remand and Assessment Centre in Bentley was established in 1965 as a reformatory for boys and girls \nbetween 13 and 18 years of age.

In addition, counsel for the State also \nsought an order arising from my reservation of a costs question at the commencement of the trial, when the \nplaintiffs abandoned their claim against the Community Development Ministerial Body (the CDMB). (On that \noccasion, I ordered that the plaintiff's action against the CDMB be dismissed and reserved the question of costs \narising from the dismissal of that part of the action.)[1765]  \n\n3 The State also sought an order for a certificate for the cost of a running transcript.  \n\n4 The plaintiffs submitted that no order for costs should be made against them because the action should be \ncharacterised as a 'test case' or as 'public interest litigation'.  \n\n5 I made orders for the filing of further submissions on the question of costs, and for the determination of the \nquestion of costs on the papers.  \n\n6 Having carefully considered the parties' submissions, I have concluded that in the special circumstances of this \ncase, the just exercise of my discretion with respect to costs warrants the conclusion that all parties should bear \ntheir own costs, and that there should therefore be no order as to costs.  \n\n7 In these reasons for decision I discuss the general principles in relation to the award of costs, particularly the \nprinciples which have been developed in 'test cases' and in 'public interest litigation', before explaining why I have \nconcluded that the parties should bear their own costs.  \n\n1. General principles in relation to the award of costs  \n\n8 The Court has a broad discretion to make orders in relation to the costs of, and incidental to, a \nproceeding.[1766]However, although broadly stated the discretion is not unqualified and must be exercised \njudicially in accordance with established principle and factors directly connected with the litigation.[1767] The most \nimportant factor which guides the exercise of the costs discretion is the result of the litigation.[1768]  \n\nThe 'usual order' as to costs  \n\n9 Generally speaking, the Court will make an order that the successful party to an action recover his costs from the \nunsuccessful party, and this is known as the 'usual order as to costs'. In Oshlack v Richmond River \nCouncil[1769]McHugh J explained the basis for the rule as follows:  The principle is grounded in reasons of fairness \nand policy and operates whether the successful party is the plaintiff or the defendant. Costs are not awarded to \npunish an unsuccessful party. The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify the successful party. If the \nlitigation had not been brought, or defended, by the unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred \nthe expense which it did. As between the parties, fairness dictates that the unsuccessful party typically bears the \nliability for the costs of the unsuccessful litigation.\n\n As a matter of policy, one beneficial by-product of this compensatory purpose may well be to instil in a party \ncontemplating commencing, or defending, litigation a sober realisation of the potential financial expense involved. \nLarge scale disregard of the principle of the usual order as to costs would inevitably lead to an increase in litigation \nwith an increased, and often unnecessary, burden on the scarce resource of the publicly funded system of justice.\n\n10 As the State was successful in defending the action the starting point for considering the proper exercise of \ndiscretion with respect to costs is that the State should be able to recover its costs from the plaintiffs. Similarly, as \nthe action against the CDMB was dismissed following the plaintiffs' decision to abandon their action against it, the \nusual order would be that the CDMB would be entitled to recover its costs to that point in recognition of its success \nin defending the action.  \n\n11 Although the 'usual order as to costs' does not constitute an absolute rule, it is well established that a court will \ndepart from the usual order as to costs only in 'special circumstances'.[1770] The need for 'special circumstances' \nemphasises that the occasions upon which it will be appropriate for a court to depart from the usual order as to \ncosts will be rare and exceptional.[1771]  \n\n\n\n12 Among these special circumstances are cases where conduct by the successful party is considered to disentitle \nit to the benefit of the exercise of the discretion in its favour, such as where the successful party by its conduct \neffectively invites the litigation or unnecessarily protracts the proceedings, or succeeds on a point not argued before \na lower court, or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute.[1772]  \n\n13 Disentitling conduct by a successful party is not the only basis upon which a departure from the usual order as to \ncosts may be warranted. In some appellate jurisdictions, particularly the High Court, where an appellant is a large \nand recurrent corporate or governmental litigant, where the other party to the appeal is not wellpositioned to meet \nadverse costs orders, and where the resolution of the appeal involves a question of general importance to the \nappellant, it is not uncommon for the grant of leave to appeal to be conditional on the appellant agreeing to pay the \nrespondent's costs of the appeal in any event.[1773]  \n\n14 Furthermore, there have been some cases at first instance, and on appeal, in which no order as to costs has \nbeen made in circumstances where the case has been characterised as a 'test case' or as 'public interest litigation'. \nSome caution must be applied in approaching the exercise of the costs discretion by reference to such \ncharacterisations, for five reasons.  \n\n15 First, the position remains that there is no special rule which applies to proceedings characterised as a 'test \ncase' or as involving issues of public interest[1774] or which requires that the usual order as to costs will not apply if \nthe subject matter of the litigation is a matter of 'public interest'.[1775] Consequently, the characterisation of a case \nas a 'test case' or as involving 'public interest litigation' should be understood as shorthand for the identification in \nthat case of a variety of circumstances which are relevant to the proper exercise of the Court's discretion to depart \nfrom the usual order as to costs.[1776]  \n\n16 Secondly, many of the cases invoking characterisations of 'public interest litigation', or of a 'test case', have \ninvolved the exercise of power pursuant to statutory provisions or rules of court (such as those which apply in \nrelation to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, for example[1777]) which warrant a different \napproach to the exercise of the discretion as to costs. Similarly, authorities from jurisdictions overseas, where there \nis a more developed tradition of 'public interest litigation', are of limited assistance[1778] given that different context.  \n\n17 Thirdly, it is far from settled what defines a 'test case' or 'public interest litigation',[1779] and the label of itself \ndoes not explain what it is about such a case which warrants the exercise of discretion to depart from the usual \norder as to costs. As McHugh J pointed out in Oshlack[1780] much litigation - ranging from prosecutions, to \nconstitutional and administrative law litigation, and many civil actions concerning private rights and duties - \nconcerns the public interest. It is difficult to identify any rational basis which warrants a departure from the usual \norder as to costs which does not involve a departure in all of these cases,[1781] or which will not result in injustice \nto one of the parties to the litigation.[1782]  \n\n18 Fourthly, characterisation as public interest litigation is not sufficient, on its own, to warrant a departure from the \nusual order as to costs.[1783] That is so in relation to 'test cases' also. To characterise litigation in that way does \nnot deny the relevance of all matters bearing on whether there exist special circumstances that would justify a \ndeparture from the usual order as to costs.[1784]  \n\n19 Finally, to focus on whether litigation may be properly characterised as public interest litigation, or as a test case, \nmay distract from the proper exercise of the discretion as to costs, which requires a consideration of all relevant \ncircumstances, including whether considerations of fairness and policy warrant the conclusion that the usual order \nas to costs would not represent a just outcome in the circumstances.[1785]  \n\n20 I turn to consider the factors commonly arising in public interest litigation and in test cases which have been \nrelied upon to warrant a departure from the usual order as to costs.  \n\nFactors in 'public interest litigation' which have been identified as warranting a departure from the usual order as to \ncosts  \n\n21 The factors identified as characteristic of 'public interest litigation' include those where the subject matter of the \nproceeding involves a matter in the public interest[1786] (bearing in mind that the fact that an action is of interest to \nthe public does not mean that it is in the public interest[1787]) and that the proceedings have been brought by the \n\n\n\nplaintiff or applicant to advance that legitimate public interest.[1788] As I have already observed, these factors alone \nwill not be sufficient to justify a departure from the usual rule as to costs.[1789] Something more is required.  \n\n22 Other factors relied upon in the cases include whether the applicant had an arguable case - that is, that the \ncontentions advanced were not frivolous or lacking in substance or foundation,[1790] whether the proceedings \ninvolved private gain,[1791] whether the proceedings have contributed to the clarification and proper understanding \nof the law,[1792] or raised novel questions of general importance,[1793] or whether the proceedings will have \nimplications for persons other than the individual litigants or will benefit the public or a large section of the \npublic.[1794]  \n\n23 On the other hand, the fact that the litigation is brought against the State, or an agency of the State, does not \nmean that the litigation can be characterised as public interest litigation, or that the nature of the defendant, of itself, \nis a reason for departing from the usual rule as to costs.[1795]  \n\n24 In those cases where a departure from the usual order as to costs has been thought warranted on the basis that \nthe case is a 'test case,' there has been little elaboration on what that label signifies. The fact that a case raises for \nthe first time the meaning or operation of a legislative provision, or the application of the legal principles applicable \nto a novel fact situation, cannot be sufficient to characterise that case as a 'test case' for present purposes. Such \ncases are hardly unusual, and as a matter of policy, it is difficult to see why novelty would justify a departure from \nthe usual order as to costs.  \n\n25 As in the case of public interest litigation, something more is required before the fact that a case is described as \na test case will justify a departure from the usual order. Most often, that something extra will be the fact that the \ncase involves a wider legal importance, or significance, than that which it has to the individual litigants.[1796] That \nimportance or significance will ordinarily derive from the likely application of the principles established in the case to \nother similar cases,[1797] or from the fact that the case involves a question of construction of a statutory provision \nwith a wide significance,[1798] or about which there have been differing views, or that the case has been brought to \nascertain the correctness of a particular line of authority.[1799] The range of factors which justify a departure from \nthe usual rule as to costs in the case of public interest litigation may also be relevant in the 'test case' context.  \n\n26 Counsel for the State submitted that in a number of the cases described as test cases, the litigation was \ncommenced by a governmental or large commercial entity to pursue an issue of importance to it, and the \nunsuccessful defendant was 'simply unfortunate to have been chosen as the respondent in the litigious vehicle in \nwhich the larger interests were being pursued'.[1800] However, in none of those authorities is any rule established \nthat the 'test case' characterisation applies only to litigation brought by governmental or large commercial entities. \nThe decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Attrill v Richmond River Shire Council[1801] was not such \na case, yet the fact that that litigation had the attributes of a test case contributed to the Court's conclusion that a \ndeparture from the usual order as to costs was warranted.  \n\n2. Why a departure from the usual order as to costs is warranted in this case  \n\n27 Counsel for the State advanced a number of reasons why there should be no departure from the usual order as \nto costs in this case. Despite the persuasive force in some of those submissions, after taking all of the \ncircumstances into account, I have formed the view that the special circumstances of this case warrant a departure \nfrom the usual order as to costs, on the basis that this was a test case. I have reached that view for four reasons.  \n\n28 First, this case sought to establish, for the first time in Western Australia, the existence of fiduciary duties arising \nfrom the relationship between the State and aboriginal people who were made wards of the State, and their \nparents. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that this case was a test case because it involved the clarification of the \nlaw in Western Australia 'as it relates to members of the State's Stolen Generations.'[1802]However, as I observed \nin the reasons for decision,[1803] this case did not concern the removal of aboriginal people pursuant to the policy \nof assimilation which has been referred to as resulting in 'the Stolen Generation'. Instead, in my view, this case had \nthe attributes of a test case because it raised a number of novel issues which went well beyond the application of \nestablished principles, and which were issues of general importance. These issues included:    the plaintiffs' claims \nthat a fiduciary relationship was founded on the State's assumption of a responsibility to act in the best interests of \nthe aboriginal people of this State following European settlement;  the characterisation of various duties said to be \nowed by the State to the Children (in essence, to act in the best interests of the Children) as fiduciary duties;  the \n\n\n\nclaim that the State owed fiduciary duties to Don and Sylvia by virtue of the Children having been made wards;  the \nclaim of the existence of secondary fiduciary duties in the form of a continuing obligation to obtain legal advice for \nthe plaintiffs, and of a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid the occurrence of further loss to the plaintiffs, which \nduties were said to survive the expiration of the Children's wardships;  the principles applicable to determining \nwhether the State breached the alleged fiduciary duties;  the quantification of damages for a breach of the alleged \nfiduciary duties; and  whether the Crown Suits Act 1947 (WA) applied to the plaintiffs' claims of breach of fiduciary \nduties said to be owed by the State.\n\n29 Counsel for the State acknowledged that some of these issues may be regarded as being of general importance. \nHowever, they submitted that much of the case was concerned with identifying the factual circumstances of the \nparticular plaintiffs, and that the legal conclusions which followed from those factual findings would not be of general \napplication to other cases, so that the case could not be regarded as a test case. I am unable to accept that \nsubmission. The outcome of every case will depend upon its particular facts. It was the advancement of the novel \nlegal principles with which this case was concerned, and the wider significance of those principles, that gave it the \ncharacter of a test case. Had the plaintiffs been successful in establishing the existence of those legal principles, \nthe application of those principles in other cases would inevitably have depended upon the particular facts of those \nother cases.  \n\n30 Secondly, the limited evidence before the Court tends to support the conclusion that the case was brought on \nthe basis that the questions resolved by this action would have significance for other possible claims by aboriginal \npeople who were made wards in circumstances not dissimilar from those applicable to the plaintiffs. It is true, as \ncounsel for the State pointed out, that the plaintiffs' claim was not run as a representative action. That was not \nsurprising, given the nature of the claim, and its dependence in a number of respects on the individual \ncircumstances of the plaintiffs.  \n\n31 However, the evidence led at the trial established that during the 1990s, the solicitors from the Aboriginal Legal \nService (ALS) who were acting for the plaintiffs were also acting on behalf of other aboriginal people who had been \nremoved from their families until the 1960s.[1804] Legal advice was sought by the ALS at various times in relation \nto the causes of action that might be pursued by aboriginal people who, as children, had been removed from their \nfamilies, and by aboriginal people whose children were taken from their care.[1805] Legal advice was also sought \nby the ALS to identify those clients of the ALS whose cases might provide a suitable basis for the conduct of a test \ncase.[1806] The ALS clearly sought to pursue a test case to clarify the law in relation to the claims of these \npersons, including the plaintiffs. It pursued funding for that purpose.[1807] Initially, 17 possible plaintiffs, including \nDon, Sylvia, Glenys, Eva and Ellen, were identified as possible plaintiffs.[1808] Glenys expressly consented to the \nuse of her case as a test case.[1809] Following the receipt of some further funding, work was able to continue on \nthe preparation of test cases[1810] and counsel was retained to advise on the suitability of particular plaintiffs in a \ntest case,[1811] resulting in the preparation of five draft statements of claim.[1812]  \n\n32 Although there was a lengthy delay between this activity in anticipation of the commencement of a 'test case' \nand the commencement of the present action, there was nothing to suggest that when this action was commenced \nit was not pursued by the plaintiffs, assisted by the ALS, on the basis that it was a test case which would clarify the \napplication of the law for other aboriginal people with similar claims. Furthermore, the different experiences of the \nnine plaintiffs in this case permitted the exploration of the legal principles in a range of different factual contexts. In \nthese respects, the action had a legal importance or significance which was wider than that which it had to the \nindividual plaintiffs.  \n\n33 Thirdly, I have taken into account the strength of the plaintiffs' case in assessing whether a departure from the \nusual order as to costs is warranted. Counsel for the State submitted that there was a considerable body of \nauthority against the plaintiffs on a number of aspects of their claim. I accept that in some respects, success for the \nplaintiffs on some aspects of their claim required the Court to depart from existing binding, or highly persuasive, \nauthority. In many other respects, however, the plaintiffs' claim was truly novel. In both senses, the plaintiffs' claim \nwas one which deliberately sought to develop the law in new directions. But in my view it cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs' case was so lacking in merit as to undermine the claim that the just outcome would be a departure from \nthe usual order as to costs.  \n\n\n\n34 Fourthly, the plaintiffs sought both declaratory relief, and damages. It is true, as counsel for the State submitted, \nthat the claim for damages was of a significant quantum, and that exemplary damages were also sought. However, \nI am unable to accept their submission that 'the plaintiffs' closing submissions focused on the award of damages' \nand that for that reason, 'it cannot be concluded that the case was primarily brought to establish a point or principle \nof law'.[1813] It was hardly surprising that during his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs addressed some \nsubmissions to the question of damages, and to how damages for a breach of the alleged fiduciary duty should be \nassessed. That was one of the novel aspects of the plaintiffs' claim and it was necessary for the plaintiffs' counsel to \nspend time developing submissions on that issue.  \n\n35 Having regard to all of these circumstances, I am satisfied that this is one of those rare and exceptional cases \nwhere the justice of the case warrants a departure from the usual order as to costs. In this case, there should be no \norder as to costs, so that the parties will bear their own costs.  \n\n36 In view of that conclusion it is unnecessary to deal with the State's application for a certificate for a running \ntranscript.  \n\n[1] ts 583 (14 February 2013).\n\n [2] Exhibit I [165].\n\n [3] Exhibit J [122].\n\n [4] Ts 75 (4 February 2013).\n\n [5] Ts 1562 (7 March 2013).\n\n [6] Exhibit JJJ, pages 1 and 2.\n\n [7] Exhibit B [107].\n\n [8] Exhibit JJJ, page 3.\n\n [9] Exhibit JJJ, page 17.\n\n [10] Exhibit JJJ, page 4.\n\n [11] Exhibit JJJ, page 19.\n\n [12] Exhibit JJJ, page 5.\n\n [13] Exhibit JJJ, page 6.\n\n [14] Exhibit JJJ, page 7.\n\n [15] Exhibit JJJ, page 20.\n\n [16] Exhibit JJJ, page 8.\n\n\n\n [17] Exhibit JJJ, page 9.\n\n [18] Exhibit JJJ, page 10.\n\n [19] Exhibit JJJ, page 11.\n\n [20] Exhibit JJJ, page 12.\n\n [21] Exhibit JJJ, page 13.\n\n [22] Exhibit JJJ, page 14.\n\n [23] Exhibit JJJ, page 15.\n\n [24] Exhibit JJJ, page 16.\n\n [25] See ts 432 (13 February 2013) and Statements Tendered for Expressly Limited Purposes, filed by the \nplaintiffs, 14 February 2013.\n\n [26] See Exhibit A400 (Annual Report of the Child Welfare Department for the financial year 1964 - 1965) at page \n7.
