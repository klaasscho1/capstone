EDT DATE: \nTHURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009\n\nMR. DESTLER: I want to welcome the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to RIT and thank \nthe Commissioners, especially Patrick Mulloy and Dennis Shea, for the recognition of the importance of upstate \nNew York to the American economy.\n\nI also wanted to recognize Ron Hira, Professor of Public Policy here at RIT, who helped organize today's hearing, \nas well as our own Professors Bill Johnson and Nabil Nasr who will be testifying before the Commission today.\n\n\nIt is my hope that this event will provide USCC with a better understanding of the impact of U.S.-China policies on \nupstate businesses and communities and ultimately inform Congress on possible reforms that might enhance \neconomic development in the region.\n\nUpstate New York has traditionally been a strong economic driver, particularly in the manufacturing sector. We've \nspawned many nationally recognized international corporations in the manufacturing sector, of course, including \nKodak, Bausch & Lomb, and Xerox, right here in Rochester.\n\nBut the region and our manufacturing industries, in particular, are facing significant competition from overseas, and \nthis competition needs to be addressed, and ways need to be found to assist businesses in retaining and improving \nmarket share and growth.\n\nSo a review of how U.S. economic and trade policies with China impact our ability to compete is a significant step in \ndeveloping stronger federal policies, to improve the manufacturing environment locally and throughout the nation.\n\nSo, again, I would like to thank the USCC for its efforts and wish its Commissioners the best today and in the future \nas you seek to address and improve American economic and security issues.\n\nWelcome to RIT.\n\n1 CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thank you.\n\nDr. Destler, thank you very much for your kind and welcoming remarks.\n\nOn behalf of all of the Commissioners and the staff of the Commission, I want to thank you for hosting this hearing \nat this magnificent facility, and I understand that you spent many years down in the Washington, D.C. area, so-- \nDR. DESTLER: I did and emerged unscathed.\n\n[Laughter.] OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN CAROLYN BARTHOLOMEW CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: \nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to today's hearing on \"The Impact of Trade with China on New York State \nand Opportunities for Economic Growth.\" I'm Carolyn Bartholomew, the Chairman of the USCC for the 2009 \nreporting year. Today's hearing will be cochaired by Commissioners Patrick Mulloy and Dennis Shea.\n\nFor those of you who aren't aware of our organization, we are a bipartisan Congressional Commission composed of \n12 members, six of whom are selected by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and six from the Speaker \nand the Minority Leader of the House. Commissioners serve two-year terms.\n\nCongress has given our Commission the responsibility to monitor and investigate the national security implications \nof bilateral trade and economic relations between the United States and China.\n\nWe fulfill our mandate by conducting hearings and undertaking related research as well as sponsoring independent \nresearch.\n\nWe also travel to Asia and receive briefings from other U.S. government agencies and departments. We produce an \nannual report. We provide recommendations to Congress for legislative and policy changes.\n\nToday's hearing is the seventh hearing for the 2009 reporting year, a year in which we have already seen dramatic \ndevelopments in the U.S.-China trade relationship.\n\nEarlier in the year, we had a hearing on China's industrial policy which supports and nurtures its domestic strategic \nindustries.\n\nToday's hearing is on the impact of trade with China on upstate New York and the opportunities for economic \ngrowth in the region. Upstate New York, as you all know better than we do, has a great industrial base, and we're \nlooking forward to hearing from our panelists about it.\n\n\n\nOnce a year, in our hearing cycle, we travel somewhere in the country to see more closely what's going on in local \ncommunities, so we're really pleased to be here to talk about what's happening in this area.\n\nBefore we proceed with the hearing, we'd like to thank Michelle Seger, Associate Director, for her outstanding \nservice and assistance; James Bober, the Lead Engineer, and Neil Kromer and the engineering staff for their A/V \nassistance in setting up the hearing room; Will Dube for his outstanding support and 2 assistance; and Janice \nEmerson, who is the General Manager of the RIT Inn and Conference Center, Rita Farsace and Jennifer Harewood \nfor their support and assistance in arranging for all of our logistics.\n\nThe staff here has been wonderful to work with and have contributed immensely to the success of this hearing. So \nwe thank everybody very much for their cooperation and warm welcome.\n\nI would also like to specifically welcome our panelists and ask that you each speak for no more than seven minutes. \nThis will allow the maximum amount of time for questions and answers.\n\nWe'll be breaking at noon for lunch, and we'll be resuming at one o'clock p.m. Also, there will be a public comment \nperiod from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., this afternoon, and there's a sign-up sheet at the press materials table by the \nentrance.\n\nWith that, I'm going to introduce Commissioner Shea who is one of the cochairs of the hearing.\n\nThank you, again.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER DENNIS C. SHEA HEARING COCHAIR HEARING COCHAIR \nSHEA: Thank you, Chairman Bartholomew, and again thanks for everyone coming here today.\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to invite all of you to visit our Web site, www.uscc.gov, where you'll find many useful \nitems, including our 2008 Annual Report and various research papers on an array of subjects that might be of \ninterest to those present today.\n\nAs the Chairman mentioned, today's hearing looks to highlight not only the impact of trade with China on central \nand western New York, but also the tremendous potential available for growth and development in the region.\n\nCompanies in upstate New York have access to a very well-educated workforce, a strong world-class university \nsystem, including RIT as a member, public and private institutions with great R&D facilities, and a state \ngovernment-- and we'll be hearing from representatives of the state government--that hopes to assist in revitalizing \nthe industrial base of the region.\n\nFurthermore, established companies with rich R&D traditions in the region can help lay the foundations for job \ncreation in the new industries of the future.\n\nWe're looking forward to hearing from all of our experts today about these future opportunities.\n\nThe transcript of today's hearing will be published on our Web site, and today's written testimony will also be posted \non the Web site.\n\nBy the end of November, this coming November, our 2009 Annual Report will appear on the Commission's Web \nsite, as well as in the form of a bound paper copy.\n\nI am very, very confident that today's hearing will provide a wealth of information for that annual effort, and I want to \npersonally thank all of our 3 witnesses for taking the time to not only be present here today, but also to prepare \nwritten testimony, and I know putting pen to paper is very, very time consuming.\n\nSo we appreciate you doing that.\n\nI'm going to turn over the hearing to Commissioner Mulloy.\n\n\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER PATRICK A. MULLOY HEARING COCHAIR HEARING COCHAIR \nMULLOY: Thank you.\n\nPerhaps our witnesses would want to come up to the witness table. First panel, Dr. Ron Hira, Mr. John Perrotti, and \nDr. Willy Shih. If I'm not pronouncing any of your names correctly, let me know.\n\nI am very pleased to have the opportunity to cochair this hearing with my friend and colleague, Commissioner \nDennis Shea. And again, I want to thank Rochester Institute of Technology, and with particular thanks to our friend \nRon Hira, who has been very helpful to us in getting this organized.\n\nIn March, this Commission held a hearing in Washington, in which we looked at China's policy of promoting pillar \nand strategic industries, meaning key industries that China believes can provide a high tech, high wage society.\n\nThis, in my view, is part of the strategy being used by China to build its comprehensive national power and to help \nChina regain its former status as a great power. China was once a great power in Asia; they want it back, and \nthey've developed a strategy to do it.\n\nI have no quarrel with China doing this as long as it's not done at the expense of our own standard of living and our \nown economic strength.\n\nUnfortunately, I believe the latter is the case, and we must formulate and adopt policies that protect the legitimate \ninterests of our country and the standard of living of our people.\n\nThis does not mean I favor provoking a confrontation with China, but rather I believe we can formulate policies that \ncan help maintain our own high tech manufacturing industries. I hope today's hearing can help us better understand \nthe challenges we face and help us think about what policies we might adopt to stop what I think is a decay in our \nability.\n\nNow, one of our witnesses today, Dr. Willy Shih, wrote in a recent important Harvard Business Review article \nentitled \"Restoring American Competitiveness\" that, quote: \"Decades of outsourcing manufacturing has left U.S. \nindustry without the means to invent the next generation of high-tech products that are key to rebuilding this \neconomy.\" That's very important what he's saying here, that this outsourcing has now reached the stage where we \ncan't innovate and be the leaders in the next generation. Somebody else is going to be there.\n\nThis Commission will make good use of today's discussion when it formulates its Annual Report to Congress.\n\n4 I thank all of our witnesses for putting the effort in and preparing their statements. I also want to thank Senators \nSchumer and Gillibrand and Congresswoman Slaughter for their interest and support of this hearing. Each of them \nhas put statements in the record, and they're available at the press table.\n\nNow, let me introduce our first panel. Dr. Ron Hira is the Associate Professor of Public Policy at RIT. Prior to joining \nthe university, he worked as a systems control engineer and a program manager for ten years. Among other places, \nhe was at NIST and the George Mason University.\n\nHe coauthored Outsourcing America, which had quite an impact in the policy circles in Washington.\n\nOur second witness is Mr. John Perrotti, the CEO of the Gleason Corporation. He has held a variety of positions at \nGleason since joining the company in 1986 so you've been there 23 years.\n\nPrior to joining Gleason, he worked for KPMG, an international public accounting firm, but his testimony is very \ninteresting because he's on the ground and has seen what's happening.\n\nFinally, we have Dr. Willy Shih, Professor of Management Practice at the Harvard Business School in Boston. \nWe're very fortunate to get Dr. Shih because he worked right here at Eastman Kodak from 1997 to 2005, and he is \none who sees what's happening in our ability to innovate.\n\n\n\nSo let me welcome all three of you, and if we could just go from Dr. Hira, Mr. Perrotti, and then Dr. Shih. You'll each \nhave about seven minutes, and then we'll open it up, and each Commissioner will get about five minutes to ask \nquestions.\n\nThank you very much. Dr. Hira.\n\nPANEL I: THE IMPACT OF TRADE WITH CHINA ON NEW YORK STATE OPENING STATEMENT OF DR. RON \nHIRA ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY, ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, \nROCHESTER, NEW YORK DR. HIRA: Thank you. Welcome to Rochester and welcome to RIT. I'd like to thank the \nCommission and the cochairs of this hearing for inviting me to testify today.\n\nOffshoring is one of the most important economic, technological and national security issues this country faces. Yet, \nwe have had a muted and often misleading public discussion about its causes, its impacts, and the appropriate \npolicy and responses we should adopt.\n\nI've been studying offshoring for the past decade, and I believe that the U.S. is charting the wrong policy course \nthat, if left unchanged, will significantly erode America's economic and technological future.\n\nI'll focus my remarks today on the offshoring of innovation and research and development, areas where the U.S. is \npresumed to hold a commanding lead and 5 areas that are widely viewed as keys to our future success.\n\nThe dominant narrative given about offshoring is that as the U.S. offshores particular jobs, industrial sectors and \ntasks, it will be a win-win for both the U.S. and the receiving country such as India or China. The argument goes \nthat it is good for the U.S. to offshore software programming to India or auto parts manufacturing to China because \nthese jobs and sectors will be replaced by better ones. The United States will simply specialize in the high-tech \nsectors that create high-skill, high-wage innovation and creative jobs to replace those that are lost.\n\nThe narrative and its prescriptions rest on a division of labor hypothesis.\n\nThe U.S. response to increased offshoring should be to move up the innovation and skill ladder. Policy responses \naimed at retaining current jobs or industry are deemed as folly.\n\nThe story acknowledges that low-skill, low-wage workers will face increased competition from workers abroad, and \nsome may lose their jobs, but it offers a solution for them, too: they can be easily retrained for higher-skill, higher-\nwage jobs and end up in a better job. Never mind that the Department of Labor itself just sponsored a study that \nfound retraining efforts are largely ineffective.\n\nAlso keep in mind that all of this, this dominant globalization narrative, rests on a key assumption: that the U.S. is at \nfull employment, a condition that no economic prognosticator is predicting any time soon. So let's leave aside the \nfull employment assumption for now.\n\nWhat happens to plausibility of this narrative, this dominant narrative, if in reality the tasks and jobs moving to low-\ncost countries are the very same high-skill innovation and high-tech jobs in which the U.S. is supposed to have an \nadvantage? What if the sectors that are lost are the \"better\" industries, the ones that we're supposed to specialize \nin? A variety of indicators show that some high-tech jobs and sectors have already moved to low-cost countries like \nIndia and China, and there's even more evidence that this migration will increase in scale and scope.\n\nPrinceton University economist and former Vice Chair of the Fed, Alan Blinder, has estimated the vulnerability of all \n838 occupations in the Department of Labor categories and found that nearly all science and engineering \noccupations are vulnerable to being offshored.\n\nAnd we know that major corporations are rapidly growing their R&D facilities and workers in low-cost countries like \nIndia and China. General Electric provides, I think, a very fascinating case study, particularly given the current \nCEO's recent op-eds about globalization. Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE, was an early and significant \nevangelizer of offshoring. The firm now has four research locations worldwide in New York, Shanghai, Munich and \n\n\n\nBangalore. Bangalore's Jack Welch R&D Center employs 3,000 workers, more than the other three locations \ncombined.\n\nAnd just this week, Reuters had a feature story about how key components of Microsoft's brand-new search engine \nproduct, Bing, which is competing with 6 Google, were produced by its R&D center in India. The article also states \nthat networking giant Cisco Systems already does half of its core--its core--R&D work in India.\n\nFurther, large losses of U.S. manufacturing jobs and the worsening deterioration of the goods trade balance over \nthe past decade are very troubling for American innovation. According to the National Science Foundation, \nmanufacturing industries accounted for a whopping 70 percent of all business R&D performed in the U.S.\n\nThe Department of Labor statistics show that more than 40 percent of engineers in the U.S.--and engineers, I \nbelieve, and I'm a bit biased because I'm an engineer myself, are the agents for technological innovation--more \nthan 40 percent work in the manufacturing sector, even though with all workers, it's about nine percent or so. So \nthere's disproportionately a large number of engineers that work in manufacturing.\n\nRecent discussions by some pundits that the U.S. should jettison manufacturing and will simply succeed by \nspecializing in innovation seem to be unaware of these statistics and the fact that innovation and manufacturing are \ninextricably linked. Lose manufacturing and you're going to lose innovation.\n\nNow let me turn to the innovation policy responses that we've seen so far from the government. They have been \nfocused purely on the supply side of innovation, on increasing resource inputs into the innovation system, basically \nincreasing R&D spending, increasing the number of scientists and engineers and improving K through 12 science \nand math education.\n\nThis prescription is bound to fail because it assumes that we have a U.S. economy moored in 1957 that we \nessentially haven't changed since Sputnik. It's based on a misunderstanding of how R&D is connected to a \ncompany's activities and to the general economy.\n\nThe purpose of government subsidies for R&D, which I fully support, is not to create research jobs. We're not all \ngoing to be researchers. There's only about a million R&D jobs in the U.S. It's about .7 percent of the workforce. \nThe sector is simply too small to be a major job creator.\n\nInstead the purpose of subsidizing R&D spending is the hope that the U.S. will capture the downstream benefits: \nthe design, development and production jobs that complement and are complemented by those R&D activities.\n\nYet, we're at a stage where we're unwilling or unable to even discuss how to design policies to capture those \ndownstream fruits of the R&D.\n\nIn my written statement, I've provided a number of, I think, concrete policy recommendations that are, to use the \nphrase of the day, \"shovel ready.\" I look forward to your questions, and again thank you for the opportunity to be \nhere.\n\n[The statement follows:] 7 Prepared Statement of Dr. Ron Hira Associate Professor of Public Policy, Rochester \nInstitute of Technology, Rochester, New York Introduction I want to thank the commission and Chairmen Shea and \nMulloy for inviting me to testify here today.\n\nOffshoring is one the most important economic, technological, and national security issues this country faces. Yet \nwe have had a muted and often misleading public discussion about its causes, impacts and the appropriate policy \nresponses. I have been studying offshoring for the past decade and I believe that the U.S. is charting the wrong \npolicy course that, if left unchanged, will significantly erode America's economic and technological performance. In \nthis testimony, I will focus on the offshoring of innovation and research and development (R&D), areas where the \nU.S. is presumed to hold a commanding lead and are widely viewed as keys to our future success.\n\n\n\nThe dominant narrative given about offshoring is that as the US offshores particular jobs, industrial sectors, and \ntasks, it will be a win-win for both the US and the receiving country, say India or China. The argument goes that it is \ngood for the US to offshore software programming to India, or offshore auto parts manufacturing to China, because \nthese jobs and sectors will be replaced by better ones. The United States will simply specialize in high-tech sectors \nthat create high-skill, high-wage innovation and creative jobs to replace those lost.\n\nThe narrative and its prescriptions rest on a division-of-labor hypothesis: the U.S. response to increased offshoring \nshould be to \"move up\" the innovation and skill ladder. Policy responses aimed at \"retaining\" current jobs or \nindustries is folly. The story acknowledges that low-skill, low-wage workers will face increased competition from \nworkers abroad and some may lose their jobs, but it offers a solution for them too: they can be easily retrained for \nhigher skill and higher wage jobs, and end up in a better job. Also remember that the narrative rests on the \nfundamental assumption that the economy is at full employment, a condition that few prognosticators have on their \nradar screen.\n\nBut what happens to the narrative if in reality the tasks and jobs moving to low-cost countries are in the very same \nhigh-skill innovation and high-tech sectors in which the United States is supposed to hold an advantage? What if \nthe sectors that are lost are the \"better\" industries? A variety of indicators show that some high- tech jobs and \nsectors have already moved to low-cost countries like India and China, and there is even more evidence that this \nmigration will increase in scale and scope, and its growth could be substantial. Princeton economist Alan Blinder \nestimated the vulnerability to offshoring of all 838 Department of Labor job categories, and found absolutely no \ncorrelation with skill level. This means that many occupations requiring advanced skills are vulnerable to offshoring, \nincluding nearly all science and engineering job categories. Getting more education or advanced degrees does not \nmake one immune from the negative effects, job and/or wage loss, from offshoring.\n\nFurther, large losses of U.S. manufacturing jobs and the worsening deterioration of the goods trade balance over \nthe past decade are very troubling for those betting on innovation. According to the National Science Foundation \nmanufacturing industries accounted for a whopping 70% of all business research and development (R&D) \nperformed in the United States in 2007. Also, Department of Labor statistics show that more than 40% of engineers, \nthe agents of technological innovation, work in the manufacturing sector. Recent discussions by some pundits that \nthe U.S. should jettison manufacturing and will succeed by specializing in innovation defy reality. Innovation and \nmanufacturing are inextricably linked and complementary activities. Now let me turn to some worrying indicators \nabout the offshoring of innovation and R&D, which I have documented in more detail in some of my recent papers.\n\n8 Advanced (High-Technology) Trade Balance The United States is running large and growing trade deficits with \nChina in the \"advanced technology products\" (ATP) category. Advanced technology products, defined by the \nForeign Trade Statistics division of the Census Bureau, captures trade in goods (services are excluded) that require \na high amount of R&D to produce. The ATP series was created in the late 1980s specifically to more easily identify \nthe U.S. trade position in high- technology.\n\nThe United States began running a trade deficit in advanced technology products in 2002, and that deficit increased \nto $38 billion in 2006. Much of the deficit can be attributed to the rapidly declining trade position with China, dating \nto its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Looking at exports and imports separately, China ranks \nnumber one for both exports and imports. The US exported more ATP, $24 billion, to China than any other country \nin 2006, up more than two-fold from $11 billion and 8th place in 2000. But the remarkable story is the massive \nfivefold increase in ATP imports from China between 2000-06 going from $12 billion and 7th place to $73 billion \nand a dominant 1st (Mexico is a distant second at $31 billion), accounting for one-quarter of all US ATP imports.\n\nIn the case of India, America ran a slight surplus of $2.6 billion in 2006, up from $913 million in 2000. Exports to \nIndia increased from $1 billion and a rank of 28th in 2000 to $3 billion and a rank of 20th in 2006. Many predicted \nthat India would become a large market for US ATP exports, as the offshoring of IT services increased. The \nprediction was that Indian workers would be buying \"Dell computers\" and telecommunications equipment from \nAmericans. But it simply hasn't materialized. Information and communications ATP exports to India increased a \n\n\n\nmere $470 million between 2003 and 2007, from $650 million to $1.12 billion, while the Indian offshoring industry \nexploded. The claim that offshoring is a two-way street isn't supported by the facts.\n\nScience & Engineering Articles A significant output of research activities, especially academic research, is \npublishing articles. China's article output increased more than four-fold between 1995 and 2005 to 42 thousand, \nmoving it from being ranked 14th to the 5th in just a decade. The 2005 Chinese output still significantly lags the US \nand EU, each in the low 200 thousand range, but it's now three- quarters the size of Japan's. India's output, which \nwas nearly equal to China's in 1995, has increased at a much slower rate to 15 thousand. It began 1995 and \nended 2005 as the 12th ranked country.\n\nA potentially more significant figure is how China has focused its efforts on particular technical fields. The data \nabove include social as well as natural and physical sciences. China appears to investing in the physical sciences, \nengineering and mathematics. In engineering and chemistry, China became the second leading publisher of \narticles, supplanting Japan. And in physics and mathematics it moved into third place behind Japan for physics and \nthird place behind France for mathematics. In the leading edge field of nanotechnology, China is now ranked \nnumber two, behind the US, in number of nanotechnology papers.\n\nHuman Capital Measures Chinese and Indians are responding to the increased opportunities in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations, from offshoring as well as overall growth. In India \nthe response has been mostly in the private sector through a proliferation of private colleges and training \nacademies. In China, the state has played a bigger role in expanding the talent pool at all levels with a dramatic \ndifference especially at the doctorate level.\n\nAccording to the NSF, India's engineering doctorate production hardly budged from 1989 to 2003, but China's \nproduction increased nine-fold, surpassing Japan in 1999 and America by 2002 to move to first place.\n\nU.S. Multinational Corporation R&D Activities in China & India There is no comprehensive list of R&D investments \nby U.S. multinational corporations and they aren't required to disclose geographic segment activities of R&D in \nfinancial filings. Below are some of the R&D activities of leading 9 U.S. firms that have been reported in the press or \nby the companies themselves. Two patterns emerge from the data: the R&D activities and investments in India and \nChina are relatively new and they are growing. Figures in the parentheses show the firm's R&D spending ranking \n(for U.S.-based firms only) and its spending for fiscal year 2007.\n\nGeneral Motors (#1, $8.1bn) India The India Science Lab, one of eight General Motors research labs, is located in \nBangalore and was established in 2003. More than 70% of its researchers hold a Ph.D. Also, GM has created \ncollaborative research laboratories with two Indian universities to focus on specific R&D topics. GM has nine such \nlabs with universities, and two of the three outside the U.S. are in India.\n\nChina In October 2007 General Motors announced it would build a wholly-owned advanced research center in \nShanghai to develop hybrid technology and other advanced designs. GM already has a 1,300-employee research \ncenter in Shanghai through a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.\n\nPfizer (#2, $8.1bn) India Pfizer has been outsourcing significant drug development services to India. 44 new drugs \nare under clinical trials involving 143 medical institutions and at least 1,800 patients. The company is now looking to \nexpand into drug research in India through collaborations.\n\nChina Pfizer has approximately 200 employees at its Shanghai R&D center, which supports global clinical \ndevelopment. It also uses a number contract research firms for some R&D there. It plans significant expansion of its \nR&D in China.\n\nMicrosoft (#5, $7.1bn) India It employs more than 4,000 workers in India. The Microsoft India Development Center \n(an R&D center) was established in 1998. It has grown to more than ten-fold since 2003 when it had 120 people. \nWith 1,500+ workers now, it is the largest development center outside the U.S.\n\n\n\nChina The Microsoft China R&D Group is over ten years old and currently employs 1,500 workers. Activities are for \nboth localization and global markets. The Microsoft China R&D Group focuses on the five areas of mobile and \nembedded technology, web technology products and service, digital entertainment, server and tools, and emerging \nmarkets. Microsoft broke ground on a new $280 million R&D campus in Beijing in May 2008. In November 2008 \nMicrosoft announced it is significantly expanding its R&D operations in China by investing an additional $1 billion \nover the next three years making it the largest R&D center behind the U.S.\n\nIntel (#6, $5.8bn) India Intel began with a sales office in 1988 and established an R&D center in 1998. It now has \nabout 2,500 R&D workers in India and has invested approximately $1.7 billion in its Indian operations. In 2007, \nIntel's Bangalore 10 Development center contributed about half the work towards its \"teraflop research chip.\" In \nSeptember 2008 Intel unveiled its first microprocessor designed entirely in India, and the first time that 45 \nnanometer technology was designed outside of the U.S. The Xeon 7400 microprocessor are used for high-end \nservers. In 2005 Intel announced a planned investment of $800 million in India to expand research operations and \nan additional $250 million to launch a venture capital fund targeted at Indian start-ups.\n\nChina Intel is building a $2.5 billion 300 mm semiconductor fabrication facility in Dalian, China, its first fab in Asia. \nIn April 2008 Intel announced a $500 million Intel Capital China Technology Fund II will be used for investments in \nwireless broadband, technology, media, telecommunications, and \"clean tech.\" The first fund's size was $200 \nmillion. Examples of Intel's first China Fund company investments include Neusoft Group, Supcon Group, A8 \nMusic, Chinacache International, Chipsbank Microelectronics, DAC, HiSoft Technology International, Kingsoft, \nLegend Silicon, Montage Technology, and Palm Commerce.\n\nWhy the Current Policy Response to High-Technology Offshoring is Insufficient In response to the offshoring of \nhigh-tech jobs and tasks an additional narrative supporting status-quo globalization has been constructed. In this \nmuddled tale, the rise of India and China is seen as both a challenge and a boon. In response to the challenge, \nAmerican workers and companies and industries that cannot take advantage of offshoring must \"run faster and \njump higher\" or \"adjust\" by moving to new functions or sectors. The proponents argue that innovation is the \npanacea, and that more public money should be directed to increase U.S. technological capacity.\n\nThey offer a simple three-ingredient cocktail: increase R&D spending (and R&D tax breaks); produce more \nscientists and engineers; and improve K-12 science and math education.\n\nTheir primary focus is on increasing resource inputs into the innovation system. But this policy course is misguided \nbecause it is based on a misunderstanding of how R&D is connected to a company's activities and the economy.\n\nFirst, the purpose of government subsidies for R&D is not to create research jobs, which number about 1 million in \nthe U.S., or less than 0.7% of the workforce (less than the number of jobs lost in the past three months alone). The \nsector is simply too small to be a major job creator now or in the future. Instead the purpose of subsidizing R&D \nspending is the hope that the U.S. will capture the downstream benefits - the design, development and production \njobs that complement and are complemented by those R&D activities. Second, a number of major structural shifts \nhave occurred in the U.S. national innovation system (NIS), the term scholars use to describe the complex system \nthat supports the innovation process. Our policies have not kept up with these significant structural and institutional \nchanges affecting the U.S. NIS - its elements, institutions and the links between them. These changes include \nshifts in the employment relations and the rise of the globally integrated enterprise; the internationalization of U.S. \nuniversities; and, the uncertainty of the U.S. science and engineering labor market.\n\nU.S. High-Technology Employment Relations & Rise of Globally Integrated Enterprises During the past two \ndecades there has been a significant shift in the employment relations between U.S. employers and their American \nscientists and engineers. Corporate decisions are increasingly being made with little regard to how it affects \nworkers. IBM, a leading employer, shows how radically these practices have changed over the past 20 years. As \nrecently as 1992 IBM never laid off an employee, but since 2002 it has policies in place that force its U.S. workers \nto train foreign replacements as a condition of severance and unemployment insurance. These practices have \nbecome quite widespread in the American technology sector. An American software engineer I know working at a \n\n\n\nmajor semiconductor company put it this way, \"The basic plan where I worked was to hire H-1Bs [foreign workers in \nthe United States on temporary work permits], train them, and use them as a way to outsource and transfer \ntechnology to China. I trained my replacement who was here on an H-1B visa from India.\" When asked if he would \ntell his story publicly, he demurred saying, \"The company I worked for required I sign a several page agreement \nstating I would not discuss company information. My human resources representative and manager both made it \nclear that the company has never lost any challenge and has gone out of its way to destroy the lives of the 11 \npeople who have caused issues. They tell everybody this, not just me. They would brag about cases.\" At the same \ntime that this American engineer was training his foreign replacement, the CEO of his company was publicly \ncomplaining to Washington policy makers about a shortage of U.S. engineers.\n\nU.S. corporate leaders have been explicit about how they now manage their technology human resources. For \nexample, in response to the discussion on offshoring and U.S. competitiveness, Craig Barrett, then CEO of Intel \nCorporation, said that his company can succeed without ever hiring another American. And in an article in Foreign \nAffairs magazine in 2006, IBM CEO Sam Palmisano gave the eulogy for the multinational corporation (MNC), and \nintroduced us to the globally integrated enterprise (GIE). Palmisano said, \"Many parties to the globalization debate \nmistakenly project into the future a picture of corporations that is unchanged from that of today or yesterday....But \nbusinesses are changing in fundamental ways-structurally, operationally, culturally-in response to the imperatives of \nglobalization and new technology.\" The MNC model, where firms replicated their organization for each country \nwhere they sold, is now giving way to the GIE model, where firms geographically separate their production from the \nmarkets in which they sell. When discussing his firm's aggressive moves to shift its share of workers to low-cost \ncountries, Ron Rittenmeyer, CEO of EDS, the largest U.S.-based IT services firm, said he \"is agnostic specifically \nabout where\" EDS locates its workers, choosing the place that reaps the best economic efficiency. By 2008, EDS \nhad 43% of its workforce in low-cost countries, up from virtually zero in 2002.\n\nFirms are significant actors in the innovation process, and changes in their behavior will impact the U.S. NIS as well \nas the distribution of its benefits and costs. For example, advanced tools and technologies created or purchased by \nfirms, will likely diffuse much more rapidly across borders (be geographically more leaky), giving domestic \ntechnology workers diminished preferred-access advantage. There will also be larger shares of technology workers \nin low-cost countries, and likely smaller workforces in the United States. This will affect new firm creation in the \nUnited States because engineers not only create new knowledge, but are also an important source of \nentrepreneurship and start-up firms.\n\nThese new arrangements will also make innovations less geographically sticky, raising questions about whether \npromised payoffs to public investments in R&D will be realized. Global firms will have access to knowledge created \nin low-cost countries, if they aren't creating it themselves, and will be able to diffuse and exploit that new \nknowledge in their U.S. operations.\n\nLow-Cost Countries Attract R&D Sites Another new phenomenon is competition by low-cost countries for R&D site \nselection. Defying the product lifecycle pattern of technological investments proposed by development scholar \nRaymond Vernon in 1966, India and China have successfully attracted R&D and innovation facilities. Vernon \nargued that newly invented products were initially produced in developed countries and only after they matured did \nproduction move to developing countries.\n\nAny R&D done in developing countries would be limited to localization, customizing the product for the domestic \nmarket.\n\nRecent surveys of corporate R&D managers indicate that India and China have become much more attractive as \ndestinations for R&D investments. A survey by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development of the top 300 \nworldwide R&D spenders found that China was the top destination for future R&D expansion, followed by the \nUnited States, India, Japan, the U.K., and Russia. A survey of 248 R&D managers of U.S. and European MNCs, \nconducted by Thursby and Thursby for the National Academies' Government University Industry Research \nRoundtable, found more firms had new or planned facilities, \"central to overall R&D strategy,\" to be located in China \nthan the United States, and a large number are slated for India. The study also found that the managers expected \n\n\n\nR&D employment growth in India and China, and more respondents expected U.S. R&D employment to decline \nthan those that expected it to increase. In 2007 The Economist magazine surveyed 300 executives about R&D site \nselection. They asked them to name the best overall location for R&D, excluding their home country.\n\nIndia was the top choice, followed by the United States and China (Canada followed as a distant fourth). Eight of \nthe 12 top 10 R&D spending companies have R&D facilities in China or India, (Microsoft, Pfizer, DaimlerChrysler, \nGeneral Motors, Siemens, Matsushita Electric, IBM, and Johnson & Johnson).\n\nWhile General Electric spends less than many other firms on R&D it nevertheless provides an interesting case of a \ncompany with the majority of its R&D personnel in low-cost countries. Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, was an early \nand significant evangelizer of offshoring. The firm has four research locations worldwide, in New York, Shanghai, \nMunich, and Bangalore. Bangalore's Jack Welch R&D Center employs 3,000 workers, more than the other three \nlocations combined. In fiscal year 2008, 47% of GE's revenues came from the United States and 84% from outside \nof Asia. So, clearly those R&D personnel are creating products for the global and high-cost country markets.\n\nThe emerging economies of India and China have leap-frogged certain stages of economic development by \nattracting private-sector R&D production. This may result in greater competition amongst regions for attracting R&D \ninvestments. An important rationale for public sector investments in R&D is that it helps to attract co-located private-\nsector R&D investments. These public-sector investments, often accompanied by tax and other subsidies, may \nbecome less effective at attracting those private investments.\n\nPerhaps the most important effect will be felt on the downstream benefits accruing from public investments in R&D, \nwhich are often targeted at economic growth and job creation. The payoff from such investments is not the R&D \njobs created by government spending or subsidies, but rather the expectation that the downstream spillover \nbenefits, in the form of start-up firms and design and development and production facilities, will be geographically \nsticky.\n\nThe fact that China and India are able to attract R&D indicates they have improved their absorptive capacity for the \nmid-skill technology jobs in the design, development and production stages.\n\nU.S. Universities Begin to Internationalize U.S. universities, long seen as providing a central role in the U.S. NIS, \nare beginning to internationalize in new ways. While these institutions have traditionally attracted large numbers of \nforeign students, particularly at the graduate level in science and engineering fields, they are beginning to take their \neducation to foreign students by building campuses and offering STEM degree programs in other countries. Some, \nlike Cornell, already identify themselves as transnational universities.\n\nOffshoring is giving high-quality foreign students new job opportunities in their home countries making it less \ndesirable to come to the U.S. to study. Those opportunities are increasingly with U.S.- based MNCs, creating new \nmarkets for universities. As a result prominent U.S. universities are expanding their global footprints, to tap a more \ngeographically diffuse student pool, especially in India and China. While there are no definitive counts of foreign \ncampuses and programs established by American universities, experts believe that more universities, particularly \nhigh-prestige ones, are venturing abroad. And the World Bank estimates that 150 of the 700 foreign degree \nprograms operating in China are American. Cornell, which already operates a medical school in Qatar, sent its \npresident to explore opportunities in India in 2007. And Cornell isn't alone-many other engineering-intensive \ncolleges, such as Rice, Purdue, Georgia Tech, and Virginia Tech, have made similar exploratory visits. Various \nprograms have already been initiated by major engineering colleges. Carnegie-Mellon offers its technology degrees \nin India in partnership with a small private college there. Students take most of the courses in India, because it is \nless expensive, and then they spend six months in Pittsburgh to complete the Carnegie-Mellon degree.\n\nUniversity internationalization is still in its early stages and is still small in scale, but reports indicate that \nhighprestige U.S. universities have serious plans in the works to ramp up their overseas operations.\n\n13 Uncertainty for U.S. STEM Workers & Students The emerging opportunities for GIEs to take advantage of high-\nskilled talent in low-cost countries have introduced career uncertainty for the U.S. STEM workforce. Many U.S. \n\n\n\nSTEM workers worry about offshoring's impact on their career prospects. According to the Taulbee survey, \nconducted by the Computing Research Association, enrollments in bachelors programs in computer science \ndropped an astounding 50% from 2002 to 2007. Rising risks for job loss in information technology, caused in part \nby offshoring, was a major factor in students shying away from computer science degrees. Other factors, such as \nthe bursting of the dot-com bubble and record unemployment levels for IT workers, were also important \ncontributors. But even as those factors have been mitigated, enrollments have not come back.\n\nOffshoring concerns have been mostly concentrated on IT occupations, but many other STEM occupations may be \nat risk. Blinder examined all 838 occupations as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He estimated that nearly \nall (35 of 39) STEM occupations are offshorable, many of which he describes as \"highly vulnerable.\" By vulnerable, \nBlinder is not claiming that all, or even a large share, of jobs in those occupations will actually be lost overseas.\n\nInstead, he claims that those occupations have characteristics that mean they will face significant new wage \ncompetition from low- cost countries. Blinder finds that there is no correlation between vulnerability and education \nlevel; i.e., even occupations that require advanced education and skills are vulnerable.\n\nWorkers need to know which jobs will be geographically sticky and which are likely to be offshored. But because \noffshoring of white- collar jobs is still an incipient phenomenon, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how \nglobalization will affect the level and mix of domestic STEM labor demand. The response of some workers appears \nto be to play it safe and opt for occupations that are likely to stay. Longer-term impacts on the national innovation \nsystem are unknown but likely to be significant.\n\nHow Globally Integrated Enterprises Are Responding to Competition We have an excellent case study for how \nthese dynamics will play out in the near future. One of the most important high-technology stories of the past \ndecade has been the remarkably swift rise of the Indian IT services industry, including firms such as Wipro, Infosys, \nTCS, and Satyam, as well as U.S.-based firms such as Cognizant and iGate that use the same business model. \nThere is no need to speculate about whether the Indian firms will eventually take the lead in this sector; they \nalready have become market leaders. By introducing an innovative, disruptive business model, the Indian firms \nhave turned the whole industry upside down in the matter of four short years. U.S. IT services firms such as IBM, \nEDS, CSC, and ACS were caught flat-footed.\n\nNot a single one of those firms would have considered Infosys, Wipro, or TCS as direct competitors as recently as \n2003, but now they are chasing them by moving as fast as possible to adopt the Indian business model, which is to \nmove as much work as possible to lowcost countries. The speed and size of the shift is breathtaking.\n\nThe Indian IT outsourcing firms have extensive U.S. operations, but they prefer to hire temporary guest workers \nwith H-1B or L-1 visas. The companies train these workers in the United States, then send them home where they \ncan be hired to do the same work at a lower salary. These companies rarely sponsor their H-1B and L-1 workers for \nU.S. legal permanent residence.\n\nThe important lesson though is how the U.S. IT services firms have responded to the competitive challenge. Instead \nof investing in their U.S. workers with better tools and technologies, the firms chose to imitate the Indian model by \noutsourcing jobs to low-cost countries. IBM held a historic meeting with Wall Street analysts in Bangalore in June \n2006, where the whole IBM executive team pitched their strategy to adopt the Indian offshore-outsourcing business \nmodel, including an additional $6-billion investment to expand its Indian operations. IBM's headcount in India has \ngrown from 6,000 in 2003 to 73,000 in 2007 and is projected to be 110,000 by 2010, which will rival the current U.S. \nheadcount of 115,000. And IBM is not alone. Accenture passed a historic milestone in August 2007, when its Indian \nheadcount of 35,000, surpassed any of its other country headcounts, including the United States, where it had \n30,000 workers. In a 2008 interview, EDS's Rittenmeyer extolled the profitability of shifting tens-of- thousands of the \ncompany's workers from the United States to low-cost countries such as India. He said outsourcing is \"not just a \npassing fancy. It is a pretty major change that is going to continue. If you can find high-quality talent at a third of the \n14 price, it's not too hard to see why you'd do this.\" ACS, another IT services firm, recently told Wall Street analysts \n\n\n\nthat it plans its largest increase in offshoring for 2009, when it will move many of its more complex and higherwage \njobs overseas so that nearly 35 percent of its workforce will be in low-cost countries.\n\nWhat We Should Do Most of the responses to offshoring will be done in the private sector, by firms and individuals, \nbut governments can and should play a more significant role in ensuring that globalization works for the national \ninterest. Given the speed by which offshoring is increasing in scale, scope and moving up the skill ladder, a number \nof immediate steps should be taken.\n\nA. Establish a Dedicated Standalone FFRDC to Study the Globalization of Innovation Princeton's Alan Blinder has \nlikened the economic transformation caused by offshoring to be equivalent on scale to the industrial revolution. The \nstakes are simply too large for the country not to invest in a better understanding of the economic impacts and \npolicy implications of offshoring. Existing institutions cannot provide objective and unconflicted advice and analysis \nbecause they all have significant limitations. The scale of the problem, and its growth rate, requires a budget of at \nleast $40 million per year for a new FFRDC dedicated to studying offshoring. Its agenda would be far ranging from \nadvising the agencies on data collection to generating policy alternatives for creating geographically sticky jobs. The \nFFRDC should be created in a new organization, rather than an existing contractor to ensure that its functions and \nmission are focused and its resources are not poached by the parent organization.\n\nMany academics, especially those in business schools, have set up research agendas studying ways that make \nofffshoring more efficient and effective, essentially speeding up the offshoring trend. This is understandable given \nthe operating model of most universities. Faculty respond to incentives and to date there have been no incentives to \nstudy offshoring from a U.S. national interest perspective. The government is the only institution that can fill this \nbreach.\n\nB. Create the Environment for Worker Representation in the Policy Process Imagine if a major trade association, \nsuch as the Semiconductor Industry Association, was excluded from having any representatives on a federal \nadvisory committee making recommendations on trade and export control policy in the semiconductor industry? It \nwould be unfathomable. But we have precisely this arrangement when it comes to making policies that directly \naffect the STEM workforce.\n\n1. Government advisory boards, such as the National Science Board, should be required to have members that \nrepresent the interests of American STEM workers.\n\n2. Organizations that fall under the FACA rules should ensure that STEM workers are represented on committees \nthat make recommendations on policy issues that affect workers.\n\nC. Collect Additional, Better, and Timelier Data There is a consensus that poor data has severely limited analysis \nof, and policy as well as private responses to, the globalization of innovation and R&D. To remedy this situation, the \nNational Science Foundation should work with the appropriate agencies (BEA, BLS, and Census) to begin \ncollecting additional and timelier data on the globalization of innovation and R&D. The broad-based effort should \ninclude a number of new initiatives.\n\n1. The NSF Statistical Research Service (SRS) should augment existing data on multinational R&D investments to \ninclude detailed STEM workforce data. This data will track the STEM workforce for multinational companies in the \nU.S. versus other countries. Details should include occupation, level of education, and experience. These data will \nbe reported on an annual basis and in a timely manner such that the data are from the most recent fiscal year \nreported by the companies.\n\n2. The NSF SRS should collect detailed information on how much and what types of R&D and innovation activities \nare being done overseas.\n\n15 3. The NSF Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) division will begin a research program identifying \nthe characteristics of jobs that make them more or less vulnerable to offshoring. The program will include a study of \nestimating the numbers of jobs that have been lost to offshoring.\n\n\n\n4. The NSF should make an assessment of the extent of U.S. university globalization. It should then track trends in \nuniversity globalization.\n\n5. NSF SBE will identify the impacts of university globalization on the U.S. STEM workforce and students.\n\nNSF SBE will begin a research program identifying and disseminating best practices in university globalization.\n\n6. The NSF should conduct a study to identify the amount and types of U.S. government procurement that are \nbeing offshored.\n\n7. The BEA should implement recommendations from prior studies, such as the 2006 study by MIT's Industrial \nPerformance Center, to improve its collection of services data, especially trade in services data.\n\nD. Create Better Career Paths for STEM Workers STEM offshoring has created a pessimistic attitude about future \ncareer prospects for incumbent workers as well as students. New programs are needed to create better career \npaths for STEM workers including improved continuing education, a sturdier safety net for displaced workers, \nimproving labor market signals and career information, expanding the pool of potential STEM workers by better \nutilizing workers without a college degree, and improving rates of successful re-entry into the STEM labor market \nafter voluntary and involuntary absences. No American STEM worker should be forced to train his foreign \nreplacement because of government designed loopholes in immigration policy.\n\n1. The government should encourage the adoption and use of low- cost asynchronous on-line education targeted \nat incumbent STEM workers. The program would coordinate with the appropriate scientific and engineering \nprofessional societies. The pilot program will assess the current penetration rates of on-line education for STEM \nworkers and identify barriers to widespread adoption.\n\n2. Using H-1B fees, the U.S. Department of Labor should work with the appropriate scientific and engineering \nprofessional societies to create a pilot program for continuous education of STEM workers and to re-train displaced \nmid-career STEM workers. Unlike prior training programs, these ones should be targeted at jobs that require at \nleast a bachelors degree.\n\n3. The NSF SRS should issue a report on improving the dissemination of STEM labor market signals, and begin \nreporting these data on a monthly basis. The report will assess the current state of labor market signals, and ways \nin which they may be distorted.\n\nThe focus of the report is how workers and students receive information on the current and future prospects for \nspecific STEM careers. The report will identify the appropriate data from the Department of Labor including data \nseries such as JOLTS, DWS, and BED.\n\n4. The National Academies should form a study panel to identify on-ramps to STEM careers for students who do \nnot go to college. This study will identify how many workers enter STEM careers without formal college degrees. \nAnd it will identify the barriers for additional workers, without college, to enter STEM careers and ways to overcome \nthose barriers.\n\n5. The National Academies should identify effective strategies for STEM workers to more easily re-enter the STEM \nworkforce. STEM workers are more likely to leave the workforce, voluntarily and involuntarily, for extended periods \nof time.\n\n6. Extend TAA to services workers since many STEM workers work in the services sectors.\n\n7. Fix the broken high-skill immigration system by encouraging the best and brightest from abroad to stay \npermanently and reducing our reliance on guestworkers. First, fix permanent residency pathways by increasing the \noverall quota for high-skill permanent residents. We should move towards a two channel approach in permanent \nresidence, with a new merit point system quota coupled with a reduced reliance on employer based sponsorship. \nSecond, the loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa guestworker programs should be closed. These loopholes enable \n\n\n\nemployers to pay below-market wages and exploit vulnerable guestworkers, harming American and foreign workers \nalike. These H-1B and L-1 reforms should ensure that employers look for American workers first, pay market \nwages, and not displace American workers. As part of the broader immigration reform policies, place the ability to \nset immigration quotas in the hands of 16 an independent body that monitors the labor market. This allows the \nboard to adjust the new flow of immigrants to real needs by the US economy. Former Secretary of Labor Ray \nMarshall has developed proposals on how such a board could be operated.\n\nE. Improve the Competitiveness of the Next Generation of STEM Workers As universities globalize and \nmultinational firms take the latest tools and technologies to STEM workers in low-cost countries, American STEM \nworkers must find new ways to compete. They can compete by finding new opportunities and niches in the types of \njobs and tasks that will remain geographically sticky to the United States.\n\nThose opportunities and niches for American STEM workers need to be identified. Entrepreneurship and innovation \ntraining have been identified as a comparative advantage, for American STEM workers, have yet to be fully \nexploited.\n\n1. The National Academies will form a study panel to identify the types of curricula reform that are needed, if any, in \nresponse to globalization. The aim is to ensure that US STEM students graduate with the best skills to compete in \nthe world.\n\n2. The National Academies will form a study panel to examine best practices in teaching innovation, creativity and \nentrepreneurship specifically target to STEM students.\n\n3. The National Science Foundation will encourage study abroad programs for STEM students to improve their \nability to work in global teams.\n\nF. Public Procurement Should Favor American Workers Government procurement has been one of the primary \nareas of outsourcing policy debate, since about forty states have legislation either pending or passed that restricts \noffshore outsourcing to some degree. Tennessee was the first state to pass this kind of legislation, but it is likely to \npass in many more states. An outright ban does not make sense, but instead we should take a pragmatic approach \nto what should and should not be outsourced overseas. A simple one-size-fits-all approach just does not work.\n\nAmerican taxpayers have a right to know that government expenditures at any level are being used appropriately to \nboost innovation and help U.S. workers. The public sector-federal, state, and local government-is 19 percent of the \neconomy and is an important mechanism that should be used by policymakers. There is a long, strong, and positive \nlink between government procurement and technological innovation. The federal government funded not only most \nof the early research in computers and the Internet but also was a major customer for those technological \nrevolutions. Also, our billions in defense expenditures have helped to fund technological innovations, such as the \nInternet, that have commercial applications.\n\nThe first step is to do an accounting of the extent of public procurement that is being offshored. Then the \ngovernment should modify regulations to favor STEM intensive work staying in America.\n\nG. Establish Tax & Trade Policies That Put U.S. On Equal Footing In Attracting High-Wage STEM Jobs U.S. tax \nand trade policies currently discourage investments by companies in high-wage STEM jobs. Changes should be \nmade to tax and trade policies to improve America's ability to recruit and retain R&D and innovation facilities.\n\n1. Investigate \"unfair\" trade practices such as linking market access to a country with technology transfer, \nundervalued currencies, and theft of intellectual property.\n\n2. Fix the perverse loopholes that provide firms a tax advantage for keeping profits overseas.\n\n3. Explore more fundamental tax reform where corporate tax rates are scaled by the kinds of jobs they have in the \nUS. It would offer lower rates for companies with high-wage jobs and higher rates for low-wage jobs.\n\n\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Dr. Hira.\n\nMr. Perrotti.\n\n17 OPENING STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN PERROTTI CEO, GLEASON CORP., ROCHESTER, NEW YORK MR. \nPERROTTI: Good morning. Gleason Corporation is headquartered here in Rochester, New York. It was founded in \n1865 and is a producer of gear production equipment or what falls into a category called machine tools. Gleason is \na global company. We've got about 2,400 employees around the world. We do business in 40 countries. 80 percent \nof our business in the last few years has been outside of the United States.\n\nThe machine tool industry is an interesting industry to study. The machine tool industry is the engine of \nmanufacturing. It's not somebody producing components, but it's the machinery and technology that's used to \nproduce those components.\n\nThe United States used to be the world leader in machine tool technology as recently as the 1980s. Today, the \nUnited States is barely in the top ten. The world leaders today are Germany, Japan, Switzerland. The Taiwanese \nand the Chinese are also world leaders. They produce more machine tools than the United States, albeit at a \nsomewhat lower technological level.\n\nSo Gleason's competition is primarily German, Japanese. We do compete to some extent with the Chinese in their \nlocal market, but make no mistake, the Chinese are gaining technically because part of what technology does is \nflatten the competitive playing field. Technology becomes an enabler where companies can advance with their own \nproducts at a more rapid rate. So we are conscious of our Chinese competitors as we develop our strategies.\n\nChina has become the center for manufacturing in the world. It's not a phenomenon unique to the United States in \nterms of seeing China grow its manufacturing base much faster than the United States. Last year China consumed \n25 percent of the machine tools in the world. So one out of every four machine tools in the world has been \npurchased by China. That's twice as many as the next country, which was Japan.\n\nI should also mention that the United States historically for many years was the largest consumer of machine tools, \nand that no longer occurs. I think that's a commentary about the decline of manufacturing in the United States. We \ncan cite that as an outsourcing of jobs, but I think it's a greater reflection of public policy and other priorities in many \nrespects.\n\nChina is an important market for Gleason. When one out of every four machine tools in the world is being \npurchased in China, if you don't have a strategy to compete in China, you don't have a business.\n\nFortunately, for Gleason, we've been doing business in China since the early 1970s. Gleason was actually the \nsecond company after Boeing to sell products into China after the Nixon administration trade talks in the early '70s.\n\nWe have over 2,000 machines in China of which 70 percent of those machines came from our factory right here in \nRochester, New York. For Gleason Corporation, worldwide, last year, one-third of our orders came from China. For \n18 Gleason Corporation in the second quarter, just ended June 30, two-thirds of our machine orders came from \nChina.\n\nAs such, Gleason understands that to maintain leading market share in China, it's very difficult to do it from \nthousands of miles away. You need to have more of a local presence. So, in the past two years, Gleason has \nopened two small facilities in China, in Suzhou China, southeast China. We only have about 40 people there in \ntotal, but we are starting to manufacture some products in China.\n\nThe good news is that's actually creating work here in the United States because many of the components that \nthey're using are still being made here in Rochester, New York. And these are sales we otherwise wouldn't get. \nThese are sales that we would be losing to our other competitors.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Chinese government doing to support or subsidize their industry? It's clear that the Chinese pick certain \nindustries as important.\n\nCountries like Germany, Japan, China, if you were to ask them, machine tools would be in their top ten. In the \nUnited States, I'm not sure machine tools honestly make the top 50 in terms of industries people think as vital to the \nsurvival of the country.\n\nThe incentives that the Chinese offer are not much different than if you went to New York State Economic \nDevelopment. They'll offer tax holidays.\n\nThey'll offer training grants. There may be low-cost loans. They are encouraging R&D centers to locate there. They \ndo put a higher premium on that. Ten years ago, perhaps just getting simple assembly work was important to them. \nToday, they are looking to bring in companies with more advanced technology.\n\nThe Chinese companies have other advantages. Many of them today are still state-owned. They are going through \nprivatization. Some of our local competitors there at one point were state-owned today are privately owned, so they \nare going through a privatization process.\n\nBut the state-owned companies do have an advantage. Many of them still operate under a model which is volume-\ndriven and profitability isn't so important.\n\nThey have access to capital that in a free market one might not have such access to. They do benefit from lower \nraw material costs, lower energy costs, many of these through governmental programs and subsidies.\n\nSo the overall costs of doing business, not just labor costs-- but the overall costs of doing business in China are \nlower. But we're even seeing those costs of doing business increasing further in this country.\n\nAnd why is Gleason in China? Gleason is in China not to make it an export hub, not to chase low labor costs, \nbecause for most manufacturers, labor is a relatively low percentage of their product costs. We're in China \nbecause one out of every four machine tools in the world is being purchased in China, and if you aren't there, then \nyou are not going to be able to compete in this market. So we're in China to be closer to our customer.\n\nThere is no doubt there are companies that have moved operations to China to try to make it an export hub \nbecause the reality is there is a lower cost of doing business there.\n\n19 I see my time is expired, but what I will say in terms of what U.S. policy needs to focus on, in my judgment, is the \nthings that will create a healthy economy here in the United States are the same things that will help us compete \nwith the Chinese. To blame any of our economic problems on the Chinese I think would be misguided. It's the \nthings we need to focus on here, starting with talent.\n\nMy greatest challenge as CEO of Gleason, and relative to our operations in the United States, is a lack of high-level \ntechnical talent. Yes, we need machinists, but even more importantly than that, I need high-level engineers.\n\nToday, to find high-level engineers, I have to hire those from abroad, and then to bring them to the United States, \nit's quite an exercise to try to get them to come here because of some of the immigration rules and to keep them \nhere.\n\nThat's a serious problem, and it honestly makes a CEO of a multinational company sometimes wonder if it's worth \nit when you have the option to do it in other places. So talent is at the top of the list.\n\nAnd beyond that, then, it's the common things you hear about, which I hate to recite, but they're true: the issue of \ntaxes; the issue of regulatory costs; energy; health care; all the things you read about everyday involving \ncompanies that have no interaction with China, either China as a competitor or China as a market.\n\n\n\nThose are the things that ultimately will enable U.S. companies to succeed, to grow, to be able to export, and to \ncreate jobs.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. John Perrotti CEO, Gleason Corp., Rochester, New York My \nname is John Perrotti. I am President and Chief Executive Officer of Gleason Corporation (\"Gleason\") which is \nheadquartered in Rochester, New York. Gleason, founded in 1865, is the world's leading provider of gear \nproduction solutions. Our company designs and manufactures advanced machinery and tooling used in producing \nall types of gears. We have approximately 8,000 customers around the world operating in a variety of industries \nincluding automotive, energy, truck, construction, industrial equipment, aerospace, marine and power tools.\n\nGleason is a global company. We have nine manufacturing plants around the world including three in the United \nStates, our in Europe and three in Asia. Our three factories in Asia include two small facilities recently opened in \nSuzhou, China to support that rapidly expanding market. Gleason sells to over forty countries each year with 75% \nto 80% of our total sales outside of the United States. To support our global customer base we have 2,400 \nemployees located in twenty countries throughout the world.\n\nGleason participates within an industry sector called \"machine tools\". Machine tools are metalworking machinery \nthat have sophisticated computer-based motion control systems which allow the machine to perform a range of \ntasks with high productivity and repeatability while achieving high precision levels.\n\nMachine tools represent the \"engine\" of manufacturing and the advances in machine tool technology have been a \nvital part of the remarkable strides made in manufacturing productivity in the past decade. The United States as \nrecently as the 1980s was the global leader in this technology and in the production of machine tools, but today with \na general decline in manufacturing within our country, the United States is now barely in the top ten producing \ncountries of machine tools. Japan and Germany, who consider machine tools as vital to their long-term economic \nprosperity, have emerged as the technology leaders. China and Taiwan are also top 20 producers of machine tools, \nbut typically with less technologically advanced products. In the past two years China has consumed 25% of all the \nmachine tools produced in the world. China is purchasing more than two times the amount of machine tools \ncompared to the next highest country. The United States had historically also been the largest global consumer of \nmachine tools. This again highlights a worrisome trend about the state of manufacturing within our country.\n\nWith compelling statistics such as China purchasing one out of every four machine tools in the world it becomes \napparent that participants within our industry need to actively serve this market. Fortunately for Gleason, we have a \nlong history in China. My understanding is that Gleason was the second company (after Boeing) to ship product to \nChina in the early 1970s after trade was established under the Nixon administration. Our sales and service branch \nin China started in 1985 and currently there are more than 2,000 of our machines installed in China. In 2008, \nGleason Corporation on a global basis had record high new order levels with approximately one-third of those total \norders coming from customers in China.\n\nIn the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, China accounted for two- thirds of our new order volume for machines \nalbeit at lower levels than last year due to the global recession.\n\nToday, we have approximately 60 employees located throughout China supporting our sales and service activities. \nIn the past two years, we have started producing machines and the consumable cutting tools used on our machines \nin Suzhou, China. Today our manufacturing presence in China is on a relatively small scale with about 40 \nemployees and a few million dollars of sales from the products we produce there, but we realize to succeed in the \nlong-term in this large and growing market we need to have an even greater local presence.\n\nOne of Gleason's largest factories is located here in Rochester. This factory makes advanced machinery for the \nproduction of bevel gears. This factory similar to our entire company counts China as one of its key markets. More \nthan 70% of the total machines that Gleason has shipped to and installed in China over the past thirty five years \nwere produced in our factory in Rochester.\n\nI cannot state strongly enough that the Chinese market is critical to Gleason's future growth and survival.\n\n\n\nThe growth in the Chinese economy has had a direct and significant benefit for Gleason in the past and its \nimportance in the future appears even greater. However, Gleason is not alone in selling its products into the \nChinese market. Because of the technical sophistication of our products most of our competitors are European and \nJapanese. These competitors are very aggressive in selling their products into China and are also establishing local \noperations to manufacture and support their products. There are Chinese companies manufacturing products \nsimilar to ours, but they are generally still perceived to be a level lower in terms of technology. Our local Chinese \ncompetitors are a mix of state-owned enterprises and privately owned Chinese companies. Today, our Chinese \ncompetitors are primarily serving their local market and are only exporting a small percentage of their products. \nHowever, each year they advance further in their technological development and no doubt will become global \ncompetitors in the not too distant future. These Chinese firms are aggressive and are continuing to invest with the \nability to acquire the same advanced components and production equipment we use to manufacture our products. \nChinese universities are graduating more than ten times the number of engineers compared to the U.S. which will \nform a strong and technically competent labor base for the future. I see the emergence of China as not totally \ndifferent from the rise in the manufacturing base in Japan and Korea over the past decades.\n\nOf course, one potential difference is the involvement of the Chinese central government in sponsoring these \nindustries. The Chinese have certain industries which they see as critical to their long-term growth and security. \nThey recognize machine tools as one of these key industries. As such the machine tool companies which are state-\nowned companies have access to capital which in a true free market would probably not be so readily available. \nCertain of these companies would not survive based upon their own financial performance.\n\nUniversities are subsidized to support research and development of higher level engineers and certain incentives \nare offered to multinational companies, particularly those bringing advanced technology or R&D 21 centers, to \nChina. Incentives for companies to expand in China are not so different than those generally offered by state \ngovernments within the United States, including tax holidays, training grants and low-cost loans. In addition as a \nresult of certain government policies many of the basic expenses of doing business, including health care, energy, \nacquisition of certain raw materials and regulatory costs are less in China compared to many other countries. As \ntheir currency is not freely traded, many economists estimate it is artificially weaker by some 40% further fueling \nChinese manufacturers' ability to export. China also has significantly lower corporate tax rates than the United \nStates, but this unfortunately is not that unusual as most of the industrialized world has lower corporate tax rates \ncompared to our country and our state.\n\nWhy did Gleason decide to establish a local manufacturing presence in China? The primary reason being it is now \nthe largest single global market for our products and still growing at a double digit percentage annual rate. Our \nEuropean, Japanese and Chinese competitors continue to expand their capabilities in serving this market. Gleason \nto compete effectively must have a robust local infrastructure in order to provide pricecompetitive products and the \nrequired technical support to our customers. Because of the geographic distance and language barriers in doing \nbusiness in China the only way to have significant market share for certain products is to be present in the local \nmarket. We manufacture some of the key sub-assemblies for the products we make in China here in Rochester \ncreating incremental business which would otherwise not exist.\n\nGleason did not begin production in China to capitalize on low labor rates or to make it an export hub for our \nproducts. We may export from China in the future but our primary mission is to serve the large and growing local \nmarket. Another objective in expanding in China is to build our technical staff which can bring value to us not only \nin China, but on a global basis. With manufacturing becoming a smaller part of the overall U.S. economy, one of the \nunfortunate consequences is the supporting infrastructure including university research, supply chain and \navailability of technical talent is diminishing within our country. We find ourselves more and more looking abroad for \nhigher level technical talent. Gleason positions itself as the technology leader within our industry so this is an area \nwhere can make no compromises. We must have the best and brightest engineers to maintain our market \nleadership.\n\n\n\nSo what government policies would Gleason like to see to support our continued success and ability to create jobs \nhere in the United States? First, we cannot afford any form of protectionism, certainly not when our global \ncompetitors are under no such restrictions. We cannot let political agendas interfere with free trade.\n\nThere are certain minimum expectations we should have of our trading partners, but these expectations need to be \naligned with the global community or else we will put American companies at a severe disadvantage which will have \nfar worse consequences than what one was trying to guard against in the first place. I have a personal core \nphilosophy of \"starting with the man in the mirror\". Blaming China, for example, for the decline in our manufacturing \nbase or job losses is energy largely wasted in my judgment. The majority of the manufacturing jobs lost in our \ncountry and state over the past two decades are generally not because the \"jobs have been shipped to China\" but \nbecause the jobs in many instances have been replaced by automated solutions. For example, a battery of five \nGleason machines today can do what fifty machines used to do twenty years ago. Today there is typically one \nperson operating the five machines compared to what may have been fifty operators creating the same output in \nthe past. By the way, the Chinese today employ fewer in manufacturing jobs compared to just a few years ago \nbecause of the very same automated solutions which they now use in their factories. However, it is clear that \nbuilding and maintaining a strong manufacturing sector seems to be a more critical priority for many countries, \nincluding China, than for the U.S.\n\nHave U.S. companies shifted some of their manufacturing capacity to China; the answer is clearly \"yes\". The \nreasons why will vary by company, but in part it is to support that growing market as is mainly the case with \nGleason and in part it is because there is generally a significantly lower cost of doing business-all around, not just \nlabor cost. For most producers the direct labor cost is a relatively small component of their overall product cost. It \nis all the items discussed previously including taxes, regulatory and health care costs where U.S. policy can help \nmanufacturers.\n\n22 In addition to lowering the costs of doing business, companies need the basic skill sets in their talent pool.\n\nGovernment needs to focus more intensely on education all the way from basic math and science skills to higher \nlevel research. Many of the qualified higher level engineers are from different countries that come here for their \nadvanced education. We should be honored and look at this as a great opportunity to retain this talent to work and \ncontribute to American companies. However, many of these talented young people face severe hurdles to remain in \nthis country and to practice what they have learned here. Even if these uniquely talented individuals were allowed to \nremain in this country they may choose not to with growing tax burdens and the cost of living within the U.S. In \ntoday's world, people are very mobile and we as a country need to be more competitive to incent people with \nadvanced levels of education to live here. As I stated earlier, finding and developing high level engineering talent in \nthe U.S. is one of Gleason's foremost challenges.\n\nTo achieve long-term economic prosperity requires government policies which are not only pro-trade but recognize \nthis as one of the cornerstones of economic growth and national security. Significant trade imbalances driven by \ntariff rates, for example, must be rectified over time. However, these decisions again must be guided by economic \nfairness for global consumers and not clouded by other issues.\n\nThe easing of policy restrictions in certain areas including with EXIM Bank which is used to finance product sales to \ndeveloping countries and export control laws on technologically advanced products to certain endusers should also \nbe considered to put American companies on even footing with foreign competitors.\n\nIn summary, doing the right things to help our economy at home in terms of creating a more \"business friendly\" \nenvironment - lower taxes, sensible regulation, improved education, and greater support of research at both the \nuniversity and private levels-are what will allow American businesses to succeed by exporting more of their \nproducts and creating new jobs.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Mr. Perrotti. Very helpful.\n\nDr. Shih.\n\n\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF DR. WILLY C. SHIH PROFESSOR OF MANANGEMENT PRACTICE, HARVARD \nBUSINESS SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS DR. SHIH: Chairman Bartholomew, Commissioners, \nCommission staff, thank you very much for the invitation to speak with you today.\n\nI think you're addressing a very important topic. As was mentioned before, I spent 18 years in the computer \nindustry. I started my career at IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. And I came here to Rochester in July 1997 and \nassumed the position as President of Digital and Applied Imaging, which represented Kodak's nascent efforts in the \nconsumer digital arena.\n\nI was then President of the Display and Components business unit, and simultaneously led Kodak's Intellectual \nProperty strategy until I left the company in February 2005.\n\nI'm pleased to tell you that both my daughters completed their high school education here in Rochester.\n\nProfessor Gary Pisano and I recently published an article in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review \nentitled \"Restoring America's Competitiveness.\" In this article, we argue that as a consequence of not thinking \nabout potential long-term implications of some types of outsourcing as well as 23 faltering investment in research, \nthe U.S. has lost or is on the verge of losing its ability to develop and manufacture many high-tech products.\n\nWe talk about the idea of an \"industrial commons\"--the collective R&D, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities \nin a region that sustain innovation.\n\nHistorically, the \"commons\" refer to the land where animals belonging to people in the community would graze. \nCommons did not belong to any one farmer, but all farmers were better off for having access to it. We describe an \nindustrial commons in an analogous fashion embodying the R&D know-how, advanced process development and \nengineering skills, and manufacturing competencies related to specific technologies.\n\nOne finds such resources embedded in companies, universities, often even in different intermediate customers and \nusers in the value network. The capabilities in an industrial commons sustain all the companies that access it, and it \nis the foundation of capabilities upon which other companies can build.\n\nI want to give you some examples. When I came to Kodak, one of the efforts I was to lead was the establishment of \na digital camera business. I think everyone in the region certainly remembers that George Eastman built the \nEastman Kodak Company on his innovations in roll film. And for a century, Kodak made its profits on film. Cameras \nwere a vehicle, if you will, for the film to be consumed. The company made low-cost cameras for the mass market, \nbut it let the mid and high-end of the camera business shift to Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. It was kind of hard to \nmake money in cameras, but the profits were in film anyways.\n\nNow digital cameras were different. There was no film, but now in a turnabout, the components of the camera \nbecame key generators of value.\n\nConsumers wanted zoom lenses, but the industrial cluster, or commons, for lenses was in Japan. Digital cameras \nused electronic image sensors, a technology invented in the United States that had migrated to Japan with the rest \nof the consumer electronics industry when Asian companies started to build camcorders.\n\nAnd, of course, the coolest thing about a digital camera was the ability to view a picture immediately on the little \nelectronic display. That was another technology invented in the United States that had moved to Asia. We talk \nabout the loss of the display industry in the paper as well and the consequences of that.\n\nSo there was no commons, or capabilities, in the United States, or specifically in Rochester, to develop and \nmanufacture a product whose technological underpinnings all came from the United States, many of them from \nKodak's own research labs, as a look at Kodak's patent portfolio will show.\n\nDid I outsource digital cameras to Asia? Actually we bought a company in Japan that was well-connected to the \ncommons in the greater Nagano region so we could tap into that cluster of resources. That was where we did our \n\n\n\ncamera design and manufacturing initially. Ultimately, we moved camera manufacturing to China where costs were \nlower because if we wanted the American consumer to purchase our products, and the United States is far and \naway our largest market, we had to be price competitive at retailers like Wal-Mart. Assembly labor costs were \nsubstantially less in China, and the cost differential would have made us woefully 24 uncompetitive if we had \nassembled cameras in the United States.\n\nCould we have done manufacturing in Rochester? Actually we tried. We had set up a highly-automated assembly \nline at the former Elmgrove site on the west side of town, but it was not as flexible as the manufacturing in Asia, nor \nwas the cost competitive, and almost all of the components would have had to come from Asia in any case \nbecause they simply aren't made in the United States.\n\nSo what was the lesson there? 30 years ago, manufacturing sophisticated cameras was less important than the \nmanufacture of film. So Kodak and others let the commons wither away. Was it a sensible decision at the time? In \nisolation, probably. A colleague of mine who was the president of a second-tier Japanese camera company once \ntold me, \"In the film era, we camera manufacturers never made money; Kodak made all the money on film.\" He said \nthat with a residual tone of bitterness as his was one of the companies that never made any money on cameras.\n\nBut then a technological shift happened and the decisions made 30 years ago suddenly had irreversible \nconsequences.\n\nI could give you some other examples, but, you know, let me look at the subject of batteries. You know, Kodak was \nin the battery business, and it wasn't the largest player, but the battery manufacturers in the U.S. kind of ceded the \nrechargeable battery business to the Asians because we weren't interested in the consumer electronics business. \nNow, there's this little company called BYD in China, who is the second-largest manufacturer of lithium ion \nbatteries.\n\nThey also make cars. I was just in China for several weeks, and we used a little taxi company, and one of their taxis \nwas a BYD car so we were riding around in it all the time.\n\nBYD has announced their intention to produce electric cars. Let's see.\n\nWorld's second-largest battery manufacturer and a maker of cars. The Chinese government strategically is using \nthe transition to hybrid and electric vehicles as an opportunity to assert global leadership in the next generation of \nautomobiles unburdened by a gasoline-powered vehicle manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nSo why do managers make these seemingly short-sighted decisions to outsource in the first place? More often than \nnot, I would argue it's not driven by greed, but it's driven by cost pressure and the need to be competitive.\n\nIf you spend any time analyzing retail sales, you find American consumers are very cost conscious; price matters a \ngreat deal. And a lot of manufacturing outsourcing is driven by pure labor cost arbitrage. So once a major player \noutsources in an industry, everybody else is forced to follow. So short-term decisions, as I've said, about the \ncommons can have a much longer-term impact.\n\nJust some other thoughts. I think other countries for years have been strategically thinking about industries they \nwant to foster and grow. Taiwan is a good example, which now has the bulk of the semiconductor foundry industry \nin the world.\n\nChina's 863 program, , so named because it was launched in March of 1986, targets specific industries and \ncompetencies that the country wants to do.\n\n25 We comment further in our article, which I'll incorporate by reference, on some of the things that Washington and \ncompanies operating in America need to work together to reinvigorate this industrial commons and restore our \ncompetitiveness. I think it's a long-term issue, and my hope is that the Commission will be able to highlight the \nimportance of these issues.\n\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Willy C. Shih Professor of Management Practice, Harvard \nBusiness School, Boston, Massachusetts Co-Chairman Shea, Co-Chairman Mulloy, other panel members, \ncommission staff, and other distinguished guests, good morning, and thank you for the invitation to speak with you \nthis morning. I believe that you are addressing a very important topic, one that has had a significant impact on the \nregion, and America as a whole.\n\nI would like to begin with some background on myself. I began my professional career in the Hudson Valley, at IBM \nCorporation in Poughkeepsie, in downstate New York. I spent fourteen years at IBM, followed by another four \nyears at two other computer companies, the Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard, Massachusetts, followed by \nSilicon Graphics Computer Systems in Mountain View, California. In July 1997, I came to the Eastman Kodak \nCompany here in Rochester, and several weeks later assumed the position of President of the Digital and Applied \nImaging unit, which represented Kodak's nascent efforts in the consumer digital arena. The team that I was \nprivileged to lead there was a great team, and I was with that business until the end of 2003. I then was President of \nthe Display and Components business unit, and simultaneously led Kodak's Intellectual Property strategy until I left \nthe company in February 2005. It was a period of great excitement, and of some real ups and downs. When I \nworked at Kodak my family and I lived in Pittsford, not far from here, and I am pleased to tell you that both of my \ndaughters completed their high school education here.\n\nI subsequently joined Thomson, a French company, and was based in Princeton, New Jersey but I also had offices \nin Burbank, California and Paris, France. Thomson, I should mention, owned what remained of the RCA \nCorporation, the pioneer in recorded music, radio, and of course color television, having received it as part of a \nfamous \"trade\" with GE.\n\nI joined the faculty at the Harvard Business School in January 2007, where I have been teaching in the second year \nof the MBA program as well as the Executive Education program. The focus of my research there has been on \ncompanies operating in Asia in technology sectors, and I just returned from my seventh trip to Asia this year, where \nwe have major research studies going on in China and Taiwan.\n\nProfessor Gary Pisano and I recently published an article in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review \nentitled, \"Restoring America's Competitiveness.\" In this article, we argue that as a consequence of not thinking \nabout potential long term implications of some types of outsourcing, as well as faltering investment in research, the \nU.S. has lost or is on the verge of losing its ability to develop and manufacture many high-tech products. We talk \nabout the idea of an \"industrial commons\" - the collective R&D, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities in a \nregion that sustain innovation. Historically, the \"commons\" referred to the land where animals belonging to people in \nthe community would graze. The commons did not belong to any one farmer, but all farmers were better off for \nhaving access to it. We describe an industrial commons in an analogous fashion, embodying the R&D know-how, \nadvanced process development and engineering skills, and manufacturing competences related to specific \ntechnologies. One finds such resources embedded in companies, universities, often even the different intermediate \ncustomers and users in the value network. The capabilities in an industrial commons sustain all the companies that \naccess it, and it is a foundation of capabilities upon which those companies can build.\n\n26 It was during my years at Kodak, when I made many trips a year to Asia, that I started to think a lot about this \ntopic.\n\nLet me give you some examples that illustrate the often unforeseen long term consequences of letting a commons \nerode.\n\nWhen I came to Kodak, one of the efforts I was to lead was the establishment of a digital camera business. I think \neveryone in this region certainly remembers that George Eastman built the Eastman Kodak Company on his \ninnovations in roll film. And for a century, Kodak made its profits on film - cameras were a \"vehicle\" for the film to be \nconsumed. The company made low cost cameras for the mass market, but it let the mid and high end of the \n\n\n\ncamera business shift to Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. It was very hard to make money in cameras, but the profits \nwere in film anyways.\n\nDigital cameras were different. There was no film, but now in a turnabout, the components of the camera became \nkey generators of value. Consumers wanted zoom lenses, but the industrial cluster, or commons, for lenses was in \nJapan. Digital cameras used electronic image sensors, a technology invented in the United States that had \nmigrated to Japan with the rest of the consumer electronics industry when Asian companies started to build \ncamcorders. And the coolest thing about a digital camera was the ability to view the picture immediately on a little \nelectronic display.\n\nThat was another technology invented in the United States that had moved to Asia. We talk about the loss of the \ndisplay industry and the consequences in our article as well.\n\nSo there was no commons, no capabilities, in the United States, or specifically in Rochester, to develop and \nmanufacture a product whose technological underpinnings all came from the United States, many of them from \nKodak's own Research Labs, as a look at Kodak's patent portfolio will show.\n\nDid I outsource digital cameras to Asia? Actually, we bought a company in Japan that was well connected to the \ncommons in the greater Nagano region of Japan so that we could tap into that cluster of resources. That was where \nwe did our camera design and manufacturing initially. Ultimately we moved camera manufacturing to China, where \ncosts were lower. Because if we wanted the American consumer to purchase our products, and the United States \nwas far and away our largest market, we had to be price competitive at retailers like Wal- Mart. Assembly labor \ncosts were substantially less in China, and the cost differential would have made us woefully uncompetitive if we \nhad assembled cameras in the United States. We did do much of our firmware and software in the United States, in \nRochester and in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nCould we have done manufacturing in Rochester? Actually, we tried. We had set up a highly automated assembly \nline at the former Elmgrove site. But it was not as flexible as manufacturing in Asia, nor was the cost competitive.\n\nAnd almost all of the components would have come from Asia in any case, because they simply were not made in \nthe United States.\n\nWas there a lesson in this? I think so. Thirty years ago, manufacturing sophisticated cameras was less important \nthan the manufacture of film. So Kodak and others let the commons wither away. Was it a sensible decision at the \ntime? In isolation, probably. A colleague of mine who was the president of a second tier Japanese camera company \nonce told me, \"In the film era, we camera manufacturers never made money.\n\nKodak made all the money on film.\" He said that with a tone of residual bitterness, as his was one of the companies \nthat had never made money on film cameras. But then a technological shift happened, and the decisions made \nthirty years ago suddenly had irreversible consequences.\n\nLet me give you another example. In my last year at Kodak, I managed what was then called the Display and \nComponents business. Ching Tang, a scientist at Kodak Research Labs, discovered the phenomena know as \norganic electroluminescence back in the late 1980s. This is the foundation for a technology called OLED, which \nstands for organic light emitting display. Some of you may have seen Sony's remarkable OLED television, and I \nwas just talking to an Asian display manufacturer last week who said OLEDs would be the next big thing for them.\n\nBut here was the problem. Fashioning a display out of OLED materials required the capability to fabricate large 27 \nthin film transistor arrays on thin sheets of glass, as is done in the LCD flat panel display industry. LCD flat panel \ndisplays were invented in the United States as well, but the capital costs and the skills for that type of \nmanufacturing left these shores in the 1990s, for Japan, Korea, Taiwan and now China. For a while I considered the \npossibility of purchasing the manufacturing tools and setting up a line in the United States. But essentially every \nother such production line in the world was located in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, or China. If a tool went down and one \nneeded a service call in Taiwan or Korea, a technician could come over in maybe 20 minutes. In the United States, \n\n\n\nit might take a week. We ended up setting up a joint venture production line in Japan, because you need access to \na production line if you want to commercialize this type of technology. Much of the innovation and the obstacles to \ncommercialization were in the manufacturing process. The commons did not exist in North America, a result of \ndecisions made a decade earlier, by other companies.\n\nLet me look at the subject of batteries. Kodak developed some pretty advanced battery technology too, but was not \nthe U.S. market leader. Who would have thought that batteries, rechargeable batteries, would become so important \nan area? Certainly not the other large U.S. based battery manufacturers, who didn't really want to chase the \nrechargeables market. Most innovation in batteries in recent decades has been driven by the demands of consumer \nelectronics products for portable power in small packages. So when U.S. companies largely abandoned the \n\"mature\" consumer electronics business, the locus of R&D and manufacturing - not just for the laptops, cell phones, \nand such but also for the batteries that power them - shifted to Asia. The Chinese company BYD is now the second \nlargest manufacturer of lithium ion batteries in the world. And BYD is also an auto manufacturer. When I was in \nChina over the last few weeks, we used quite extensively a little taxi company with two cars, one of which was a \nBYD, so we rode around in it quite a bit. It was not a bad little car - it reminded me of where Korea was 10 years \nago, and of Japanese cars from the mid 1980s. BYD has announced their intention to produce electric cars, and I \nbelieve the Chinese government strategically is using the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles as an opportunity \nto assert global leadership in the next generation of automobiles, unburdened by a gasoline powered vehicle \nmanufacturing infrastructure.\n\nWhy do managers make these seeming short-sighted decisions to outsource in the first place? More often than not, \nit is not driven by greed, but it is driven by cost pressure and the need to be competitive. If you spend any time \nanalyzing retail sales, you find that American consumers are very cost conscious - price matters a great deal. A lot \nof manufacturing outsourcing is driven by pure labor cost arbitrage, the ability to reduce costs by taking advantage \nof lower factor costs in another geography. But when a major player in an industry outsources an activity, cuts \nfunding for long-term research, and gains a short-term cost advantage, competitive pressure often forces rivals to \nfollow suit. Next potential employment opportunities shrink, experienced people change jobs or move out of the \nregion, and students shy away from entering the field. Eventually, the commons loses the essential critical mass of \nwork, skills, and scientific knowledge and can no longer support providers of upstream and downstream activities, \nwhich are, in their turn, forced to move away as well. Short term decisions, which might make sense in their own \ncontext, have the longer term potential to impact strategic control points for future technologies.\n\nThe problem I am describing has been years in the making. It is the consequence of what I sometimes call \"logical \nincrementalism,\" in which individual decisions made with a local context and shorter horizon, seem to make sense.\n\nBut taken together, the long term consequences are not what we bargained for.\n\nHaving said this, I don't think all outsourcing is bad. The global model of vertical specialization and sequential \nproduction that we live in today has brought dramatic improvements in the standard of living to many people, \nespecially here in the United States. And there are many things that are outsourced from the United States that are \njobs people here would not, or could not do. We as a country need to look forward, and think carefully and \nstrategically about what we do want to keep, and what do we want to nurture for the future. We need to recognize \nareas that embody capabilities that will be the underpinnings of important technologies for the future, and we need \nto recognize that the capacity to undertake advanced process engineering and complex manufacturing is important \nto continued innovation.\n\nOther countries have for years thought strategically about the industries that they want to foster and grow. I am not \n28 speaking just of China. Japan in the 1970s, Taiwan in the 1970s and 1980s, Singapore, Korea, all have \nexhibited visionary thinking and planned for the long term. One of my good friends and colleagues was one of the \nfathers of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. As a government researcher, he was part of the original team that \ntravelled to RCA in New Jersey, to transfer its CMOS process to Taiwan. He then spent the next thirty years of his \nlife trying to foster the development of the right types of capabilities within local industry. They put a lot of energy \nand government funding into the growth of a commons, through its Industrial Technology Research Institute, which \n\n\n\nhe ultimately headed. Today Taiwan has 70% of the world's semiconductor foundry capacity, and they are \nrecognized as world leaders not only in semiconductors, but in LEDs, PC design, and information displays.\n\nChina's \"863\" program framed its long term technology development goals in 1986. Subject areas included \ninformation technology, biotechnology and advanced agricultural technology, advanced materials, energy \ntechnology, and resource and environmental technology. It targeted specific product categories and know-how that \nthe country needed to develop. This program was not about currency manipulation or trade barriers, it was about \nwhat capabilities the country wanted to establish, what strategic industries they wanted to foster. China as well as \nother nations were only too happy to see the American companies abandon area after area in pursuit of short term \nprofits. Should we fault them for capitalizing on our myopia? So what do we do? I think Washington and companies \noperating in America need to work together to reinvigorate the industrial commons. A few of the things that we \nsuggest in our article include: Reverse the slide in the funding of basic and applied science. Government funding for \nbasic research has been flat to declining over the last six years, and funding for applied research has dropped \nsharply. Historically, government programs like the DARPA VLSI program in the early 1980s or National Science \nFoundation funding of the NSFNet have had led to ground-breaking innovation and growth of entire new industries.\n\nFocus resources on solving \"grand challenge problems.\" Programs like the sequencing of the human genome, big \ncomplex problems like climate change, such problems require tremendous resources and coordination. We rally \nto such challenges in this country. And the benefits in generating new capabilities in universities, companies and \nthe commons are lasting and profound. But that also means that we have to look at the granting process, and move \nit beyond the safe and incremental to the higher risk, higher return cross discipline challenges that the U.S. is \nsupremely good at tackling.\n\nWe suggest that companies need to make capabilities the main pillar of their strategies. Capabilities are the \nfoundation on which innovative products are built. There are some exemplary upstate companies in this regard - \nCorning and IBM Research.\n\nCompanies need to stop blaming Wall Street for short-term behavior. I understand why it happens, the pressure for \nshort term earnings can be huge. But I think this is a matter of choice for executives. Again, to cite Corning, there \nstock has had its ups and downs. But when you talk to people responsible for the long term strategy of the \ncompany, they think about the next 150 years and invest for the long term. And they end up having the stockholders \nthey deserve.\n\nCompany managers need to recognize the limits of financial tools. I have worked in a company where every key \nR&D project was evaluated by a tool called net present value or NPV. I suspect one reason they did this was it \nrelieved top executives of the need to understand the details of the projects, including their longer term strategic \nimplications. The problem with a lot of these tools is that you need data in order to use them. And data is only \navailable on the past, and good data is really only available on the distant past. Informed judgment is a better guide \nto making such decisions than analytical models loaded with arbitrary assumptions.\n\nWe all need to reinvigorate basic and applied research. I've cited Corning and IBM as great New York State \nexamples. Locally the University of Rochester, R.I.T., Kodak's Research Labs, Xerox, U. of R.'s Laser Energetics \nLab, there are rich resources and capabilities in the area.\n\n29 There are many things we as a country can do to set ourselves on a better course for the future. The Federal \ngovernment, and to a lesser extent state governments have long played a role in supporting technological \ninnovation.\n\nAs we discuss in our article, programs like DARPA's VLSI Program, the National Science Foundation Network, the \nsequencing of the human genome - these programs produced tremendous benefits by creating capabilities in \nuniversities and companies - and in the commons. And the Albany Nanotech initiative is making the Hudson Valley \na key development area in the future of microelectronics and nanotech. The recent groundbreaking of the new \nGlobalFoundries fab in Luther Forest is a testimony to this, and it complements the ongoing investment by IBM in \n\n\n\nmicroelectronics at East Fishkill. These are all steps that hold great promise for upstate New York, as long as we \ntrain people for the new types of jobs that they will create.\n\nI hope we can turn our recognition of the challenges we face into concrete steps that will start to address this \nproblem. Only by rejuvenating our high-tech sector can we hope to return to the path of sustained growth needed \nto pay down our enormous deficits and raise our citizens' standard of living.\n\nThank you very much for your attention.\n\nPanel I: Discussion, Questions and Answers HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Doctor. Very important \ntestimony.\n\nNow we'll start the questioning. Commissioner Blumenthal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Thank you all very much. It was very interesting and useful testimony.\n\nI'm going to throw out a couple comments and questions and have you answer them together. One thing I did not \nhear much about is China itself. What you said about the Gleason Corporation, that made a lot of sense to me. \nChina is a huge market, and it's kind of a good news story for you in many ways. You want to export machine tools \nto China because it's a growing economy, and it's at a certain phase, and it needs these machine tools.\n\nThe problems are back here is what you said--the immigration problems, the need for capturing human talent, \nand nurturing it and keeping it here in the United States--but it doesn't seem to me that any of you said it's anything \nChina itself is doing unfairly.\n\nIt sounds more like we have some fiscal, immigration, and other types of problems, back here that are hurting us. \nThat's just one comment I'd want you to respond to.\n\nDr. Hira, the one thing that I'm puzzled about is this trade in advanced technology surplus. When you look at the \nWorld Economic Forum Competitiveness Index, we're still at the way top and China is way behind us, and even \nwith all the problems that you mentioned, I wonder, what do you mean by advanced technological products? Is \nthere a particular--Dr. Shih pointed out the lithium business--but are there are particular sectors or industries or \ncompanies that the Chinese are really developing in terms of competing or are putting out or actually pushing out \nour top most innovative companies? Do you see that coming down the line? I wanted a little bit more specificity in \nterms of what we mean by advanced technological 30 products and which companies and which sectors are \nactually in some trouble.\n\nAnd then I would just throw out the general comment, going back to the Gleason Corporation's testimony, which is \nwould you all agree with the statement that attracting the best human talent to the United States and keeping it here \nis something that we can do much better than the Chinese, and is that something we should focus on as an answer \nto some of these problems? So each one of you. Start with Dr. Hira, and go down.\n\nDR. HIRA: Sure. Let me address this issue of whether, what China is doing actively to attract R&D centers. If you \ntalk to people who are in the business, what they'll say, and they don't want to say this on the record very often, \nwhat they'll say is that there's a linkage. If you want to take, if you're a foreign multinational corporation, and you \nwant to take advantage of the low cost production work, you need to transfer technology; you need to establish an \nR&D center in China as kind of a quid pro quo.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Is that illegal? Is that wrong? Is that unfair? Is that against obligations? DR. \nHIRA: I do not know if it's illegal or not. I think fairness is a normative judgment. It is active policy. As far as \neverybody I've spoken to, there's a consensus that this goes on.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: So should we be doing that in response? DR. HIRA: I think that we should have \nactive policies to promote R&D centers being established in the U.S., but I think we need to go beyond that, and \nthat's part of what I get into in my testimony.\n\n\n\nFor example, in New York State, we have a major center in nanotechnology and nanoelectronics in Albany. We're \nsubsidizing that in a big way. The R&D.\n\nBut what's more important is not to create R&D jobs, but it's the downstream benefits. The design, development \nand production jobs hopefully will be co-located or, as a taxpayer in New York, that those jobs will stay within New \nYork or at least in the U.S., and I don't think we're talking about those kinds of policies.\n\nWe've been instead just talking about the R&D. The R&D is not the end.\n\nIt's a means to an end.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nDR. HIRA: And it's only a piece. It's a necessary but not sufficient part of the policy that we need to have, and \nwe're not having that discussion, at least within R&D policy and industrial policy.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: My time has gone over so I'd like to just hear some remarks from the rest of you \non the immigration and human talent issues.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Well, let me get to that. The first part of your question I think was essentially talking about is there \na level playing field to compete on, and the answer is probably no. But is there a level playing field to compete on \nwith the Japanese, with the Koreans? You know there are all kinds of different barriers that one faces competing in \nthe world in terms of labor markets, regulations, tariffs, 31 and so forth.\n\nIs the Chinese situation perhaps a bit more skewed? Yes. But, again, from my perspective, I try not to so much to \nfocus on that. I really try to focus on what we need to do as a company because I don't think the playing field is so \nskewed that it's an unwinnable situation.\n\nRelative to the issue of talent, yes, absolutely. As I said in my comments, we need to rebuild a manufacturing \ninfrastructure in this country, and it starts with high-level talent and innovation. That will be the engine that will help \nus to rebuild the manufacturing infrastructure in this country.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Dr. Shih, did you want to comment? DR. SHIH: Let me just add that I think what \nChina is doing, as Mr.\n\nPerrotti said, is no different than what Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, other countries have done. It does \nhave the advantage of what is perceived to be an enormous domestic market.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nDR. SHIH: Which is what helped the United States in the 20th century and the late 19th century. And that's a huge \nadvantage, and selling access to that market essentially is a big difference.\n\nI'd just mention that import substitution is a major drive in China, as it was in Japan and Taiwan earlier and Korea \nearlier, and there is a strong notion of national champions as well.\n\nAs far as particular sectors, one day this country will wake up to what has happened in semiconductors and \noptoelectronics and communication technology and display technology, a whole host of high- tech areas.\n\nAs far as attracting the best talent, one telling observation--I agree with everything that has been said. Certainly \nafter 9/11, for understandable reasons, we have made it much more difficult for people to come to the United \nStates.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\n\n\nDR. SHIH: One of my colleagues in Taiwan told me in the 1990s, 95 percent of the top engineering graduates in \nTaiwan came to the United States.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nDR. SHIH: And he said today zero percent come to the U.S. 95 percent go to China COMMISSIONER \nBLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Commissioner Shea.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: I too want to thank the panelists. I think you've made, each of you have made great \npresentations. I just want to, again, thank you for that.\n\nI just have a couple of questions. I was hoping--I think Dr. Hira touched upon it briefly--but I was hoping if all the \npanelists could describe the importance of innovation, research and development being geographically proximate to \nthe manufacturing process? So, in other words, if the manufacturing process is leaving the United States, that \nimpacts the ability to do effective research and 32 development because you need to be close to the production \nline.\n\nI was wondering if you could just generally talk about that, and if you can give me an example, or maybe you \ndisagree with this proposition? Secondly, this might be for Dr. Shih, but I'd appreciate the other panelists' views. \nYou talk about incrementalism. If you're a CEO of a company and you can outsource a design, outsource \nproduction, lower your costs; you have pressures from shareholders; you have pressures from Wall Street analysts \nto meet projections. How do you tell a CEO not to do that if that is a rational decision? And I think Dr. Shih is saying \nthat it might be rational for that particular moment, but the effect, the cumulative effect of all these rational decisions \nis negative for the United States? I want to explore that a little bit.\n\nSo why don't I start with you, Dr. Hira.\n\nDR. HIRA: Sure. I think that there's been a couple of trends within R&D management, management of R&D, over \nthe past 30 years or so. One of the big ones is the shorter time cycle, and so companies don't do basic research. \nYou know our imagination of the Watson labs and GE's research labs, and what not, or Xerox PARC, for example, \nis an anachronism. It's not true today.\n\nWhat they're doing is if a product doesn't look like it's going to be commercializable within three years or so, they're \nnot doing that research and development. It's much more applied research, much more development. So heavy on \nthe \"D,\" a little bit of \"R.\" And as a result, I think there needs to be a much tighter link, and I think co- location \nbecomes a bigger issue with the production side of things, and so I think there's a stronger pull from manufacturing \nreaching back into the research and development, and I think you see that trend in terms of companies in general.\n\nRegarding your last point, I think it's a really important one. This is not a blame game; right. The CEOs who are \nmaking these decisions are not Benedict Arnold's, as one former presidential candidate tried to label them. They're \nmaking rational decisions based on their incentive structure. We have to think about how we recreate those \nincentives, both through carrots and sticks, through incentives and disincentives, so that their interests are aligned \nwith the country's interests.\n\nWe have to be grown up enough to realize that what's in the interest of IBM is not necessarily in the interest of the \nU.S., but you better believe that IBM's CEO and their team are going to lobby for things that are in the interest of \nIBM even if it's at the expense of the U.S.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Perrotti.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Relative to your first question, yes, having research and development-- ultimately, it needs to be \nnear the manufacturing infrastructure because the two need to go hand-in-hand. Yes, there are advanced tools \n\n\n\ntoday where you can follow the sun and, you know, with the beauty of the Internet and many technologies can do \nmore and more things remote.\n\nBut in our world, particularly with complex technologies and products, you really need to have those things in close \nproximity, which is why it's so important for us to be successful in the United States to have this higher level talent \nnearby.\n\n33 We can't rely on doing the engineering in Europe or Asia because it's not just about creating technology. It's \nbeing able then to commercialize it and the production process related to that.\n\nRelative to CEOs and why they make certain decisions, I think-- HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Are you publicly \ntraded? MR. PERROTTI: We used to be.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: We are privately owned now.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Does that mean easier? MR. PERROTTI: It does.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. PERROTTI: That's a whole another day. I've lived on both sides of that fence, but what has made \nAmerica great are many things, but one of them is its embracing capitalism, and, yes, capitalism perhaps in some \ncases has been misapplied, but in general being profit-driven leads to a lot of good things, and we should never try \nto extinguish that, and with some of the tax burdens people face, one of the reasons people don't want to stay in \nthis country is because of things like taxes and the cost of living here.\n\nAnd we have to do something about it. The United States has the secondhighest corporate tax rates of any \nindustrialized country in the world other than Japan. So, in China, tax rates are 23, 25 percent. In Germany, the tax \nrates are 30 percent. In the U.K., the tax rates are under 30 percent. In the United States, particularly being in New \nYork State, our tax rate is 40 percent.\n\nNow who's going to make decisions to operate in a high-cost environment-- there's no sense going to business \nschool because it teaches you to try to make rational decisions. Who's going to make rational decisions? \n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nDr. Shih.\n\nDR. SHIH: On your first question about tying innovation R&D close to manufacturing process, I cite an example in \nmy written testimony about trying to go into the OLED business here in New York, and essentially all display \nmanufacturing has moved to Asia.\n\nAnd the commercialization process involves very close linkage between R&D, experimentation, process \ndevelopment, and so on. So I think some industries more than others, but, in general, I think it's a vital linkage.\n\nAs far as the pressure from the short term, you know, one thing I'd like to add--I agree with my other panelists here-\n-one of the challenges is there's an active market in corporate control.\n\nOkay. And that means if you as a leader, of a publicly traded company particularly, don't make your numbers on a \nquarter-byquarter basis, you know, somebody else will.\n\nWhen I was here at Kodak, I mentioned earlier that we used to have a New Year's Eve staff meeting, and I'd \nusually open it with \"the prize for winning is you get to play again.\" I mean if you made your numbers and you \nsurvived the year, 34 then we could do another year.\n\nThat was relatively long-term. Most companies operate on a quarter-toquarter basis now, and there's tremendous \npressure on that. When you go to Asia, my colleague, who was the father of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, \n\n\n\nrecognized that the Taiwanese companies were too short-term focused. So he forced long-term R&D because he \nsaid I know you guys are too short-term focused.\n\nThey always complained back to him that, you know, you're competing with me.\n\nHe said but you're too short-term focused to do this. So I'm going to invest in it, and he invested from the \ngovernment standpoint.\n\nI think it's a serious problem, the difference in time horizons. In Asia, I was once told, you know, you guys have \nonly--you guys in the U.S. have only been around 250 years. That's like a dynasty for us.\n\n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: A dynasty.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Slane.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Our job is to make recommendations to Congress. And what's troubling me is what do \nwe recommend to Congress to stop or stem the tide of losing our high-tech industries to offshoring? Dr. Hira.\n\nDR. HIRA: Well, I think there are a lot of lessons from the debates that we had about Japan in the 1980s in \nparticular. A lot of people look back, and I think it's revisionist history, and say, what happened with Japan is okay; \nwe moved on to the Internet and IT, and so what if we lost some sectors to Japan and the like? But I think that's a \nwrong reading of history. We had a long debate, and I think a very fruitful one, in terms of policy measures that \ncame out of our struggle with competing with Japan.\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, the Stevenson-Wydler Act, the Cooperative Research and Development Act, a number \nof different policy measures were taken within innovation policy to really bolster the U.S. One of the biggest ones \nwas something called SEMATECH. It wasn't just autos and steel that we were worried about in terms of losing \nthose sectors.\n\nIt was also semiconductors, and the CEOs of those semiconductor companies, Intel, in particular, Bob Noyce, \nmade the rounds of Washington to push for subsidies. Essentially, what SEMATECH was, was a $500 million a \nyear--and $500 million actually was a lot more back in the '80s--subsidy to the semiconductor industry. But it wasn't \njust a subsidy. It was forcing collaboration amongst the companies. You know there's a lot that went into it.\n\nBut we did that under the umbrella of national security; right. DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency, was the organization that funded SEMATECH.\n\nWe haven't had that discussion about national security, about the defense industrial base this time around, and I \nthink that's one of the major voids in the 35 public discussion because, as I mentioned in my testimony, you're sort \nof dismissed, that, you know, we're just going to move on to the sunrise industries; right? It wasn't that we didn't \nhave that discussion. There were the Atari Democrats--right-- the so-called Atari Democrats back in the '80s. There \nwas a strategy, and there was investment, and there were policies, major policy changes, along the way.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Well, relative to innovation and preserving high- tech industries in the United States, it starts with \nlabor. It starts with talent. You can go all the way back to the fundamental level of math and science skills within our \nschools, which is obviously a longer-term proposition, but I'm sure everyone here is aware that the United States \ndoesn't rank favorably with that.\n\nSo if we want to be the world's leader in terms of high-tech industries, we first have to focus on some of the very \nfundamental things that go back to primary education.\n\nBeyond that, we've talked about talent and retaining high-level talent here.\n\n\n\nOne of the other things I observe traveling the world is that at least in the sectors I interact with is that in foreign \ncountries, not just China, but in all foreign countries--Japan, Korea--there seems to be a tighter relationship in many \ncases between universities and the private sector.\n\nWhether that's because of public policy, what exactly gives rise to that, I don't know, but that is something I think we \nneed to think about, is how we can have universities and the private sector and create incentives there that create \nan even tighter working relationship because I see that more prevalent in some of the, in other foreign countries.\n\nDR. SHIH: Let me just add on your question about losing high-tech to offshoring. Immigration. I will remind us that \nwe are a nation of immigrants, and we've made it very difficult to attract the best and brightest who I believe would \nstill want to come here if we didn't make it so difficult. So that would be one thing.\n\nCost of capital, I think that's a large complicated issue. Craig Barrett, retired chairman of Intel, has testified on \nnumerous occasions that if you look at the tax and location--factor costs associated with operating a fab in the \nUnited States over the ten year life of a fab, it's typically about $1 billion more than in other countries.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: To operate it? DR. SHIH: Direct. Direct costs of ownership. I think the last time he \ntestified on that was probably about three or four years ago. What we're now seeing is even larger incentives, not \nonly in China, but in other places, where there's direct subsidies which influence the cost of capital.\n\nGlobalFoundries' new facility in Luther Forest received a large incentive as well, but, you know, that's sort of the \nstakes that is happening. Tax and cost of capital.\n\nLet me reinforce what my other panelists said about talent and skills. If 36 you are operating a fab in Taiwan --and \nI've been through many of the fabs there-- they have machine operators who are masters in electrical engineering \nor industrial engineering. Okay. There's a level of skill and qualification for some of these jobs, and the universities--\nin fact, I was just in a debate in Taiwan on this last week, where some of the companies said, you know, you \nuniversities need to train our operators a little bit more--okay-- whereas, the universities were saying, no, we need \nto focus on the long term; you're responsible for training your operators.\n\nBut you don't even have that discussion in the United States. Okay. And one of my concerns, and I don't know how \nto address this, is that, you know, as long as our young people would rather be a sports hero or an entertainment \ncelebrity, as opposed to, you know, a technological leader, that's very troubling to me. I see that in my two children \nwho are in technology--okay--and are wondering what is their future. My younger daughter is a mechanical \nengineer. I don't know if I had any influence on that, but anyways-- [Laughter.] DR. SHIH: But it's troubling. It's a \ncomplicated problem, but I think we can start to address some of those very straightforward things like, you know, \ntaxation and cost of capital.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Videnieks.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions maybe for all three of you, \nbut Mr. Perrotti, you mentioned that a large part of your business, machine tools, is with China. My understanding \nwas, from prior testimony to this Commission, that they are primarily assemblers. I'm not conversant on the topic, \nbut are they wrong? How do machine tools fit into assembly of imported components? MR. PERROTTI: Well, what \nmachine tools are, are basically metalworking machinery. So you're using machine tools to produce parts out of \nmetal.\n\nIn Gleason's case, it's gears. Gleason machines are specialized. So they're buying Gleason equipment to produce \ngears. Those gears may be going into transmissions, axles, gear boxes for a variety of industries ranging from \nautomotive to wind turbines, and so forth.\n\nSo, yes, the Chinese are doing much more than just doing light assembly.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese are doing-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: We heard that they add anywhere from five to ten percent. \nValue added by China is like five to ten percent of the final value of the exported item, the manufactured end result. \nSo my question basically is if that's true, that they basically assemble components. I still don't quite understand. \nSure, some machine tool use is involved, but isn't manufacturing done in other countries? MR. PERROTTI: China \ntoday is almost as capable in its manufacturing technology as any country in the world, the United States, Germany, \nJapan. As I mentioned earlier, today technology, it's a great leveler of the playing field. So in the United States \nthere's been millions of manufacturing jobs lost. The reason for 37 that is not so much outsourcing of jobs as it is \ntechnology.\n\nWithin our factory here in Gleason, in Rochester, New York, we have a fifth of the jobs we used to have 20 years \nago, but our output is 50 percent more.\n\nAnd you can find those statistics all over, and it's the same thing in China. China today actually has less \nmanufacturing jobs than it had a few years ago because they're buying automated equipment.\n\nSo part of when someone is looking at jobs for example, they should not underestimate the impact of technology \nand automation as probably the major variable in that.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: So, okay, then basically we are talking about the process? MR. PERROTTI: The \nmanufacturing process.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Right.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Yes.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Dr. Shih, in the article which you coauthored, I read it--and I may be wrong--that the \narticle appeared to say that if we solved our trade deficit situation, the problems with our economy would go away. \nAnd half of our trade deficit, or roughly so, is from energy, oil. A part of it is manufacturing, and then maybe it's with \nthe region, not just with one country.\n\nDR. SHIH: What we were intending to say there was that we have a large trade deficit in high-tech products, and \nwe are going to have to manufacture products in the United States to earn our way out of that deficit, but let me add \nto what Mr. Perrotti said. What he said, and it is true in many high-technology products, that a lot of know-how and \ncapability is embodied in tools.\n\nAnd you can kind of trace this by, for example, export controls on semiconductor process tools, which has held \nChina back a little bit from Taiwan, you know, so for example they've only recently started to come on stream with \n300 millimeter wafers as opposed to 200 millimeter wafers, and they had to file for export control relief on every \nindividual tool they brought in.\n\nNonetheless, they got their start by doing a lot of manual assembly and substitution of manual labor for capital \nintensity, but there are sophisticated manufacturing capabilities in China. You see it in organic chemicals. You see it \nin a lot of metals. You see it in a lot of high-tech processing. You see it in optoelectronic components.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: So you're saying it would vary by industry? DR. SHIH: It varies by industry.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: So a blanket statement like five to ten percent value added would-- DR. SHIH: I \nwould suggest that the way to look at that is that a lot of products that are assembled there have relatively low labor \ncontent compared to the component costs. So, for example, a notebook computer doesn't have that much labor \ncontent.\n\nNow, the question you have to ask is how many of the components are now 38 made in China, and the answer to \nthat is more and more because there's a real drive for localization, if you will, and import substitution.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Understood. If I could ask Dr. Hira to comment. Sir.\n\n\n\nDR. HIRA: Yes. I would just point to the trade data. We're running a very large and increasing trade deficit in \nadvanced technology products. So unless you think the trade data is wrong, I think that speaks for itself.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Chairman--okay? COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Yes.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes. Chairman Bartholomew.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thanks very much, and thank you, gentlemen, for interesting testimony.\n\nA couple of comments on my end first. I can't resist making the comment that the purportedly rational decisions by \nsome of the graduates of this nation's finest business school got us into the economic crisis that we have certainly \nbeen experiencing for the past year, which, Dr. Shih, is not to say that people shouldn't go to business school.\n\nBut I think our business schools need to start looking a little bit about what they're teaching in those schools.\n\n[Laughter.] CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Actually I serve in a different part of my life on a corporate board with \nsomebody who is involved with a California business school, and I know that they're struggling a little bit with some \nof these issues.\n\nI was really interested, Mr. Perrotti, in the statement you made that this is not an unwinnable situation, but that also \ngets to what Dr. Hira was talking about.\n\nMy question is also sort of unwinnable or winnable for whom, and how do we align the interests? I don't think \nanybody expects that CEOs of companies should be--I mean they have to make the decisions that are in the \ninterests of their shareholders, of their business--but we do expect the policymakers in this country to be making \ndecisions that transcend the interests of a particular company, and that's some of what we're trying to explore.\n\nI also think, Dr. Hira, the comment you made about the defense industrial base is a very important piece of all of \nthis. This Commission is supposed to be looking at the nexus of our national security interests and our economic \nsecurity interests.\n\nTwo years ago, we held a hearing in Dearborn, Michigan, and at that hearing, somebody from the Army testified \nthat we no longer have the capability in this country to manufacture triggers for howitzers. Now that also goes, Mr.\n\nPerrotti, directly to the machine tool industry, which is a critical part of our whole manufacturing supply chain.\n\nMy question would be, the Chinese government has done an excellent job of identifying sectors in their economy \nthat they want to build some of the basic 39 manufacturing; what kinds of competition are you facing from a \ndomestic machine tool industry in China and what kinds of pressures are you under to share technology that you \nmight have? Nobody here has mentioned intellectual property theft, and similar issues.\n\nI do think that our machine tool industry is really going to be critically important. We can talk about R&D, but we also \nreally have to talk about this. So how do you deal with those competitive pressures, and what are they as you face \nthe future? MR. PERROTTI: Well, when I first think of competitive pressures, I actually don't think of the Chinese \nfirst.\n\nOne thing we need to be cognizant of--I think of the Germans, the Japanese, the Koreans because as we develop \npolicy, whether it be trade policy or other policy, security-related policy, if it's not somewhat in lockstep with the rest \nof the world, and it can try to put greater restrictions on doing business in China, which might not be catastrophic for \nGleason if all of the other people we compete with-- the German, the Japanese, the Swiss, the Koreans, and so \nforth--are in lockstep with those policies.\n\nBut when the United States is creating policies and the rest of the world isn't following those policies, the Chinese \nare going to still have access to all of the technology because none of this is necessarily proprietary within the \nUnited States.\n\n\n\nSo that is one of the dilemmas. We lose orders today because of certain U.S. policies that exist where Germans or \nother competitors aren't under the same restrictions.\n\nRelative to local Chinese companies, they are aggressive. But in some ways, capitalism almost seems more alive in \nChina than it does in the United States, if any of you have been there, you see the entrepreneurial people coming \nup. Yes, is the central government maybe behind with some puppet strings? Certainly to some extent. How large an \ninfluence they're playing in every corner of the economy I guess is debatable, but we have not personally \nencountered intellectual property theft. We're careful; we're guarded about it.\n\nThere are blatant things like violations of patents, patent infringement, and these kinds of things, but there's the \nthings you can't guard against again anywhere in the world, and that's just people reverse engineering, picking up \nknow-how, trade secrets, hiring people who once worked for your company, the same way technology transfers all \nover the world, and those risks exist in China.\n\nOur antenna is up. We've had to guard against it, but we have not at this point encountered anything that is really \nthat different from what we encounter dealing with other countries.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Dr. Hira, Dr. Shih.\n\nDR. SHIH: I would echo. I think the intellectual property area is very interesting, and what we saw in Japan in the \n'50s and '60s, and we saw in Taiwan in the '70s, and we saw in other areas, is almost like, you know, economies \nand nations go through an evolutionary stage where eventually intellectual property becomes important enough for \ntheir own home industries to protect it.\n\n40 You only have to look at the mobile phone handset market these days to see that there is a whole segment \ncalled the \"shanzhai\" market, which are knockoff cellphones. It will be one-quarter of the world total mobile phone \nhandsets produced this year, and, you know, so for the major players in mobile phones, it's a big problem. But it's \nnot that different than the evolution of many other countries. The main difference is the size of their domestic \nmarket.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: And pace? DR. SHIH: And the pace. Well, everything is going faster these days, \nyeah.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Dr. Hira.\n\nDR. HIRA: I'd just make a couple quick comments. One is that my wife teaches in the business school here so I \nhave to be careful.\n\n[Laughter.] DR. HIRA: So we have interesting conversations about these issues. I would say that we have shifted \nfrom a stakeholder model. It wasn't always the case that corporate governance was driven in the short run by the \nquarterly reports and what not. I don't have enough expertise to say what we need to do to sort of change those \nincentives and create disincentives.\n\nThe other point I would make is the comments about talent. The defense industry or the Defense Department, I \nshould say, has played a leading role over the years in subsidizing engineering education. When I graduated from \nengineering school in the mid-'80s, where you went to work was in the defense sector. And I think it's lost its role in \na lot of ways and hasn't played that active a role and could play a much more active role in encouraging people to \ngo into engineering but also creating opportunities for them when they graduate.\n\nIt's not just a matter of convincing people to go into engineering; it's they have to have a job at the end that they \nwant to go into and do interesting work.\n\nIn terms of the intellectual property, it's not my area of expertise, but I would just point out if you look at the royalty \nnumbers, even if we solved it--and I think we should do something in terms of IP theft--it wouldn't solve the trade \ndeficit issue.\n\n\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes. Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Cleveland.\n\nCOMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: I actually want to follow up a little bit on that, your comment about the Defense \nDepartment, and Dr. Shih, in your article and testimony, you speak to the urgency of the need for investment in \nbasic and applied science and talk about the government's role in the past in making those investments.\n\nIf you were the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Commerce today, how would you structure U.S. government \ninvestment in basic and applied science? Would you restructure existing agencies? What agencies would you use? \nAnd do you think that the stimulus package that just went through makes any of those investments? DR. SHIH: I \nthink some of the examples we cite and some of the things--I 41 think back to, as Dr. Hira mentioned, like DARPA--\nhad some tremendous successes. The National Science Foundation had some tremendous successes.\n\nOne of the things I think is very important is some of these bold initiatives that are a little bit riskier because if you \nlook at the grant process, there's been a bias towards more incremental, incremental problems, as opposed to \nreally tackling some of those big bold initiatives. I think a wonderful example of that was the sequencing of the \nhuman genome, which was not that long, but it really created a whole industry in the United States. You see it very \nmuch in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area.\n\nSo I think it's increased funding in basic research, which underpins a lot of things, as well as the applied-- \nCOMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: When you say \"basic,\" is there a sector or a type of basic science that you think \nthe government should or could invest in, like the Genome Project? DR. SHIH: Well, I think there are a lot of areas. \nContinuing in the biotech sector, of course. Also, in materials and nanomaterials in particular, which there is already \nsubstantial investment. It isn't evident to me that the short-term stimulus money is showing up in any of those areas \nright now, which is a little unfortunate, but what we need to do is take some of those longer horizon bigger risks.\n\nYou know it's interesting that we just came up on the 40th anniversary of the lunar landing.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes.\n\nDR. SHIH: Okay. That's an excellent example of a big risky audacious venture that generated tremendous amount \nof spillover into the commons and capabilities and drove a lot of those types of needs.\n\nThe Chinese are doing some of those things from an infrastructure standpoint. They'll have a much more advanced \ncable television network than we will here in the United States, for example. So they're doing it in a very applied \nfashion.\n\nI think for this country, we need to take on some of those big grand challenge problems, and that's a great way of \ndriving kind of the next generation of spillover.\n\nCOMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: And who would you suggest lead that effort? Where do you see that innovative, \nimaginative, and creative energy in terms of the government? DR. SHIH: I'll have to give you a more thoughtful \nanswer on that later.\n\nThat's a very important question.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Are you available? [Laughter.] COMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: I'm not talking about \nindividuals.\n\nI'm talking about where you see that kind of-- DR. SHIH: You know, there's a question of will in this country as well, \npolitical will. But--you know, desire to make this important--that's why I think 42 the framing of grand challenges \ntends to attract a lot of people who want to do things like that.\n\n\n\nI lived through the '60s with the race to the moon. That was absolutely inspiring for a whole generation of people, \nand we have that type of problem in the U.S., like energy independence, for example.\n\nCOMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: Well, yes. Continuing on the government theme, Dr. Hira, you talked in an article \nthat I read about the FFRDC--and I think you said in your testimony as well--you would recommend a free-standing \nFFRDC.\n\nDR. HIRA: Yes.\n\nCOMMISSIONER CLEVELAND: Can you elaborate a little on that--I mean the testimony, unfortunately, being \nabbreviated, it sounded like you were going to study the problem rather than what kind of sort of real impact it \nmight have, like the other FFRDCs.\n\nDR. HIRA: Right. Well, I would respectfully disagree to some extent about this, the analogy of the Manhattan \nProject or the Apollo Project being something that we need to do. We spend a lot of money on research and \ndevelopment, about $140 billion a year. I see the issue not so much as a funding issue as much as that the world \nhas changed, and the nature of innovation has changed. It's become a global process, and we're acting as though \nthat never occurred or that hasn't occurred.\n\nAnd so my proposal in the written testimony is to create an organization that actually studies this in much more \ndetail. Alan Blinder has argued that offshoring is equivalent to the Industrial Revolution, that the transformation is \nequivalent to the Industrial Revolution, and we're essentially not doing anything about that.\n\nWe're not even studying the issue, and so the FFRDC that I propose would look specifically at the offshoring and \nglobalization of innovation and make recommendations, specific recommendations, on the nature of innovation and \nwhere we should be reallocating our resources.\n\nWe're really not reallocating that 140 billion. We're not spending it as smartly as we should be, and it's fine to \nhave grand challenges, but, hey, we already have that 140 billion. Let's do that in a much smarter way. As you \nknow, in government, there's a lot of inertia. Programs don't get killed, and so on and so forth. We need to rethink \nthat.\n\nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, even with Japan, we really did rejigger our innovation system during the '80s. I worked \nat NIST. That was created through the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, right, from the National Bureau of Standards, \nand I think it made a lot of good investments, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the place I worked, the \nAdvanced Technology Program, and so on and so forth, but it also focused our attention on what was really going \non in terms of innovation and how it had changed.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nDr. Shih, I have cut out a quote, and I put it on my computer, from the Book of Proverbs: \"Without a vision, the \npeople will perish.\" And I thought you 43 just hit it.\n\nThe national leaders have to give you a vision; they don't tell you how to do things. And then you set the country \nfree to achieve the goals. I thought President Kennedy did that. He didn't say how we're going to get to the moon; \nhe said we're going to get to the moon, but--okay--and we did it. And it gave a burst of energy and spillover to the \ncommons.\n\nI think the Chinese have the same thing. They were a great society. They fell apart when they came into the contact \nwith the West, and the British went to war and forced them to take opium and all that sort of thing, and they were \nhumiliated.\n\n1949, the Communists came to power; they drove out foreign influences, but they couldn't make their economy \ngrow properly. By '78, they came in, and the new guy, Deng Xiaoping, came in with a vision: we need the foreigners \nto help us build a high-tech economy. And they had a vision of how to incentivize the foreigners to come in and help \n\n\n\nthem achieve great power status again, and I think they're being very successful at it, to be honest with you. They \nhave a vision.\n\nMy sense now is the United States because we're in an economic crisis, there's a chance now to break out of this \nold thinking and begin to think anew how important manufacturing and how important balancing your trade account. \nWe've been unbelievable because we can balance our trade account by shipping Treasury bills, IOUs, to other \npeople, and then they get more and more claims on our economy. That's what we've been doing.\n\nNow, Dr. Shih, at the end of your testimony, you say, quote: \"Only by rejuvenating our high-tech sector can we \nhope to return to the path of sustained growth needed to pay down our enormous deficits\"--that's the trade deficits, \nthis debt that we're now in-- \"and raise our citizens' standard of living.\" Bingo. That could be a vision. How do we do \nthat? Now, one of the things that Dr. Hira--I brought a quote--I was reading this book by Senator Schumer called \nPositively American, published in 2007. Senator Schumer hit the same thing you did about the divergence of \ninterests between the multinational corporations and the national interests.\n\nHe says by their very nature--he talks about this divergence. He says: \"Today large corporations have much less \ninterest in this country.\" And then he goes on to say: \"Corporations are not sentimental or patriotic. They are the \nsum of their capital. They're looking to increase returns for their shareholders. Still, it's undeniable that \ninternationalizing diminishes the overlap between business interests and national interests.\" So the vision should \nbe we're in trouble; how do we get these guys to put back on American shirts and get on the team, and how do we \nincentivize them? In the old days--I think someone talked about--shareholder value was not the only goal of a \ncorporation. Somehow, over the last 25 years, that changed, and I think it's important for this Commission to come \nback and understand that a little 44 better, but in my opinion, we need to figure out how to reincentivize this game \nand get the American corporations playing back on the team.\n\nDr. Shih, you talk about this, the little incremental decisions that are made, but then you wake up 20 years later, and \nyou're really out of the ball game. So I would ask Dr. Shih, Dr. Hira, and then Mr. Perrotti, if you have any thoughts, \nhow can we reincentivize this game? Dr. Shih.\n\nDR. SHIH: Well, one thing that was mentioned earlier is taxation and cost of capital. In a lot of high-tech industries, \nlabor is a very small part of the total.\n\nAnd I believe an awful lot of companies look at comparative costs. Certainly one of the things that has enabled this \nhas been the relatively high ratio of value to transportation costs, which has enabled this kind of global sequential \nmanufacturing model that we see today.\n\nI'm watching with interest the new GlobalFoundries fab going up in Luther Forest, up in upstate New York, which is \npart of Albany Nanotech. I think that's actually a good example. Now, they received a subsidy which lowered their \ncost of capital. Okay, we need to think through our taxation and cost of capital here because so much is embodied \nin the tools, as Mr. Perrotti had said earlier, that that would be a very good first step that will cause rational thinking \nto put more in the United States, I think. But we're going to have to address that first.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Dr. Hira.\n\nDR. HIRA: Yes. I would just point to an article by Sam Palmisano, published in Foreign Affairs, back in 2006--he's \nthe CEO of IBM--where he talks about the \"globally integrated enterprise.\" And he's explicitly talking about his \nincentives and the future of multinational corporations, which he's now calling \"globally integrated enterprise.\" I \ndon't know how you realign these interests. I think it's important, and there's folks that are working on this. But you \ncan't just hope that that happens.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: No.\n\nDR. HIRA: You have to take steps that realize that the current situation is that they're going to make decisions. \nThey're not bad people.\n\n\n\nThey're making rational decisions, and we need to accommodate and adjust to that.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes.\n\nDR. HIRA: And make our policy choices based on the current system as it is, hoping to change it so that you \nchange those incentive structures and what not to realign things.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes. Mr. Perrotti, do you have anything you want to add? MR. PERROTTI: Well, \nrelative to shareholder value, shareholder value needs to be the number one priority for a company or else the \nentire model fails.\n\nPeople won't provide capital. The businesses will disappear in short order.\n\nPerhaps the one refinement to that is long-term creation of shareholder value as opposed to some of the short-term \nincentives. Technology is wonderful, the Internet and all of these things, but it's almost created an even more \nshortsighted kind of behavior where people are literally checking things every 45 minute, every hour, and wondering \nwhether they should be acting on it.\n\nSo that exists in business, and we even have to think about in government, not that I suggest we have to redo our \nentire form of government, but even people who have relatively short-term assignments, two years and so forth, \npeople, understandably so, it's hard to take a long-term view of things when you perhaps have an assignment for \none year or two years and you're trying to satisfy perhaps a set of short-term goals.\n\nAnd that is one of the fundamental issues that underlies a lot of the problems we have in this country, as to how we \ncan keep some of those institutions in place, but have a much better long-term focus on what we need to do.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: There's been a lot of interest in the Commission in your testimony, so we'll start a \nsecond round, but let's each try to say within the five minutes on the second round so that everybody can get their \nshot.\n\nCommissioner Blumenthal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: I won't take a shot.\n\n[Laughter.] COMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: I can't resist one comment, and then I want to ask a question-- \nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Taking a shot.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: --which is--no, well, not at them-- [Laughter.] COMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: -\n-which is a lot of the innovations that you alluded to, Sputnik and switch packeting that led to the creation of the \nInternet. We were in a global security competition with the Soviets, and we were trying to--I think you even alluded \nto it, Dr. Shih, in your article-- we were trying to solve very specific military problems that then had spinoffs.\n\nAnd there's no feel for that--there's no feeling in Washington that I can sense that we're in any kind of security \ncompetition with the Chinese. In fact, we're cutting defense budgets. We just cut our most high-tech, most capable \nstealthy airplane, the F-22, and we've been cutting defense budgets and certainly procurement and investment \nsince the end of the Cold War.\n\nSo one place to start would be actually to raise the defense budget, and then the defense industrial base and all \nkinds of companies would be incentivized to create new things. So I can't resist that comment. And there is no feel \nin Washington right now that there's any threat from China militarily that I can sense.\n\nDr. Shih, I'm concerned about your daughter because here we have a mechanical engineer, someone who actually \nwent to engineering, got an engineering degree, and you said that she might not have a future in technology, and \nso I'm wondering if you can spin that out a little bit? I have a romantic view of what happened in the '90s with Silicon \nValley, and a lot of immigrants came and started businesses, and we had this boom, and we became leaders again \n\n\n\nin different types of Internet technology and 46 telecommunications technology. So is that not possible anymore? \nCan your daughter or others like her not go off and start new businesses? Is it really that bleak in terms of the road \nfor people who actually have engineering degrees? DR. SHIH: Well, obviously, I believe this continues to be a land \nof great opportunity, you know, so--but it goes back to the comment I made earlier about what do we value in this \ncountry when we see the sports heroes and the entertainment industry heroes as opposed to, you know, people \nwho excel in technology and science and so on? You have a different feel of that overseas.\n\nI want to come back to your opening comment as well. I don't think we face--this is personal opinion--I don't think \nwe face a defense threat. I think we face an economic security competition now, and maybe there is education that \nneeds to be, that needs to go on, because I've been in hundreds of factories across Asia, and I've been with \ngovernment leaders, I've been with universities, I've been with CEOs, and I don't think people in this country have \nany concept of the relative scale of what's happening over there versus what's happening in this country.\n\nHaving said that, I think we have some good examples. I think Gleason is a terrific example, and there are some \nother terrific examples in the U.S., of being able to hold their own in a global market. Okay, we don't make it any \neasier for them, but there are some terrific examples.\n\nBut I think people have no comprehension of what is going on on the other side of the world.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Okay. The other question I had for you is it's very interesting, Amazon Kindle 2. I \nsuppose you think this is not a good model for the United States, but I wonder how much value Amazon took out of \nthat, right? Out of that particular product? DR. SHIH: Amazon will take a substantial value out of that because it is a \nsupporting part of their business model to sell e-books as well. You probably saw that E-Ink, the originator of the \nelectrophoretic bead technology, which came out of MIT, was recently sold to Prime View International, and so \nPrime View is securing their intellectual property position in that as well.\n\nKudos to Prime View, you know, in my view, but the challenge and the purpose of that Kindle example was if you \nwanted to manufacture that in the U.S., you could not do it because the capability is not here anymore.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: But again, you think this is not a good model for the next Amazon? This is not a \nsustainable model even though they take the highest value out of it? DR. SHIH: Well, people say the same thing \nabout Apple and iPhones and iPods.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\nDR. SHIH: And notebooks as well. And what you see in the notebook computer business, outside of Apple, is that \nthose manufacturers move up the value chain as well. Okay. So the next wave you'll see is the rise of the other \nbrands 47 who start to take a lot of that value; right. Acer is now the number two PC manufacturer, having passed \nDell. That happened in the last quarter, and they used to manufacture for a lot of other people, and so they're \nmoving up the value chain.\n\nSo I just think that's kind of the inevitable progression.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Commissioner Shea.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: I'll be quick. Two questions. We spend $140 billion a year annually on research and \ndevelopment. That's great, but to me, research and development achieves its fullest potential if you commercialize \nit and create jobs, good-paying jobs for people. How well do we do as a country with commercializing R&D, and are \nthere government policies that you would recommend to assist in commercializing R&D so that we can create jobs \nhere in the United States? And if we have time, we're in Rochester, we're going to talk about this in the next panel, \nbut I would like to get your views on the status of manufacturing in this particular region of New York State and \nwhat's your prognosis for the future? Do you want to start, Dr. Hira? No one wants to answer? [Laughter.] \nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: It wasn't that tough a question.\n\n\n\nDR. HIRA: Yeah. I mean I think there's a perception that we should only invest in basic research, and we have this \ndebate about corporate welfare and industrial policy and the like, but the reality is that commercialization, that's the \nend, that's what you want to get, I mean, so doing, inventing it here, getting the nanotech breakthrough in Albany \nisn't sufficient, right.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Right.\n\nDR. HIRA: So you have to have those kinds of policies in place, and the reinvented ATP program, now called TIP, \nis a good program, I think, in terms of getting things towards commercialization, the so- called \"Valley of Death.\" \nYou know the SBIR program, if you talk to venture capitalists, is a very important part of commercialization process \nand the like, and I'll defer to my business colleagues who probably have a better sense in the real world.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Well, I can comment briefly on the question about the state of manufacturing here in New York. \nYou know the model right here in Rochester is an interesting one because Rochester for many years had been \ndominated by a few large employers--Kodak, Xerox, Bausch & Lomb, and those companies. The number of \nemployees in this area working for these companies has shrunk dramatically over the past ten to 20 years.\n\nBut the unemployment rate in this area is still below the national average, and the reason is there have been lots of \nsmall businesses that have popped up, some of them feeding from people who left those companies, which were \ntechnology-based companies; some who have started businesses based upon research from the universities like \nRIT. So there is a positive model there.\n\nOn the other hand, we do need to look at the jobs that have been lost and the reasons why. Fortunately, some have \nbeen able to be remade, but, and, of 48 course, New York is a tough environment to do business relative to the \ncost of doing business--taxes, regulation, and so forth. And we certainly continue to hope that those things will \nchange because the jobs aren't necessarily being lost to China. Sometimes the job is being lost to South Carolina \nor Texas or other places, not necessarily going thousands of miles away.\n\nDR. SHIH: Let me just add, reinforce, that a big part of the value-add in the know-how comes in the \ncommercialization of a product, commercialization of the technology. I'd reinforce things like SBIR are actually a \ngood way of helping small companies over that commercialization hump.\n\nI think, you know, as far as manufacturing in the Rochester area, I would agree with that. There's been a \ntremendous amount of spillover from the shrinking of Kodak and some of the other large players, and that kind of \nspillover also populates the commons which makes it a good resource for reapplication of some of that know-how.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Chairman Bartholomew.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thanks.\n\nAgain, I think this is more of a comment than a question, and it will lead into the next panel. I'm really struck \nlistening to all of you about the challenges that we face, not just in R&D, but the downstream aspects of it. Dr. Hira, \nyou mentioned that particularly.\n\nWhen we were in North Carolina a couple of years ago, we learned a lot about both the sunset industries there and \nthe sunrise industries and the role of Research Triangle Park, but when you started digging into it, it turned out that \nmany of the jobs that were being created were not jobs that were being created that the people who had lost their \njobs were appropriate for.\n\nIt was not simply about retraining. It was a completely different kind of thing, and again I go back to machine tools \nand the importance of our manufacturing base when we look at the workforce in this country, the people who built \nthis country, and how do we take these issues that we're talking about, high level R&D issues, and relate it back \ndown to what do we do to make sure that the people in this country who are not engineers, don't want to be \n\n\n\nengineers, perhaps are not capable of being engineers, but go down a different path? And that's the bulk of people \nin this country who built this country. So any insights that you all have about how we connect that to what do we do \nabout strengthening our communities, strengthening our families in this country, and strengthening our workforce? \nMR. PERROTTI: I guess the G-20, or whatever they call themselves now, is going to hold their next meeting in \nPittsburgh, and I saw an interview with their mayor, and they were asking him how Pittsburgh remade itself, you \nknow, from the steel city into what they are today, and they asked what are the leading industries there, and he said \nhealth care.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Which is positive, but every city, the leading industry 49 can't be health care. Guess what it is in \nRochester now? It's health care. The largest employers are health care.\n\nAt some point you need somebody else working in some other industry, and it goes back again to, I hate to suggest \nit's a long- term journey or long journey, but it is. It goes all the way back to putting a reemphasis on manufacturing, \nwhat we teach in our schools, what we teach in our universities, to make manufacturing again a priority, to make the \nmanufacturing technology, not just somebody taking something off a machine, but the underlying technology, a \npriority and to rebuild that.\n\nThe distinct disadvantage we have in the machine tool industry is there are very few universities that have a focus \nor curriculum on that in the United States, where in Germany it's held in high esteem, for example, and the Chinese \nare doing the same exact thing. And it has to start at the very top in terms of our business leaders, in terms of our \ngovernment officials, in terms of trying to put an emphasis back on that.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Dr. Hira.\n\nDR. HIRA: I would just take a step back and say that I view students and even universities as rational actors. They \nwill create programs where there are opportunities. Students will go into fields where they perceive opportunities, \nand we saw this during the 1990s when computer science enrollments mushroomed, maybe not enough to keep up \nwith the demand in terms of the workforce, but I think we have to be cautious about pushing supply and think about \ndemand, and to tie this into a practical policy recommendation, we have to look at public procurement.\n\nWe're spending a lot of money in stimulus dollars. We're also spending a lot as a government, and government \nspending is 20 percent of the economy, of GDP, and it will continue to increase, it looks like, for the foreseeable \nfuture. We have to favor domestic content. People will call that protectionism, but I see that as an investment. You \ncan do R&D cheaper in India so should we direct the NSF to do research grants away from RIT and to the IITs in \nIndia? Does that make sense? The reason that you're spending that money is because there are spillover benefits \nfrom it, and we should rethink our procurement policies in that light. I'm not saying that every pencil that's bought \nshould be bought from \"Buy American,\" but, boy, there's a wide spectrum between research and pencils. IT \nservices is a big one. Right. We should be looking at whether we should offshore or not-- public procurement.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thank you.\n\nDr. Shih, anything to add? DR. SHIH: Well, I would only add that one thing I learned in business is that problems \nthat are a long time in the making are a long time in solving. So we won't see, you know, a simple solution that we \ncan implement over the short term.\n\nI have a lot of reservations about starting a trade war with something like Buy America. I understand what Dr. Hira \nis saying, but I think it's important for 50 people in this country to understand, as other countries, business leaders \nin other countries, understand the nature of trade balance and dependence on other countries for key components.\n\nThere's presently a big debate in Taiwan about whether the government should rescue their memory industry. \nOkay. And I went and interviewed a couple of the ministers there, and they said, well, because Taiwan has 90 \n\n\n\npercent of the PC industry from a design standpoint, and they don't want to be dependent on other people for-- \nspecifically, Korea--for DRAMs.\n\nOkay. Now, the DRAM debate happened in the '80s and the '90s, and it was a huge debate, but I cite that example \nas a difference in mentality--right. You find in China a sensitivity towards dependence on external sources for things \nthat could get them in trouble. You see them buying a lot of resources right now and trying to secure resources for \nthat very reason; right.\n\nIt's not I'm trying to control it; I'm trying--they're trying not to be held hostage by other parts of the world. Okay. \nWe're held hostage. We just don't know it.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: I think we do.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Slane.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Dr. Hira, you referred to SEMATECH and the R&D subsidy they received from DARPA. \nWhat often happens, it seems to me, is that the R&D gets commercialized; then U.S. companies wind up turning it \nover to Chinese state-owned enterprises. Isn't this self- defeating and shouldn't we try to prevent this? DR. HIRA: \nWell, I think that that question dovetails with what I was talking about, is the downstream fruits. We don't subsidize \nR&D for the sake of creating research jobs. We do it because the hope is there will be localized geographic \nspillover benefit, that the design, development and production jobs will be created, at least the first round of those, \nwill be created in the U.S.\n\nYou're not asking the blue collar worker to subsidize and pay taxes to subsidize research jobs at universities. The \nhope is that the country as a whole will benefit, and I don't think we're paying attention to that because I think the \nnature of firms has radically shifted. Firm behavior has changed, for better and worse.\n\nAnd we're not thinking about the fact that these downstream benefits, these downstream fruits, are much more \ngeographically leaky than they were in the past, and we need to think about how do we capture those downstream \nbenefits? It goes back to why companies don't spend on basic research because they don't believe that they'll \nappropriate, they'll capture those downstream benefits unless they can put a patent on it, unless they can get \nintellectual property out of it. It goes into the commons arguments.\n\nThe problem is these benefits that we traditionally expect will occur and be around Albany I think are being \ncommercialized overseas, and most of those 51 benefits will leak out which calls into question, you know, why \nwe're spending $140 billion on R&D and not thinking about what the outcomes will be out of that.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Other comments? MR. PERROTTI: Well the premise that people are turning technology \nover to state-owned enterprises, I don't think a rational CEO would do that to a stateowned enterprise or anyone \nelse.\n\nTechnology is very fluid, more so today than ever, and it will be even more so in the future. So people will have the \nability to reverse engineer and understand things faster than they have in the past, and we have to accept that as \njust a fact of life, that technology is more portable than ever.\n\nBut obviously today a CEO has every incentive in the world to try to protect that technology as best they can.\n\nDR. SHIH: I would argue that some of the reasons we have the perception that technology flows in the state-owned \nenterprises is exactly the argument we make about not having the infrastructure in this country to manufacture \nsome of those things. You know there are an awful lot of things that if you want to manufacture them, you can't do it \nin this country, you have to go overseas, and that's how, that kind of encourages the flow.\n\n\n\nGoing back to the Albany example, and Albany Nanotech, I do agree that know-how created there flows outward \nthrough tools. When you talk to IBM people, their argument will be this field moves so quickly that, you know, it's all \nin the nature of having some temporal advantage for some number of years.\n\nHaving it first, you milk a lot of the profits early on, and then everything commoditizes.\n\nSo I'm hopeful on Albany because I think outside of Intel, that's really the large, the sole large, you know, \nsemiconductor manufacturing cluster remaining in the U.S. There's still some around Austin, Texas, but it's, you \nknow, it's a global game that we're playing. Technology flows very quickly; you need to have a temporal advantage. \nAnd then you need to work on higher parts of the value chain to convert that advantage into products where you \ncan make some profit.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nI just want to finish up by noting that the transcript of this hearing, you'll get chances to correct your English, and \nthen we put all that up on our-- COMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Not that you need to.\n\n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: We put that all up on our Web site so that people can access this, and \nthis has been a very important hearing.\n\nDr. Shih, you mentioned when you go to Asia and you go into these places and what you see. I first went to China \nin '81 so I have some perspective of what's happened here.\n\nChairman Bartholomew always says when we go into these places, I come out and I say, man, it's over; I mean it's \nover because you see how rapidly they're moving up the technology chain.\n\nI'd like to comment on one last thing. Dr. Shih, in your testimony, on page 52 five, you talk about other countries \nhave for years thought strategically about the industries they want to foster and grow, and you mention China's 863 \nprogram which they adopted in 1986, and they said these are the areas we want to dominate or at least we want to \nbe very, very competitive in.\n\nPart of our problem is any time you talk about these kinds of things, people say, jeez, we don't want to get in the \nbusiness of picking winners and losers. And I think we have to get over that and begin to talk about what is \nhappening in this country and why manufacturing is so important.\n\nThere's a debate beginning in Washington on this. You guys have been invaluable witnesses before this \nCommission. We can't think you enough, and I think I speak for all the Commission to say thanks for your \npresentation and taking time to be with us.\n\nMR. PERROTTI: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: We'll recess for ten minutes and then come back.\n\n[Whereupon, a short recess was taken.] PANEL II: THE IMPACT OF CHINESE COMPETITION ON LOCAL \nCOMPANIESAND COMMUNITIES HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Will our two witnesses please come up, Mr.\n\nKowalewski and Mr. Bertolone? Are they here? Good morning. Our third witness, Mayor Johnson, is running a bit \nlate so we will just start, once Mr. Bertolone gets seated, with our two witnesses.\n\nCome on up. Good morning.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: Good morning.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: We're going to begin our second panel, \"The Impact of Chinese Competition on Local \nCompanies and Communities,\" and again I want to thank the witnesses for taking the time to be here today and to \nprepare some written testimony for the Commission.\n\n\n\nWe have as our first witness Mr. James Bertolone, who is the President of the Rochester Labor Council (AFL-CIO), \nand he's also the President of the local here of the American Postal Workers Union. Thank you for coming.\n\nWe also have on the panel Mr. Ed Kowalewski, who is the Director of International Trade and Investments for the \nUpstate Empire State Development Corporation, based in Buffalo.\n\nIn addition to his 11 years of government experience, Mr. Kowalewski has over 20 years of international business \nexperience in the private sector, and as I said earlier, we're waiting to hear from former mayor--waiting to receive \nformer Mayor William Johnson, who is on his way to the hearing but running a bit late.\n\nSo when he comes, we will bring him on to the panel.\n\nSo why don't we begin with Mr. Bertolone.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. JAMES V. BERTOLONE 53 PRESIDENT, ROCHESTER LABOR COUNCIL \n(AFL-CIO), ROCHESTER, NEW YORK MR. BERTOLONE: Let me start by thanking the Commission for having me \nhere today and receiving this testimony.\n\nI am familiar with some of your work, and I want to recognize and thank you for your recommendations in the past \nthat have included, but are not limited to, defining China's currency manipulation as a violation of WTO rules, to be \nconsidered a prohibited subsidy; recommending that Congress petition to investigate Chinese workers' rights \nviolations in order to make the case before the WTO that the suppression of labor rights is an unfair trade practice; \nand recommending trade remedies authorized by the WTO be used against China to enforce antidumping and \ncountervailing duty penalties, as well as to protect our economy from the extensive subsidies for companies in \nChina.\n\nI'm also thinking--and I know you touched on it earlier--that some of your recommendations are very important \nwhen it comes to U.S. technology and the effect of that technology moving to China on our national defense \nindustries.\n\nFirst, in a general overall view, and you have my testimony so I won't read it word for word, but I think working \npeople and Americans in this country were sold a bill of goods that the deindustrialization of America was inevitable \nand it was necessary, and that it was a good thing. And this process began obviously long before we established \npermanent trade relations with China, but since we have, it has gotten much, much worse.\n\nJust a decade ago, nearly 30 percent of our gross domestic product came from the manufacturing sector. Today it's \nless than 12 percent, and most of the stuff I'm using is statistics at the end of 2007. It doesn't take into account any \nfurther effects of the great recession that we're in now.\n\nIn 2007, manufacturing still employed 14 million Americans which created eight million additional jobs, and again, \nas touched on by Professor Hira, when you're talking about jobs of the future and future technologies, robotics, \nlaser, computer science, photonics--and this is one of the biggest areas in the country on photonics with Bausch & \nLomb, Kodak and Xerox--biomedical advances, American manufacturers are the leading purchasers of new \ntechnology in our economy, and the nearly 80 percent of all patents, come from the manufacturing sector.\n\nAt the end of 2007, manufacturing still contributed $1.2 trillion to our economy, and for every 100 steel or auto jobs, \nfor example, it creates somewhere between 400 and 500 jobs, where in retail every 100 jobs creates somewhere \naround 94 jobs.\n\nI also--and labor has done some work with Professor Hira--I want to recognize his book Outsourcing America. Over \nthe years, particularly since NAFTA, whether it's labor or business, we've heard a lot of platitudes on trade based \non ideology, whether it's from the right or the left, and his is one of the original works, I think, that actually attempts \nto document the evidence of what has happened as these trade laws have expanded, and by his own admission \nwith 54 me, it's an initial work, and there needs to be further study of the actual effects of these trade policies as we \ngo forward.\n\n\n\nThe American people were not told when we got permanent trade relations with China and these trade policies, that \nit meant their jobs were going to be outsourced. Historically, trade and outsourcing were two different things, and \nthese trade agreements have been used to outsource in a race to the bottom with few safety and environmental \nregulations, and that is a big problem.\n\nI understand the gentleman's testimony from IBM, and the technology, but representing American workers for 35 \nyears, we have failed to see any benefit when the executives and the stockholders at IBM do well if they're not \nproviding jobs to Americans. It's no skin off our back whether they do well or not if they are not part of the American \neconomy providing good jobs.\n\nWhen NAFTA was first passed, President Clinton said we might lose some labor-intensive jobs in clothing, shoes or \ntoys, but high-tech jobs with the exporting of computers and electronic parts would increase. Yet, in 2007, we had a \n$68 billion trade deficit in advanced technology products with China, which represents 25 percent of our trade \ndeficit.\n\nNow this was all expected to change when China joined the WTO in 2001 with the WTO rules on illegal subsidies, \nillegal dumping, currency manipulation, et cetera, and yet from 2001 to 2008, we've lost another 2.3 million \nmanufacturing jobs to China. If you add the labor rights' abuses against international standards, which artificially \ncontribute to the low cost of Chinese goods, that Chinese companies are allowed to pay as little as 15 cents to 50 \ncents an hour, depressing consumer demand in their own country, and that forces reliance on an export economy.\n\nAmerican multinationals doing business in China have all kinds of roadblocks from the Chinese government to get \naccess to the Chinese market and end up, the majority of their business ends up being for export, as opposed to \nthe promise of getting into the Chinese market and creating American jobs.\n\nCost of the environmental and safety standards. 80 percent of the products recalled by the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission in the past year involved Chinese products--17 million toys with the excessive lead, poison pet \nfood and toothpaste, tainted and contaminated seafood.\n\nOne of the saddest things to me in the statistics, and I brought new copies of my testimony with some of these \ngraphs documented in there, is that our number one export now in America by far--number two is non-electric \nmachinery, $1.1 billion a year--number one, 17.4 billion surplus, is in scrap and waste.\n\nAnd New York State is behind California and Texas. After them, we lost the largest number of jobs to trade. We are \nthird, 127,000 jobs since 2001, and in New York State, manufacturing was the third-largest contributor to GDP, \nabout $61 billion a year.\n\nRochester, which is my hometown, has been devastated by the loss of manufacturing jobs. Kodak moved whole \ndivisions to China. They employ less than 7,500 workers here. Kodak employed over 60,000 in 1980.\n\n55 To be fair, Kodak has downsized its worldwide workforce. It's now I believe under 25,000.\n\nAuto jobs have been lost and offshored due to much of the unfair cheating in China. The old Delco, later to become \nITT Automotive, then Valeo Automotive, is gone, 4,000 jobs with it. Just 15 years ago.\n\nDelphi, 3,500 jobs, down to 800 now and struggling. Hickey Freeman has lost a number of jobs and has been in \ndanger of closing in the past year due to subsidized dumping of Chinese suits.\n\nOur business community, again, particularly groups like the Chamber of Commerce and IMF, have said it's okay. \nWe're going to transition from a manufacturing economy, labor-intensive stuff will go offshore, and we will pick up \nthe jobs in the service economy.\n\nNationwide service economy jobs pay on average $8,100 less. In Rochester, some of those averages are as much \nas $20,000 less from an average of $60,000 in manufacturing to between 30 and 40,000 in the service industries. \nThat is devastating to an economy where there seems to be a consensus among economists that 70 percent of our \n\n\n\neconomy is based on consumer spending, and even prior to the last decade and a half, post-World War II, \nconsumer spending was anywhere between 61 and 65 percent of our economy.\n\nPart of the service economy increase in jobs has been in government. We are now losing government jobs which is \nfurther devastating the economy. We are in the process of laying off 200 teachers in Rochester. Other positions are \nnot being filled by attrition, and we know that there will be further layoffs with the problems on Wall Street and the \nfurther erosion of our tax base.\n\nWe do have economic development funding, industrial development agencies, Empire and Enterprise zones, tax \nsubsidies, but they are just not sufficient to stop the bleeding in this area.\n\nWe also have had a big battle between labor and business on IDA reform, which has been stalled for a year. \nBusiness, though our free marketeers have no problem taking tax subsidies as part of the free market equation, do \nnot want to have to pay the area median wage as part of taking that money, which is a little over $15 an hour, about \n$30,000 a year in full time work. That is one of the big problems.\n\nThe city of Rochester now, the average household income is under $30,000 a year. 45 percent of our children grow \nup in poverty, and the attendant crime and educational problems that come with that has devastated our city in the \nlast two decades, and I'm sure my old friend, Mayor Johnson, can really speak to those issues of what's happened \nto our economy in the city of Rochester in the last two decades.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Bertolone.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: Yes.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: We're limiting statements to seven minutes.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: I'm sorry. I'll just finish up with the statement that again, when we were sold these trade \nagreements and these trade policies, and 56 from the business world told it's okay, it's evolutionary, our position is \nthey don't get to decide for the rest of us in an economy.\n\nTom Friedman, the IMF, they do not get to decide for the citizens in a democracy that Flint and Akron and \nRochester and Newark and Buffalo that our cities can be devastated and destroyed because they believe--the \nmasters of the universe--that this is the new global economy.\n\nSo, with that, I'll finish.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. James V. Bertolone President, Rochester Labor Council (AFL-\nCIO), Rochester, New York Let me begin with the biggest impact on our economy due to trade with China, the \ndeindustrialization of America and the myth that this is inevitable and necessary. Though in some areas this \nprocess began long before permanent trade relations with China were established by legislation, the record of the \nlast ten years in different manufacturing sectors and our trade deficit with China leads one to the undeniable \nconclusion that deindustrialization and attendant reduction in the manufacturing over the last decade has greatly \nincreased to the detriment of the United States and New York State. There are those representing the corporate \nsector, from the Chamber of Commerce to the International Monetary Fund that have continued to put forth the view \nthat deindustrialization and the loss of manufacturing in the United States is inevitable in a globalized market \neconomy and not detrimental to our economy due to the expansion of the service economy. The statistics refute \nthis view beyond any doubt. Just a decade ago manufacturing was about 30% of US Gross Domestic Product or \nGDP, today it is less than 12%. From 2000 to 2007 another 3 1/2 million jobs were lost in US manufacturing. Yet as \nof 2007 US manufacturing still employed 14 million Americans and creates 8 million additional jobs in other sectors. \nWhen it comes to the jobs of the future, whether in robotics, lasers, computer sciences, photonics or bio medical \nadvances, American manufacturers are the leading buyers of new technology in the United States. In fact, \nAmerican manufacturers are responsible for two thirds of research and development investment in the US and \nnearly 80% of all patents filed come from the manufacturing sector. Though the great recession has reduced these \n\n\n\nnumbers, at the end of 2007 manufacturing contributed $1.2 trillion dollars to America's economy while every 100 \nsteel or auto jobs create between 400 to 500 new jobs in the rest of the economy. Contrast this with the retail \neconomy where every 100 jobs generates about 94 new jobs elsewhere.\n\nI would like to take a moment to commend RIT Professor Ron Hira for his work in the areas of concern before the \ncommission, particularly his book \"Outsourcing America\". His research and documentation has furthered our \nknowledge of the actual effect of Global trade and problems with our policies involving China. Particularly \ndisturbing are his findings that Research and Development tend to follow manufacturing off shore. R&D jobs, \nimportant in themselves, develop the new products, processes, innovations and technologies that shape the future \nand create the jobs of the future. This trend is especially disturbing for the future of domestic manufacturing, jobs \nand our economy.\n\nAllow me to give a brief overview of Labor's problems with Trade with China under current conditions in light of the \nCommission's mandate to assess the nature of the transfer of United States production to the People's Republic of \nChina. For one thing the American people were not told that new global trade rules meant outsourcing their jobs for \nslave wages with few safety or environmental regulations . American companies selling America products to \nAmerican workers with cheap foreign labor was never part of the bargain. Outsourcing jobs, in a race to the bottom, \nis not trade, but that is what happened. President Clinton said we might lose some labor intensive jobs in clothing, \nshoes, or toys, but high tech jobs with the exporting of computers and electronic parts would increase. In 2007 we \nhad a $68 billion dollar deficit in advanced technology products with China, 25% of the total US-China Trade \ndeficit.\n\n57 The fact is China's cheating trade practices has cost Americans millions of jobs. This was expected to change \nwhen China joined the WTO in 2001 with WTO rules on illegal subsidies, illegal dumping, and currency \nmanipulation expected to reduce this problem, but in fact it has gotten worse with 2.3 million lost US jobs to China \nfrom 2001- 2008. Add to this Labor Rights abuses against international standards, which artificially contribute to the \nlow cost of Chinese goods. Millions of child workers and forced labor are used to make products for export to the \nUnited States. Independent Labor Unions are forbidden and such attempts result in firing, imprisonment or worse. \nThe Chinese allow companies to pay as little as 15 cents to 50 cents a hour, depressing consumer demand thus \nforcing reliance on an export economy. Costs of production are also depressed due to low safety and \nenvironmental standards. As one example 80% of the products recalled by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission in the past year involve Chinese products, from 17 million toys with lead, to poison pet food and \ntoothpaste, to tainted and contaminated seafood.\n\nI think the public at large would be alarmed to know that in 2007 the United States ran a manufacturing trade \nbalance surplus in only two areas. Number two, a little over $1.1 billion dollars a year was in non-electric \nmachinery. Number one, by a large margin, over a $17.4 billion dollar surplus, was in scrap and waste.\n\nTo apply this to the Local area, since 2001 New York State has lost the third highest number of jobs to China, after \nCalifornia and Texas, 127,000 jobs. Manufacturing is the third largest contributor to NY's Gross State Product, \nabout $61 billion per year. Rochester has been devastated by the loss of manufacturing jobs. Kodak has moved \nwhole divisions to China, employing less than 7500 workers here.Kodak employed over 60,000 in 1980 in \nRochester. To be fair, Kodak's world wide employment is now less than 25,000. Bausch and Lomb has moved jobs \nto China. Auto jobs have been lost or offshored due to this unfair cheating by China, 4000 jobs at the old Delco, \nlater ITT, then Valeo, a couple thousand more at Delphi. Hickey Freeman has lost a number of jobs and been in \ndanger of closing in the past year due to dumping of subsidized Chinese suits. On average the jobs created in \nservice industries, health care and government pay $8100 less per year nationwide. However, these jobs have not \nbeen of sufficient quanity or wage quality to make up for the losses in the manufacturing sector. Additionally we now \nhave significant job losses in the government sector which will not only decrease jobs but further depress average \nwages. State government has grants for companies, economic development funding and IDA and Empire or \nEnterprise zones for tax subsidies, but for the most part they haven't been sufficient to stop the bleeding. Since \nthese tax subsidies do not require family sustaining wages, they will not rebuild an economy based on consumer \nspending. Interestingly, anti dumping laws and countervailing duty laws (AD-CVD) on subsidies have been around \n\n\n\nfor over a century and are part of WTO rules, and they go hand and hand. These regulations have the support of \nmost trade partners, expect many American CEO's who say when we advocate for enforcement we are being anti - \ntrade protectionists.\n\nIn fact these executives are the anti- trade protectionists whose motivation is the same greed that caused business \nlobbyists to get politicians to pass Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1920's. These subsidies that favor home industries in \nChina have hindered and denied access to the Chinese Market for foreign companies manufacturing in China so \nthat most of what they make in China is for export. In less than a decade, over $27 billion dollars in government \nsubsides in energy to China's steel industry has moved them to the number one producer and exporter of steel, \nproducing more steel than the next three countries together, Japan, US and Russia.\n\nAs our own NY Nobel Laureate in economics, Joseph Stiglitz writes, all countries have the ability to levy tariffs to \nbalance trade and protect jobs, all do with a VAT, value added tax on imports, except the US. However, the majority \nof countries do not have the money to subsidize their own industries to compete with massive subsidies that China \ngives to their industries. Such subsidies are the epitome of protectionist unfair trade.\n\nThough I agree with the recommendations I've seen from this commission on dumping, subsides, currency \nmanipulation, and labor and environmental standards, the problem is they are recommendations, \nrecommendations to Congress to recommend to the President or the Treasury, that they recommend to the WTO \nthat the trade regulations be enforced. The Bush Administration showed no interest in enforcement and sometimes \nneither did the WTO. Regulations are useless if not enforced. Congress must pass laws requiring corrections in \nWTO rules and enforcement of existing rules or pull out. The Constitution charges our government to promote the \ngeneral welfare, not some tribunal that is not accountable to the electorate. Economists still agree that when \nAmerica sneezes the rest of the world catches cold. China needs our consumer market, especially in a country \nwhere workers are low waged 58 and not free,supressing internal consumer demand. Yet there are still plenty of \nBig Business types and economists from the IMF, the Chicago School, the \"my head is flat\" Tom Freedman people \nwho say this is \"OK\", natural, evolutionary, that 100 manufacturing jobs lost in Rochester is \"OK\" because 100 \ncustomer service call center jobs replaced them in Tuscan. In a democracy they don't get to decide that it is \"OK\" \nour children have no family sustaining jobs after school, its not \"OK\" that 45% of Rochester children live in poverty \nand that poverty is crumbling our city and contributing to a culture of crime and fatalism. In a Democracy they don't \nget to decide for the rest of us that its \"OK\" to sacrifice and destroy once thriving communities like Rochester, and \nFlint and Detroit, and Buffalo, and Syracuse and Akron and Newark. We need trade laws and rules with cheaters in \nthe Global Community, like China, that are required to trade by the rules as our Constitution says, and promote the \ngeneral welfare.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you very much. As Mr. Bertolone noted, Mayor Johnson is now with us. Mayor \nJohnson is a Professor here at Rochester Institute of Technology, and he was Mayor of Rochester from 1993 to \n2005. In 1999, Governing Magazine named Mr. Johnson as one of its \"Top Ten Public Officials in America.\" Maybe \nwe can go to Mayor Johnson now and then finish up with you, Mr.\n\nKowalewski.\n\nMR. JOHNSON: Thank you very much.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Again, if we could limit the remarks to seven minutes, please.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAM A. JOHNSON, JR.\n\nFORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER AND DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY \nAND URBAN STUDIES, ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK MR. \nJOHNSON: Yes, thank you, Commissioner Shea and Commissioner Mulloy and other members of the Commission. \nThank you for this opportunity and this invitation, and I apologize for my delay.\n\n\n\nBut without any explanation, let me get right into what I wanted to say here. As you know, I spoke with each of you \nand with members of your staff as you were doing your ascertainment for this hearing, and I indicated that I \nprobably would not have much to add about the notion of outplacing and outsourcing of jobs to China, but you also \nexpressed concern about what had happened to the upstate economy and the reasons for that.\n\nAnd, therefore, I've really confined my analysis to looking at the kind of dislocations and disinvestments that have \noccurred in what we refer to as the Rust Belt economy in the last 60 years.\n\nAnd true, as I bring quite a bit of experience, even the telling of it makes me shudder that I'm as old as I am now, \nbut I spent 42 years now in the field since graduating, and I've lived in two Rust Belt communities. I lived and \nworked in Flint, Michigan for several years, and then I moved here to Rochester where I have actually now lived for \n36 years.\n\nDuring that time, a lot of things have occurred which only in hindsight and 59 retrospect are we able to get our \nhands around. At the time I lived in Flint, Flint was one of the leading automotive capitals of the world. During that \nperiod in the late '60s and the early '70s, every Buick automobile that was built in America was built and assembled \nin Flint, Michigan.\n\nAt one point, earlier, every Chevrolet automobile that was built in America was built and assembled in Flint, \nMichigan. Flint is the birthplace of General Motors as well as the birthplace of the United Autoworkers, and has had \na long and storied history, and yet we know from popular culture and from reading press accounts that Flint is on \nthe precipice of demise. It is one of those cities that has lost a significant portion of its population from its peak of \nover 196,000 people in 1960 to current times where it's now about to slip below 100,000 residents.\n\nAnd as someone who keeps in contact with friends and colleagues, former friends and colleagues, in Flint, I can tell \nyou that there is no end to the misery.\n\nWhat does it mean when a city that depended upon one employer for over 80,000 jobs is now down to less than ten \npercent of that number, fewer than 8,000 jobs, and that number keeps going down.\n\nWhen I moved to Rochester in the early 1970s, it was as though I was moving to nirvana. I was moving to a place \nwhich seemed to be immune to all of these economic dislocations. It was even then cities like Buffalo, Syracuse, \nUtica, Jamestown, Binghamton, were beginning to show fraying signs, but Rochester was that glowing light, that \ngem, in a sea of despair.\n\nAnd, in 1980, as my friend Jim Bertolone has already indicated, Kodak employed in Monroe County alone, over \n60,000 people. It has now shed 90 percent of its jobs in the intervening years.\n\nI would say to you that I think this tsunami of economic dislocation which hit places like upstate New York, which \nhas been documented in numerous studies, which I refer to in my paper, this happened long before outsourcing of \njobs to China and Japan and Mexico and other places.\n\nIn fact, you have to research it to really document it. People have forgotten that the first outsourcing of jobs from \nplaces like Schenectady and Rochester and Syracuse went to the Sun Belt. I was born and raised in a sleepy town \ncalled Lynchburg, Virginia in the 1940s and '50s, and I remember when General Electric opened up a facility, a \nbrand new facility, in Lynchburg, which had transformational powers on that city which was caught in the grips and \nthe throes of racial segregation.\n\nGeneral Electric from the north came into that city, creating several hundred new jobs, and opened--in fact, a few \nthousand new jobs--and opened up tremendous economic opportunity for the residents of that city, but if you track \nit, and you can find the history, and it's very hard because these companies do not tell you when they leave \nSchenectady where they go, but they left the north and they went to the south and the west, and they went there in \nsearch of cheap labor, lax labor regulations, and lower costs.\n\nSo we are now just caught in the second wave of this ongoing movement.\n\n\n\nAnd I cite what happens as a mayor when you're dealing with a city. I cite that 60 when I came to office in 1994, \nthere were still rather, relatively abundant resources that were available, and we were able to deal with a lot of the \nproblems that were overwhelming our communities like abandoned neighborhoods, loss of services, jobs, \nimproving public safety, improving schools, providing after-school activities. There were still resources that were \navailable for us to pour into these community needs.\n\nBut when you step back, and after I left office--when I left office, and I would want the record to reflect that I left \noffice on my own accord.\n\nI was not ushered out of office by disgruntled voters. I retired from office. At the time of my retirement, in 2005, and \ncoming here to RIT, I've had an opportunity now to look back over that period, and when you look back, you say, \nwow, look at all this investment that we made; look at all these physical changes where I can take you to see.\n\nI just took some visitors from Korea around the city of Rochester last week who came here to look at some things, \nand I could point to things that occurred, new improvements that were made, and yet this city still is on the \ndownslide.\n\nLet me cite two quick statistics to try to illustrate my point. First, the notion of concentrated poverty. In 1950, there \nwas one census tract in this region with poverty rates of over 40 percent. That's the definition of concentrated \npoverty. By 2000, that number had increased to 20. There are 20 census tracts in the greater Rochester \nmetropolitan area that have poverty rates of over 40 percent.\n\nEach and every one of those poverty tracts is concentrated and found within the corporate limits of the city of \nRochester, which is only 35 square miles of a 615 mile, square mile county.\n\nThe rest of that county, the rest of the 615 square miles, are absolutely free of this level of bone-crunching poverty. \nAnd I would submit to that you it doesn't matter how often or how innovative and creative you are, these are factors \nthat are very, very difficult to overcome.\n\nLet me cite another one. We talk often about Kodak's job loss. Let me cite another statistic for you. In 1983, Kodak \nwas the second- largest taxpayer in the city of Rochester and its property valuations accounted for nearly 12 \npercent of the city's total taxes.\n\nThis last year, 2008, which is the last year for which we have records, it's now down to 1.95 percent. In Kodak's \nshrinkage and downsizing, not only have we lost jobs and we've lost middle-class standards for thousands and \nthousands of families who depended on those jobs generation after generation, we've seen communities that are \ndevastated.\n\nThe community just south of Kodak Park, which is known as Maplewood, one of the most beautiful and historic \nneighborhoods in this city, has been the recent scene of some of the most vicious crimes that we have ever seen. A \nmother was stomped to death by a mob just less than a mile south of Kodak Park. And we've seen that \nneighborhood transformed from being largely owner-occupied to now being investor owned with renters \npredominating the population.\n\nWe've seen the loss of philanthropy. Kodak was a great corporate citizen, 61 and it spread its largess around this \ncommunity. That philanthropy has all but disappeared. We've seen greatly decreased volunteerism--Kodak \nencouraged the 60,000 workers to be active partners, and not only did its leaders go out and take part in the civic \naffairs of this community, but the average person on the line went out and did things like coach Little League \nbaseball, volunteer for neighborhood groups, be actively and intimately involved in the affairs of community.\n\nAll of that has dissipated, and now Kodak has shrunk its physical footprint by more than a third. Kodak Park, which \nwas the largest manufacturing complex in all of New York State, is now a shadow of itself. Not only have buildings \nbeen torn down, which accounts for that shrinkage of tax base, but buildings have been empty, and in its place they \nnow have become realtors and landlords. They opened up their facilities for new companies to come in. That would \n\n\n\nbe a wonderful thing if we were in a growing community, if our population base was expanding, but what is \nhappening is that people are being seduced and attracted to leave their current space and go to this historic site \ncalled Kodak Park, where all of the amenities and the histories are there.\n\nSo they are essentially just moving chairs on the Titanic, moving people out of one building into Kodak space, and \nso we have a tremendous problem of vacant and abandoned properties in this community.\n\nLet me close by saying this. This is not news. I didn't come here today with any headlines or any news. This has \nbeen known to the policymakers and the officials of this state for the last 40 years, and their response to it can only \nbe called feeble, feckless, ineffective. And aside from offering a few tax incentives and abatements, there is no \nconcrete urban policy that you can find in the state of New York.\n\nThis has been suggested in a number of places. Two years ago the Brookings Institution put out this report that you \nmay be aware of called \"Restoring Prosperity: The State Role in Revitalizing America's Older Industrial Cities,\" \nwhich calls for policy changes at the state level, and because of our unexpected shift in governance from Governor \nSpitzer to Governor Patterson, this has gotten lost in the process.\n\nA year later, a commission that Governor Spitzer appointed, which reported to Governor Patterson--I happen to \nhave been a member of that commission--issued a roadmap for change: \"21st Century Local Governments.\" And \nthere have been other studies from people like Professor Rolf Pendall down at Cornell on behalf of Brookings. It \ntalks about how we can change the upstate economy. It is not from a lack of knowledge that we have not found a \nway out of this mess.\n\nIt's from a lack of will, and I don't know how to begin to get that point across, particularly, and I say this without any \nattempt to demean anybody who is in public office because I myself served in that position, but with the people who \nare currently entrusted with the public interest, these people have not shown the vision, the courage, and the \nfortuity to bring us out of the mire that we are in.\n\nSo I would come here today to say to you it's great that we're looking at the role of China as to what has happened \nthere, but we ought to look at how much of 62 this has been self-inflicted, and how we can recover from our own \ndoing.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. William A. Johnson, Jr.\n\nFormer Mayor of the City of Rochester and Distinguished Professor of Public Policy and Urban Studies, Rochester \nInstitute of Technology, Rochester, New York To the co-chairs of this public hearing, Patrick A. Mulloy and Dennis \nC. Shea, I thank you for the invitation to speak at this hearing. At the outset, I should indicate that my presentation \nwill take a somewhat different direction than the other speakers, focusing on more generalized conditions of urban \ndecline rather than on the specific conditions of globalization and trade. This is done with the prior knowledge and \nconsent of the co-chairs and commission staff, based on our preliminary discussions at the time this hearing was \nbeing planned.\n\nI have no empirical studies to cite, or original research to report. I am still in a data gathering and assessment \nphase of my research on declining cities. I am able to share a narrative with this panel today based on more than \nforty years of experience as an urban policy maker and practitioner. Hopefully these subjective field observations \nwill be helpful in your on-going deliberations about the patterns of urban decline that are so pervasive in certain \nregions of this nation.\n\nLet me briefly describe my professional background, which will illuminate the perspective that my testimony will \ntake. I have been on R.I.T's faculty since January 1, 2006, and I hold a joint appointment in the departments of \nScience, Technology and Society/Public Policy; and Urban and Community Studies. My courses focus on urban \npolicy and planning, with a particular concern about the contemporary relevance of local governance structures, \n\n\n\npast and present performance of community economic development initiatives, and the process for engaging \ncitizens in reform and accountability efforts for local governments. I came to this appointment immediately after \nretiring as Mayor of Rochester.\n\nSince completing graduate school forty-two (42) years ago, I have been engaged in a diverse array of urban \ngovernance and community development activities. For twenty-one (21) years I served as the chief executive \nofficer of one of Rochester's leading human service and planning organizations, the Urban League; for two (2) \nyears as the deputy director of the Urban League in Flint, Michigan; for twelve years (12) as the elected Mayor and \nchief administrative officer of New York's third largest city; and for seven (7) years as a political science and urban \npolicy professor in Flint and Rochester.\n\nDuring this period I have worked in two \"rust-belt\" cities, one each in the Northeast and Midwest, which have \nundergone unrelenting transformation and decline. The 1950 census reflected the peak populations for many \ncommunities in these regions, with marked declines occurring in subsequent decades. Between 1950 and 2000, \nRochester registered a 34% population loss, from 332,488 to 219.773. If current projections for this decade are \nconfirmed by the 2010 census, Rochester will have around 200,000 people, the lowest level since 1910. [Note: All \npopulation data cited throughout this paper is taken from various Census reports, unless otherwise indicated.] Flint, \nthe birthplace of both General Motors and the United Auto Workers, experienced a 1094% population increase \nbetween 1900 and 1930, from 13,103 to 156,492, most of which can be attributed to the rapid expansion of the \nautomotive industry. At one point, every Chevrolet and Buick automobile was built in a Flint factory. This growth \nwas so phenomenal that when most other northeastern and Midwestern cities were experiencing a population \ndecline between 1950 and 1960, Flint registered a 20.5% increase, from 163,143 to 196,940. Rochester [ - 4.2%], \nBuffalo [ -8.16%], Pittsburgh [ -10.7%], Cleveland [ -4.2%], Detroit [ -9.7%] and St. Louis [ -12.46%] were moving in \nthe opposite direction.\n\n63 Between 1970 and 2000, Flint has lost 35.5% of its population, down to 124,943. Like Rochester, its population \nhas continued in free fall during the past eight years, where estimates project an almost 9.5% loss of its residents.\n\nBoth cities have suffered huge losses in jobs in their leading industries. The photographic giant, Eastman Kodak, \nhas eliminated nearly 90% of its 60,000 jobs in the Rochester area since the early 1980's. The General Motors \ncompanies that employed more than 80,000 people in the Flint area as late as 1978 have also shed 90 % of their \nworkforce. This is a shock to the community's central nervous system that is impossible to absorb.\n\nIt is customary to look to conventional and very obvious explanations when seeking reasons to explain this level of \ndecline. Factors like disinvestment, deindustrialization, globalization and technology improvements are often \nidentified as causal factors. However my experience and research have revealed that other factors, sometimes \noverlooked and sometimes deliberately minimized, can often play a crucial role in destabilizing communities. It is \nmy belief that one such overlooked factor played a contributory role in the early stages of Flint's decline, which was \nmade irrevocably worse by General Motor's massive downsizing two decades later.\n\nLet me indicate at the outset of this particular anecdote that I have discussed this theory with several of my former \nFlint academic and political colleagues, to first ascertain if any empirical studies were conducted, and to validate my \nrecall of the facts. While the factual recall was verified, I could find no evidence of hard research into the matter. I \neven raised this subject when I was twice invited to lecture in Flint a few years ago, but my presentations did not \ngenerate any follow up. Nor have I had the time or resources to spend in any follow up research of my own.\n\nMy connection to Flint began in September 1967 when I relocated from Washington DC to teach, two months after \nthe major riot in Detroit and a couple of lesser skirmishes in Flint. In January 1968, it became one of the first cities \nto install a Black mayor. There was in place at the time the commission-manager form of government, where the \nMayor was elected by his fellow commissioners as the presiding officer for official meetings and ceremonial events.\n\nFloyd J. McCree, a beloved community leader and commission member, won this designation, but he resigned \nshortly afterwards in protest when the commission voted down an historic open-housing ordinance that was \ndesigned to overturn housing segregation patterns in the city. The mayor's resignation sent shock waves \n\n\n\nthroughout the entire community, but McCree would not budge from his decision unless the commission reversed \nitself, which occurred after much emotional public discourse over the period of a few weeks.\n\nUntil that time, the majority of Flint's Black population was confined to intolerable living conditions in the northeast \nquadrant, in the vicinity of many of GM's manufacturing facilities. The imaginary dividing line was Detroit Street \n(later renamed Martin Luther King Boulevard); few Blacks lived west of Detroit Street and few whites lived on the \neastern side. Yet, after open housing this changed. Once a few Black families began to move, racial fears began to \nescalate. Some realtors were suspected of engaging in \"blockbusting\" tactics, which the Urban League and the \nNAACP, along with the white religious community, worked hard to overcome. News media accounts of increasing \ncrime overtaking formerly peaceful white neighborhoods and of persons selling their homes for below-market prices \nwere standard fare. White flight and Black pride abounded in an atmosphere of hysteria and fear. This was not \nFlint's \"finest hours\", which might account for why so many people are still trying to push these memories out of \nmind without reflecting on what this situation did to disrupt the overall sustainability of the community.\n\nWithin a couple of decades, Flint was transformed from a majority-white to a majority-Black city. By 2000, over 53% \nof the population was African-American. Today, Flint has one of the highest rates of abandoned and vacant \nproperties of any city in America, and it is one of the pioneers of a land banking program that could place it on the \nroad to recovery and re-population [Land Bank Institute].\n\nWhile little or no empirical data beyond old newspaper accounts exist from this era, there is one indisputable fact. \nIn 1970, the census registered 3,623 fewer city residents, a meager 1.8% loss. (Rochester and Buffalo lost 7% and \n13.1%, respectively, during the same period.) Given that Flint's factories were still employing record numbers, and \nthe impact of the 1973 OPEC \"oil embargo\" had not taken effect, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that much, if \n64 not all of this population decline, can be attributed to \"white flight\" to the surrounding suburbs. One other factor \ncan be noted: a majority of Genesee County's population lived outside of the city, as registered in the 1970 census. \nIn 1970, 56.6% of the county's 445,589 residents lived outside of the city, compared to 47.4% in 1960. [Genesee \nCounty Parks, page 5]. While these trends matched the march to suburbanization that began full bore after World \nWar II, a case can be made that the Flint Open Housing ordinance helped to stimulate some of that movement.\n\nEven with the benefit of four decades of hindsight, it is not entirely clear that Flint could have avoided its current \nstate of decline if the open-housing program had been better planned and implemented. Communities that followed \na less controversial path have experienced similar levels of destabilization. And Flint's open housing law was not \nthe only example of well-designed initiatives that wrought unintended consequences. The Open Housing \nOrdinance was not conceived as a way to drive white residents out of town, or to render whole neighborhoods as \nunlivable. But that was the practical effects of the legislation, and it unintentionally placed the city on a downward \nspiral from which it has been slow to recover. Flint's residential tax base has been devastated in recent years by the \nmassive depletion of its housing stock. The 2000 U.S. Census estimated that 12 per cent of the city's housing stock \nwas vacant or abandoned, amounting to over 5,000 units. [Land Policy Institute, p.7] Whole blocks of houses, and \nsometimes entire neighborhoods, look as though they have been attacked by a neutron bomb. There is little \nevidence that state and local officials could come up with a credible strategy to deal with the problem until a few \nyears ago, when massive property abandonment in cities like Detroit and Flint forced the Michigan legislature to \nrevamp its outmoded tax foreclosure laws, giving local officials a quicker and cleaner path to taking possession of \nproperties that were in foreclosure. The Genesee County Treasurer, Dan Kildee, created a Land Bank program that \nhas allowed the county to address this problem in a creative way. [ Swope, 2008; Streitfeld, 2009].\n\nThe point of this story is that it illustrates the flaws of well- intended urban policies, as well as the opportunities for \nchange that can be derived from them. That is the perspective I want to address in the remainder of this testimony.\n\nThis hearing is seeking answers to six questions. I will confine my attention to questions 5 and 6, as outlined in your \ninvitation letter: 5) \"What has the state government done to respond to the economic decline in central and western \nNY? What kinds of state policies are being implemented to stop the outsourcing or to attract new investment in the \nregion? 6) \"What impact did this decline have on the job base and the tax bases of communities in central and \n\n\n\nwestern NY? What kinds of jobs have replaced the jobs that have been lost?\" There is no question that the urban \ncommunities of upstate New York have experienced tremendous dislocation during the past sixty years.\n\nThe title, \"The Empire State\" reflected its status as the nation's largest and most prosperous state. Every major city \nin the state, from New York City downstate to Buffalo-Niagara Falls upstate were home to corporations that shaped \nthe nation and the world through the much of the 20th century. Companies like Bethlehem Steel and General \nMotors in Buffalo, Dow and DuPont in Niagara Falls, Kodak, Xerox and Bausch & Lomb in Rochester, Carrier, \nCrouse-Hinds and General Electric in Syracuse, IBM in Poughkeepsie and Binghamton, and General Electric in \nSchenectady were leaders in their fields and generated substantial economic prosperity for the citizens of their \ncommunities. Today, these companies and their home cities are mere shadows of their former selves. Most of \nthese corporate giants have either relocated or downsized considerably.\n\nDavid Rusk, a noted urban policy expert who has spent much time advocating for structural change in New York \nstate, has charted the demographic decline of the Upstate region. Between 1950 and 2000, each of the major \npopulation centers experienced substantial losses: Albany [ -29%]; Binghamton [ -41%]; Buffalo [ -50%], Elmira [ - \n38%]; Jamestown [ - 27%]; Niagara Falls [ -39%]; Rochester [ -34%]; Schenectady [ -33%]; Syracuse [ -33%]; Utica \n[ -40%]; and Troy [ - 32%]. [ Rusk, 2005].\n\n65 These numbers are even more startling when compared to downstate. While New York City grew by a meager \n1.5% during this period, Westchester County grew by 48%, Nassau County by 98% and Suffolk County by 414% \n[Rusk}.\n\nThis upstate decline has been the subject of much analysis, both in the media and among academics. One of the \nmost recent studies was conducted by Professor Rolf Pendall of Cornell University for The Brookings Institution. It \nstudied population data from 1990 through 2002. He concluded that if the Upstate Region, home to nearly 7 million \npeople, was a separate state, its growth rate of 1.1% would have outpaced only West Virginia and North Dakota.\n\nHe found that out-migration during the period greatly exceeded in-migration, and that the elder population grew \ndisproportionately; there were 14% aged 65 and older, compared to 12.1% nationally. One additional finding that \nalso illustrates the changing jobs picture in Upstate was the increase in the prison population: 28.3% of all new \nUpstate residents were prisoners. The state has significantly increased the number of prison facilities in the wake of \nits severe Rockefeller Drug Law enforcement during the past 25 years. [Pendall] The results of this unrelenting and \npervasive Upstate depopulation has been absolutely depressing: eroding tax bases, concentrated poverty, \ndistressed neighborhoods full of abandoned residences and businesses, and declining political power. \nCommunities like Rochester have gone from prosperous to precarious in the face of this turnaround.\n\nIn my opinion, many of these forces of disinvestment and dislocations preceded the global redistribution of jobs and \ntechnology. It is clear that the fortunes of Upstate, like the remaining regions in the so-called \"rust-belt\" economies \nof the north- east and mid-west, began to unravel in the 1950's when factories in Schenectady, Niagara Falls and \nother communities began to relocate to the \"sun-belt\". My hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia received one of those \nplants which were relocated by General Electric and another by Babcock and Wilcox, which transformed it from a \nsleepy town to a growing metropolis. Lynchburg's population increased 36.8% from 1950 through 2000. Meanwhile \nSchenectady, which had once housed 44,000 GE employees before that number was reduced to 4,000, suffered its \npreviously noted 33% decline.\n\nThus, my contention is that if we focus on the impact of trade with China on Upstate New York, then the analysis \nwill be extremely incomplete.\n\nDuring my three terms as Mayor, from 1994 through 2005, the city was faced with an array of challenges: \nincreasing and concentrated poverty accompanied by spiraling rates of violence, declining public school student \nperformance, decaying neighborhoods being overwhelmed by vacant and abandoned housing, declining stature as \nthe hub of the region, and difficulties in generating sufficient new economic activity that would help to mitigate many \nof these problems.\n\n\n\nOne example of this malaise was the unrelenting spread of poverty, in the city proper. One piece of data that my \nstaff produced was used repeatedly to frame the dialogue for action. In 1950, there was one census tract in the \nentire city with a poverty level higher than 40%. A poverty rate of 40% or more is the accepted definition of \n\"concentrated poverty\" in the U.S. By 2000, there were twenty (20) poverty tracts with 40% or more of concentrated \npoverty, located within the 36 square miles of Rochester. Within the remaining 614 square miles of Monroe County, \nthere were \"zero\" concentrated poverty tracts.\n\nI have defined the five phases of urban decline as: deindustrialization, disinvestment, deterioration, despair and \ndivorce. While the first three are obvious, let me elaborate on the last two phases. When city residents are faced \nwith a situation where many of the good jobs are beyond their reach, when they do not have ready access to \nservices that most of us take for granted - like quality food markets, medical facilities, pharmacies, gasoline \nstations, safe recreation facilities for their children, and restaurants to enjoy a leisurely meal-they feel neglected and \ndiminished by being forced to live a \"second class\" existence. These feelings of despair lead to dysfunctional \nbehaviors that further undermine the viability of these neighborhoods, as William Julius Wilson and others have so \nassiduously studied. In the face of these conditions, efforts to bring about sustainable change are often \noverwhelmed.\n\n66 Divorce best describes the disillusionment that most non-city residents manifest at these conditions. Ray Suarez \ncaptured this mood perfectly a decade ago in his best-selling book, \"The Old Neighborhood\". He interviewed scores \nof people who had migrated from working class and middle income neighborhoods in Chicago, Cleveland, Los \nAngeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Washington, DC. When those people returned to their old \nneighborhoods, they were appalled with the conditions that greeted them: rundown and abandoned housing; sacred \ninstitutions and community gathering places like churches, schools and social clubs that had fallen into disuse or \nunconventional uses; and men hanging out on street corners and not taking care of their families. They felt, almost \nuniversally, that the residents who had followed them had squandered a precious inheritance. They were unwilling \nor unable to rationalize such abstract theories as concentrated poverty or disinvestment, and how these things, \nalong with a ferocious out-migration of people like themselves, could have conspired to create the most \nunimaginable \"unintended consequences\". All that mattered to them was that their precious old neighborhoods, \nwhich had been the source of so many precious memories, were irretrievably lost [Suarez].\n\nDuring my tenure we were blessed with much creativity, institutional support and significant financial resources. We \nwere able to inspire neighborhood residents to join in an effective partnership with City Hall to plan for the future.\n\nWe built new houses, brought new services into neighborhoods, increased resources to our school, created new \npartnerships with police and residents that led to reduced crime and violence. Despite all of this energy and \ninvestment, it was not enough. The city could not escape the downward spiral, because there were just too many \nforces beyond our control.\n\nThe plight of the Eastman Kodak Company and other key employers illustrates this point. I have attached a chart \nthat I have prepared for one of my courses that illustrate the changes that occurred in the local employment market \nbetween 1981 and 2007. In 1981, Kodak was the top employer with 59,582 workers. As you can see, the top 15 \ncompanies during that period employed nearly 127,000 people. Eight of those employers were manufacturers. By \n2007, Kodak had dropped to 12,500 employees and ranked third on the list. The top fifteen companies employed \n82, 673, which was 45,000 fewer people than in 1981. Only three of them were manufacturers. The top employer is \nnow the University of Rochester/ Strong Health and the grocery company, Wegman's, rank second. No one \npretends that the quality of jobs and pay at these two outstanding companies compares with Kodak's halcyon days. \nFrom news accounts, it is clear that the same trends exist in cities like Buffalo, Syracuse and Binghamton, where \nlocal universities have replaced manufacturers as the leading employer.\n\nOne further example will illustrate the significance of Kodak's decline. In 1983, Kodak accounted for 11.36% of the \nproperty tax valuation in the city. By 2008, they accounted for only 1.95%. This data can be found on the annual \nAssessment Rolls of the City of Rochester.\n\n\n\nWhen a company like Kodak shrinks its presence in its hometown, there are significant side effects: the loss of jobs \nleads to a decline in the quality of life for the families who were dependent on that income.\n\nMany people are unable to maintain their middle class lifestyles, and neighborhoods suffer as these families either \nmove on or cut back.\n\nKodak was recognized for its civic leadership. Not only were its top managers involved in a host of important \ncommunity initiatives, but it encouraged its workforce to also be good citizens through volunteerism and generous \nfinancial support. Kodak's philanthropic activities supported a host of worthwhile community endeavors.\n\nIn addition to much of this activity being greatly diminished, Kodak has greatly downsized its physical presence.\n\nMany buildings on its Kodak Park manufacturing campus have been vacated or demolished. Its Elmgrove Plant, \nlocated in the Town of Gates, was closed and sold a decade ago. This 5 million square facility provided significant \ntax revenue to the town, by some estimates accounting for 40% of its tax base. Much of that facility is currently \nunderutilized or vacant, and is now in the hands of its second owner after Kodak's departure. At Kodak Park, an \nincreasing amount of space is being leased to outside businesses. One can only surmise the amount of vacant \nspace that is being created in other parts of the community, as companies take advantage of attractive space and \nattractive rates at a location with such a storied history.\n\nSo far, there have been few state or federal programs that have been able to reverse these trends of disinvestment \nin 67 the Upstate region. At the time of his election, Governor Eliot Spitzer proposed a set of strategies that would \nbe targeted specifically at the Upstate Region. Due to his unexpected and premature departure from office, these \nstrategies have mostly been re-oriented towards a \"one state\" strategy by his successor, Governor Patterson. Aside \nfrom the standard package of tax incentives, Albany has been unable to craft a meaningful and sustainable \nrecovery program for this region.\n\nIn 2007, The Brookings Institution issued a set of recommendations in its report, \"Restoring Prosperity: The State \nRole in Revitalizing America's Older Industrial Cities.\" New York was a primary target of these recommendations, \nwhich called for targeted investments in city schools, neighborhoods and job creation venture. Unfortunately, the \ntransition from Spitzer to Patterson caused this activity to be deferred, and it has never gotten back on tract.\n\n[Brookings] A state commission on which I served gave Governor Patterson a road map for the reform of local \ngovernments, which have become cumbersome and antiquated. These recommendations, under the title \"21st \nCentury Local Government\", have set practically dormant because the Governor's attention has been largely \ndevoted to the state's escalating fiscal crisis. {LGEC] Recommendations from reports prepared by David Rusk and \nRolf Pendall are also still viable. President Obama has begun to set up a new Office of Urban Affairs at the White \nHouse, but its rollout has been delayed by attention to the economy and other high priority issues.\n\nThere is no shortage of recommendations on curing the ills of the Upstate economy. The lack of knowledge is not \nthe problem as much as the lack of will. A lot of people will have to reconsider their opinion about the important \nroles that urban communities play in this new economy, including people who have \"divorced\" themselves from the \nsituation. Hopefully the stage is being set for a path of reconciliation and recovery.\n\nWorks Cited Brookings Institution, Restoring Prosperity: The State Role in Revitalizing America's Older Industrial \nCities. 2007 Genesee County Parks: Five Year Parks and Recreation Plans, 200902013 \nhttp://geneseecountyparks.org/5-yearplan,pdf Land Policy Institute, Economic Impacts of Residential Property \nAbandonment and the Genesee County Land Bank in Flint, Michigan.

JOHNSON: Present company excluded.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. KOWALEWSKI: Everybody needs a break.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: At least he came last, right. Mr.\n\nKowalewski.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. ED KOWALEWSKI DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND \nINVESTMENTS, UPSTATE EMPIRE STATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, BUFFALO, NEW YORK MR. \nKOWALEWSKI: On behalf of Governor David Patterson and Empire State Development's Chairman, Dennis \nMullen, let me begin by again thanking the Commission and its consideration for having this hearing and listening to \ntestimony here in upstate New York and also for selecting Rochester. It's a great location, and I'm glad you were \nable to make the trip.\n\nRather than read my written testimony, I thought what I'd try to do is just make a couple of key remarks and a \ncouple of key points, and then I'm sure you'd like to get into the question and answer session.\n\nLet me start by saying that international trade is a key component to New York State's prosperity. Export sales \ncurrently contribute as much as $70 billion to New York State's economy, and again as a representative of state \ngovernment, particularly tasked with trade promotion, the performance of New York State business in the \nmarketplace is among our greatest concerns, and I spend about 50 percent of my time working and asking \nquestions directly with New York State companies.\n\nThe position that I have allows me the opportunity to meet with companies on a daily basis. So I'm able to hear \nfirsthand about their business challenges and also hear about their business successes as well.\n\nThere is hardly a firm in New York State that has not been touched or impacted by Chinese- made products. I will \nsay that those come in two flavors.\n\nMany of those Chinese-made products are made in China by U.S. corporations, and in many ways, companies in \nupstate New York that are in the manufacturing and service sectors are competing against China on two levels. \nThey're competing against the U.S. corporation products that have their sources in China, and they're also \ncompeting against increasingly sophisticated Chinese companies and Chinesemade products as well.\n\n\n\nSo the competition has a couple of different faces to it. I will, however, also comment that with the rapid expansion \nof low-cost capacity in China, New York State manufacturers continue to experience competitive pressures from \nother locations as well.\n\n70 South Korea, Southeast Asia, Mexico, and even South American countries by almost any measure are \ndeveloping export-oriented economies and exportoriented industry sectors that New York State manufacturers and \nservice providers have to deal with in a daily basis.\n\nAnd I guess I'd be somewhat remiss if I didn't also include India as being a competitor in the area of software and \nbusiness services. Certainly, China's excess industrial capacity and cost advantage have dramatically lowered the \nprice for manufactured goods sold around the world.\n\nNew York firms have had to react to those lower prices, and they've had to do so in many ways by rethinking how it \nis that they perform business. In many cases, New York firms have jettisoned low value and low-priced products, \nhoping to move up the food chain. I can say the record isn't quite clear in terms of success, but many companies \ndo report to me that they've been able to move up the food chain with enhanced or innovative products that now \nmake them competitive in domestic markets and international markets as well.\n\nWe're certainly not naive in our understanding of the market dynamics in the two-way trade between New York and \nChina. Low-cost components produced in China represent a means of cost cutting for New York manufacturers, in \nsome cases, positively impacting supply chain efficiencies and allowing them to create some profit that in some \ncases wasn't there before.\n\nI will report to the Commission that this is a key point for New York manufacturers as they continue to be under \nprice assault by many low cost manufacturing locations. For many firms, this sort of substituting of low-cost \ncomponents from other parts of the world is their secret to survival.\n\nI know the Commission was also interested in investment, in investment attraction, and I will say briefly that China \ncertainly because of its current economic situation and its rapidly expanding production base does represent an \narea of interest for New York State and New York State communities.\n\nWe would certainly welcome that kind of investment, particularly as it allows us the ability to create jobs and create \nlevels of prosperity. As an agency, I will say that we are particularly interested in those high-tech industries. We're \nlooking at Chinese biotech. We're looking at Chinese solar. We're looking at green technologies, and I will say that, \nand my written remarks certainly allude to that, that New York has some levels of Chinese investment already.\n\nWe certainly would be interested in trying to attract more. Rather than chase all of the industries that China has, we \nare keenly interested in the hightech, the value-added industries, and as part of our effort to both support New York \nState industries, but also to support our endeavor to attract investment to New York State, we've recently opened \nthree offices in China.\n\nThey provide services to our companies, help provide market information, develop agent distributor relationships \nand do general problem-solving on behalf of New York State companies. They're also tasked with being on the \nlookout for investment cases.\n\nMore recently, we've started to see an uptick in the potential for Chinese 71 investment, and it's certainly our \nagency's goal and mission to try to attract investment from wherever we can get it in the world to develop levels of \nprosperity here in upstate New York.\n\nLet me simply conclude, the good news that I hear from New York State companies is that they are increasingly \nfinding some success in the China market.\n\nWe're reporting almost $3 billion in export sales, and the challenge that many companies have frankly is to take \nproducts and to increase their level of attention to the innovative process. As they continue to innovate within their \n\n\n\nfirms and create newer products, those products are increasingly being absorbed not only in China but in other \nparts of the world, as well.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. Ed Kowalewski Director of International Trade and Investments, \nUpstate Empire State Development Corporation, Buffalo, New York Let me begin by thanking the Commissions' \nconsideration of an upstate New York location for a field hearing and for selecting Rochester as hearing location. I \nam aware and attentive of the commissions' mandate to assess the key dynamics of the US- China relationship and \nreport back to Congress and I am pleased to provide testimony in support of your mandate.\n\nInternational trade is a key component to New York State prosperity. Exports sales contribute as much as seventy \nbillions of dollars to New York's economy. As a representative of a state government agency charged with \nassisting firms in entering or expanding into international markets, China is particularly important to New York. \nChina is a buyer as well as a seller. Global trade, along with the free movement of capital, is at the heart of today's \ninternational and New York's economy. What makes global trade different today and quite likely into the future is \nthe unprecedented speed and depth of change: firms reorganizing and extending their enterprises, establishing of \nglobal supply chains, instantaneous communications and a new competitive dynamic where every part of the global \neconomy is effectively in competition with every other part.\n\nThe Commission indicated a particular interest in gathering information and better understanding the impact of \nChinese competition on local companies and communities. There is hardly a firm in New York that has not been \ntouched or impacted by Chinese made products. China is the world 's new industrial powerhouse. It is also a large \nand rapidly growing market for raw materials, industrial goods, capital equipment, consumer products and technical \nservices. As such, it remains a market of significant interest for many New York manufacturers and service \nproviders.\n\nChina's exports have grown dramatically over the last three decades. China is now a leading manufacturer, not \nonly of textiles and consumer products, but of increasingly sophisticated electronic equipment, software, and other \ntechnologies as well. It is competing not merely on basis of low costs but increasingly on the basis of high-end \nvalue-added products, as well as costs, using some of the world 's best technologies and drawing from a pool of \nhighly skilled talent and it competing against NY firms.\n\nFaced with the rapid expansion of low-cost production capacity in China, New York manufacturers continue to \nexperience competitive pressures. Throughout the past decade, they have also seen the emergence and \ndevelopment of large export-oriented industry sectors in Southeast Asia and South Korea, Mexico, and South \nAmerica. Now India is a competitor, particularly in the fields of software and business services. China while a being \nfierce business competitor is not the only low cost competitor affecting New York business.\n\nChina's excess industrial capacity and cost advantage have dramatically lowered the price of manufactured goods \n72 being sold around the world. NY firms have had to react to lower priced goods. For a number of NY firms, the \nreaction was to jettison low cost/low value products for products with higher value added and producing higher \nprofits margins. In many other cases the response from firms was to innovate a newer and better product.\n\nChina, in addition be being a competitor, is a source of dynamic market growth for NY firms having the appropriate \nproducts. Business interest by NY firms in Chinese markets and the demand for state trade assistance in China has \nresulted in our agency opening of three trade offices in China. Our agency continues to improve access to markets \nin China on behalf of NY firms. With some satisfaction I do report to the commission that many New York firms are \nfinding success in markets in China. Almost three billion dollars of export sales have been reported in 2008.\n\nAs analysts of two way trade between the US and China we are not na\u00efve in our understanding of the market \ndynamics. For some New York manufacturers, low cost components produced in China represent a means of \ncutting product costs, improving supply chain efficiencies, buoying profits upwards, and lowering prices for \ncustomers. This is a key point as NY manufacturers continue to be under price assault by many low cost \nmanufacturing locations. For many firms, this is their secret to survival.\n\n\n\nWe are always concerned that in addition to following their customers to overseas locations, NY firms consider \npulling up the flag and leaving the state completely. This is not just an international phenomenon or just a Chinese \nchallenge, as we are under constant pressure by other US states to keep firms in New York. We to the best of our \nability activity seek our those firms to work to retain them in the state.\n\nWhere competitive situations exists between location in and out of New York and there is the potential that a firm \nmight leave, we do attempt to offer incentive to keep the target firm in the state. These incentives have produced \ninvestment opportunities for China. One only needs to tour a Chinese industrial park and read the list of American \nfirms that have established operations in the that park to appreciate the return on that incentive offered.\n\nWe are aware of incentives offered by various levels of Chinese government to NY firms to have them consider a \nrelocation of high technology activities (including R & D) to China. We share a joint desire to develop economic \nprosperity through industries and products of the future. Chinese incentive offered range from tax exemptions on \nmachinery, rapid depreciation of equipment and subsidies on real estate and leases. NY firms are increasingly \noffered; a housing resettlement subsidy for key business officials; preferential rental of apartment (owned by \ngovernment) for key technical personnel (typically 70% of market price) and salary subsidies in the range of \nRMB1000-3000 /month for key company officials.\n\nNew York State fiercely competes for investments from manufacturers and other businesses that can choose from \nany number of other attractive investment locations. China's rising financial status makes it an interesting candidate \nas a potential investor in NYS. China's outward investment comes partly from a national policy, not just from \nChinese companies seeking profits overseas.\n\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation selected \nsome thirty to fifty top Chinese companies to take the lead in overseas investment. As they looked to invest \noverseas, these national champions enjoy more advantaged by benefits that helped them compete, including low- \ninterest funding from Chinese banks, many of which are controlled by the government. While China has a cheap, \neffective manufacturing base at home, and has few globally recognized brands this situation is rapidly changing. \nChinese firm's are now making overseas investments in everything from footwear, garments, electronics, and \nappliances.\n\nThis increase can be tied to Chinese companies wanting to secure the complimentary assets that they need to \nbecome internationally competitive. We are also cognizant that in many industry sectors the domestic US market \n(and in turn NY markets) are key driver for investment considerations.\n\nAs an Economic Development agency, we are hopeful that the level of Chinese investment in New York will \nincrease. We can already account for Chinese investment in the forms of real estate and other financial industry \ninvestments. We activity seek and have received inquiries from potential (Chinese) investors in many industry \nsectors but we are particularly interested by potential investment in knowledge based industries such as solar \nenergy, biotech and pharmaceuticals. A key agency task remains to identify, track and engage potential Chinese \ninvestment to secure that investment and create jobs in New York.\n\n73 While NY competes and collaborates across global economic and industry arenas, we must not forget that the \nmost important competition is being fought in the arena of ideas, learning, and delivering new kinds and levels of \nvalue to the marketplace. NY's strategy for success has been articulated by the executive and invested in by the \nlegislature.\n\nIncreased funding in education, and the establishment of Centers of Excellence lay the ground work for innovation \nin key industries. Innovation generates the productivity that economists estimate has accounted for large portions of \nU.S. GDP growth over the past 50 years. Innovation gives rise to new industries and markets; fuels wealth creation \nand profits; and, generates high-value, higher-paying jobs. In a world in which many nations have embraced market \neconomies and can compete on traditional cost and quality terms, it is innovation - the ability to create new value - \nthat will confer a competitive edge in to New York and New York's firms in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nI conclude my remarks and would be happy to respond to questions.\n\nPanel II: Discussion, Questions and Answers HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you very much. Again, we \nappreciate your taking the time to be with us today.\n\nI guess since I have the gavel, I'll ask the first question. This is for you, Mr. Kowalewski. You mentioned that you \nwere trying to seek Chinese investment I guess in New York State generally from their high tech and value-added \ncompanies.\n\nWhat specifically is New York's plan to develop, improve manufacturing, and improve the economy of Rochester \nand the surrounding area? Do you have a plan? MR. KOWALEWSKI: I think the quick answer is that we don't have \na plan specifically for China. What we've been doing, frankly, is rallying resources and rallying marketing \ninformation across upstate. We've had the privilege of working with local public-private organizations in Buffalo, like \nthe Buffalo Niagara Enterprise.\n\nHere, in Rochester, the Greater Rochester Enterprise and various other upstate locations have these groups \nfocused in on trying to retain jobs, create jobs, and market those communities as destinations for foreign \ninvestment. Working with them, we've been able to create tailored marketing brochures. We've been able to focus \nand identify which communities have stronger industry clusters in industries that would attract the appropriate kinds \nof investment.\n\nAnd the state has an ongoing program that we've initiated recently of collecting as many foreign trade councils and \ntrade officers of the foreign consulates that are in New York State, literally bring them to upstate, and then show \nthem, walk them through the communities.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Correct me if I'm wrong. It's my understanding that Albany is becoming a center for \nnanotechnology. There's a focus in Buffalo on life sciences. Is there a similar focus in Rochester on a specific \nindustry or cluster of industries? MR. KOWALEWSKI: There are centers of excellence across all of New York State, \nand there is a center of excellence actually located in Canandaigua.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Optoelectronics.\n\n74 MR. KOWALEWSKI: --focusing on optoelectronics, yes. All of them--and there were a few more that will be, that \nare still be to be opened-- are going through growing pains. You have to establish your credibility in terms of the \nlocal community and being able to assist local businesses, and then you also have to advertise your attributes to \nattract international attention.\n\nAgain, one of the sort of key marketing pieces, and sometimes I think we do make short shrift of the requirement to \nmarket locations' attributes and capabilities, and do it in a way that will attract international attention and on the pull \nthrough international investment.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mayor Johnson or Mr. Bertolone, do you have anything to respond? MR. JOHNSON: \nWell, I want to be fair to the state. It's not, again, through a lack of effort. It's, and even though the results are \nmeager, I think the problem is that we have really not been able to develop a clear strategy and a targeted \nstrategy. When Governor Spitzer came to office, and I've often said this, and many of us rue the day that we drove \nGovernor Spitzer out of office because he at least came to office with some preparation, some focus.\n\nHe spent eight years getting to know this state, and he came with a sort of a bifurcated strategy: he indicated that \nhe would essentially deploy the resources, the economic development resources, targeted to upstate, and to create \na downstate focus as well. We are a two-region state, and our downstate region is far more prosperous now than \nthe upstate is. The situation was just reversed 50 years ago when the upstate economy essentially was the net \ncontributor to the New York State economy.\n\nI think Governor Spitzer brought a sensitivity and an understanding, and he was in the process of developing a set \nof concrete strategies that never had an opportunity to play themselves out.\n\n\n\nThe second point is that there are so many places of despair. In my paper, on page eight, I think it is, and you don't \nneed to find it. You can read it. I cite the number of cities -- there are at least 12 cities in upstate New York -- that \nhave lost between 25 and 50 percent of their net population over the last 50 years.\n\nEvery one of these cities is out to compete for restoration and revitalization.\n\nSo we latch on to any opportunity, and oftentimes we're fighting among ourselves, and we are bidding against \nourselves. We are offering the best of deals.\n\nAnd we have never been able to quite resolve the fact that a new set of jobs, if they are in Batavia, for example, \nthey can benefit both Buffalo and Rochester.\n\nYou know, we don't want them to go to Batavia; we want them to come to Rochester; we certainly don't want them \nto go to Buffalo. We've got find a way to really address that.\n\nThe third thing is that we have meager resources. During my time, we actually successfully attracted one company \nfrom Taiwan to locate a branch operation in one of our industrial parks in the northeast side of Rochester. It \nsupplies parts to Delphi, and they needed to be, and we persuaded them that they should be, close to their \ncustomer so they came.\n\n75 Let me tell you, they didn't have to expend a lot of effort in order to get here. I mean we wrapped this deal in as \nmuch red ribbon as we could in order to attract them. We had an empty industrial park. We had money. We had the \nstate and the county working with us. And yet today that company--I have a chart on the back of my paper that lists \nthe 15 largest employers in Monroe County from '81 up to 2007--you will not find Macauto on that list. It probably \nemploys less than 50 people.\n\nOur view was that at the time if we could get one, there were a whole host of others that would follow, and I would \nsay to you that if it were just Rochester trying to dig itself out of the hole, I think the state would be in a better \nposition to help, but the fact is that there are so many communities that are in that same hole trying to dig \nthemselves out, it makes it difficult for them to decide where to target their resources.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: I would say two things. One of the things in the debates we've had here with the local business \nalliance leading up to these trade groups is that Rochester would benefit. Unlike Syracuse and Buffalo, which was \nmore blue collar, Rochester industrial base was more high tech, and more white collar--computers, photonics, \nbiomedical, and the rest.\n\nInteresting thing, I write a monthly labor column for the Rochester Business Journal, and I ran across a column I \nwrote at the beginning of 2005. In the year 2004--and Rochester because of Kodak and this high tech always had a \npositive trade balance--we exported more from Rochester than we imported.\n\nRochester exported more goods than Buffalo and Syracuse combined, and yet we lost more jobs that year than \nBuffalo and Syracuse combined. That is how serious the problem is with trade with China. So it is insidious. Mr. \nKowalewski mentioned Dennis Mullen who I know.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: A Rochester resident, right? MR. BERTOLONE: Yes. Before he went with the state, \nhe was with Greater Rochester Enterprise to bring business in here, and I know, I was on the plane last week to \nNew York with Dennis, and I know--and I thanked him because I know it's through GRE, he worked over a year, \nover a year, to bring an Italian company in here, Barilla, to Avon, I think, for about 120 jobs, decent jobs, but just the \neffort expended and the community resources, like Bill Johnson, who said to get the company from Taiwan, to bring \none company here, and 100 plus jobs in the current economic situation is very, very difficult with what we're facing.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\n\n\nChairman Bartholomew.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thank you very much.\n\nOne of the very interesting things for us is to be able to go out and talk to people about what's going on in their \ncommunities. In the early 1990s, the machinists put out a report called \"Jobs on the Wing\" that was one of the first \nreal forward-looking analyses. It focused on the aerospace industry, of course, but it was essentially talking about \nhow many of the jobs that were already shifting to 76 China for the production of airplanes and a lot of, of course, \nhaving to do with Boeing.\n\nBut the point of it was that these opportunities that are created by expanding the trade also have costs because, as \nBoeing was doing more and more business with China, more and more jobs were going to be shifted over to China.\n\nSo I'm particularly interested in your comment, Mr. Kowalewski, about Chinese investment, that Chinese companies \nwant to secure the complementary assets that go along with their investments in the United States, and I wondered \nif any or all of you could comment on whether you're concerned that Chinese investments in cutting edge industries \nhere in New York would result in the transfer of know-how and technology that ultimately hollows out these sunrise \nindustries before they even have a chance to be created? MR. BERTOLONE: Well, there are a couple of things. I'm \nalso on the board of the AFL-CIO's Workforce Development Institute for New York State. It does quite a bit of \ntraining grants, and one of our coalition partners is the Apollo Alliance in green technology.\n\nThe words \"corporate welfare\" were mentioned earlier, and labor has no problem with that under certain \nconditions. Taxpayers are entitled to certain conditions. One of the things we've invested with in the Apollo Alliance \nis putting steelworkers back to work in Buffalo in a plant that was closed making solar panels. Good investment. \nGood investment of tax dollars. Good jobs brought back.\n\nI had been arguing and arguing when we were in this project that there must be guarantees in the contract. It does \nnot help us that we do this, and two years later the company is successful and says you know what, we can \nincrease our profits ten percent by going to Mexico and close the factory after taking our tax dollars.\n\nSemiconductors were mentioned earlier on technology. That's a perfect example. In the '80s, under the Reagan \nadministration, wave of the future. We got to be heavily invested in semiconductors. We need protective tariffs, and \nthe government did that to protect that industry. As soon as that industry got its global competitive footing and was \nentrenched in the global market, they began outsourcing jobs.\n\nI heard a little bit about education. One of the graphs that I have attached here will show that in the last seven or \neight years, the majority of wages and jobs that have been outsourced are those with college degrees plus, not \nlabor intensive toys and shoes and clothes, college degrees plus.\n\nWe are now seeing these technical--as Professor Hira talked about-- research and development. We are now \nseeing billions of dollars of wages in hightech jobs, and this very college, and it's a trend nationwide, in the last \nfour or five years, you will see the number of computer science majors are way down.\n\nKids have changed their majors because the unemployment rate in computer science is at ten year highs in the last \ntwo or three--this is before the recession-- the unemployment rate.\n\n77 Sometimes this is left out of the media because what goes on-- you train your replacement. Under our labor \nlaws, professional white collar managerial workers are not allowed to unionize under the National Labor Relations \nAct.\n\nConditions of their separation agreements, if they want to keep health care for a year, get severance pay and the \nrest, is they got to keep their mouth shut as they sign a contract.\n\nAnd you mentioned guest workers. There's no shortage of engineers and computer scientists in this country. These \nH-2 guest worker visas are being used to bring immigrants over here, sometimes educated at the same universities, \n\n\n\nhave the people who are losing their jobs train them, and then they go back to India and do a $70,000 for 12 to \n15,000 a year.\n\nNow, India really isn't the problem and won't be the problem in the future that China is because India is the \nworld's largest democracy, and what we've seen in the last five or six years is the rate of inflation over there.\n\nWe are seeing the wage scale increase with double-digit inflation and consumer demand developing in India, unlike \nthere's a death of consumer demand in China outside the 300 million people on the east coast--their industrial \nsector--because wages are so low.\n\nBut this is a continual problem. Tax subsidies, whether it's industrial development agencies, where we give our tax \nmoney to promise to create jobs, there has to be some claw backs. If the taxpayers of New York help you establish \na solar panel company, you can't move it to China and throw everybody out of work when you use taxpayer money.\n\nI give you an example that people are screaming about that I represent right now. If we own 60 percent of a bank, \nwhy are they still paying obscene salaries and giving themselves bonuses? And why are we going to pay interest \non those TARP loans that will keep our grandchildren--there has to be something in return, some guarantees for our \ntax money.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Kowalewski, would you like to respond? MR. KOWALEWSKI: The aviation \nindustry is one that I spent a fair amount of time on for personal reasons, having spent time working in the defense \nelectronics industry. Still, as airplanes take off from various airports, I wonder about all of the components and the \ncompanies that I knew that contributed to make that aircraft fly.\n\nNew York doesn't have a Boeing. We don't have a final assembly. What we do have are companies, and I'll say the \nlarger concentration is in the western part of the state and Long Island, but not exclusively there, that work in the \naviation industries. Companies like Moog in Buffalo, billion dollar companies that make large components that go \ninto aircraft, landing gear, wing actuators, and supply to all of the prime contractors and companies like Boeing and \nBombardier and Airbus and those sorts of companies.\n\nThe smattering of companies that do constitute the aviation cluster in New York make subsystems and are tier two \nor tier three suppliers, an important contributor. They typically are tied to airframes and specific programs. When \nBoeing decides to create a new Dreamliner, companies around--aircraft companies 78 around the nation and \ncertainly in New York clamor to be responsive to the needs of Boeing and Airbus.\n\nWe do recognize that the aviation industry has certainly changed. Gone are the days when the entire aircraft that \nBoeing built was produced in Seattle. Many components come from all over the world-- Japan, Italy, China--and \nagain our companies attempt to the best of their ability to compete to keep an innovative edge and to be able to be \nsuppliers to those industries.\n\nAs long as Boeing is making airplanes, as long as Airbus is making airplanes, our companies, and frankly in a very \nfierce fashion, seek those job and do the best they can to be responsive to those new aircraft in designs.\n\nAre we concerned that the Chinese may be looking for key technologies and want to transfer those to China? Let \nme put on a different hat for just a second.\n\nIn addition to my position with the state of New York, I'm a faculty member at the State University of New York \nworking on international business courses, and I take groups of students to China to study Chinese businesses, \nand we visit all kinds of businesses while we're there.\n\nOur observations, and certainly my personal observations, having been in China, are those key technologies, \nfrankly, are there. I don't see many sort of key technologies that we have in New York State that don't have a place \nin China already.\n\n\n\nAnd again, my observation is if there were technologies that we attempted to protect here, European manufacturers \nslide in and provide European machines, European technology, and make those key technologies available \nindirectly.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Mulloy.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nMr. Mayor, thank you for your testimony about what happens to communities when they lose their industrial base. I \nthink you talk about on page eight of your testimony, deindustrialization, disinvestment, deterioration, despair, \ndivorce. A lot of bad things happen.\n\nAnd here's my understanding. What we have to understand is that this happened to China. China had a great \ncivilization, and the West hit them, and they fell apart, and they didn't like it, and they sat down and put a game plan \ntogether.\n\nWe're in a globalization game. They have a game plan and we don't, and you can see, and it's not just China. As \nDr. Shih points out in his testimony, on page five, he says I'm not speaking just of China. Japan, Taiwan, \nSingapore, Korea, they've all exhibited visionary thinking, and they plan for the long term, and we haven't.\n\nAnd the results are becoming increasingly clear. It's been masked because there's a lot of propaganda that goes \non in Washington, and that's why we like to do these field hearings, to find out about the benefits of all this. Well, \nthere's a small group in our society are benefiting pretty well, the shareholders and the Wall Street guys and other \npeople.\n\nBut I think the vast bulk of the people are not doing that way. So if we can 79 set some goals, and that would be \none.\n\nI read a wonderful article by Warren Buffett in Fortune magazine in October 2003. Warren Buffett is concerned \nabout this, and he said in that article by running these massive trade deficits year after year, you're sending dollars \nout which are claims on your economy. We're not sending goods out. We're getting the goods, but we're sending \nthe dollars out which are claims on our economy, and then the foreigners are beginning to buy up our economy.\n\nAnd he said we're undermining and we're outsourcing our economy ownership. We're not moving toward an \nownership society. We're moving toward a sharecropper economy. That's what he said.\n\nNow, then he says why don't we set a goal of balancing our trade? Let's balance our trade. What do you think of \nsetting a goal like that--let's balance our trade in five years? You set the goal, and then you figure out how you have \nto do it. There may be a lot of things you have to do, but if you set the goal, then we could stop just talking. \nPresident Kennedy, he set a goal: get to the moon in so many years. And we found a way.\n\nIf we set some goals, what do you think of that idea? And let me hear from Mayor Johnson, Mr. Bertolone, and then \nMr. Kowalewski.\n\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, Mr. Mulloy, I find what you say absolutely powerful and potent, but I have to reflect on all the \nyears that I've spent trying to achieve just very minor objectives and finding that they kind of dissipate, and I don't \nthink it has anything to do with my skills or my talent. I think it's the environment in which we operate.\n\nNow, this is probably not going to come out right. It's probably not going to sound the way I intend it so I ask you to \nforgive me in the beginning. When you talked about the fact that China got its lunch handed to it and it regrouped \nand it recovered, I think that perhaps the reason it was able to do that was that it didn't have to deal with the \nniceties of democracy. It didn't have to deal with all of the various opinions that people had to deal with, all of the--\nit had a way to impose its will on that society.\n\n\n\nI'm not calling for that in this country, but I think if we don't recognize the fact that we have this kind of \nrepresentative democracy where everybody not only is entitled to think but actually now has an opportunity through \nour media to express their views, think of themselves as being expert as the next person.\n\nIf you watch what's going on in the halls of government--I don't want to dump on it, but I know it very well, and I \nwatch it in its dysfunctionality--it is very hard to achieve any consensus about anything. The political agenda is what \nprevails.\n\nSo how do we transform our own national psyche to get to a point where we recognize that we're in such a state of \ncrisis that we have to change the status quo? There's a book out that I'm reading. It's called \"The Tyranny of Dead \nIdeas: Letting Go of the Old Ways of Thinking to Unleash a new Prosperity.\" There are certain things that we just \nneed to give up on. We just need to say, hey, they don't work anymore; we need to stop embracing them, and we \nneed to find new 80 paradigms.\n\nSo I think that for me at this point in my life, struggling not to be pushed off of the side of the stage but to still try to \nfigure out before I leave this earth how to get some of these problems solved, I think it requires a frontal lobotomy.\n\nWe need to change the way not only we think, but we need to change the way we act.\n\nAnd I'm not seeing that even in the face of this crisis-the New York State Senate, a metaphor for dysfunctionality, \njust went through a whole month of doing absolutely nothing, playing around and determining who was going to get \nthe opportunity to dispense the perks. That's all this was all about. That was what all this fighting was about, not \nabout governance, not about reform. Who's in charge of the kitty bank, and who's going to get a chance to disburse \nit? And the citizens of this state--there was a poll that just came out early this week saying that citizens of this state \nwere just damn angry at their public officials, but the fact of the matter is they don't get a chance to express that \nanger until 14 months from now.\n\nI can almost guarantee you based on past experience that in the next 14 months, that anger will have absolutely \ndissipated and the record of returning incumbents to the New York State legislature will remain intact.\n\nWe got to do something up here. That's what it's going to take, not down here.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Do you have a quick comment? MR. BERTOLONE: Yes. Because this really goes \nbeyond the problem with China, but Commissioner Mulloy, when you talk about planning, it is something that, \ncompared to other countries, that it seems in our states and localities has been absent my entire life.\n\nTo Bill Johnson's credit, and sometimes I think I was the only one who supported it, he ran on metro government. \nYou know in a county of less than 750,000 people, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of taxing authorities. \nWe have 18 different school districts with different standards. We have a federal infrastructure project that has been \non the drawing board for--what--almost a decade on main street in Rochester.\n\nWe have the money from the federal government, and we're going to lose it because we can't get the county \ngovernment and the city government to agree on the final plan even though it's been going on for ten years.\n\nMetro--he talked about urban sprawl, so much of it dictated by the racism of even in the north of the '50s and the \n'60s that has helped destroy our city, put economic pressure on our infrastructure, and raised taxes, and there is \neducation to be done for Americans who don't want to pay taxes but all want their own local governments, their own \nlocal legislatures, their own local school districts.\n\nSo we need planning. I have been having this debate within labor, whether it's trade with China, whether it's labor's \ntop two agenda items, universal health care and Employee Free Choice Act, and that is my debate within labor is \nthat our number one priority should be the public funding of all election campaigns.\n\n81 And I'll be bipartisan here. On the health care thing, we have on the Finance Committee in the Senate, Senator \nChuck Grassley, talking about socialized medicine, who has brought socialized agriculture, billions of dollars to it. \n\n\n\nYou want to talk about subsidies and dumping in Iowa. And on the other hand, we have the Democrat Max Baucus, \nwho according to NBC reports has gotten so many millions of dollars from the for-profit health care industry, that it \ncomes to $1,500 a day for everyday he's been in Congress, and that's over 30 years.\n\nThat's what we have and the shenanigans that Bill talked about in the Senate. We have a building on this campus \nnamed after billionaire Tom Golisano who put millions of dollars into changing the State Senate to Democrats, and \nwhen they passed the budget that raised his taxes, he then promised millions of dollars to two Democrats to switch \nto Republican. I mean does my vote count for anything here or what? And that's what is going on. I have read--and \nI'm not a lawyer so I don't have all the legal nuances down on the Supreme Court decision on free speech and \ncampaign finance.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Buckley versus Valeo. We're going to have to move on to the next witness.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: Well, just let me say my position is bribery is not free speech. In a lot of countries, what's going \non, this would be felonies.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay. Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Blumenthal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes. Thank you all for your testimony, and Mr. Bertolone-- MR. BERTOLONE: \nYes.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: --yes, very compelling. I definitely feel for the people so hard hit by the economic \ndownturn. I wonder, some of these statistics are interesting, given testimony we heard beforehand, and I saw that \nyou got these statistics from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, but how do we know that these jobs were lost to \nChina rather than some of the other factors people brought up, such productivity and technological gains or high \ntaxes or number of other factors? The other question is there are a lot of puzzles here, because on the one hand, \nwe want to be competitive and attract investment, and I would suppose that just take the auto industry, for example, \nthere were some bad management decisions and high health care costs and so forth in the Big Three, but then \nworkers down in Toyota plants in the south or Kia plants are benefiting, I would guess, and like their jobs.\n\nIt's not that we don't have an auto industry; it's that there was also some bad management. But it seems to me we \nwould want to encourage those kinds of investments from foreigners into the country, as well, because they do \ncreate good jobs.\n\nSo I also wonder, and this is for all of you, why is it so hard to attract investment in New York? Is it harder than in \nother states? Is it the tax rates? 82 What is it? Why was it so hard to attract one Taiwanese business into \nRochester, and meanwhile you have some of these other foreign countries thriving in the United States and \ncreating jobs here? So those are two questions. If there's time, Mr. Bertolone, I'd like to hear your comments also \nabout labor abuses in China because that's not just immoral, but also an unfair trade practice, and I would like to \nhear a little more about that as well. But I don't want to go over the time.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: If you'd like for me to start. I think we know that technology has gotten rid of a lot of jobs, but \nmost of the China statistics are from 2001 to 2007. So there is less of--it's easier to measure what advances in \ntechnology eliminated jobs. In my own business in the Postal Service, 80 percent of our mail has been worked by \nphotonics, bar codes, computer bar codes, not by reading addresses. It's all automated.\n\nWe have machines that work 40,000 pieces of mail an hour. We've had those machines so they've been upgraded \nsince the late '70s. So I believe, as measured by whether it's the Alliance for American Manufacturing, the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, the Economic Policy Institute, some of this has been factored out.\n\nPeople have a conception that our auto plants, for example, are blue collar, and some of the most advanced \nmanufacturing technology that you can find today, lasers and robotics and all the rest, are in our auto manufacturing \nplants, and that technology has been in place for years.\n\n\n\nThere are some other issues here. I mentioned universal health care.\n\nAgain, the way Toyota and all the rest, you got to talk about legacy costs, where the health care they provide \nbecause in their home country, they have universal health care, there's a difference of anywhere between 1,100 \nand $1,400 a vehicle.\n\nGeorgia lost an auto plant--Toyota--to Canada because they have universal health care. So, and as Bill Johnson \nmentioned, this has been going on for years where New York lost jobs to the Sun Belt states. Now, in the last ten \nyears, we have seen some of the largest job losses--the Carolinas and Georgia are now in the top ten of job losses \nto China because they went there to get lower costs, and now they're leaving the Sun Belt states to get lower \ncosts in Mexico and China.\n\nSo there are other issues besides that. But I think when it comes to protectionism, most countries buy--what this \nCommission work has done, and they're in the WTO rules about antidumping laws and subsidies, but yet we see \nAmerican businessmen--labor points out the subsidies; we're protectionists.\n\nJoseph Stiglitz, one of New York's Nobel Laureates, has done a good paper on this that, you know, everyone likes \nto bring up Smoot- Hawley. We've had thousands of tariffs. That's the most extreme, and it was sold by the \nbusinessmen, not by labor, in the '20s. But tariffs, fair tariffs, can balance bilaterally trade, and all countries can \nafford to do that.\n\nTwo-thirds of the countries in the world cannot afford to heavily subsidize their industries. China heavily subsidized \nthe steel industry, 28 billion approximately, just energy costs and the steel industry, since 2001. Developing \nnations can't compete with that. They went from number four to number one, and 83 they now produce more steel \nthan the U.S., Japan, and Russia combined, the next three, because of the subsidies.\n\nThe environmental standards. It costs China half of what it costs us for every ton of steel to meet environmental \nstandards because their standards are much lower. You mentioned the lower labor costs.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Labor abuses.\n\nMR. BERTOLONE: Labor abuses. Prior, when global, when this started after NAFTA in the '90s, and Professor Hira \ndid some research on this, the majority of foreign investment from the United States multinationals was going into \ndemocracies or countries we considered on the road to democracy.\n\nSince 2001, that has changed. The majority, overwhelming majority, of American multinational capital investment is \ngoing into totalitarian states.\n\nIf workers are not free, that is--you know, in the second half of the 20th century, the check on corporate power was \nthe labor movement, whether through the legislative side in Social Security and minimum wage and all. As labor's \ndensity and power has declined from the macro/micro economic policies in the last 50 years, there has been no real \ncheck on corporate power.\n\nI do not know of a society in the world, whether it's a country of the left like Castro and Cuba or a dictatorship of the \nright, like Saddam Hussein, or theocracy like Iran, if they don't have a free democratic labor movement, the people \ndo not have freedom.\n\nIf the people do not have freedom, they are not free to improve their conditions, their wages, their safety standards. \nWhy would Chinese workers care about exposing 20 million of our kids to excessive leads when they're working 12 \nhours a day with that lead without safety masks and breathing it in and all the rest? So, you know, these issues.\n\nInvesting in totalitarian regimes, to me, that is what our legislative--the corporation is an amoral being, in business \nto make a profit. It is up to us to regulate it, and again as a history major, I think it was 1932, FDR said that if you \nwant to sustain capitalism, you must restrain it, and he was called a traitor to his class, and he said I welcome their \nhatred. Well, some of our politicians need to welcome the hatred and rein some of the excesses in.\n\n\n\nMR. JOHNSON: May I? HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Yes, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMR. JOHNSON: I want to leave with this one--if you leave here with nothing else, I want you to understand, most \nelected officials, mayors, and legislators, county executives, whatever, don't sit around discussing policy. They are, \nwe are like emergency medical technicians. When a problem hits our desk, we try to figure out the quickest and the \nsurest way of dealing with it.\n\nAnd let me tell you that there's no greater crisis in any of our communities than the loss of jobs. I have the sheet--I \nattached it here--that shows you that this economy lost just 45,000 jobs from 1981 to 2007 from its 15 largest \nemployers.\n\nThat number is much, much greater.\n\nAnd without a job, I can't persuade kids to stay in school to get a good 84 education because they say for what \npurpose? And without a job, I can't get those young men off the street corners who are not only standing there idle \nbut who might, in fact, engage in some kind of criminal behavior. Without a job, it's very hard to keep people in their \nhomes and to keep those neighborhoods stable.\n\nSo, you know, much of Kodak's job decline occurred while I was in office.\n\nI didn't get a call from [former CEOs] George Fisher or Dan Carp to say, oh, by the way, Mr. Mayor, we're about to \neliminate some jobs; what can you do to help us? Well, let me tell you what, if they had called, I'd have been \nbreaking my back trying to figure out how to keep them from reducing those number of jobs.\n\nAnd when it happens, there are companies that have come to me, and they say, Mr. Mayor, we're going to have to \nleave town unless you can figure out a way to keep us here, and we scrambled around, and we put together \npackages. I can take you to places and show you, large and small, where this has happened.\n\nWhat it does is that in the pursuit of that goal, in order to maintain a stable community, we continuously deplete our \nresources. Our tax bases are shrinking automatically, and we are forced to use resources that we literally do not \nhave because we understand doing nothing is not an option.\n\nAnd so going back to Mr. Mulloy's question, it behooves us to find a way, you know, to stop talking about this. It \nbehooves us to find a way to finally get down to the bottom line, you know, and I appreciate, if you take anything out \nof here that you can pass on, President Obama is going to staff up an office, a White House Office on Urban Affairs. \nHe is coming to office committed to being a president who will not ignore cities and metropolitan areas, but who will, \nin fact, try to find a way to help regenerate them.\n\nAnd it's going to take more than five or ten people sitting in a White House office going out having hearings in the \nfield. We have to find a new way of doing business, but the bottom line is this, an d I'm not opposed to Chinese \ninvestment--I don't think anything comes good of it, but I'm telling you if they come here, you know, I wanted to \nmake Macauto to come here, not to occupy vacant space, but to grow, to expand, to create jobs for people who live \nin one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city. That has not happened. They are not paying us back the \ninvestment that we made in them.\n\nSo we got to stop this endless pursuit, this endless chase for the rainbow, the gold pot at the end of the rainbow. \nWe got to find a way to get that gold pot and to make it pay off for our community. I know that sounds like a political \nspeech. I'm not a politician. And I tell you what it sounds like-- HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: You're a professor.\n\nMR. JOHNSON: --a frustrated man, a man who spent 40 years of his life trying to make sea change happen, \nworking with people like Jim Bertolone, trying to see things happen, and it would be tremendously disastrous for me \nif the last conscious thought I have before I leave this earth is that things are no better now than the day that you \nstarted out.\n\n\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Well, hopefully, you won't leave this earth for quite some time, and things will improve \nin the interim.\n\n85 But we have one last question. Commissioner Slane.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Thank you.\n\nMayor, I want to assure you that we have met the enemy, and it is not the Chinese and it is not American \ncompanies; it is us. And my feeling is that unless we have a national industrial policy to deal with these issues, we \nwill continue to lose our high-tech industries, and there is very little that the states or the cities will be able to do to \nstop it.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: On that note, again, I want to thank you, Commissioner Slane. I want to thank \neveryone, the witnesses, for being here.\n\nWe're going to adjourn until one o'clock. Thank you.\n\n[Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the hearing recessed, to reconvene at 1:05 p.m., this same day.] PANEL III: \nGOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH IN NEW \nYORK STATE HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Good afternoon. We will begin our third panel, which is entitled \n\"Government and Institutional Perspectives on Current Opportunities for Growth in New York State.\" I want to thank \neach of the four witnesses. It's a little tight there at the table. I apologize for that, but thank you for participating.\n\nI would remind you, if you could, if you could keep your oral remarks to about seven minutes maximum. We ask a \nlot of questions in this group.\n\nI'd like to introduce our four panelists. The first panelist is Mr. Peter Robinson. He's the Vice President and Chief \nOperating Officer of the University of Rochester Medical Center and Strong Health here in Rochester.\n\nHe assumed his current role as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 1997, if I'm correct.\n\nAlso joining us is Ms. Linda Dickerson Hartsock, who is the Director of the Center for CleanTech Entrepreneurship, \na New York State Energy and Research Development Authority funded initiative-- that's NYSERDA; right--that \nhelps entrepreneurs and early-stage clean tech companies.\n\nWe're also privileged to be joined by Mr. Nicholas Rostow, who is the University Counsel and Vice Chancellor for \nLegal Affairs of the State University of New York, based in Albany, New York.\n\nAs the University Counsel and Vice Chancellor, Mr. Rostow is the legal advisor to SUNY, and before joining the \nuniversity, he served for four years as General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor to the U.S. Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations.\n\nOur fourth panelist is Mr. Paul Vargovich. Mr. Vargovich is President of National Solar Technologies based in \nDepew, New York.\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Vargovich established NST, a division of National Manufacturing and Distribution, a company he \nfounded and still owns. NST started in the renewable energy business as a manufacturer, developer, and integrator \nof 86 solar and wind power systems and commercial solar-powered lighting systems.\n\nDid I get all that right? MR. VARGOVICH: Yes, sir.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay. Great. So why don't we begin with Mr. Robinson.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. PETER ROBINSON VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATION OFFICER, \nUNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER AND STRONG HEALTH, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK MR. \n\n\n\nROBINSON: Well, thank you very much. Commissioners, Chairperson, others, thank you very much for allowing \nus this opportunity to testify.\n\nMy comments will be principally focused on the perspective the University of Rochester has to bring, and I will really \njust refer in passing to my written comments, but I think it's good to begin by focusing a little bit on the fact that the \nupstate region, Rochester being typical of that, has seen fairly significant effects from globalization and the shift of \nthe manufacturing sector from our upstate communities and cities. That's typified here in Rochester by what you \nsee as significant transitions in the size of the high-tech manufacturing base in places like Kodak and Xerox, where \nmore and more of that work has shifted overseas.\n\nAnd in this kind of an environment, we believe research institutions like the University of Rochester have a very \ncritical role to play in terms of helping to shape the region's economic future.\n\nAnd part of that is, of course, that we have a very significant footprint both in terms of employment and spillover \neconomic activity that's driven by the University's activities, but the principal role that the University can play, we \nbelieve, in contributing to the local economy and, therefore, linking it to the areas that you look at, is a driver of the \nknowledge-based commercial sectors that are driven by the cutting-edge research that comes out of institutions like \nthe University of Rochester.\n\nAnd we believe that very strong and meaningful partnerships between institutions like the University of Rochester \nand similar institutions in China can propel local growth and innovation.\n\nThere are a couple reasons for that. Higher education, we believe, is one of the economic pillars of the entire \nregion. The greater Rochester area has 19 colleges and universities. We have more than 90,000 students enrolled \nand grant about 15,000 degrees annually.\n\nThe University itself at slightly under 20,000 full time equivalent employees is the region's largest employer, and in \nfact the fifth largest private sector employer in the state, accounting for aggregate employment of 28,000 people \nwith an impact of about 43,000 jobs, or about 8.7 percent of the labor force in the greater Rochester area.\n\n87 So, in addition to all of that, focusing specifically on university-based research, we believe the potential here for \nthat research to serve as a catalyst for technological innovation, which can be harnessed for local economic \ngrowth, is critically important, but let me just skip a little bit to how those activities can tie to important interactions as \nwe build relationships, particularly with countries such as China, that are also aggressively investing in science and \neducation.\n\nWe believe in the coming years that many of the efforts that we've set in motion to create these kinds of \npartnerships internationally will provide benefits both for our institution and for the local region.\n\nFirst, a few statistics that we think would be helpful. The University has one of the largest concentrations of foreign \nstudents in the country, 16 percent, and we rank 22nd in U.S. universities in the percentage of foreign-born \nstudents.\n\nThe largest number of those students comes from the People's Republic of China, and during the most recent \nacademic year, we had over 500 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Rochester from China, \nwhich is about a quarter of our entire foreign student population. There are an additional 115 from Taiwan, so it's an \neven higher percentage if you incorporate both Chinas.\n\nWe also have a growing number of scientific connections with Chinese institutions. We currently have 144 scholars \nfrom China and Taiwan at the University in categories ranging from full and part-time visiting professors and \ninstructors all the way through to research associates, and some of our faculty members hold appointments at \nChinese institutions, and collaborations are growing. I will cite a few specifically.\n\n\n\nThe University and the Medical Center have been actively building formal partnerships with Chinese institutions and \nrecently signed an agreement with two leading Chinese medical schools: Zhejiang University School of Medicine in \nsoutheast China and Shanghai Jiao- Tong University School of Medicine.\n\nThe partnerships consist of graduate student and faculty exchanges, and those are producing emerging \ncollaborative research programs in the areas of cardiology, microbiology and infectious diseases, and biomedical \ngenetics.\n\nIn addition, we are working on a third partnership with Fudan University in Shanghai which we believe is one of the \ntop two or three medical schools in the country. We expect that these partnerships are going to grow and evolve \ninto meaningful scientific exchanges in the coming years.\n\nThe benefits of those relationships for Rochester specifically are they do expose our faculty to international funding \nopportunities because the Chinese government itself has actually begun to expend more in terms of research \nfunding.\n\nThe data that we generate from these collaborations is used to enhance research projects and leverage funding at \nhome, and it also provides access to populations that will enable us to more effectively and rapidly move our \nbiomedical research programs into clinical settings for clinical trials and further development.\n\nI'd like to also point to a couple of companies that are specifically spinning out of university technologies that have \ndirect links to China. Koning, Inc., which 88 was created in 2002, is a medical imaging technology company. It has \ndeveloped Cone Beam Computed Tomography, a new way of applying CT technologies to breast imaging. And that \ntechnology is moving through the FDA process and is pending approval.\n\nThe company's founders are linked to Chinese investors, and part of that investment strategy is going to include the \ndeployment of these technologies into clinical settings in China.\n\nThe interesting thing about the evolution of medical screening and breast screening in China is that they've actually \nlagged significantly in terms of the opportunities for breast cancer screening in the Chinese population. So the \nintroduction of the kind of baseline mammography technology that exists here isn't broadly distributed in China.\n\nSo the effect here will be, we hope, that this technology will, in fact, jump over the current technology and be \nintroduced as the first baseline for widespread use of breast cancer screening in China.\n\nAnother technology also developed at the University which precisely monitors data from electrocardiograms to \ndetermine if an individual is at risk for adverse cardiac events is also being developed into a technology for personal \ncardiac safety devices, and there is similarly Chinese investment in that and plans for commercial deployment in \nChina, as well.\n\nThe one issue that I do want to get to during questions and answers is the issue of H-1 visas and the restrictions \nthat that is placing on the ability to effectively promote the exchanges that we have established.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. Peter Robinson Vice President and Chief Operation Officer, \nUniversity of Rochester Medical Center and Strong Health, Rochester, New York Chairwomen Bartholomew, \nmembers of the commission: Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to submit testimony on behalf of the \nUniversity of Rochester. I would also like to thank you for calling this hearing on this important topic.\n\nRochester, like its sister cities in Upstate New York, and many other areas of the country, are feeling the growing \neffects of globalization. Direct competition for jobs with low-wage workers, coupled with increased investment by \nforeign competitors, advances in modern communication and other technologies, has lead to a fundamental shift in \nmanufacturing jobs to other areas of the country and overseas. What was once a significant building block of our \narea economy is now leading to layoffs and general economic decline as Rochester companies, like Kodak and \nXerox, continue to shed jobs.\n\n\n\nIn this environment, research institutions such as the University of Rochester have a critical role to play in terms of \nhelping shape the region's economic future. The University of Rochester has a significant and growing \"footprint\" in \nterms of employment and spillover economic activity. But perhaps the most important economic function that the \nUniversity can serve is to fuel growth in knowledge based commercial sectors through cutting edge research. And \nwe believe that strong and meaningful partnerships with institutions in places such as China will propel growth and \ninnovation.\n\n89 Higher education is one of the economic pillars of the region which is home to 19 colleges and universities.\n\nCollectively, these institutions enroll more than 90,000 students and grant more than 15,000 degrees annually.\n\nWith19,441 FTE employees, the University of Rochester is the region's largest employer and the 5th largest private \nsector employer in the state. According to a report by the Center for Governmental Research in 2008, the University \nof Rochester generates aggregate employment for an estimated 28,000 to 43,000 people (8.7% of the labor force in \nthe Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area).\n\nIn addition to this direct economic impact, university-based research holds the potential to serve as a catalyst for \ntechnological innovation which can be harnessed for local commercial growth. Over the last 5 years, the University \nhas received more than $1.8 billion in research funding and is home to many leading research programs in the \nfields of engineering, optics, medicine, and alternative energy. These resources, combined with talented scientific \nfaculty and state- of-the-art facilities, have led to a significant growth in new discoveries and the University's \nintellectual property portfolio. We also serve as an important research and development partner for many local \ncompanies, such as Kodak, Bausch and Lomb, and Carestream.\n\nWe believe that a critical contributor to future research growth will be the relationships that we build with institutions, \nparticularly in countries such as China that are aggressively investing in science and education. In the coming \nyears, we anticipate many of the efforts that we have recently set in motion to flourish and have significant benefits \nfor the University and the region.\n\nThe University of Rochester has one of the largest concentrations (16%) of foreign students in the nation - in 2007, \nthe University ranked 22nd among U.S. universities in the percentage of foreign born students. The largest number \nof foreign students is from the People's Republic of China. During the 2008-2009 academic year, there were 505 \nundergrad and graduate students at the University of Rochester from China - more than a quarter of our entire \nforeign student population. The University also had an additional 115 students from Taiwan. Most of these students \nare concentrated in the fields of engineering, medicine, and business administration.\n\nThe University also has substantial and growing scientific connections with Chinese institutions. Currently, there are \n144 \"scholars\" from China and Taiwan at the University of Rochester, a category which includes full/parttime/ \nvisiting professors and instructors, post-doctoral fellows, and research assistants/associates, and technical \nassociates. Some of our faculty members also hold appointments at Chinese institutions and collaboration between \nRochester faculty and their Chinese counterparts are growing as witnessed by joint scientific publications, \ncollaboration on individual research projects, and inter-institutional scholarly visits.\n\nThe University of Rochester Medical Center has also been actively building formal partnerships with Chinese \ninstitutions and has recently signed an agreement with two leading Chinese medical schools - Zhejiang University \nSchool of Medicine (southeast China) and Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine. These partnerships \nconsist of graduate student and faculty exchanges and emerging collaborative research programs in the areas of \ncardiology, microbiology/infectious disease, and biomedical genetics. The Medical Center is exploring additional \npartnerships, including one with Fudan University in Shanghai, home to one of the top medical schools in China.\n\nWe anticipate that these partnerships will grow and evolve into meaningful scientific collaborations in the coming \nyears and expand into other areas of medicine.\n\n\n\nThese partnerships have significant benefits for Rochester. They expose our researchers to international funding \nopportunities; the Chinese government has significantly expanded research funding over the last several years. In \nmany instances, data from these collaborations can then be used to enhance research projects and leverage \nfunding at home. It also gives our scientists access to large and diverse populations for clinical research, this is \nparticularly important when studying rare and emerging diseases. And finally, China has a large population of highly \ntrained researchers who can help fill out University labs.\n\nMany of the technologies that emerge from our labs serve as the foundation for new business ventures that remain \nin 90 Rochester and contribute to the growing number of high tech companies.\n\nThere are more than 35 companies in the region that are based on University of Rochester technologies and, in \nsome instances, Chinese markets and resources hold the key for their future growth.\n\nKoning, Inc. was created in 2002 to commercialize a new medical imaging technology developed at the University - \ncalled Cone Beam Computed Tomography - for breast cancer screening. The technology is pending approval by \nthe FDA. The company's founders are in discussions with Chinese investors, have scouted out potential \nmanufacturing facilities in China, and have entered discussions with the Chinese health officials about using the \ntechnology in Chinese clinics once it has been approved - a potentially vast market for this technology.\n\nAnother University of Rochester start-up company, iCardiac Technologies, is developing technologies that can \nprecisely monitor data from electrocardiograms to determine whether an individual is at risk for an adverse cardiac \nevent such as a heart attack. The company is in discussions with a number of potential Chinese partners regarding \nthe manufacture of personal cardiac safety devices.\n\nThe University of Rochester has many other interactions with Chinese institutions and the Chinese people on a \nscientific and cultural level. For example, our faculty members have participated in efforts organized by the National \nScience Foundation to strengthen scientific ties between our two countries and the University of Rochester's \nEastman School of Music recently concluded a 12-day tour of four Chinese conservatories that included concerts, \nlectures given by Eastman faculty, and informal meetings between Eastman and Chinese students..\n\nOne of the potential barriers to the continued growth in our interaction with foreign institutions and students that \nmust urgently be addressed is U.S. immigration policies. U.S. colleges and universities use the H1-B visa to recruit \nexceptional researchers, faculty, scholars, and other talented personnel from around the world.\n\nThe program grants only 65,000 visas per year - the same amount provided when it was first established in 1990, \nplus an additional 20,000 visas for those holding an advanced degree from a U.S. university. This is an arbitrary \nlimit that does not reflect the reality of today's global economic environment and increasingly works against our \nnation's competitiveness. It is common that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will announce \nthat they will meet their allotment of H-1B visas on the very first day applications were accepted - clearly \ndemonstrating the great demand for this program. Allowing foreign competitors to benefit from the best minds the \nworld has to offer - many of whom have been educated right here in the United States -- threatens America's \ninnovation leadership and competitiveness.\n\nWhen Congress and the Administration consider immigration reform, we should identify ways to strengthen U.S. \nhigher education and our global leadership by encouraging more international students and scholars to come to \nstudy and work here. This includes, where appropriate, providing them with a clear path to employment and \npermanent residency.\n\nIn addition, greater promotion of international academic and cultural exchanges will also facilitate international \nstudents and scholars better understanding the U.S. and its citizens. These exchanges would lead to long-term, \nsustainable relationships and collaborations that can lead to new knowledge, economic development and greater \nsecurity.\n\n\n\nAgain, thank you for allowing me this opportunity to submit my testimony for the record and thank you for your \nefforts to help us understand and adapt to the economic changes brought about by globalization and trade with \nChina.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.\n\nMs. Hartsock.\n\n91 OPENING STATEMENT OF MS. LINDA DICKERSON HARTSOCK DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR CLEAN TECH \nENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE TECH GARDEN, SYRACUSE, NEW YORK MS. HARTSOCK: Thank you and \nwelcome to upstate New York, and thank you for extending the invitation to me to be part of this hearing.\n\nAs Commissioner Shea mentioned, I am the Director of the Center for CleanTech Entrepreneurship, but I'm also \nhere today representing the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems who is our \nstrategic partner.\n\nThe Center for CleanTech Entrepreneurship is actually a new initiative supported by NYSERDA. It's located at the \nTechnology Garden in Syracuse, New York. We are focused statewide on developing emerging businesses and \ncommercializing technologies in sectors of renewable and clean energy, alternative fuels, grid and system \nintegration, clean transportation and energy efficient construction technologies.\n\nThe CleanTech Center offers support for entrepreneurs and early stage companies through incubation, \nacceleration, and retention. Our collaborators include angel and venture investors, financial institutions, and other \nlenders, leading New York State colleges and universities, service providers, utilities, industry associations, \neconomic development organizations, and government agencies who work with us to provide technical and \nfinancial assistance to foster this clean tech business development.\n\nAnd, in addition, we connect clean tech companies with national, state and global resource providers for the \nacceleration of staged growth.\n\nThe Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems uses a collaboration to demonstrate new \ntechnologies, commercialize innovations, create jobs, and improve human health and productivity, security and \nsustainability in urban and built environments.\n\nThe CoE works in three core areas: indoor air quality; clean and renewable energy; and water resources, helping \nfoster innovation through research, demonstration, and commercialization.\n\nCoE has played a critical role growing the reputation of upstate New York as an incubator for green technologies. In \nrecognition of the CoE's work at the global scale, the CoE is the host location for the International Healthy Buildings \n2009 Conference that will be in upstate in September, an event that's only held once every three years--has \npreviously been in Stockholm, Budapest, Milan, Helsinki, and most recently Singapore.\n\nThere's a large contingent of academic researchers and companies coming from China who will be engaged in this \nvenue to showcase New York State R&D and innovation to these global leaders in the field of indoor air quality and \nhealthy built environments, and we see it as an opportunity for exchange at the academicto- business level and the \nbusiness-to-business level with the delegation, not just 92 from China, but the 1,500 or so people we're expecting \nfrom around the world.\n\nThe event will also coincide with the completion of the Syracuse CoE Headquarters, which is a world-class research \nbuilding where innovations will be deployed and demonstrated by international teams of academic researchers and \nindustry partners, and which is a test bed itself for innovation in environmental and energy systems. It's a 55,000 \nsquare foot LEED Platinum building with lab and office space for joint international research in some of these areas \nof innovation.\n\n\n\nThere are more than 300 formal collaborators that are part of both the Syracuse Center of Excellence and the \nClean Tech Center Alliance, and through those partnerships, we're uniquely positioned at the nexus of innovation \nstemming from leading research universities from around the world, small businesses, venture investment deal \nflow, and corporate innovation from across New York State, the northeast and the nation.\n\nSo if there's a message we want you to take away it is that while we're focusing on dangers, we also want to focus \non opportunity, and to leave you with the message that upstate New York is a region that is ripe with innovation. \nRight now there's about $2 billion in annual R&D activity underway at research institutions in central upstate. The \nregion that I am from has the highest concentration of undergraduate and graduate students in the nation: 138,000 \nstudents. And equally important, it's a region that's truly a national model for collaboration.\n\nAcross upstate, when we focus on opportunities for growth, I think we're all on the same page when it comes to \nsectors that hold promise across the broad clean tech sector.\n\nClean tech, as we know, is a major driver in our national economic transformation plan, with opportunities for \ninvestments to retrofit buildings, construct smart energy grids, develop new technologies for energy storage, and \nexpand production of wind, solar and advanced biofuels. Much of this research is being done collaboratively at \nupstate institutions with international partners.\n\nJust to give you a few examples: work that's going on in advanced microelectronics and flexible solar technologies \nat Binghamton University; work in wind energy and advanced materials at Clarkson; work in sensor and advanced \ncomputer applications and software engineering with applications for the Smart Grid at Syracuse University; work in \nfuel cells and battery technology at Cornell University, which was recently selected as one of our new national DoD \nEnergy Frontier Research Centers; work in advanced biomass and alternative energy feedstocks being done \nacross the SUNY system but particularly by SUNY ESF, a recognized global leader in this area; and work in \nadvanced biofuels at Morrisville State College, another SUNY institution, which is working with China in areas \nrelated to liquid biofuels, particularly advanced research in new areas such as algae.\n\nSo the list could go on, but I want to convey to you the message that Upstate New York can truly play a role in the \ndevelopment of the new energy economy-- a sector that has the potential for both economic and security 93 \nimplications, and this message should provide a window of optimism for what is ahead.\n\nBut that is only if there is a true public policy infrastructure plan that provides regulatory policy and incentives to \nreally jumpstart at a large national scale the kind of innovation and effort that put a man on the moon 40 years ago \nthis week.\n\nGiven our R&D legacy and our unique asset base, Upstate New York can become a test bed with international \npartners for developing, validating and commercializing technologies that can help the energy industry make the \ntransformation that is needed to save energy, reduce costs, increase reliability, and enhance transparency, which \nis ultimate economic security.\n\nSo, thank you, and we look forward to working with you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: I'm very impressed. You just finished right at the seven minute point.\n\n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Rostow.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. NICHOLAS ROSTOW UNIVERSITY COUNSEL AND VICE CHANCELLOR FOR \nLEGAL AFFAIRS, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, ALBANY, NEW YORK MR. ROSTOW: Thank you.\n\nI'm honored to appear before the Commission on behalf of the State University of New York. The U.S.-China \nrelationship is of importance to all Americans. It has many facets and dimensions. Interdependence is one \nimportant reality. It has not always meant smooth sailing however.\n\n\n\nMy remarks reflect the perspective of a large system of public higher education, a system that is intimately \nconnected with the present and future wellbeing of New York State, and whose ambitions on behalf of all New \nYorkers recognize the realities of globalization and seek to take advantage of them.\n\nI will begin with a few general points about education and economic and social well-being in this country and then \nsummarize the SUNY relationships with China and where they might lead in the future.\n\nIn the discussion period, I should be happy to address such issues as changes in the visa system and other \nmeasures taken since after 9/11.\n\nFirst, it ought to be axiomatic that among the few essential functions of government, including the federal \ngovernment, none is more important--there may be some that are equally important--than support for education at \nall levels. An educated citizenry has been the backbone of American democracy and society for more than 200 \nyears. One can only imagine what this country would look like without one. And public education has been at the \ncore of that backbone.\n\nA few New York statistics give an idea of one aspect of the impact of public higher education. The SUNY College at \nNew Paltz is the third-largest 94 employer in Ulster County after the school district and the county government itself.\n\nThe University of Buffalo is the second-largest employer in western New York after the federal government. Its \neconomic impact is measured in billions of dollars and will only grow in the future.\n\nAggregating SUNY's multiple western campuses makes the State University the largest employer in western New \nYork and probably in central New York as well.\n\nSecond, American prosperity since World War II has owed much-- many multiples of the investment itself--to the \nfederal government's investment research at American universities and the national laboratories.\n\nThese investments enabled the United States to sustain economic leadership long after the rest of the world had \nrecovered from World War II, and without such investment, the United States would be a poorer and weaker place \nin every sense of these words.\n\nEvery region of the country wants its own Silicon Valley or Route 128-- visible economic benefits of investment in \neducation and research. SUNY centers of excellence such as its nanotechnology center in Albany have involved \npartnerships between industry and university researchers with positive results in terms of employment and \ninnovation. The model is replicated throughout SUNY through incubators and other educational-industry \npartnerships, particularly in life sciences and bioengineering.\n\nFinancing for start-ups is the hardest form of financing to find. The present economic situation obviously does not \nhelp.\n\nThird, the evolution of the global economy has made the U.S. economy an intellectual industrial complex by force of \nnecessity. To sustain it requires investment in education. Investment is not simply a question of money although \nmoney certainly is important. It also means investing in people: reaching out and drawing into the educational \nsystems and opportunities those people who feel excluded or once included become turned off.\n\nIn short, the country cuts its nose off to spite its face if it doesn't invest in education and research.\n\nLet me turn now to SUNY's China relationship. It has a number of dimensions. It developed from the ground up, \nspawned by campuses such as the University of Buffalo, which launched its partnerships with individual Chinese \nuniversities in 1980. Today, 15 SUNY campuses have exchange and other programs with individual Chinese \ninstitutions of higher learning.\n\n\n\nThe SUNY System relationship with China is of newer vintage. China sees SUNY as a whole and a large whole at \nthat. It is up to the State University to take advantage of that fact for the benefit of students and faculty at 64 \ncampuses by establishing and maintaining relationships with the central government.\n\nThe most recent SUNY initiative with China has led to broad and deep relations with the Chinese government in \nsupport of educational collaboration. In response to the massive earthquake in Sichuan, in May 2008, SUNY's \ntrustees 95 offered to help 150 affected Chinese college students continue their studies at SUNY for a year.\n\nEducation is what we do, and we thought it was a real way we could help these young people whose lives had been \nturned upside down. We could help them not to lose a year and give them skills they could use in the recovery effort \nwhen they returned home. The SUNY-China 150 initiative, as it became known, enjoyed the support of the highest \nlevels of the Chinese and American governments and provincial and state and local governments here. Without that \nsupport, the initiative could not have been a success.\n\nThe 150 students arrived in New York in mid-August 2008 and returned to China at the end of May 2009. They \nwere housed at 22 SUNY campuses from Buffalo to Stony Brook, from Plattsburg to Alfred.\n\nThey majored in different fields--a lot in science and business. They all learned leadership skills.\n\nThey lived, studied and played among students from all over New York and from many other countries, and they \nmade memorable contributions to their campuses and campus communities, introducing teachers, staff, friends and \nstudents to a new culture and a new way of viewing the world.\n\nThey also absorbed a lot about New York and America, and, of course, they had a front row seat as Americans \npicked a new president and made history doing so. They visibly grew in ways no one could have predicted. Shy and \nscared when they arrived, they departed confident young adults.\n\nThe benefits to the students were made clear to all who met them. They also enriched SUNY. All campuses \nreported that this initiative challenged their international programs to step up in new and unforeseen ways and that \nthey all met the tests. All campuses reported that the students and faculty and community learned from their \nChinese guests and came away from the experience with a new appreciation of the diverse world we inhabit, and \nall reported that our regular students developed and grew as a result of interacting with the Chinese students.\n\nSUNY takes from that experience and from the many exchange programs with individual Chinese universities our \ncampuses have developed over many years, as it has from being open to students from all over the world. Buffalo \nalone has students from 138 countries. Internationalizing our education system is a good thing. Not only does it \nflow logically from New York's own diversity and history as a gateway to America, but also it so visibly enriches the \nquality of the education we provide and the research we do.\n\nThe Chinese government has made available ten scholarships a year for three years to SUNY students to study in \nChina and has offered a study tour during next year's semester break to 200 SUNY students.\n\nSUNY believes that there is only upside to internationalizing education with China and the world and that it can \nonly enrich us as a society.\n\nThank you.\n\n[The statement follows:] 96 Prepared Statement of Mr. Nicholas Rostow University Counsel and Vice Chancellor for \nLegal Affairs, State University of New York, Albany, New York I am honored to appear before the Commission on \nbehalf of the State University of New York.\n\nThe U.S.-China relationship is of importance to all Americans.

Without that support, \nthe initiative could not have been a success.\n\nThe 150 students arrived in New York in mid-August 2008 and returned to China at the end of May 2009. They \nwere housed at 22 SUNY campuses, from Buffalo to Stony Brook, from Plattsburgh to Alfred. They majored in \ndifferent fields - a lot in science and business. They all learned leadership skills. They lived, studied, and played \namong students from all over New York and from many other countries. And they made memorable contributions to \ntheir campuses and campus communities, introducing teachers, staff, friends, and students to a new culture and a \nnew way of viewing the world. They also absorbed a lot about New York and America. And of course they had a \nfront row seat as Americans picked a new President and made history. And they visibly grew in ways no one could \nhave predicted. Shy and scared when they arrived, they departed confident young adults.\n\nThe benefits to the students were made clear to all who met them. They also enriched SUNY. All campuses \nreported that this initiative challenged their international programs to step up in new and unforeseen ways and that \nthey all met the tests. All campuses reported that their students and faculty and community learned from their \nChinese guests and came away from the experience with a new appreciation of the diverse world we inhabit. And \nall reported that our regular students developed and grew as a result of interacting with the Chinese students.\n\nSUNY takes from that experience and from the many exchange programs with individual Chinese universities our \ncampuses have developed over many years, as it has from being open to students from all over the world - Buffalo \nalone has students from 138 countries - that internationalizing our education system is a Good Thing. Not only \ndoes it flow logically from New York's own diversity and history as a gateway to America, but also it so visibly \nenriches the quality of the education we provide. And the research we do. The Chinese Government has made \navailable 10 scholarships a year for three years to SUNY students to study in China and has offered a study tour \nduring next year's semester break to 200 SUNY students.\n\nSUNY believes that there is only upside to internationalizing education, with China and with the world. It can only \nenrich us as a society.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you very much, Mr. Rostow.\n\nMr. Vargovich.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. PAUL VARGOVICH PRESIDENT, NATIONAL SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES, \nDEPEW, NEW YORK 98 MR. VARGOVICH: Good afternoon and thank you for asking me to testify.\n\nI just want to say I'm not an expert on U.S.-Chinese relations. I don't have a list of statistics to throw at you. All I \nhave is over 25 years as a small businessman in manufacturing.\n\nOver the course of time, I've run across different venues where I had to make the decision dollarwise/timewise on \nwhat we were going to do, and what I did do is invest into technology that I purchased from Ontario Hydro \nTechnologies in the solar and wind business. And in looking at that and the way that I am associated with \nmanufacturing, I've always liked to be self-supportive. So when we looked at the costing of what we're building, \none of the biggest costs were solar panels.\n\nSo I looked at manufacturing our own line of solar panels. We started out looking at the equipment costing to go \nmanual all the way up to full automatic.\n\nWe evaluated all of those numbers on the equipment, and then justified them.\n\nAnd now we looked at your supplies. When I looked at the supplies, my supplies were coming in the main course \nfrom China. So now when I started putting my costing together, and trying to say, well, where am I going to buy--I \n\n\n\ncan't buy it in the U.S. I have to go to China for it. So then the costing that I had there, based on the fact that they \ncontrol that market, I decided I didn't want to do it.\n\nThe profit margin was at a point where you had to go fairly large to do it, and with a minimal amount of what you \nmight call rug-tugging under your feet, they could knock you out of business with it. So I decided not to do that.\n\nThat was a business development that didn't happen right from the get-go.\n\nIt wasn't something that went away. It was something that didn't happen because I looked at some of the realities of \nit.\n\nWhen you get into--I'm going to get a little bit more into it in a little bit-- but the funding that I see, I built my business \nall the way through this without funding from the government. Funding came out of my pocket. Loans and whatever \nI could. I tried to get funding, but when I did, I found there were different avenues that people take to accomplish \nthat. A lot of it was if you knew somebody, and in talking with NYSERDA, they will say oh, no, it can't be that way. \nWell, I've proven it is.\n\nI did use some pull that I had at one time, and I did get a NYSERDA grant for improving some of the electronics that \nwe were building. It was $250,000 grant. I took it, started looking at what I had to do to accomplish the end-product, \nand the costing that I came up with versus what was available basically from China, I couldn't compete.\n\nSo I took that money that I had received in the grant and gave it back.\n\nBecause as a small businessman, I'm not in the research and development business; I'm in the production \nbusiness. Colleges, universities, and R&D companies want that. They have to have that research and development \nmoney because that's how they survive. I survive in my business by producing, and if I can't produce a product at a \ncost that I can make a profit, I'm out of business.\n\n99 And I'm a small guy. I'm not making hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWe're talking under $10 million. So everything that we do, I have to look at, do the numbers and make a decision on \nit.\n\nOkay. A lot of the funding that I see in the proposals sent to me, is for research and development. I see very little if \nany for the end product. In talking to NYSERDA on one of my endeavors, I asked-why they had 1.5 percent residual \nthat you had to pay them back after you started production and sales on your product? Where do you come up with \n1.5 percent? And they told me that's their return on investment.\n\nSo, to me, that's saying all the millions of dollars, and you have your NYSERDAs, you have your federal \ngovernment, that are putting money into research and development; what is the return on the investment? Is it \ngoing just to more research and development? And where is the product going? Is it going to China or is it just \nlaying dormant? And an experience that I had is that most of the time it remains dormant. It gets to a point where \nthere's a product that could go to market, but that's where it ends.\n\nResearch and development ends when you have the product, and then from there, it has to go to somebody like in \nmy business to produce it. So if I'm going to produce it, now I have to market it, and in order to market it, it costs \nmore to market that product than it did to do the research and development.\n\nSo why not take, instead of putting everything into research and development, why not take that and put it into--\nsome of it--into the production and marketing of the end products that are coming out of this research and \ndevelopment? And to go back, that's how I ended up with the solar products from Ontario Hydro Technologies. I \npaid nowhere near what they had invested in it. Nowhere near. So I picked it up for pennies on the dollar because \nthey weren't going to be able to do anything with it. And then I took it and have been making a profit with it.\n\n\n\nWhen you look at the R&D, I also looked at, when we had this grant, one of the things I looked at was where the \ncomponents were coming from. They were coming from China. You cannot buy it here in the United States--\nelectronic components. It's basically made in China, so when you start looking at what you have to do, you have a \ncompetitor in China. I have a competitor in China that I have to buy my supplies from. I don't have any choice. And \nthen they basically control my market through--they're my vendor, my supplier for those parts.\n\nSo let's see what I have. You talk about regarding the New York State taxation. You know, no matter where you go, \nthere's taxes. You're not going to get away from--you're not going to have a free situation with taxes, but I've been \napproached by several other states. At least four times a year, I get a very serious conversation with other states \nthat are offering me incentives to come to Virginia, come to Michigan, because of the renewable energy business \nthat I have.\n\nAnd I look at that, and just over the telephone or a couple of letters, the 100 incentives that they're offering me are \nvery \"enticive.\" You know, it's just that rate. At this point, you may ask, why don't you move? And when I look at it, I \nhave roots here. I have my family, and I have business associates that I'm not ready to leave. If I was 35 years old \nand I had this business, like my son who is going to eventually take it over, you might see something.\n\nSo my answer to that is if you're offering incentives to new companies to move into upstate New York, why not work \nwith the companies that are already here and give them, offer them the same incentives? What I look at is with a \nmanufacturing facility, whether it's a large one or a small one, they want to see a building. It's a cash cow for the \nlocal governments and county governments for taxation.\n\nIt's not jobs. Jobs are the secondary issue with them.\n\nIf you look at IDAs and all the deals that they've made with different companies in keeping the amount of \nemployment to a certain level, it is hardly ever is reached. The counties and the states complain about the IDAs \nbecause they're given tax breaks, but it's in the long-term, and they're expecting the counties and the states will \nhave that cash cow coming in. And it's ruined a lot of businesses because--especially big business--you take, in \nBuffalo, New York, they had Bethlehem Steel plant there. That plant paid more in taxes than all the other \nBethlehem Steel facilities in the country because it was a cash cow for the city.\n\nIt just drives business down. So what I say is why not support the businesses that are here? When you get into the \nresearch and development, work with the companies that are here. If you take renewable energy, there are \nprobably just a handful of manufacturers in New York State that actually manufacture, that are manufacturing a \nproduct.\n\nWhy not take those companies, put them all together, and let them meet.\n\nThere is no such thing as competition. Everybody has their own specialties. Have them meet. Put some money into \nmarketing for those companies and just market it to the government, to start. The federal government--we do a lot \nof work with the military. We built streetlights, and we put them in Baghdad and all over the country, and the world, \nbut there's other things that we don't do.\n\nThe most expensive thing is trying to get the market, trying to go out and market my business to a larger scale.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. Paul Vargovich President, National Solar Technologies, Depew, \nNew York Just to provide some additional background I am a small manufacturing business owner in Buffalo, NY. I \nhave built my business from a two car garage in 1980 to a facility that is 34,000 square feet employing 20 \npersonnel. I own two companies, National Manufacturing & Distribution, Inc. (NM&D) which designs, develops, and \nmanufactures electrical and electronic components and serves the electrical utility and large industries. National \nSolar Technologies (NST) is a renewable energy business, which manufactures, develops, integrates solar and \nwind power systems and commercial solar powered lighting systems with customers around the world.\n\n\n\n101 I do not claim to be an expert in U.S. - China relations, but I do have over 25 years experience in the \nmanufacturing industry. Only recently have I been involved with importation of products from China to integrate into \nour solar product line. This was due to the fact that the availability of U.S. made similar products were either not \navailable or not as competitive.\n\nFunding provided by the State is focused on Research & Development (R&D) and is useful to R&D companies, \ncolleges and universities. The perfect end result of an R&D project is a completed product. My experience as a \nsmall business is the high cost of developing a product for the market place. We have been involved in enhancing \nthe R&D of Ontario Hydro Technologies (OHT) solar products from the acquisition of their technology, which \ncreated National Solar Technologies. OHT spent millions of dollars developing this product, and we spent an \nadditional million to enhance the existing capability. It is not just the expertise and expense required to develop a \ntechnology. Once the product is created the more time consuming and expensive step is marketing your finished \nproduct.\n\nNST was the recipient of a State Grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency \n(NYSERDA) to develop an inverter control allowing for a larger power output utilizing solar panels. After researching \nthe cost associated with designing, producing, and marketing this product we could not compete with a less \nexpensive, similar capability produced by China. After this realization I declined the NYSERDA grant. In my opinion \nI would recommend government funding be focused on not only R&D activities but also helping to market the final \nproduct. The inability to compete with Chinese manufacturing will hinder New York State (NYS) competitiveness in \ndeveloping and manufacturing finished R&D products in the United States versus China. Many of the required R&D \ncomponents are only manufactured in China, from electronics to machinery. This is like a competitor supplying you \nwith essential parts. This provides the Chinese with control of the marketplace and cost of equipment. As a small \nbusiness I cannot afford to invest in projects that could eventually be terminated or unaffordable due to competitor \ncontrol. I would recommend that if a NYS company wishes to develop a capability with China, NYS government \nshould not fund this endeavor.\n\nRegarding NYS taxation, I have been contacted by State agencies, outside of New York, and offered lucrative \nincentives to relocate my business. I have chosen to stay in this region due to family ties and business associations.\n\nI would recommend that the incentives to entice other companies to come to NYS, including tax breaks, should \napply to existing businesses especially during the current economic decline. Lower taxes and streamlining \nregulation will make NYS a more hospitable place to do business.\n\nIn summary, I believe that NYS government has the ability to make a difference by helping to create jobs in the \nregion by supporting small businesses through additional tax breaks, funding R&D projects with companies \nplanning on manufacturing the product in the US, as well as aiding in marketing the final designed and developed \ntechnology. These efforts will aid in increasing New York State's competitiveness in myriad industries.\n\nPanel III: Discussion, Questions and Answers HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you very much, Mr. Vargovich. \nWe appreciate the comments and the participation of all the witnesses.\n\nI guess I'll start with the first question. It's my understanding that the Obama administration, through the stimulus \npackage, has clearly made the development of clean technology a national priority. Do we agree on that? The \nChinese have an enormous environmental problem. They are making, I think it's fair to say, a concerted effort to \nclean up their environment with a focus on developing their own indigenous renewable energy industry; is that fair \nto say? It's also my understanding that the New York State government has made 102 creating a clean energy \nsector in this region of New York State a priority; is that fair to say? How is it going? I mean is this going to happen? \nWhat are the challenges to getting that done? How does Rochester, this area, Syracuse, this area, become a global \nleader in clean tech? How do we get there? Are we anywhere near that? MR. ROBINSON: Well, I think we have a \nlittle bit of a concern regarding the directions the Department of Energy is taking in the sectors that they're selecting \nfor support and those that they're deselecting. The greater Rochester area, for example, has had significant \ninvestments both in fuel cell technology and in the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel.\n\n\n\nAnd in both of those instances, it does appear as though the policies in the Department of Energy are \ndeemphasizing that, at least as we see it outlined in the budget proposals that are coming out of the administration. \nAnd so places like the General Motors Fuel Cell Development Center here in the greater Rochester area have \nstarted to shed a few jobs, and we have a concern that more might be on the way out if that kind of funding support \nis--if those indications actually turn out to be reality.\n\nI don't know if you want to add to that.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: I'd be glad to jump in. First of all, I think New York has received a very generous share of the \nstimulus package, particularly in areas related to weatherization, and the expectation is that this will jumpstart and \nreally lift the labor market when it comes to jobs in installation, energy management, construction.\n\nI think our concern is, again, we want to see on the national level a fullscale commitment to the development of a \ntrue innovation economy so that we're not just creating jobs at that one end of the spectrum, but we see a \ncontinuum, and so that we have the ability to capitalize on the research coming out of these institutions who are \ntruly working collaboratively.\n\nThe reason that Cornell was able to capture a National Energy Frontier Center DoE grant was that it put together a \nconsortium that involved RPI, Cornell, as well as industry partners. So I think there's a tremendous potential.\n\nNew York State has a very ambitious goal of \"45 by 15,\" -- deriving 45 percent of its energy through a combination \nof renewable resources and conservation measures by the year 2015. Again, to achieve this, clearly there's more \nthat has to be done by way of regulatory and policy reform.\n\nIf you look at why countries like Spain and Germany are so much further ahead of us, it has to do with tariff \nstructure and things that I think we're still debating-- MR. ROSTOW: Nuclear power.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: Exactly. And the Chinese government-- if we look at them as a model for government innovation, \nwhat they're doing to build energy research parks, what they're doing to develop national smart grid systems, are, I \nthink, lessons that we could take a page from here, both in New York State and nationally. So I think the more we \ninteract, listen, learn, and adopt best practices 103 both ways, I think the better for all parties.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Vargovich, did you want to add something? MR. VARGOVICH: Well, just one \nquestion-- HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: It sounds like you have the state government as a potential customer. \nMaybe we can hook you up.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. VARGOVICH: Well, one of the things that I look at is doing research and development doesn't \nreally enter into my production as a manufacturer.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: You need marketing money.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: I need--well, we need projects. The stimulus money, we do work with the government, federal \ngovernment, military, right across the board, but they're waiting for the stimulus money. That's the new reason that \nthey're waiting. Before they didn't have any money; now they're waiting for stimulus money.\n\nBut just to take the technology, there's so much technology that's out there right now that can be utilized into \nproducts. Instead of throwing all the money into research and development, which you still had to do that to keep \nthe universities afloat, but if you could--it's true.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Right. Well, hopefully, they commercialize some of that technology.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: But they don't. You don't see that. A great percentage of it is not. A great percentage of it is not. \nAnd I've seen it. Ontario Hydro Technologies is the NASA of Canada. Okay. Smaller, but it's the same scenario.\n\n\n\nAnd there are projects that were completed, that, if you want to buy it, they'll give it to you. They just want a royalty \nfrom it because they're finished with it.\n\nWhat we need in this country and this state are projects, projects that can be manufactured. You're not going to \ngain manufacturing jobs by doing more research and development. You're going to gain manufacturing jobs by \ndoing some work, doing the finished product in the--put the solar arrays, put the wind turbines up, and do that, and \nput incentives to--higher incentives for people to purchase it.\n\nMake it, market it. Make it more user knowledgeable.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: If I just may follow up, you know, we heard this morning some testimony about the \nnotion of a commons, an industrial commons, where you have clusters of companies and researchers around an \nindustry. People want to come together, be geographically proximate to each other in order to share information. Is \nthat your vision for New York State to-- when I think of Syracuse or Rochester, I'm thinking green. Is that the vision? \nMS. HARTSOCK: That is the vision. In fact, yesterday, I finished writing material for a DoE Smart Grid \nDemonstration Grant that is due on August 6-- a collaborative project involving multiple players across upstate New \nYork in a smart grid enterprise with National Grid as the utility.\n\nSo, yes, again, I think it is our vision.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: I think for a variety of reasons. I think it's certainly the 104 exchange of knowledge, but it's also \nthe establishment of critical masses for career development for people. People are going to stay in a community if \nthey have an opportunity to kind of move.\n\nIf the number of installations around a particular discipline are very limited, their next career move is likely to be out \nof the community, and so those critical masses actually also create more stability for the population, more \nopportunities for local growth, which we think is very important as well.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Mulloy.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nI was reading an article in the New York Times by Keith Bradsher, \"Drawing Critics: China Seeks to Dominate in \nRenewable Energy.\" China has built the world's largest solar panel manufacturing industry by exporting over 90 \npercent of its output to United States and Europe.\n\nBut when China authorized its first solar power plant this year, it required that at least 80 percent of the equipment \nbe made in China. When the Chinese government took bids this spring for 25 large contracts to supply wind \nturbines, every contract was won by one of seven domestic Chinese companies. All six multinationals that \nsubmitted bids were disqualified on various technical grounds.\n\nThe vision, as I see it, is America is now going to become the green industry capital of the world. We're going to \nmake solar. We're going to make wind, but I never understand. We're already running a trade deficit in green \ntechnologies. There's a new study put up by the New America Foundation just two weeks ago showing we are \nrunning a larger and larger deficit in so-called green technologies.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why do we think that the same forces that drove Kodak, Xerox, Corning, a lot of these \ncompanies to outshore/offshore, to do all that, why do we think these forces will be any different when we pump all \nthis money into R&D to develop these ideas and then we start making the stuff? Why do we think that the forces \nthat drove won't drive this stuff to be outsourced as well? Mr. Robinson, and we can go right across.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Frankly I think it is a concern, and I think that the kinds of trade barriers that we're concerned \nabout are going in two directions. And I think that we certainly need to be advancing on trade policies that are \n\n\n\nbalanced and fair on both sides. So there's no question that, absent that, we will continue to find restrictions in our \nability to sell what we make rather than have our technology exploited and having manufacturing take place \nelsewhere.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Terrific response.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: First of all, I don't think we're investing that much in R&D. I really don't. I think if you look at, \nagain, at the national level, what we're investing in R&D in early stage funding to commercialize these technologies \npales with the level of government subsidy that's happening in other areas.\n\nSo I would argue that it is about innovation. I had the opportunity to work 105 in economic development before I \ntook this job in communities that were the home of the Smith-Corona typewriter, who in the 1980s had the \nopportunity to make a strategic decision: am I going to continue to manufacture typewriters or am I going to take on \nthis new concept called laptop computers, personal computers? Their decision: No, I don't think that's a technology \nthat's going anywhere.\n\n[Laughter.] MS. HARTSOCK: We all know the end of that story, don't we, as we shut down a plant in Cortland, New \nYork that employed close to 10,000 people. So I would argue that it's about investing in R&D and doing it at \nsufficient scale and scope with financial support to commercialize some of these entrepreneurs and early stage \ncompanies to get them to production. It's the entire continuum.\n\nAnd I would say that it also needs to be supported by government policies that relate to procurement.\n\nFrom my career in economic development, we worked with some of the largest solar manufacturers and wind \nmanufacturers in the country, and globally, who were looking at New York vis-a-vis other states for investment. It \nwas not state incentives that made the decision where they would site those. It was not who put the biggest pile of \nmoney on the table. It was who could provide procurement and purchase commitments to buy 80 megawatts of \npower from these producers, and that is just as important in terms of developing the market for renewables in the \nUnited States. It's why you see other countries, not just China, ahead of us in that regard.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: I think what your question goes to is the nature of China's behavior in the international trade area, \nand to what extent its practices violate treaties, and so on, to what extent they can be hailed before the World Trade \nOrganization. It is an obligation of the federal government to make sure that the playing field is as even as can be.\n\nCandidly, New York State needs to face a few realities. The most fundamental reality, I think, is that the population \nof the state today is the same as it was 30 years ago, and that the only areas of growth have been the New York \nCity metropolitan area, Long Island and the Hudson Valley, and that the taxation and regulatory structure here is \nnot exactly a positive incentive for companies to start up.\n\nI have a colleague who says it is legal malpractice to incorporate a corporation in the state of New York. As long as \nthat's the case, you're going to see it pretty hard to attract new business to the state.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Mr. Vargovich.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: Corporate America is not concerned with employment.\n\nTheir concern is the bottom line, and there's a reason for it, because it's allowed that way. All right. When you can \ntake a GE, large corporation, they can set a plant up over in China to reduce their manufacturing costs here, \neliminate, virtually eliminating it here, it costs them nothing if they make money.\n\nWhy would they think any other way? There's no reason for them to think any other way but to do that. So there has \nto be something that changes that playing field so that if they produce, take what they're doing here over to China \nor 106 India, Mexico, that there has to be a cost for that, and it has to be a cost that's associated, they have to \nthink twice before they really want do that.\n\n\n\nI've read some things where companies have found that it's not that advantageous to be in China, more of a smaller \ncompany than a larger one, but the larger companies have to do it. Even if somebody did care in the upper \nmanagement, well, what about all these people that we're not going to employ anymore, they have to do it for their \nbottom line.\n\nSo unless you can do something that evens that off between the two, it's going to continue.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: I'll just make one comment. You agree, then, with the testimony earlier that there's \ndeveloped a divergence between the national interests and the corporate interests of some of these multinationals? \nMR. VARGOVICH: Right.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay. Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Blumenthal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes. Thank you very much.\n\nI have two questions. One is for Mr. Vargovich and one is for Mr. Rostow.\n\nIn your testimony, Mr. Vargovich, you talked about the competitors; you're buying parts from your competitors in \nChina. But are you finding Chinese companies in this particular business, renewable energy, developing, integrating \nsolar and wind power systems, are they competing with you in China? Are they competing with you here in the \nUnited States? MR. VARGOVICH: They have competed with me on, we did a lot of work, we manufacture solar-\npowered streetlights that we were putting into Baghdad with the U.S. military, the Department of Defense. And \nbefore we were called upon to do that, they had purchased Chinese lights directly from China.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: To put into Baghdad.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: Right. Put into Baghdad. They had some of our prototypes in other areas; we make a top-shelf \npiece of equipment. The ones that they were getting from China, they rejected them, they didn't work, they had this \nproblem, so eventually what they did is they took all the Chinese out and installed ours. They can get in there \nbecause of costs.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: We've had that same situation in Africa.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: We've had it in other parts of the world the same way.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: But not the same quality? MR. VARGOVICH: Not the same quality.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: They can't compete with you on quality. Do you see them moving up to a place \nwhere they can compete with you on quality? MR. VARGOVICH: Well, anybody can--you know, if you can-- \nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Have you seen that? 107 MR. VARGOVICH: You know, but it's, we're small. \nWe're not making a dent in the Chinese economy, you know, where they're going to say let's see if we can take \nNational Solar Technologies off the screen, but it's something that I've been at trade shows where I hear the \nChinese come over and start taking snapshots.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: Go ahead. You know.\n\n\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: But that's the mentality that I get from it anyway.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Right.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: You know, you might look at other statistics and see something else.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: When I'm directly involved and I directly see something and, you know, the solar panels, we buy \nthe solar panels from China now. I get a cargo carrier full.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: Ship them over on a boat because I can't buy them here for what I have to do to be competitive.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes. Thanks.\n\nDr. Rostow, can you tell us a little bit more about this nanotech initiative at Albany? We've heard a lot of different \ntestimony today basically concluding that R&D is not enough for a variety of reasons. If it's just an R&D product, but \nis not commercialized and doesn't get help getting commercialized, it could be a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nCan you talk about that aspect of the project and where you see it? Are you helping these nanotech R&D projects \nget commercialized? Would you like to see more of that? What's the plan? MR. ROSTOW: Well, first of all, I would \nencourage the Commission or Commission staff to reach out to Dr. Alain Kaloyeros, who is the President of the \nCollege of Nanoscale Engineering at SUNY Albany, and who is--the whole development of nanotechnology and the \npublic-private partnership at Albany is his, was his idea. He conceived of it, and he got the state government to \ninvest heavily in the idea and he brought in IBM, Tokyo Electronics, SEMATECH, to be partners in what is a very \nsuccessful effort at marrying companies, university research, teaching, and the production of new products in the \nnano area.\n\nI am no expert in this. But over the last five to seven years, the state of New York invested very heavily in this \nvision, which involved creating a research park, if you will, with vast clean rooms, with, as I said, leading \nengineering companies in the high-tech area to come and work with SUNY researchers and to build, create an \nincentive to build a whole new college that didn't exist and to make it stand out as the number one in its field.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: So the vision included the companies to commercialize it from the beginning.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: Right. And the result has been the accretion of several 108 thousand jobs. The last number that \nsticks in my head is 3,000 in the last five years, but a lot of research, development and production of products. So \nit's been an enormously successful effort that has given a real spring in the step to the Albany area and the whole \nnotion of public-private partnerships of this sort.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nChairman Bartholomew.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thanks very much, and thank you to all of our witnesses.\n\nDr. Rostow, I'll note in your bio that you were the Staff Director at the Senate Intelligence Committee for awhile. I \nshortly after that was on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee. So we don't often see people out and about \nwho have been doing that work.\n\nA question, for those of you who haven't followed this Commission, you'll be a little surprised that I'm actually going \nto reemphasize a point that Commissioner Mulloy made, but I think this Keith Bradsher article is amazing, and the \n\n\n\nfact that when China authorized its first solar power plant, it required that at least 80 percent of the equipment be \nmade in China, and then when they took bids for 25 large contracts to supply wind turbines, every contract was won \nby one of seven domestic companies.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: I'm shocked to hear this.\n\n[Laughter.] CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Well, I was going to ask does anybody here think that that's \ncoincidental? No. I guess my next question is why is it that people can sort of cavalierly say, well, that's the way the \nChinese government does business, and yet if anybody dares to mention domestic content for U.S. production, \npeople get apoplectic? MR. ROSTOW: To state the question is to answer it. I've spent a lot of my career in the \nfederal government. I have observed that getting the U.S. government to link aid to foreign government to the \nbehavior of that government has always been a contentious issue. Somehow it's impure to do this, to say, you \nknow, you want our assistance, then vote the way we want you to vote at the U.N., for example.\n\nWe have trouble behaving like the Chinese. The Chinese do not have trouble behaving like the Chinese.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Yes. There's really so much at stake here in the sense that as we have seen the \ndecline of our traditional economy, and people are trying to figure out how we move forward as an economically \nvibrant country, renewable energy is supposed to be a growth industry for us, but it looks like we've fallen behind \nbefore we've even gotten started. I know we talk about R&D and we talk about tax rates and we talk about all of \nthese things.\n\nOne of the reasons we decided to come to Rochester was that we wanted to look at sunset industries and sunrise \nindustries and figure out are we already losing the competition before we even get in the game? Ms. Hartsock.\n\n109 MS. HARTSOCK: I don't think we are. I think what's happening is happening under the radar screen because \nthere are not large-scale production facilities, but there are just a number of these smaller enterprises. We \ncommissioned the Battelle Institute to do a study on our 14 county region of central upstate New York to look within \nNAICS codes identified as energy environmental system and determine how many companies are there and how \nmany jobs are there, and what's that growth been over the last eight to ten years.\n\nTheir research indicated there are 419 firms, a little over 10,000 jobs. The growth rate in that industry is 50 percent \nhigher than other comparable sectors, but I think we're just at the threshold of developing this industry here. But I \nthink you're absolutely right in asking are we the tortoise or the hare in the race? And again, you know, that comes \ndown to regulatory policy, incentives, and developing the market, and issues like government strategy related to \nprocurement.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: That's an important one right there. Mr.\n\nRobinson, anything to add? MR. ROBINSON: Well, I would say two things. One, it relates to the example I cited of \nthis company that's going to, we hope, introduce and leap-frog technologies by getting a new base in that's at a \nhigher tech state than where we are because in many instances, China's evolution has been so rapid that they leap \nover certain stages in technology development.\n\nAnd what that actually does is put our start-up companies, I think, at a disadvantage, and the point that you made \nearlier is critically important. There is so much, and maybe even Mr. Vargovich's comments about, you know, a lot \nof research doesn't go anywhere. Well, the reality is that it is true that there is a lot of research that's \ncommercializable that doesn't. The private sector in the United States does not pay much attention to the earliest \nstages of company development.\n\nAnd some states that have made investments in these early stage companies are starting to show some progress, \nplaces like Pennsylvania where they've got the Ben Franklin Fund and things like that.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: Exactly.\n\n\n\nMR. ROBINSON: New York, and I'm sure we're not alone, leaves that gap to the three FFFs: friends, fools and \nfamilies, and you don't really end up with a structured approach to supporting the development of early stage \ntechnology companies. Unless you're in a market where all of the investors live, like in Silicon Valley, or in Boston, \nyou will find that there is very little in the way of early stage technology company development.\n\nI think that is inherently where our competitive advantage is with China and with other emerging technologies.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: It's where? I missed the last part.\n\nWhere is the competitive advantage? MR. ROBINSON: In our early stage technology companies that can't get off \nthe ground. And so I would strongly urge for there to be, where public investment needs to go is where the private \nsector is not going. I don't think we need to get into where the private sector is being successful. It is not going into \n110 that earliest stage. And we need some mechanisms to actually have more failures.\n\nWe are so risk averse in terms of investing in early-stage companies that we do not, because we don't tolerate \nfailure well, but in the early stage technology company development, what you really need to do is have a high \nenough failure rate that you've gotten enough of the universe in play that the winners can emerge.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Right. Just one comment, and then we'll turn it over, but I want to tie all of this into \nsome of what our panelists talked about this morning.\n\nI don't think we can walk away from the fact that not only, Mr.\n\nVargovich, do you now have to import from China the components or whatever the pieces are of these solar panels \nthat you're manufacturing, but because of this policy that Keith Bradsher talks about here, you're not going to be \nable to export your product to China because it's not made in China, and so there is this R&D level up here that's \ntalking about, but there's also this manufacturing.\n\nWe're not going to get out of our trade deficit problem unless we can export more products. We can't export what's \nsupposed to be a major sector for us if the Chinese government is going to continue to do whatever it is doing, \nbarriers or the choices that it's making. So it's like we're being hit twice.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: If I may, I'd like to second what Mr. Robinson said. I think it's not true that in Boston, they finance \nstart-ups any more easily than in New York.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: By reputation perhaps.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: But when I worked on economic development in Massachusetts, MIT used to claim that they \ngenerated 70 percent of the economic activity in Massachusetts, and this was graduates going from the garage to \nRoute 128.\n\nBut if we could have a fund that would support innovation and accept the fact that there would be failure, that would \nbe an enormous step forward.\n\nI think if we could change our policy on nuclear energy--I mean with all respect to wind and solar and everything \nelse, if we want to be independent of foreign oil, or oil, period, nuclear energy is the way to do it. The French did it.\n\nYou know, other countries have done it. It's not rocket science. And if I can understand it, it certainly is not rocket \nscience.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Anybody else want to add a comment? MS. HARTSOCK: Well, both of my colleagues \nare right. There is no silver bullet when it comes to technology. It's the entire technology platform we need to be \ndeveloping, but the critical gap at the federal and state level is that Valley of Death when it comes to the incubation \nand acceleration of these new technologies.\n\n\n\nThat's what I was talking about when I said at the national level, we need to focus on an innovation agenda at the \nsame scale and scope at which we did 40 years ago in the space race.\n\nThe Governor has just commissioned a Small Business Innovation Task Force. He just announced $100 million \nState Innovation Fund as a ten percent match for institutions, companies, organizations applying for federal \nstimulus dollars, which hopefully will leverage up a billion dollars in activity.\n\n111 But we still, we just don't have the solution. We don't have it at the federal or the state level, and if there's one \nthing I think all of us could agree to, it's that's the critical gap in terms of taking that vision and making it a reality \nand really fully recognizing and realizing the promise that academic institutions, not just in Upstate New York, but \nacross this country, have to offer.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Slane.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Mr. Vargovich, did you want to comment? HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Oh, sure, \nI'm sorry.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: I just wanted to make a comment on asking a question about selling back to China or dealing \nwith China. I'm not concerned with--I don't want--I'm not even concerned with selling to China.\n\nThe renewable energy business right now just from what we potentially have in the United States--all right--just the \nUnited States is enough to make a million businesses like mine. You know, there's, maybe not a million, but they \ncan have big business right here. You don't have to go to China. You don't have to do that.\n\nYou're competing with them with a product, but as an innovator and business and manufacturing, there's always a \nway around everything that's done. If I have to compete with China, fine. If I have to buy a solar panel from them, \nbut my other products, whatever I can do, I'll do it right here, and then I can sell it right here.\n\nThere's more business, dealing with the United States government, states and local governments around the \ncountry, that have sustained many, many, many businesses. You know, it's not a--renewable energy if you're \nlooking at that as an industry, is really small right now-- right. It's really small. You're not going to see a General \nMotors type of renewable energy company popping up.\n\nIt's all going to be the smaller companies, the hundred, 200, 20, maybe 20 employees like my business, but you're \ngoing to see that, and that can grow. But you have to have the projects that we can go after.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Slane.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: As we all know, innovation is what drives our economy, and yet less than four percent of \nAmerican college students choose engineering as a profession. Does anybody have any ideas on how we can \nreverse that and incentivize or encourage these kids to go into engineering? Start with Mr. Robinson.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, I think I'd almost validate your point.\n\nEngineering in the hard sciences has perhaps been a little less attractive, in terms of the best and the brightest. \nThey go into medicine; they go into business and finance. And we actually find that, I mentioned that the \npercentage of our students who are foreign- born or are coming over through some international vehicle to enroll, \nand if you take a look at our graduate programs in the biomedical sciences, 112 the Ph.D. programs, they're \noverwhelmingly populated by people from international sources, not just China.\n\nAnd so it remains a significant concern for us. We do aggressively compete for U.S. graduates, I'm thinking medical \nschool now, and we are actually seeing a little bit of a turning of that tide recently as employment opportunities are \n\n\n\nshifting. Obviously, with this downturn, and finance maybe not being as attractive a discipline as it was before, we'll \nbegin to see some shifts, but I echo your concern, and we have to do more to promote those career opportunities \nwell before people select their colleges.\n\nSo that's going to have to be working through secondary education and the introduction of STEM-related programs \nin the educational system across the country at the secondary and middle-school level.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: I can only give you the \"mom\" answer. So I have three sons: a mechanical engineer; an \naerospace engineer; and a 12- year-old who's sitting around the corner on a laptop who wants to be a chemical \nengineer-- COMMISSIONER SLANE: You're doing something right.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: I think the answer is at K to 12 -- making it fun. I mean I encouraged my kids to blow up things in \nthe kitchen when they were little, and now one who was part of the team that blew up the wayward spy satellite a \nyear ago in February as part of the Lockheed Martin-U.S. Navy mission. So I think it is engaging kids at an early \nage to give them a vision of not just a career path but a life that can really make a difference.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Yes, let me just add, I was involved with a large public university, and the largest profit \ncenter at the university was the law school, and these kids borrow $150,000 a year, and come out of law school, \nand for most of them, there are no jobs. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they, many of them certainly \nwould qualify to go to select a degree in engineering.\n\nDoctor, do you have any-- MR. ROSTOW: I think this is a concern for everybody in the education, certainly in the \neducation business.\n\nAt SUNY, we've engaged in a pretty systematic effort to redesign basic courses to make them more interesting for \nstudents, recognizing that an awful lot of decisions about what career path or study path a student takes depends \nso much on the classroom experience: is it a good one or bad? And where you have in basic science courses or \nbasic history courses--it doesn't matter what field--huge numbers of students that don't finish a course because \nthey're just totally turned off by it, that is something we're addressing through course redesign with very great \nsuccess, using computers and interactive devices so that the student is more engaged, and this is something that's \nessential at the lower level and essential for us because we are engaged in the training of teachers on a very large \nscale. So it's a very important subject for SUNY.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Well, I would say to Commissioner Slane, it probably started with Perry Mason and \nthen Boston Legal and LA Law. Popular culture made being a lawyer a sexy thing to do.\n\n113 COMMISSIONER SLANE: Right, I agree.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: You don't see television shows about engineers; do you? Or, you know, chemistry-- \nMR. ROBINSON: Well, Apollo 13.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. VARGOVICH: Can I make a comment? HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Yes, please.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: When you're looking at engineering, you have to look at where are the jobs? Okay. And the jobs \nare in--what-- manufacturing and production. So generally when somebody goes and takes a career course, it's \nusually on some sort of advice from somebody else. So if your father, your uncle, or next door neighbor was an \nengineer at Chevy or Ford, and everything is going great, he's going to say, boy, you have to go for engineering; \nyou're going to have a terrific job, a terrific career. I can get you into Chevy or Ford or General Electric, whatever it \nis.\n\nBut when those jobs start going away, what's he going to tell them? COMMISSIONER SLANE: Switch careers.\n\nMR. VARGOVICH: Go to law school.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Right, yes.\n\n\n\n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay. This will be our last question. Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Videnieks.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Good afternoon, everybody. With most taxpayer-financed R&D, the acquisition \ninstruments give the government unlimited rights to give to whomever the information generated under the grant or \ncontract.\n\nBut these grants and contracts don't require that the government proactively disseminate this information.\n\nWould it be helpful and less restrictive in making a make or buy decision that there were a bank of information of \nR&D results readily available to even small businessmen? That's my question. Should something like that be, \nshould the regulations, the acquisition regulations, be changed to require that the taxpayerfinanced institutions or \nsupported-institutions that they proactively disseminate R&D data and create a database for this? Am I coming \nacross? MR. ROBINSON: First of all, I think you're, at least in terms of research funding, which is where the \nintellectual property comes from, much of it federally funded through NIH, NSF, DoE, and other federal agencies is \nsubject to Bayh- Dole, and the Bayh-Dole Act, in addition to attempting to accelerate the commercialization of \ntechnology by providing the research institution with the IP rights and the ability to license it, I think that's been \ndemonstrated to actually be much more-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: No licensing would be required if the \ngovernment has unlimited rights to disseminate. They have it.\n\n114 MR. ROBINSON: The information, actually the publication of research information is required, so that \ninformation is out there. Could it be organized better so that it's accessible-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: \nWithout a fee. In other words, gratis access to the information generated? MR. ROBINSON: In other words, that \nthere--well, I mean that taking that out of the IP realm and just making it available first-come/first-serve? Is that kind \nof what-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: When the government finances R&D, awards a contract or a grant-- MR. \nROBINSON: Right.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: --it's got a data rights clause in it, and it usually gives unlimited rights to the \ngovernment to do-- MR. ROBINSON: Right.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: --whatever it pleases with data first generated under the contract or grant.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Right.\n\nMS. HARTSOCK: I always refer IP questions to legal counsel.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. ROSTOW: Well, I could duck this by saying that the State University IP world is handled through \nthe Research Foundation of the State University of New York, which is a separate entity.\n\n[Laughter.] CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Which you used to work for.\n\nMR. ROSTOW: True, I worked briefly there. [Laughter.] MR. ROSTOW: Let me just say this is not a subject for a flip \nanswer because there's all kinds of research that's done with federal dollars. Some of it is more readily amenable to \nproducts being available to the world. Some of the results of research are far less amenable to this.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Do taxpayer-financed research results get to China? MR. ROSTOW: Absolutely. \nThat's not desirable, but that's what one would have to guard against. There's an awful lot of sensitive technology \nthat is or knowledge that's generated through federal research which is not just the stuff that has revolutionized the \ngame of tennis.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Right. Having China be-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Not intended. Sir, do you want to \ncomment maybe? MR. VARGOVICH: Yes, I do. That's a great idea, and there is information that would be great to \nbe able to pick and choose what you wanted, but a lot of it, what I see is a lot of the money being spent on the \n\n\n\nresearch and development of products that are looked at first as to the probability of them being a viable product \nand being manufactured if we are, in fact, looking to produce production jobs in the United States.\n\n115 All right. Did I lose you? COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: To reduce production jobs? MR. VARGOVICH: Yeah, \nif your idea of doing an R&D project is to take a product, end up with a product at the end that will be used here in \nthe United States to, is manufactured, will produce jobs, then that's one story.\n\nI think what should be done is with that money, if it's going to end up in China, then that company that was given \nthat money to do their R&D work should have to pay it back or let China pay for the R&D.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Or, but my point basically is this, if the government in its acquisition documents \nrequired that whoever the contractor is or a grantee is, that they be required to distribute to industry organizations \nthe results of the research and development, if applicable, to industry groups-- MR. VARGOVICH: Sure.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: --wouldn't that be something to include as a requirement in the future government \ncontracts at some point? MR. VARGOVICH: Sure.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Would it be helpful? MR. VARGOVICH: And I also think that there should be some \ninput from industrial, from industry itself on what it's actually looking for in the marketplace rather than the pie in the \nsky.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Mr. Robinson, did you have something to add? I'll give you the last word.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Well, I was just saying that I think the dissemination of information and control of intellectual \nproperty are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nAnd the dissemination of information takes place.\n\nCould it be organized in a way that was more accessible is a reasonable question to ask, and I think that's true.\n\nI think turning upside down the system of intellectual property protection right now is actually going to further erode \nour ability to be competitive because it really is our competitive edge. So I would view information dissemination \nand protection of property as two separate-- COMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: Is it not one and the same subject if \none takes government money to do the work? One doesn't have to take it.\n\nMR. ROBINSON: Okay.\n\nCOMMISSIONER VIDENIEKS: There's a price.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Well, thank you very much to all four of you for being here today and for your \nparticipation, and you made a real contribution to our efforts.\n\nWe will reconvene at 2:35 for our last panel. Thank you.\n\n[Whereupon, a short recess was taken.] PANEL IV: ADVANCED R&D IN SUNRISE INDUSTRIES THAT CAN \nLEAD TO GROWTH FOR LOCAL COMPANIES HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: We're going to start our final \npanel, and 116 then we will have an open mic after this. I thank each of you for being here. Like the wedding feast \nat Cana, maybe we've saved the best till last.\n\nOur first witness, Dr. Nabil Nasr, is the Director for the Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies right here at the \nRochester Institute of Technology.\n\nDr. Nasr just flew in red-eye from California so he could be here with us today, and we can't thank you enough for \nmaking that effort. He's the Assistant Provost for Academic Affairs, and he's the Director of the Golisano Institute \nfor Sustainability here at RIT.\n\n\n\nDr. Marnie LaVigne is the Director of Business Development at the University of Buffalo at the Center for Advanced \nBiomedical and Bioengineering Technology, and she's an editorial board member for the Biotechnology \nHealthcare and Disease Management. Thank you for making the effort to be here.\n\nMr. Edward Patton is the Director of Sales and Marketing for Rochester Precision Optics.\n\nMR. PATTON: Correct.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Mr. Patton joined Rochester Precision Optics in 2007. He was previously with \nLightPath Technologies. And this is one of the sunrise industries that we hope New York State will help us \nunderstand that.\n\nFinally, Mr. Barons, thank you for being here.\n\nMr. Barons is the Vice President for Strategy Integration for Fuji Xerox Operations. In his role, he's responsible for \ndeveloping business strategies for optimizing Xerox's investment in Fuji Xerox with a special emphasis on product \ndevelopment, logistics and distribution.\n\nBut Mr. Barons, you've also had a lot of time out in Asia, I understand-- MR. BARONS: I have not lived there, but \nI've traveled.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: You've traveled, though.\n\nMR. BARONS: Yes.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes, yes. So thank you very much, and we'll start with Dr. Nasr.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF DR. NABIL NASR DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INTEGRATED \nMANUFACTURING STUDIES, ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK DR. \nNASR: Good afternoon. First I would like to thank the Commission for giving me the opportunity to speak to you \nabout this very important subject.\n\nBefore I start, just a few words about CIMS. Actually this is the CIMS building that you're in today. The Center for \nIntegrated Manufacturing Studies, or CIMS, at RIT was established in 1992 with the mission to increase the \ncompetitiveness of manufacturers through technology development and technology transfer.\n\nCIMS represents a dynamic collaboration of in-house technical experts as 117 well as academic, industry and \ngovernment collaborators. Our facility houses five research centers and an outreach program.\n\nIt's been well documented that New York State is still undergoing considerable job losses in the manufacturing \nsector, which is a point of interest to this Commission.\n\nA multi-year study conducted by CIMS to analyze the manufacturing sectors, the manufacturing clusters, in this \nregion was concluded last year. The title of the study was \"The Development of a Roadmap for the Revitalization of \nUpstate New York Manufacturing.\" The goal of the Roadmap study was primarily to gain a clear understanding of \nthe state of health of clusters in the region, and to understand what action can be taken to address some of the \nchallenges as well as the revitalization of our manufacturing economy, the manufacturing sector, here in upstate.\n\nThis work -- conducted by CIMS in collaboration with many of our clusters and cluster leadership here in the region, \nand with many of our industrial partners -- helped identify several needed initiatives that could positively impact New \nYork State's economy.\n\nThese initiatives are focused on expanding existing clusters into new areas such as smart product technology \nintegration and sustainable mobility technology development in areas such as fuel cells. We have many fuel cell \nR&D facilities here for GM and Delphi and others in the area, as well as suppliers. Other initiatives focus on \n\n\n\nenhancing industry resources and collaboration, including enhancing partnership between the university and \nindustry, which is critical to leveraging university resources to advance innovation and technology development.\n\nI will cover some of the recommendations that we included in the study very briefly. I'll start by discussing the \npotential for new clusters or the new business opportunities that were identified as opportunities for existing clusters \nin upstate New York.\n\nThe first one is green jobs. The latest statistics I've seen note that growth in green jobs is double what we typically \nsee in the traditional manufacturing areas: 9.1 percent growth in this area versus 3.7 overall job market growth. \nThere are plenty of opportunities here and we do have several incubators focusing primarily on clean technology.\n\nWe have one incubator here at the university that was in partnership with one of the state agencies, NYSERDA, \nand it has great potential for expanding job growth in this region.\n\nThe other area is alternative fuels. Even though we are in a recession, we see significant growth in this area versus \nother traditional job opportunities.\n\nIn the fuel cell area, as I mentioned, we have significant infrastructure and capabilities here in upstate, and it's a \nchallenging time because some of these activities are led by GM and Delphi. Some of these activities, like Delphi's, \nfor example, are in an advanced phase and ready for production in 2011. However, with the challenges we see in \nthe automotive industry today, may be in question.\n\n118 The green IT area is another cluster we have identified Many organizations are looking at their IT infrastructure \nequipment for computing and data centers, as well as printers and so on, with an eye toward lowering the footprint \nof the eco-IT area for their organizations. This has opened the opportunity for innovation ranging from equipment, to \nservices, to building equipment, and so on.\n\nAnother area -- and I know one of our other speakers will be talking about it -- is bio-informatics; so I will not say \nmuch about this, but it's a great opportunity for growth for firms in this region.\n\nAnother area we identified, based on the existing infrastructure and the resources here in upstate, is \nremanufacturing and recycling. There is significant growth in this area based on many voluntary take- back \nprograms.\n\nSmart products also is an area that we identified with many regional strengths in this area.\n\nI'm going to briefly mention some of the initiatives we identified, that really target what the federal government or \nNew York State can do to help our clusters here to increase job growth and to address some of the challenges that \nwe see in the manufacturing area.\n\nThe strategic alignment of resources is one key area. We identified significant resources that exist in upstate New \nYork. We have a notably welleducated labor force in this region. We also have significant infrastructure in this \nregion. The alignment of these resources was identified as one of the major challenges we face.\n\nPromoting New York State exports was also another area that we identified as a major area for growth that can help \nmany of our firms.\n\nGlobal market expansion tools can provide many small and medium- size companies with the ability to understand \nhow they can take their product to export market and thus grow their business Research related to how the state or \nthe federal government can assist our industry is intended to help companies identify where the opportunities are \nand help guide them to gain entry into some of these markets and identify what's needed. For example, today we \nsee major certification requirements for many countries; in many economies, there are significant equal labels \nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThose requirements can be barriers for many medium and small-size companies trying to enter into that market, \nbecause it requires a sizable investment for the companies just to understand how they can meet the requirements.\n\nLastly, I would like to stress the fact that we have significant infrastructure in the region, and the university system \nthat exists here in upstate New York offers tremendous resources for industry.\n\nHowever, our studies found that 70 percent of regional manufacturers said that basically they have no collaboration \nwith the university system although they do have significant overlap in terms of technology with many of the existing \nprograms at the universities.\n\nManufacturers also indicated that they would like to work with the universities. Some of the things that they reported \nwere frustration over 119 intellectual property restrictions, conflicts, contracting process, and slow responsiveness \nof many research organizations due to some of the rules and regulations we have to comply with as well.\n\nHaving said that, I think New York State does have the significant resources that I mentioned earlier, and we also \nhave some bright examples of advanced technology centers that are doing significant work with the clusters in their \nareas.\n\nSo it is definitely an area where we believe major improvement can happen, and that would allow us to leverage all \nthe university resources and capabilities to assist job growth in the region. This is not just a problem in New York \nState; it is a problem we see nationwide.\n\nSUNY and other universities in New York State are operating a number of research centers and R&D facilities in \nareas such as Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, Binghamton. These college- and university-based research centers \nhave remarkable potential to provide assistance to companies and clusters where they have the expertise.\n\nI apologize. I didn't look at the system here.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: The time. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but if you want to finish up, then we'll go \non.\n\nDR. NASR: Yes. I will conclude that I think we see these centers as a tremendous opportunity for growth for our \nindustries, by providing the mechanism to allow companies to work collaboratively with universities.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Nabil Nasr Director of the Center for Integrated Manufacturing \nStudies, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York Thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony \nto the US-China Economic & Security Review Commission. I am Nabil Nasr, Director of the Center for Integrated \nManufacturing Studies and The Golisano Institute for Sustainability, both located here on the campus of Rochester \nInstitute of Technology.\n\nThe Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies, or CIMS, was established in 1992 with a mission to increase the \ncompetitiveness of manufacturers through technology development and transfer. CIMS represents a dynamic \ncollaboration of in-house technical experts, as well as academic, industry and government resources. CIMS' facility \nhouses multiple research centers focused in specific technologies and industry sectors. These centers include: the \nNational Center for Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery (NC3R), Systems Modernization and Sustainment \nCenter (SMS), Center for Sustainable Mobility, Center for Sustainable Production (CSP), and New York State \nPollution Prevention Institute (NYSP2I).\n\nEach of these centers embodies programs that contain both focused research efforts and an active industry \noutreach.\n\nThe success of these programs resulted in CIMS becoming a recipient of the U.S. Department of Commerce's \nEconomic Development Administration's (EDA) Excellence in University Led Strategies award for 2009. The EDA \naward recognizes innovative economic development projects or strategies of national significance and showcases \nbest practices achieving outstanding results.\n\n\n\nIt has been well documented that New York State is still undergoing significant job loss in the manufacturing sector, \n120 which is a point of interest for this commission. A multiyear research project entitled the Development of a \nRoadmap for the Revitalization of Upstate New York Manufacturing was conducted by CIMS to gain a clear \nunderstanding of the health of our manufacturing clusters in the region and identify what can be done to revitalize \nour manufacturing base. This work at CIMS has identified several needed initiatives that could positively impact the \nNew York State Economy. These initiatives are focused on expanding existing clusters into new areas such as: \nsmart products technology integration, and sustainable mobility technology development in areas such as fuel cells.\n\nOther initiatives are focused on enhancing industry resources and collaboration including enhancing partnership \nbetween universities and industry, which is critical to leverage university resources to advance innovations and \ntechnology development. I will cover some of these recommendations as follows.\n\nLet me start by discussing which industries have the potential to spearhead future economic growth of New York \nState. Based on my experience, there are several emerging high-potential industry sectors that could help fuel \nbusiness growth in our state. They include: \u2022 Green Jobs: The Pew Charitable Trusts finds that U.S. \"green jobs\" \ngrew 9.1 percent between 1998 and 2007, versus 3.7 percent for the overall job market. According to this report, \ngreen jobs represent over half the size of employment in the traditional energy sector and it's gaining.\n\n\u2022 Alternative Fuels: Despite the recession, the U.S. bio-fuel industry grew by 34 percent last year, adding an \nadditional 240,000 new jobs. With the push toward energy independence, this industry should continue to expand.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Cells: Lux Research predicts that global commercial sales of fuel cells will reach $1.8 billion in 2012. This \ngrowth will be driven primarily by applications in residential heat/power systems and distributed generation.\n\n\u2022 Green IT: The Gartner group surveyed 620 organizations worldwide whether they were cutting spending to \nimprove the energy efficiency of their IT systems. The results showed that for most businesses, green IT remains a \npriority. Forty-plus percent of survey respondents expected to spend more than 15 percent of their IT budgets on \nenergy efficiency projects.\n\n\u2022 Bio-Informatics: Bioinformatics is the application of information technology to the field of molecular biology.\n\nRNCOS, a market research organization, predicts that biometric product lines, software, and other applications will \nachieve an annual market growth rate of 15.8 percent by 2010.\n\n\u2022 Remanufacturing and recycling: The remanufacturing industry is reinventing itself in response to the \"green \nproducts\" movement and many remanufacturers are growing. The U.S. remanufacturing industry generates $65 \nbillion in sales, with the automotive sector contributing $37 billion of that total.\n\n\u2022 Smart Products: Smart products and production systems offer a great opportunity for NYS businesses.\n\nSmart products leverage intelligent systems, embedded sensors, and connectivity to provide customers with \nadvanced utility throughout the life cycle. Likewise, smart production systems use information age technologies to \noptimize performance and quality while reducing environmental impacts and resource consumption. The value-add \nfrom smart products and systems applies to both large firms and small to midsize manufacturing companies.\n\nThe New York State government has a significant role in promoting sunrise industries. Sunrise industries are \nhighrisk/ high-potential enterprises that often require additional support from government to succeed in the global \nmarketplace. Our study of Upstate's industrial base found that the State government could aid high-potential \nmanufacturers to compete globally by adopting these strategies: \u2022 Strategic Alignment of Resources. Provide long-\nterm support and planning assistance for clusters impacted by manufacturing transformation; and, link statewide \nplanning with federal strategies, including support for regional companies in areas of national importance and \nassistance in seeking federal investments.\n\n\u2022 Promote NYS exports by reforming policies surrounding exportation of New York centric products, and promote \nbetter linkage of company marketing and expansion efforts with cluster organizations and state resources.\n\n\n\n121 \u2022 Global Market Expansion Tools: Create incentives for export-based manufacturing initiatives, and expand \nsupport to global market expansion programs.\n\n\u2022 Research & Report Out On Global Markets: Perform periodic reviews of potential trade policy and global initiative \nimpacts on NYS industry clusters and proactively communicate results to impacted clusters. Also, support efforts on \nbehalf of NYS companies regarding global trade policy fairness.\n\nAnother key component in promoting future growth is the university system in New York State. There are \ntremendous resources available through our region's college and university system -- both public and private -- to \nassist manufacturers in advancing innovation through the development of advanced technology industries that are \ngeographically near to the university. Unfortunately several challenges inhibit strong linkages between New York \nuniversities and area companies. CIMS' study found that 70 percent of regional manufacturers do not currently \npartner with universities, although over half of them would be interested in collaboration. At the root of this situation \nis a cultural divide between the for-profit business and non-profit research worlds. Companies said they were \nfrustrated with the intellectual property restrictions, complex contracting processes, and slow responsiveness of \nmany research organizations.\n\nTo improve linkages between the private sector and the universities, the State should reform intellectual property \npolicies to encourage and facilitate more technology development and transfer. The State should also strategically \nlink both universities and Centers of Excellence to specific industry clusters that stand the best chance of benefitting \nfrom this collaboration.\n\nDespite these challenges, NYS has many bright examples of successful collaboration between advanced \ntechnology centers at NYS universities and industries. The work being done here at RIT-CIMS is a good example of \nencouraging the growth of advanced technology industries.\n\nSUNY and other universities in New York State are operating a number of research centers and advanced R&D \nfacilities in the region. They include Albany, Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton, and Rochester. These college and \nuniversity-based research centers have remarkable potential for providing assistance to industry. Today, many \ncenters are focused on transferring technology and research to companies in a wide variety of fields. However, \nmany NYS industries and companies have not been able to take full advantage of these resources, and linkages \nbetween centers and industry have not been strong according to our industry survey. To leverage the resources \ncontained within the region's research centers and advanced R&D facilities, the State should take an active role in \nconnecting its Centers of Excellence to those industry clusters that could gain the most advantage from this form of \npartnership.\n\nNew York State is not alone in its desire to foster high-growth and sunrise industries. Many people know that China \nhas created a number of successful industrial parks. I am often asked if this strategy should be emulated in upstate \nNew York. It is true that the Chinese have a strong commitment to large, broad-focus industrial parks to serve as \nbusiness attractor. Many have paid back their investments handsomely, but some have failed, which has proven \nvery costly. Let's keep in mind that China-style industrial parks require massive long-term investments in planning, \ndevelopment, and infrastructure. I am not sure emulating this model is right for New York State. We in New York \nshould leverage the strengths of Upstate. I suggest that the State support carefully selected and vetted high- \npotential business industry clusters. This would focus State funding on the best opportunities for sustainable \nbusiness and jobs growth.\n\nThis concludes my testimony, and again I would like to thank the commission for the opportunity to testify today.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\nDR. NASR: I thank you again for the opportunity.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Dr. Nasr.\n\n\n\nDr. LaVigne, your testimony, when you talk about BioBay, suggests you've been over there and you've seen what's \nhappening in China.\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: Yes, I wish I had been over there. Actually, we had visitors in Buffalo.\n\n122 HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Oh, you had visitors.\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: Yes.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Okay. Go ahead.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF DR. MARNIE LAVIGNE DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, UNIVERSITY \nOF BUFFALO CENTER FOR ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL AND BIOENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY, BUFFALO, \nNEW YORK DR. LaVIGNE: Very good. Thank you so much for the opportunity to address the Commission today.\n\nAs you heard, I'm Director of Business Development for what is called the University of Buffalo CAT program, which \nis one of 15 programs across the state supported by one of our economic development agencies known as \nNYSTAR.\n\nI actually have an added advantage that we did actually see the wisdom of pooling a couple of our programs so I \ntoo am part of a Center of Excellence, of the CoE. As you heard referenced in Syracuse, we are the Center of \nExcellence for the Buffalo region which specializes in bioinformatics and life sciences.\n\nWith that role, I too bring a background that is fairly eclectic. I was a scientist, a U of R grad actually, from many, \nmany years spent there prior to receiving my doctorate in clinical psychology, but actually went from scientist to \nentrepreneur, did two start-up companies, took them public, and then actually moved into economic development \narena, and now I'm going a lot of workforce development. So kind of running across the spectrum.\n\nHopefully, I bring a perspective that is informed by experience as well as studying of the region.\n\nThe programs that I mentioned actually all reside in the Buffalo Life Sciences Complex which we are most proud of. \nIt was spawned through a $200 million public-private sponsorship, much like the Albany Nanotech Center, which \nyou heard of, but at a much, much smaller scale, to be sure.\n\nWe do have three institutions that are key in that collaborative, and that's University of Buffalo, Roswell Park \nCancer Institute, as well as Hauptmann- Woodward Medical Research Institute. These are our region's premier \nresearch institutions, and, in fact, they've had an incredibly rich history of discovery.\n\nFor example, the most widely used test for prostate cancer detection, the PSA test, was actually invented at \nRoswell Park. Avonex, a widely used drug for multiple sclerosis treatment, was invented in Buffalo, New York, as \nwell. The pacemaker, you may not know, was invented in Buffalo, but the business we actually obtained there and \nset up is in Greatbatch, which really is more of a battery technology, and Medtronic went on to go into the billion \ndollar market cap range.\n\nIn fact, we're very proud of our history. There are great examples that show that, in fact, all the R&D that we've \ntalked about here can yield great products and services in addition to wonderful kinds of ways to improve our health \n123 and quality of life.\n\nUnfortunately, for our region and all of New York State, has not one of those inventions, and many, many more I \ncould list for you, yielded any private sector jobs in the state. In other words, the companies that took those to \nmarket did not do that here.\n\nThis has taught us some really good lessons, and hopefully we're learning from those lessons, and I think that it's \nuseful to share here today.\n\n\n\nThe key lessons that I just want to summarize briefly, as I work into a little bit more detail, but I think they ring true \nwith so much of what you've heard here today. The key lessons for us are, first and foremost, is that we need to \nassemble the full complement of strategically-aligned resources--you've heard that phrase before-- versus \noperating through our multiple silos and traditional programs.\n\nSecondly, we need to invest in operational elements for business development versus strictly investing in capital \nexpenditures like buildings and equipment.\n\nTo build a high-tech economy in industries like life sciences, renewable energies and advanced manufacturing, we \ndo know that it requires a unique and strategically combined gathering of technology innovation, capital and \nworkforce.\n\nThe process of growing high-tech industry revenues and jobs is, in fact, dependent upon a robust pipeline that \nfacilitates innovation development and movement from the point of discovery and invention to the actual \nmarketplace, as you've heard again prior to my discussing this.\n\nThis process is dependent on both capital and talent. So investments in our Center of Excellence in Buffalo Life \nSciences Complex, again, we are most grateful for them. They were primarily for capital expenditures. So these \nhave gone far indeed to improve our infrastructure and hard assets, just as you've seen in Albany and as you're \nseeing in Syracuse, but, in fact, we know that we need to do more than this.\n\nRecently, we are seeing new federal and state initiatives also adding more dollars to the research and development \npipeline, and, in fact, this is very exciting because we know we can invent more when we have those resources for \nour research programs.\n\nBut what of the other resources needed to develop the high-tech economy, especially in regions like upstate New \nYork where it's not happening naturally despite the extensive research funding? This concern actually holds true for \nall of New York State. As you know, we have one of the highest research expenditures in the country. In fact, we're \nsecond just to California, but, in fact, if you look at the typical resource needed to turn this R&D into commercial \nproducts, which is often in the form of venture capital, we actually only receive four percent of the venture capital \ninvested nationally, whereas, California receives 47 percent of that venture capital.\n\nWe're well aware that we're not where we need to be. We all hear about Silicon Valley and Boston's high-tech \ncorridor, but what about the rest of the country? 124 To mention--Pat, I'm turning to our results--we have seen great \nresults, but it has been with great effort trying to pool resources that are not aligned and are not well funded. So our \nresults for our region are that the life sciences has, in fact, grown and retained jobs to the tune of 5,000 jobs in the \nprivate sector and in our academic institutions.\n\nWe're pleased with that number. We have spawned over 40 new life sciences companies since we got into this \ninitiative in about 2001. We're showing typically 20-to-one return on the kind of investment we're making in our early \nstage Valley of Death company opportunities. So we're pleased about that, and we've actually grown our total base \nof life sciences companies to over 140 with 6,000 private sector employees. We know private sector is where it's all \nat.\n\nFor us, this has been terrific, but we also look at states like North Carolina, who have made significant long-term \ninvestments, much more significant than we have here. We look at China with bioBay, and yes, we had visitors \ncome from bioBay, two business development folks, with a cadre sitting behind them back in China that was \nnothing I could even imagine.\n\nThe bioBay exercise is one we absolutely must learn from. We need to aggregate. It doesn't always have to be \ngeographically in the same space, but there is no question that we need to create those virtual relationships, and \nthat amounts to people. We must have people together, and we must have people who do the work like the work I \ndo, and those are typically the dollars we do not see.\n\n\n\nThe dollars are for buildings, they are for equipment, but they are generally not for the operations including the \ntalent who has business experience in this industry, and also for the capital investment in the young companies and \nthose that are trying to grow rapidly.\n\nWith so much our federal government can do to catalyze our new economy, I think that that strategic investment is \nkey.\n\nA couple quick items as far as where I think we need to make the investments is: We have to absolutely incentivize \nand fund projects but make sure that it's clear where the private sector win is. As you well know, many projects \ndon't delineate that carefully.\n\nWe have to increase the technology commercialization funding beyond capital expenses, as you heard me say.\n\nWe need to develop programs that involve multi-year sustained funding.\n\nIn addition, we need to create investment capital programs that actually incentivize our private sector to jump in \nhand-in-hand with government.\n\nPennsylvania, Ben Franklin Fund, perfect example.\n\nWe need to deploy our funding initiatives through both community- based and university-based programs. I think \nwe've learned that this does work. We're just not funding it at the right level.\n\nIn addition, I would add that we have to bring industry-savvy talent into economic development, workforce \ndevelopment and to research arenas. I am an anomaly in my world. Most people have not had the kind of \nexperience I have had, 125 and when you give people money who are used to spending it on research programs \nor traditional economic development, it's hard to expect them to know how to treat it differently. So I think we have \nto really innovate in our people that we're bringing to the table.\n\nAnd to a point that came up earlier, we do have to address regulatory and trade issues, and I have to tell you I am \nno expert in it, but the federal government can't be shy about doing what's right for this country.\n\nSo I would just urge you to take those ideas back, and I certainly would be happy to discuss those in more depth \nwith you.\n\nThank you.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Marnie LaVigne Director of Business Development, University \nof Buffalo Center for Advanced Biomedical and Bioengineering Technology, Buffalo, New York Thank you for the \nopportunity to submit testimony to the US-China Economic & Security Review Commission. I am Marnie LaVigne, \nDirector of Business Development for two New York State-funded, university- based economic development \nprograms at the University at Buffalo (UB): one is the NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Life Sciences, \nand the other, which is also housed at the Center of Excellence, is the UB Center for Advanced Biomedical and \nBioengineering Technology, known as the UB CAT, which is funded by the New York State Foundation for Science, \nTechnology and Innovation.\n\nThese programs reside in the Buffalo Life Sciences Complex spawned through a $200M public-private partnership \ninvolving both state and federal funding that includes the University at Buffalo, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and \nHauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute. These are our region's premier research organizations that have \na rich history of yielding substantial inventions and discoveries. One example of our local inventions is the most \nwidely used test for prostate cancer called the PSA test. Another is the drug beta interferon, which ultimately \nbecame Avonex, the medication used to treat multiple sclerosis and that launched the biotech company, Biogen. In \nour largest life sciences sector, medical devices, the pacemaker was invented in Buffalo and became a major \nproduct offering of Medtronic.\n\n\n\nThese are terrific examples showing how research investments and institutional groundwork can lead to \nimprovements in health and quality of life, while spawning new businesses to create high-tech industry and jobs.\n\nUnfortunately for our region and all of NYS, the businesses that brought these inventions to market and created \nnew jobs were not in NYS. This taught us that we in our region are missing something to build our high-tech \neconomy.\n\nThe entire United States should learn from these lessons as well, as we seek to compete in a global economy, \nparticularly in high-tech sectors. Two key lessons are first and foremost that we need to assemble the full \ncomplement of strategically aligned resources vs. operating through multiple silos and second, that we need to \ninvest in operational elements for business growth vs. strictly capital infrastructure.\n\nTo build a high-tech economy in industries like life sciences, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing, \nrequires a combination of a) technology innovation, b) capital or funding, and c) workforce. The process of growing \nhigh-tech industry, revenues, and jobs is dependent upon a robust pipeline that facilitates innovation development \nand movement from the point of discovery and invention to the marketplace, through a process dependent upon \nboth capital and workforce.\n\nInvestments in our Center of Excellence and Buffalo Life Sciences Complex are going far to improve our \ninfrastructure and hard assets, such as cutting edge equipment, to be able to drive technology innovation. In \naddition, 126 new federal and state initiatives funding research are yielding more grants for research programs. \nThis means we can keep inventing more. But what of the other resources needed to develop the high-tech \neconomy, especially in regions like Upstate New York where it is not happening naturally despite the extensive \nresearch funding? In fact, we need to coordinate the full set of resources to move these inventions from the lab to \nthe marketplace.\n\nLet's call these business development and technology commercialization resources. Unfortunately, the \npublicprivate funding that created our Center of Excellence did not provide any such operational resources initially. \nWe were left having to gather what programs already existed to fulfill our mission of economic development side-\nbyside with translational research.\n\nThis story rings true across New York State. As you may know, New York is among the top states in this country \nwhen it comes to its higher education system comprising dozens of institutions turning out research talent, \nconducting innovative research, and finding new discoveries. At the same time, we have one of the poorest records \nof translating this world class research and development into investments, new products, businesses, and jobs in \nour State. In fact, if you look at venture capital funding new business in the US, in 2007, New York State only \ncaptured 4% of those dollars vs. California, which captured 47% of the venture capital investments. Furthermore, \nwithout a thriving economy to offer employment and business development opportunities, we continue to lose the \nbest and the brightest and fail to attract new high-tech industry constituents to our State. This same story might be \nsaid not just about NYS relative to other states in the US, but about the US relative to other countries around the \nglobe. We all hear about Silicon Valley and Boston's high-tech corridor, but what about the rest of the country? The \ngood news for our region is that we have made progress by coordinating literally dozens of organizations, \ncombining university- based resources and traditional economic development programs, each of which has very \nsmall pots of dollars. Through these collaborative efforts our region has managed to launch over 40 new life \nsciences companies since 2002 and create or retain over 5000 jobs in this sector between industry and academic \nsettings. Our work with dozens of life sciences firms over the past several years yielded over a 40:1 return on \ninvestment last year alone. The CAT program has shown a 20:1 return on investment across all regions and \ntechnology sectors in New York State since the new millennium, but it still only receives the same level of annual \nfunding since it was launched in 1983, despite its success.\n\nI understand that the goal of economic development programs is to grow the private sector jobs as the highest \npriority. Even with very limited public resources fueling the effort, I am pleased to say that our region now has \napproximately 140 life sciences firms and over 6000 private sector employees in these companies. However, given \n\n\n\nthe economic crisis we are in today, particularly in an already depressed region, we need to accelerate our efforts at \nbuilding the life sciences and other new economy industries. Better coordination of state and federal initiatives can \ngo far toward this goal.\n\nAs you have heard thus far, the Buffalo Niagara region has a broad life sciences industry ranging from medical \ndevices to diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, biomedical informatics, and research and development products and \nservices. A central part of my job is to connect industry and academia in order to move technologies from the \nresearch lab to the marketplace. A small group of us spend each day leveraging our university research and \ndevelopment assets with three targets in mind: 1) helping start new companies based on these technologies, 2) \ngrowing existing companies by helping them add new products and markets, and 3) attracting companies who want \nto locate where they can be in this hotbed of new technology development.\n\nWhere the efforts are struggling most is in strategically coordinating technology commercialization and business \ndevelopment resources and sufficiently funding such activities. Some states, like North Carolina, have made a \nsignificant, long term commitment to growing its biotechnology sector. At an international level, countries such as \nChina have seen the wisdom of applying significant and sustained resources toward this end through the kind of \nscience and industrial park environment embodied in bioBAY, for instance.\n\nBioBAY comprises a city-sized campus outside of Shanghai with more building and equipment than we in Buffalo \n127 Niagara can imagine, plus all the people power to drive ever-expanding numbers of institutions and companies \nto engage with them. Yet, in our world here, this facilitating resource bringing partners to the table, known as \nbusiness development, is typically embodied in a very small number of individuals spread among fragmented \norganizations with disconnected agendas and minimal high-tech industry familiarity or experience. Whereas at \nbioBAY, there is an entire business development department comprising dozens of high level individuals working \ntoward the same comprehensive set of goals.\n\nFortunately, private industry in the US and throughout the world already understands the critical nature of business \ndevelopment and related functions, such as marketing, and they are learning new ways of doing business in the \nglobal economy. Similarly, our government- supported initiatives must adapt to the new landscape of \ngovernmentacademia- industry partnerships. This adaptation requires people resources - a different kind of \nresource than has resided traditionally in our economic development, workforce development and academic \nresearch settings.\n\nFurthermore, this is an investment in people vs. strictly buildings and other infrastructure.\n\nSimilarly, the supply chain in high-tech industries like life sciences requires a virtual network of organizations that \nare global, where even research and development alone may need to be done in multiple locations, not to mention \nmanufacturing, marketing and distribution on a global basis. Our life sciences companies have to embrace \nglobalization to be successful, while being savvy about how to create a win-win arrangement across international \nboundaries. Again, this is where business development plays a significant role and publicly-funded resources can \nassist our growing companies. China clearly understands this new model of doing business, where in the US we \nstill expect traditional economic development, such as one-shot trade missions, to be the answer.\n\nIn addition to people resources who respond to this new business climate, bioBAY has capital to support companies \nin talent acquisition and other growth activities via grants, loans and equity-based programs. One could argue that \nChina's government infrastructure supports the organization of these resources in ways not possible in the United \nStates. At the same time, as I mentioned previously, our private sector in the US has decided on its own where to \nput its investments in new business, as in 2007, where again, 47% of venture capital funding went to California, \n12% to Massachusetts, 5% to Texas, 4% to New York with even smaller percentages to the rest of the country. We \ncan assist in driving more of these dollars to whole array of innovation hubs throughout the US where there are \nstrategically- located private-public partnership initiatives. The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and its Life \nSciences Complex is just such a location, where a combination of business development talent and investment \ncapital for companies, supported at least in part with public dollars, would accelerate high-tech industry growth.\n\n\n\nAlthough our Center of Excellence is not formally defined as an incubator, we have a dozen private sector firms \nwho clearly are benefiting from the critical mass of translational research, start-up company activity and support \nresources offered on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. Similarly, incubators in our region set up through private \nand public funding should be brought into the fold through publicly-supported programs that promote science and \nindustrial park networks.\n\nDespite these clear opportunities to catalyze growth of high-tech businesses, our federal government is still mired in \ntrying to grant even the smallest support for our new economy. For example, recently our federal government was \nconsidering increasing its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants from 2.5% to 3.5% of the national \nresearch funding set aside, yet one of our budding life sciences entrepreneurs was just told that his funding will not \nbe forthcoming as this meager increase in SBIR funding was not passed. Conversely, it seems incongruous when \nwe contemplate the highly touted economic development through the Recovery Act only to realize that pouring \nhuge amounts of stimulus dollars into our existing silos for research, economic development and workforce \ndevelopment only serves to increase our spending with little promise of tangible, sustained results due to the lack \nof coordinated, strategic investment.\n\nIn fact, in our region, what might be called a fire hose of recovery act dollars has caused a suspension of strategic \ninvestment, only to yield a feeding frenzy on behalf of individual agenda items and a need for agencies to spend \nout the funds at a record pace. Once the stimulus dollars are gone, we are back to reduced budgets to try to \nsupport shelved high-tech strategic initiatives, where any exist at all. By way of example, in Buffalo Niagara state \nworkforce 128 development funding has supported life sciences and advanced manufacturing programs for the past \ntwo years of $500,000 per year. The stimulus initiative is yielding literally millions of additional dollars to be spent in \nless than 24 months, which requires a practical approach of having to direct the funds into existing programs, very \nfew of which address building high-tech industry talent.\n\nThe preferential focus of stimulus funding for green technology jobs and industry to the detriment other high-tech \ndevelopment opportunities critical to regions like ours who have attempted to foster these sectors is even more \nperplexing. Buffalo Niagara, like so many other regions, does not have programming in place that is linked with \nexisting or projected job opportunities in the green technology sector. To date, there has been little analysis and \nstrategic planning in our region to develop a coordinated approach to grow the energy and green tech sectors other \nthan through traditional business attraction strategies, with neglect of growing existing companies and launching \nnew businesses by capitalizing on technological advances in our institutions and industry.\n\nThe solution to gaining ground in building our new economy is to stay focused on our target high-tech sectors, such \nas life sciences in our region. With this focus, the task is to create a pipeline of translational research, technology \ncommercialization and economic development initiatives that combine the most successful elements of traditional \neconomic and workforce development programs with university-based technology development and \ncommercialization programs. More specifically, our state and federal government needs to be the catalyst to \nengage the private sector in this partnership effort via programs designed to: \u2022 Incentivize and fund projects, \nincluding translational research and technology commercialization, that involve multi-organizational coordination \nwhere clear-cut economic impact in the private sector is delineated; private sector involvement in such projects \nmust be a requirement at the application phase.\n\n\u2022 Increase technology commercialization funding to include more than just capital expenses; including funding for \noperations that mirror best practices in industry engaged in a global, high-tech, multi-organizational, interdisciplinary \nenvironment is a good model to follow.\n\n\u2022 Develop programs that involve multi-year funding for research and industry growth, leveraging industry and \nscience parks where appropriate, that require participation of state-level programs working in combination with \nfederal support.\n\n\u2022 Create investment capital programs that engage both the angel investor and venture capitalist in supporting the \nlaunch of our new economy beyond the few currently active areas such as Silicon Valley and Boston.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Deploy funding initiatives through a combination of community- and university-based economic development \nprograms that engage a new type of industry-savvy talent than traditionally seen in these settings.\n\nThe new economy in our region and in so many areas throughout the US is in its infancy, and like an infant, it \ncannot be starved or fed sporadically in its early days and expected to thrive down the road. The promise of a \nrobust high-tech economy deserves the proper kind of upbringing catalyzed by strategically-aligned public \ninvestments that break down the existing silos and engage the private sector in ways that are anything but business \nas usual.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you, Dr. LaVigne.\n\nMr. Patton, thank you for being here.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. EDWARD PATTON DIRECTOR OF SALES AND MARKETING, ROCHESTER \nPRECISION OPTICS, WEST HENRIETTA, NEW YORK 129 MR. PATTON: Thanks. I actually am speaking on \nbehalf of not only my thoughts and my experiences in the photonics industry, 30 years, past business, 90 percent \nof the jobs moved to China, but also my colleagues within the photonics cluster here in New York.\n\nJust a little bit on optics itself. Optics have a pervasive impact on our daily lives, but the impact is rarely noticeable \nbecause the products of optical technology are ironically often invisible and because we accommodate so swiftly to \nmodern technology.\n\nToday, we pay little attention to the infrared remote control, LCD TVs, laser printers, as we do to the mirrors that \nhave been with us since antiquity.\n\nBesides the products we use daily, optics is an enabling technology. If it weren't for progress in UV optics and UV \nlasers, Moore's Law and the dramatic exponential growth could not have happened.\n\nOptics also provides superiority in the defense world--night vision systems, long-range surveillance, missile \nguidance and aversion systems. One only needs to glance at a modern weapon system in the hands of our \nsoldiers. It has a thermal imaging sight, it has night vision, laser designators, and a plethora of optical devices to \nprotect our soldiers and provide superiority over the enemy of today.\n\nIn the Rochester area, across the country, there are several regions that have a strong base in the photonics or \noptics industry, and upstate New York is among the most prominent.\n\nThe domestic optics industry began in Rochester as early as 1880 when Bausch & Lomb and Eastman Kodak \nbegan manufacturing camera lenses. Industry growth increased so that by the early 1900s, Rochester became \nhome to over ten of the largest camera and optics manufacturers in the world.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Kodak's \"Hawkeye\" facility was the largest optics facility in the world. Today, the majority \nof those jobs are in Asia.\n\nThere are over 60 leading optical and photonic companies in Rochester alone, along with 18 outstanding colleges \nand universities. This includes RIT, University of Rochester's Institute of Optics, which is a multimillion dollar \nresearch engine based at the University of Rochester.\n\nSince its creation, the Institute of Optics has granted more than 2,500 degrees in the field of optics, approximately \nhalf of all the degrees awarded in optics in the United States.\n\nAs I speak today, there are over 200 executives of the New York photonics cluster getting together for a golf \nfundraising activity which last year raised $16,000 for the Children's Hospital at Strong Memorial. The New York \nphotonics cluster is the largest and most active photonics cluster in the country, and it is a vital resource to the \neconomic growth for our local, state and federal governments.\n\n\n\nWe wish the Commission had held its hearing in Rochester this past May when over 1,700 representatives from \nevery company and every country concerned with optical fabrication traveled to Rochester. Optifab is an optical \nfabrication conference that is held here every other year.\n\n130 The New York photonics cluster has been competing with governments that pour many millions of dollars into \npromoting their optics, photonics and imaging industries. We have been competing on a shoestring budget of less \nthan $250,000 per year, two-thirds of it provided by industry. This year the New York State Senate eliminated the \nstate's contribution to our efforts.\n\nNew York photonics is also part of the Emerging Industry Alliance of New York State. The Emerging Industry \nAlliance authored the legislation for Qualified Emerging Technology Credit, a tax credit for sunrise industries in the \nNew York State.\n\nThe role of state government is to help the industry promote the industry.\n\nThere is no way the state government could get better results for the same dollar than by supporting the Emerging \nIndustry Alliance, as they have for the past 15 years, until 2010 when the funding was cut.\n\nHow will this funding affect our promotional activities? For example, at Photonics West in San Francisco, the largest \nannual conference in our industry, China, Germany, France, and Canada will be promoting their photonics \nindustries in gigantic footprint pavilions that are fully funded by their governments.\n\nGermany's pavilion, for example, will be two stories and over 4,000 square feet. New York State, which competes \nwith those nations by promoting New York as a vital center for this global industry, has chosen not to contribute to \nthe New York Pavilion in 2010. Simply put, we cannot compete without New York's participation.\n\nAnother question that was asked of us prior to convening of this panel was how can New York support the \ndevelopment of advanced technology industries that are geographically proximate to the universities? Simply put, \nthis already happens. What is missing is seed money. Every year panels are convened upon the promise that \nuniversities need to get more and more research dollars, and that this will result in economic development. Full \ntime lobbyists are employed to convince politicians that this is the future of economic development.\n\nAs an industry group, we have no problem with academics getting research dollars, but it needs to be \nacknowledged that successful companies know how to innovate. Perhaps some of the research dollars should be \nprovided to companies in the form of vouchers to find research partners among the New York State's universities.\n\nMore R&D dollars need to be invested in companies, not just universities, along with providing incentives and tax \ncredits for more commercial R&D to provide seed dollars to support early-stage emerging companies.\n\nYou know just another thing I heard a little bit earlier today, you know, talking about the IP and IP migrating out of \nthe U.S., and you know, the same thing, I think we talked about in New York. You know there's a lot of IP \ndeveloped here and where does it go? It leaves the state and leaves the country.\n\nYou asked about incubators. I've got a fairly good example of an incubator that worked. It was academic, industry, \nand government working together in the 131 Rochester optics industry. It was called the Center for Optics \nManufacturing, COM.\n\nIn 1999, the University of Rochester, Harvey Pollicove from Eastman Kodak, and the American Precision Optics \nManufacturers Association, along with a $4.8 million contract from the U.S. Army Materiel Command, created a \ncollaboration to develop advanced optical technology and equipment for U.S. optical manufacturers.\n\nCOM was chartered with meeting the needs of a faltering U.S. optics manufacturing industry that was losing ground \nto overseas manufacturers. Though the funding for this collaboration was relatively small, the development that \nsprang from it was great and impacted each one of us each day of our lives.\n\n\n\nThe MRF, or Magneto Rheological Finishing, technology developed through QED and COM, is used by all of the \nworld's top manufacturers of UV, ultraviolet, optics for semiconductor lithography systems. These systems enable \nthe semiconductor industry to achieve the decreasingly smaller and smaller line widths leading to the evolution of \nfaster computers and everything digital around us today.\n\nUnfortunately, at this point, the funding for COM has been eliminated and that entity no longer exists as an \nincubator for optics manufacturing.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Mr. Patton, we're going to have to finish up, but you have some very good \nrecommendations in your testimony. Why don't you mention a few of those and then we'll move on? MR. PATTON: \nThe five recommendations that we felt were really important: Craft a national vision-- HEARING COCHAIR \nMULLOY: Craft a vision.\n\nMR. PATTON: Craft a vision, really from the national point. I think it was said earlier on one of the panels, do we \nwant to pick the winners? Maybe we need to pick the winners. We haven't done that in the U.S., but maybe we \nneed to.\n\nCreate incentives for keeping IP developed in the U.S. to stay in the U.S.\n\nDr. Eugene Arthurs, the CEO of SPIE, who presented to the Commission earlier in the spring, he stated--in \ntestimony, he said: We need to select key manufacturing technologies and do what is needed to have world-leading \nplants in the U.S. The decades of work in the Department of Energy laboratories should lead to solar energy \nmanufacturing here and not the installation and maintenance of imported panels and the outflow of incentive dollars \nto support jobs elsewhere.\n\nWe also recommend that the federal and state funds continue to support the incubators, university and private \nsector research and the photonics clusters.\n\nWe recommend that the government and New York State invest more in this industry by providing expanded SBIR \nprograms, low-cost loans and/or grants to help private industry grow and compete globally.\n\nAnd finally, we strongly recommend that the federal government include a true \"Buy American Act\" clause in the \ngovernment's contracts that are awarded to 132 optical components and electro-optical assembly manufacturers.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. Edward Patton Director of Sales and Marketing, Rochester \nPrecision Optics, West Henrietta, New York Thank you to the commission for this opportunity to share some views \nfrom our local optics community. We believe that the Federal Government could be better aligned with industry and \nour state and local governments to put our tax dollars to more effective use and make sure that critical technology \nand jobs related to the photonics industry remain on shore. This is not only an economic issue, but a matter of \nNational Security.\n\nThe 20th Century was the century of the electron and now the 21st century is the century of the photon.\n\nExactly what comprises the optoelectronics or photonics industry? According to a paper written by the Committee \non Optical Science and Engineering, National Research Council in 1998, it is \"the field of science and engineering \nencompassing the physical phenomena and technologies associated with the generation, transmission, \nmanipulation, detection, and utilization of light. Optics have a pervasive impact on our daily lives, but that impact is \nrarely noticeable because the products of optical technology are, ironically, often invisible and because we \naccommodate so swiftly to modern technology. Today we pay little attention to the infrared remote control, LCD \nTV's and laser printers as to the mirrors that have been with us since antiquity.\" Besides the products we use daily, \noptics are an enabling technology. If it weren't for the progress in UV lasers and optics, Moore's Law and the \ndramatic exponential growth of the digital chip could not have happened. According to Washington DC based OIDA \n(Optoelectronics Industry Development Association) the global optoelectronics industry in 2008 was $356 billion. It \nseems the U.S. should be doing everything we can to strengthen this industry and generate and retain jobs.\n\n\n\nOptics is a critical technology that must remain strong in the US In 1996 the National Science Foundation and other \nUS agencies asked the Japanese Technology Evaluation Center (JTEC) to assess the current state of \noptoelectronics research, development, and manufacturing in Japan compared to that in the United States. It found \nthat while optoelectronics is regarded as important in the United States, this field has not achieved anywhere near \nthe visibility and significance that it has in Japan. The panel regarded this as a significant long- term problem for \nthe United States as it struggles to maintain its worldwide leadership in electronics technologies for the future. The \npanel concluded that in this respect, the Japanese have a much clearer understanding of the crucial role that \noptoelectronics technology plays in the development of future electronic and communication systems.\n\nIn the 20th century, large corporate research facilities such as Bell Labs, 3M and Eastman Kodak Company fueled \nthe creativity and research that birthed enabling technologies for government and commercial applications.\n\nInnovations such as solid state, integrated circuitry and MEMS devices gave rise to an endless supply of products \nthat find application in all areas of defense, medical, industrial, and commercial products. Yet now in the 21st \ncentury these corporate resources have mostly disappeared as companies focus more on short term profit and less \non long term goals. Executives under pressure to increase the company's stock value are constantly faced with \ndecisions of balancing the short and long term needs of the company, and it seems there are few enticements to \nsupport research and development efforts. This is where federal and state agencies can play a much more \nprominent role.\n\nThe U.S. should not rely on corporate America to unilaterally develop long range goals and policies that compete \nwith foreign governments. As long as businesses emphasize a short term focus on profits, it is clear that a long term \nvision must be crafted and implemented by the US government. We are not talking about government bailouts and \nintervention in the free market economy that serve as short term fixes to address the symptom rather than the \nsource 133 of the problem. We are suggesting that the government do more to incentivize business to invest in our \nfuture for the security of our country and the security of our families and their children. Government policy needs to \nfocus on promoting and protecting technological advancements in our nation.\n\nTechnological superiority in the global optics industry is critical to the defense and security of our nation as well as \nbeing a key enabler of existing and emerging commercial applications. Optics provide Defense with superior \nadvantage through night vision systems, long range surveillance, and missile guidance and aversion systems. One \nonly needs to glance at a modern weapon system in the hands of our soldiers. It has thermal imaging sights, night \nvision, laser designators, and a plethora of optical devices that protect our soldiers and provide superiority over the \nenemy of today.\n\nRochester is the epicenter of the optics community, both in academia and manufacturing Across the country there \nare several regions that have a strong base in the photonics or optics industry, and upstate New York is among the \nmost prominent. The domestic optics industry began in Rochester as early as 1880 when Bausch and Lomb and \nthe Eastman Kodak Company began making camera lenses.

The \nNew York Photonics Cluster is the largest and most active Photonics cluster in the country and is a vital resource to \neconomic growth for our local, state and federal governments.\n\n\n\nWe wish that The Commission held its hearings in Rochester this past May, when over 1,700 representatives from \nevery company and every country concerned with optical fabrication traveled to Rochester, NY for an optical \nfabrication conference that is held here every other year: Optifab.\n\nNew York Photonics, our industry cluster, has been competing with governments that pour many millions of dollars \ninto promoting their Optics, Photonics and Imaging industries. We have been competing on a shoestring budget of \nless than $250K per year, two thirds of it provided by industry.

The Emerging Industry \nAlliance authored the legislation for the Qualified Emerging Technology Credit, a tax credit for the sunrise industries \nin New York State.\n\nThe role of the State Government is to help the industry promote the industry. There is no way that New York State \ncould get better results for the same dollar than by supporting the Emerging Industry Alliance as they have for 15 \nyears -- until 2010 when funding was cut.\n\nHow will this funding cut affect our promotion efforts? For example: at Photonics West, the largest annual \nconference in our industry, China, Germany, France, and Canada will be promoting their OPI industries in gigantic \nfootprint pavilions that are fully funded by their governments. Germany's pavilion, for example, will be two- stories \nand over 4,000 square feet. New York State, which competes with those nations by promoting New York as a vital \ncenter for this global industry, has chosen not to contribute to the New York Pavilion in 2010. Simply put, we 134 \ncannot compete without New York's participation.\n\nAnother question that was asked of us prior to the convening of this panel was \"how can New York support the \ndevelopment of advanced technology industries that are geographically proximate to the university?\" Simply put: \nthis already happens. What is missing is seed money. Every year panels are convened upon the premise that \nuniversities need to get more and more research dollars and that this will result in economic development.

More R&D dollars need to be invested in companies, not just \nuniversities along with providing incentives and tax credits for more commercial R&D and provide seed dollars to \nsupport early-stage emerging companies.\n\nAdditionally New York State needs to be paying attention to how the I.P. paid for with New York dollars is \nlicensed/transferred, and where the products created from that I.P. are then manufactured. New York State has \nfunded research enabling new products that are now being manufactured in other countries. Surely this is counter \nto the goals of New York's investment in sunrise technologies.\n\nIncubators - Rochester industry/academia and government support A good example of academia, industry and \ngovernment working together in the Rochester optics industry is COM (Center for Optics Manufacturing). In 1999 \nThe University of Rochester, Harvey Pollicove from Eastman Kodak, and the American Precision Optics \nManufacturers Association with a $4.8million contract from the US Army Material Command created a collaboration \nto develop advanced optical technology and equipment for US optical manufacturers. COM was chartered with \nmeeting the needs of a faltering US optics manufacturing industry that was losing ground to overseas \nmanufacturers and in decline for a decade. Two companies which are world known and compete globally were born \nfrom this collaboration. QED based in Rochester developed a technology known as MRF (Magneto Rheological \nFinishing) which is used to produce the world's most accurate optical surfaces and Optipro Systems, which is \nsynonymous with world-leading computer controlled machine tools and equipment for deterministic fabrication of \nprecision optics. Though the funding for this collaboration was relatively small the development that sprang from it \nwas great and impacted every one of us every day of our lives. The MRF technology developed through QED and \n\n\n\nCOM is used by all of the world's top manufactures of UV (ultraviolet) optics for semiconductor lithography systems. \nThese systems enabled the semiconductor industry to achieve decreasingly smaller and smaller line widths leading \nto the evolution of faster computers and everything digital around us today. Unfortunately, at this point, the funding \nfor COM has been eliminated and that entity no longer exists as an incubator for optics manufacturing.\n\nConclusions: 1. Craft a National Vision The United States must craft a clearly defined, long-term vision for the \ndirection of research and more importantly put more emphasis on development.\n\n2. Create Incentives for keeping IP developed in the US to stay in the US As Dr. Eugene Arthurs (CEO, SPIE) \nstated in testimony to this commission, \"We need to select key manufacturing technologies and do what is needed \nto have world leading \"plants\" in the U.S. The decades of work in the DOE laboratories should lead to solar energy \nmanufacturing here and not the installation and maintenance of imported panels and the outflow of incentive dollars \nto support jobs elsewhere\".\n\n3. We recommend that Federal and State funds continue to support the Incubators, University and Private Sector \nResearch and the Photonic clusters.\n\n135 4. We recommend that the Federal Government and NYS invest more in this industry by providing expanded \nSBIR programs, low-cost loans and/or grants/ to help private industry grow and compete globally.\n\n5. We strongly recommend that the Federal Government include a true \"Buy American Act\" clause in the \ngovernment contracts that they are awarding for optical components and electro-optical assemblies.\n\nWithin the last couple of months the US Army made 2 contract awards for AN/PVS-14, Night Vision Goggle optical \nsubassemblies that totaled over $4.1M. The two companies that received these contracts are simply procuring the \noptics from offshore sources in Singapore and Japan. It is shameful that our tax dollars continue to be used to \ncreate jobs in foreign countries, especially during these difficult economic times.\n\nUS policymakers need to do a better job of providing government agencies and industry with direction and the \nfunding that is necessary to foster innovation and keep critical technologies and jobs within the borders of the \nUnited States.\n\nThank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you. I want to let you know that Commissioner Shea--that NPR is doing a \nradio show on this hearing-- their local affiliate--so he's down there doing that. He didn't mean to be impolite to this \ngroup.\n\nMR. PATTON: No problem. I didn't know.\n\n[Laughter.] HEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Mr. Barons.\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF MR. CLIVE R. BARONS VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGY INTEGRATION, FUJI \nXEROX OPERATIONS, WEBSTER, NEW YORK MR. BARONS: Thank you, members of the Commission, for \nallowing me the opportunity to testify today on the challenges to our country and this region from the perspective of \nXerox Corporation.\n\nActually I've been with Xerox for 37 years, which is 60 percent of my life and 50 percent of Xerox's life, in two \ndifferent countries.\n\nI will give you some background on Xerox first. Our 2008 revenue was $16.8 billion. Now, that actually excludes a \nlarge amount of revenue which isn't counted because Asia-Pacific is managed by a minority joint venture, Fuji \nXerox, where we own 25 percent equity. So the revenue is not consolidated.\n\n\n\nSo essentially we're $25 billion company, which is head-to-head with two other major players in the industry, one \nJapanese and one U.S. company, with two letters. And all our major competition is either U.S. or Japanese-based, \na few smaller European players, and some emerging Korean players. We have no direct competitors in our industry \nfrom China.\n\nXerox's main interest in China at the moment is, in fact, the source of low- 136 cost components. We have been \nvery successful with that and saved in times up to 40 percent of the product cost by moving components over to \nChina.\n\nThose are often the lower technology type of components, but we do see a significant long-term threat from China, \nand there's an old adage in outsourcing in that first you move the low-tech, simple jobs; secondly, you move the \nsupply base to be with the assembly jobs; then, you begin to move the technology; and then you've lost the \nbusiness.\n\nSo although we don't have any direct competitors at the moment from China, it's always possible, they could \neventually move into that. As I think Japan took on the U.S., and Europe and Korea is now taking on Japan, China \nmay come next.\n\nLocally, Xerox has a long proud history in upstate New York. It's been our headquarters from the operational side, \nalthough our headquarters from corporate governance was in Stamford, Connecticut, Norwalk now. 65 percent of \nour R&D resources are based in Monroe County. We employ 7,000 people. We spend $6 billion a year locally in \nwages and salaries and with taxes and with local suppliers.\n\nOur core global operations are also based here: research, technology, product development, still some \nmanufacturing, and global procurement operations.\n\nWe also have the North American sales, services and marketing organizations--and a lot has been said today on \nthe environmental side--and our environmental health and safety group is based in Webster, New York here.\n\nWe believe we're a good member of the local community from an educational, social and service perspective. We \ncontribute both in money and time.\n\nFor example, United Way: we contribute $2 million annually, and half of that is from the company and half of that is \nby private employee donations. And we've given $2 million to RIT in funding, $1.8 million to MCC, $1 million to \nUniversity of Rochester, and to many other educational establishments.\n\nThe reason we do this is because we depend on local universities for welleducated and technically advanced \nworkforce, and in talking to Mr. Patton just before we came on, I learned he was from Florida, and what we learned \nsome time ago is that because of the unusual weather conditions in Rochester-- [Laughter.] MR. BARONS: --if we \nhire graduates straight out of Arizona or Florida, they don't always stay once they get through a winter.\n\nWe're a technology-led company. I believe there's three sources of wealth creation: physical resource; natural \nresource; and intellectual property. We're an intellectual property company, and half the 609 patents we were \nawarded last year originated in Monroe County.\n\nSo we need to sustain this innovation engine, and we find links with the local communities like RIT very, very helpful \nin doing that. And it's not just at the university and college levels. We also have our employees volunteer their time \nat the school levels.\n\n137 At the high school level, we support the FIRST program and National Geographic competitions. At middle \nschool, there's a sort of a smaller version of that called FIRST LEGO, which gives school children in middle school \nan early exposure to engineering, and in elementary schools, we have the Xerox Science Consultant program, \nwhich has been running since 1968. I think we've had 700 students we've trained in that program.\n\n\n\nLet me turn from our local community to a global business perspective. As I said, last year, we were $16.8 billion \nrevenue. We announced our results this morning for the second quarter; our revenue was $3.7 billion, down 18 \npercent year over year. Fortunately, our net income was about four percent better than expected so last time I \nlooked the stock was up 50 cents. That's good news.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: 50 cents? MR. BARONS: But we are seeing the impact of the recession: GDP fell \nthe fourth quarter over the third quarter. U.S. and Europe, our largest two markets, were down six percent. Japan, \nKorea, Taiwan, Australia, where we indirectly support that through Fuji Xerox, was down double digits. Russia, for \nexample, was up one percent, but that compares to 7.7 percent growth in the prior quarter.\n\nSo we have had some tough decisions to make on jobs, salaries, benefits, even some educational sponsorships. \nBut we have maintained our commitment to engineering because we believe the future growth of Xerox will be a \nfunction of our R&D investments.\n\nSome of those investments are overseas, and a lot of commentators and economists have criticized U.S. \ncompanies for moving offshore and claim they cost U.S. jobs. But as Thomas Friedman said, \"The World is Flat.\" \nWe must utilize the best vendor base in the world to compete with our competitors. If they're going there and \nbringing in lower product costs, so must we.\n\nAgain, sourcing in China does have some risks. One of our major sources of revenue and income is toner sales, the \nblack powder that goes on the paper, and we see an attack on that core business through counterfeit, much of that \nemanating in China. So one of the things we look for is a marked improvement in the respect for intellectual \nproperty, particularly in China and Southeast Asia.\n\nAnd that risk will increase as China moves from its current state of development forward. When I went to China first \nabout ten or 12 years ago, onethird, I could see one-third of all the high rise cranes in the world outside my hotel \nwindow. China has developed from a low- cost simple assembly to a fairly competent electronics and component \nmanufacturing entity, if it continues on that growth path, there will be lots more competition other than just toner.\n\nI'm going to then switch quickly to another major aspect, trade, which we need to look at. We've been a truly global \ncompany. 45 to 50 years ago, Joe Wilson went over and formed Rank Xerox to cover Europe and Fuji Xerox to \ncover Asia-Pacific. So we fully understand the opportunity for growth overseas, and we really are supportive of \ntrade initiatives.\n\nWe would like to see the Trade Promotion Act/Fast Track renewed. We would like to see the FTAs implemented \nand new FTAs developed and conclude the 138 Doha Round.\n\nSo, in summary, Xerox is an innovation-based company. In 2006, we were awarded the National Medal of \nTechnology for recognition of 50 years' worth of innovation in our industry. I think America's, upstate New York, and \nXerox's opportunities are all aligned. We need to stay internationally engaged and competitive. We need a strong \neducation system working with industry to help us with that, and we need to stay focused on innovation.\n\nSo our need from government, from the Administration, both national and locally, is fourfold: We need continuous \nimprovement in education, especially in technology of the information and communications industry, and that must \nbe measured in relative global standards.\n\nAnd as someone who has just put three kids through New York schools, affordable would go well on that.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. BARONS: We need protection from IP infringement, most of which for Xerox is created here, \nupstate New York.\n\nWe want relief on taxes, employee benefits, which are spiraling out of control, to help the U.S. operations be more \nglobally competitive.\n\nAnd, as I said before, we need to implement the Free Trade Agreements and Doha Round.\n\n\n\nAnd, as Ursala Burns, our CEO, effective first of July, invoked David Kearns, a former CEO, who is a resident of \nRochester, the 20- year old statement, which is today as true as it was then, if not more so in the global economy. \nHe said: \"We're in a race with no finish line.\" So the survival of the fittest and the smartest is what we need to do.\n\nThank you.\n\n[The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Mr. Clive R. Barons Vice President, Strategy Integration, Fuji Xerox \nOperations, Webster, New York 139 Statement of Clive Barons Xerox Corporation Before the U.S.-CHINA \nECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION July 23rd, 2009 Mr. Chairman, members of the \nCommission, thank you for the opportunity to testify today and to discuss the major challenges our country and this \nregion face from the perspective of Xerox.\n\nWhile Xerox Corporation does not sell products or services directly in China - we access the Chinese market \nthrough a minority joint-venture (Fuji Xerox) - we do have a keen interest in the development of China as a market \nopportunity and a viable source of cost competitive components. However, we are also conscious of some longer \nterm competitive threats from Chinese based companies in the advanced technology field.\n\nThis is particularly relevant to Xerox which has a long and proud history in Upstate New York with 65% of our global \nR&D resources located in Monroe County.\n\nXerox in Rochester.\n\nConnecting with our Community.\n\nLet me begin with some background on Xerox's commitment to the region. Since our very beginning, Xerox has \ninvested in the greater Rochester community through jobs, real estate, conducting business with local vendors, and \nvolunteer and philanthropic support. Home to the largest population of Xerox people, Rochester is closely \nconnected to how Xerox operates around the globe. Xerox employs around 7,000 people in the Rochester area, \nrepresenting over 20% of all Xerox employees in the U.S. In Greater Rochester, Xerox annually spends: \u2022 Over \n$800 million in payroll \u2022 $4.5 million in property taxes \u2022 Over $500 million with local suppliers Additionally, over the \nlast five years, we have invested close to $100 million in new facilities and upgrades, including a state-of-the-art \nChemical Toner factory.\n\nOur Monroe County operations are core to our global business and include: \u2022 Product manufacturing assembly \u2022 \nToner manufacturing \u2022 Product technology and software development \u2022 Global Procurement 140 \u2022 The Xerox \nResearch Center in Webster and the headquarters of the Xerox Innovation Group \u2022 Gil Hatch Center for Customer \nInnovation \u2022 North American sales, services, and marketing \u2022 Our Corporate Environmental Health and Safety \norganization A local voice on issues that matter Twenty-six senior executives serve on 40 area boards, including \nthe University of Rochester, Monroe Community College, Rochester Institute of Technology, the Urban League, \nGreater Rochester Enterprise Foundation, YMCA, Rochester Business Alliance, Strong National Museum of Play, \nGarth Fagan Dance, and many more.\n\nGiving back Over the past 10 years, Xerox has invested over $25 million in Rochester-area educational, cultural, \nand community organizations and thousands of employee hours. Major investments include: \u2022 The Xerox \nFoundation provides $1 million each year to the United Way.\n\nXerox employees and retirees donate an additional $950,000. 1,600 Xerox employees participate in the annual \nUnited Way Day of Caring.\n\n\u2022 $2 million grant to Rochester Institute of Technology for the Golisano Center on Sustainability.\n\n\u2022 More than 75 Rochester residents and students have received education assistance through Xerox's Technical \nMinority Scholarship Program.\n\n\u2022 $1.8 million grant to Monroe Community College for scholarships and campus improvements.\n\n\n\n\u2022 $1 million grant to the University of Rochester for the Wilmot Cancer Center, in addition to $100,000 a year for the \nDavid T. Kearns Center on Diversity and $300,000 a year for undergraduate research programs.\n\n\u2022 Since Xerox started its Social Service Leave program in 1972, 98 Rochesterbased employees have taken paid \nleave to work full time for local community organizations such as Foodlink, Gilda's Club, LDA Life and Learning \nServices, and the Rochester Fire Department.\n\nNurturing the next generation of Xerox innovators Xerox depends heavily on local universities and colleges to \nprovide a well educated and technologically advanced workforce. We are a technology company that is fueled by \ninnovation. 55% of patents filed by Xerox originate from our Upstate New York R&D employees. These employees \nare at the center of our R&D. Sustaining this base from local educational establishments is good for the community \nand good for Xerox.\n\nXerox supports a number of educational programs in the Rochester community through direct funding and the gift of \nour people's volunteer time. Some examples include: 141 Xerox Science Consultant Program The Xerox Science \nConsultant Program (XSCP), which began way back in 1968, is one of the longest running business/education \npartnerships in the country. Xerox researchers, engineers, and scientists teach real-life science lessons to \nelementary school students, working in partnership with local school districts. The program also includes a \ncompetition that culminates in an event where the winners present their inventions -with market research, pricing \nplans, packaging, etc - to Xerox employees who then vote on the inventions and inventors with the most potential.\n\nAnnually, 80 Xerox science consultants teach 1,700 students from 24 schools.\n\n70,000 students have participated since the program began 40 years ago.\n\nFIRST Robotics and LEGO League The FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) \nrobotics program pairs Xerox engineers with teams of high school students to build robots that compete in regional \nand global competitions. A founding sponsor of FIRST, Xerox provides funding and volunteer support for four \nRochester teams as well as the Finger Lakes Regional FIRST competition held annually at RIT.\n\nMore than 700 Rochester-area students have participated on Xerox FIRST teams in the last 15 years.\n\nThe FIRST LEGO League program gives middle school students early exposure to engineering. Xerox sponsors \nfour Lego League teams in Rochester.\n\nWhere We Are Today As you know, the world's economy basically fell off a cliff last Fall. The 4th qtr GDP numbers \nfrom around the world are almost unprecedented in our lifetimes: \u2022 United States, our largest market was down \n6.2% \u2022 EU our second largest market fell 6% \u2022 Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Australia were all down by double digits \u2022 \nRussia was up 1.1% -- but this was down from 7% growth rate in 3rd quarter There hasn't been any place to hide. \nLike many companies, Xerox has had to make some tough decisions on jobs, salaries and benefits. But we have \nmaintained our commitment to innovation during these tough times.\n\nBut what is going to follow? GE CEO, Jeff Immelt recently said \"The basic engine of global growth for a long period \nof time -- maybe 25 years -- has been the U.S. consumer,\" ...\n\nNow, the U.S. consumer is finally going to have to save. As consumers around the world get more conservative, we \nthink that overall economic growth -- not just for a year or two but even post the recession -- may be slower,\" Xerox \nthinks we will see investment- led growth, rather than consumer-led growth. As a country, we are going to make \ninvestments in broadband deployment, in health IT, in rebuilding our infrastructure. The auto companies must invest \nin new kinds of cars, 142 GE wants to bring new energy sources onto the grid. We have plenty of needs - no \nshortage of needed investments - so the next period could be very good for our economy, but it is going to be \ndifferent from what we've come to expect. Growth will be slower; there will be some very difficult transitions, and \nslower income growth.\n\n\n\nIf we're moving towards an investment-led economy, we better make sure we make the investment in an education \nsystem that will provide the engineers, scientists and mathematicians to support that type of economy both \nnationally and regionally.\n\nImmelt also gave an indication of next steps: \"An American renewal must be built on technology. We must make a \nserious national commitment to improve our manufacturing infrastructure and increase exports. We need to dispel \nthe myth that American consumer spending can lead our recovery.\n\nInstead, we need to draw on 230 years of ingenuity to renew the country's dedication to innovation, new \ntechnologies and productivity ... Renewing American competitiveness will not be accomplished through \nprotectionism, but by rebuilding American technology, manufacturing and exports. To get back to making great \nthings, we should clearly strive for a manufacturing workforce that is growing.\" America must continue to engage \nwith the rest of the world if we are going to prosper. The global economy is a reality, and the current downturn isn't \ngoing to change that basic fact. According to the Treasury department, 57 million American workers are employed \nby firms that engage in international trade. Despite domestic political pressures, the case for expanding trade is \neven stronger during these hard times. Trade barriers slow commerce: removing barriers increases the flow of \ncommerce. At a time of a severe global downturn, governments need to work together to get commerce flowing. \nOur exports exceed $1.5 trillion per year - a 69% increase in ten years. We want that number to go up, not down - \nand that only happens with international engagement and negotiating away barriers to trade.\n\nAlthough the U.S. economy has slowed over the last two years, international trade has been an essential driver of \nwhat GDP growth we have experienced. Economists from the Federal Reserve calculate that without trade, GDP \nwould have declined during 2008. Trade is essential to the growth of not just the high-tech industry, but the U.S. \nand global economy as a whole.\n\nOver the last two decades, the global average applied tariff has fallen from 25 percent in 1987, to nine percent in \n2007.\n\nMeanwhile the volume of world trade has increased more than fivefold over the same period, from $2.5 trillion in \n1987 to $14.0 trillion in 2007. Trade has also steadily risen as a percentage of GDP, growing its role as an \nimportant component of economic growth, from 38 percent in 1980 to 54 percent in 2005. Continuing to reduce \nbarriers to trade and investment will be important to sustained and future economic growth.\n\n900,000 U.S. jobs in 2007 were supported by high-tech exports. In addition, many U.S. tech jobs are dependent on \nmultinationals headquartered in the U.S. 67 percent of U.S. high-tech manufacturing jobs, and 80 percent of U.S. \ntelecommunications and internet services jobs were generated by U.S. based multinationals in 2006. These \ncompanies' investment and expansion abroad sustains job creation at home.\n\n143 The Global Competition What make Xerox's contributions and commitments to the Rochester area possible are \nour successes in the global marketplace. Xerox, like most U.S. corporations has increasingly adopted global \ninvestment, marketing and sourcing strategies. According a recent study by the Business Roundtable, over the past \n40 years, exports by U.S. corporations have doubled as a share of the size of the total economy, and the share of \nworldwide profits of U.S. corporations attributable to foreign earnings has nearly tripled. Among the largest \ncorporations, the share of worldwide profits attributable to foreign earnings is even greater. In 2005, of U.S. \ncompanies in the Standard & Poor's 500 reporting foreign earnings, more than 40 percent of worldwide income was \nearned outside the United States.\n\nUntil early 2007, U.S. trade has been expanding and, with it, U.S. employment. An economic study conducted for \nthe Business Roundtable found that more than 31 million U.S. jobs depended on trade in 2004. The analysis was \nthe first estimate of the number of U.S. jobs, both nationally that depend on U.S. exports and imports of both goods \nand services. The key findings of the study were: \u2022 Total net U.S. jobs dependent on U.S. trade exceeded 31 \nmillion. Nearly one in every five U.S. jobs was linked to exports and imports of goods and services.\n\n\u2022 Contrary to popular belief, the net impact of trade on the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has been positive.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Every U.S. state had realized net employment gains directly attributable to trade.\n\n\u2022 As U.S. trade -- both exports and imports -- has grown over the past decade, caused in part by trade liberalizing \ninternational agreements, so has the number of U.S. jobs tied to trade.\n\nIn 1992, a year prior to the implementation of a long string of multilateral and bilateral trade liberalizing agreements, \nnet total trade-related employment in the United States amounted to approximately 14 million jobs, one in ten U.S. \nworkers. By 2004 the comparable trade-related employment estimate had more than doubled, representing nearly \none in five U.S. workers.\n\nU.S. enterprises are sometimes criticized for making foreign investments on the grounds that such investments \ncome at the expense of the American economy and jobs. However as Tom Friedman said, \"The World is Flat\".\n\nThus, as our competitors utilize the global opportunities - such as China, India and SE Asia -- to improve their cost \nstructures, so must Xerox. We must do so to remain a key player in our industry and thereby sustain employment in \nUS. Xerox's sales in China are through our minority-owned joint-venture, Fuji Xerox, so our main use of China is for \ncomponent sourcing to support products designed and manufactured in Upstate New York. This ability to utilize the \nbest vendor base, anywhere in the world, assists our overall competitiveness.\n\n144 However, there are downsides. We do see a significant attack on our core business, especially on our post-\nsale toner business, through counterfeit products many of which have their origins in China. Thus, Xerox would like \nto see a marked improvement in respect for Intellectual Property from this region as China's development and \nmanufacturing infrastructure continues to become more sophisticated, especially in the area of advanced R&D \nrelated to the information and communications industry.\n\nVast Growth Opportunities As one of the first, truly global companies, Xerox understands how foreign demand for \nconsumer products and capital equipment can create extraordinary opportunities for U.S. companies. Ninety-five \npercent of the world's population lies outside the United States. The prosperity of emerging market economies \nrepresents significant potential for the sale of U.S. products and services. Today, almost 80 percent of the world's \npurchasing power is located in markets outside the United States. For the largest American companies included in \nthe S&P 500, sales by foreign subsidiaries had increased from 25 percent of total corporate sales in 1985 to nearly \n40 percent by 2005.\n\nBe There to Sell There Relying solely on exports to penetrate foreign markets often does not suffice.\n\nLocalized operations may be necessary to market products effectively, to cut transportation costs, to avoid tariff \nbarriers, and to meet local content requirements.\n\nServices, the industry in which 61 percent of U.S. foreign affiliates are classified, and a major growth area for Xerox, \noften cannot be exported and must be supplied locally.\n\nThe Race for International Competitiveness America's major international competitors are not standing still. We \ncannot afford to either. Every major trading nation in the world is actively negotiating free trade agreements, to \nensure that their businesses and workers can compete successfully in a global economy and to secure strategic \ncommercial, foreign policy and natural resource advantages. U.S. economic success demands that we continue to \nmatch the energy and urgency of other major traders. The alternative is an international economy where U.S. \nbusinesses and their workers compete at a disadvantage, and where the international economic landscape is \nshaped without the United States in a leadership role.\n\nTo keep the United States on pace with our international competitors, the Congress and Administration have \ncritical roles to play. TPA/Fast Track must be renewed based on an open and bipartisan discussion among the \nAdministration, the Congress and stakeholders. Free Trade Agreements that have already been negotiated need \nto be implemented in the coming year, and ongoing FTA negotiations and the Doha Round must be concluded on \ncommercially meaningful terms.\n\n\n\nOur Competitors Are Moving Forward, With or Without Us Approximately 300 FTAs have been negotiated globally \nwith over half coming since 2002. In the Asia Pacific alone, the number of FTAs has tripled over the past five 145 \nyears, from 57 in 2002 to 176 in October 2006. This activity is occurring across many countries - indeed, FTAs have \nbecome a regularized part of the international landscape, and every country in the world has entered into at least \none FTA. Today, more than 50 percent of world trade occurs through FTAs.\n\nConclusion Xerox is an innovation based company - in 2005 we were awarded the National Medal of Technology by \nthe President in recognition of over 50 years of innovation in marking, materials, electronics, communications, and \nsoftware that created the modern reprographics, digital printing, and print-on-demand industries.\n\nAs the upstate region looks to the future, our opportunities lie exactly where America's opportunities lie. We need to \nstay internationally engaged and competitive. We need to take advantage of this region's strong educational \nsystem, and encourage more students to go into math and sciences. We need to continue to focus on innovation.\n\nThe support we need is primarily fourfold: 1. Continuous improvement in the quality of education, especially in \ntechnologies related to information and communications industry, as measured in relative global standards 2. \nProtection from infringement or violation of our Intellectual Property, the majority of which is created in Upstate New \nYork 3. Relief on taxes and employee benefit costs to help make our US Operations more competitive globally 4. \nImplementation of Free Trade Agreement and resolution of Doha round Our new CEO, Ursula Burns, recently wrote \nto all Xerox employees and quoted a former Xerox CEO (and Rochester area resident) David Kearns. David was \nspeaking over twenty years ago, but what he said remains true. It is true not only for Xerox, but for this region and \nthe country as a whole: \"We are in a race with no finish line.\" 146 Panel IV: Discussion, Questions and Answers \nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you very much. I want to thank Xerox for having you testify or you coming \nbecause some of the other multinational companies that we wanted to testify did not want to do it. So we appreciate \nyou coming in and giving us that perspective.\n\nCommissioner Blumenthal.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: There's been a lot of debate about whether the world is flat or not today. Galileo, \nI thought he put that to rest.\n\n[Laughter.] COMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: But I have two questions: one for Mr.\n\nPatton and one for Mr. Barons.\n\nGiven your experience on the ground and in actually seeing some of the competition in China with respect to optics \nand lasers--and you do a lot of defense work on missile guidance systems and thermal imaging and these sorts of \nthings-- what do you see coming up in China that looks to be of similar quality that's worrying you in terms of \noutcompeting you, not just on price, but really on quality? MR. PATTON: Well, I think quality, I think they are still \nbehind in some of those fields. For instance, infrared detectors, the U.S. is many years ahead of China in what's \nbeen developed through government funding. The uncool detector- - I'm not sure how familiar you are with that--but \nthose are very important.\n\nNight vision, the tubes, and some of the basic components in night vision, I think we're still well ahead, but China \ndoes provide things that work. I mean everything works. It might not be quite as good. It might not have quite as \nhigh a performance, but it works.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Are there particular areas within the industry that they're cutting into your market \nshare? MR. PATTON: I think so. In the U.S., in the optics industry, I think if it wasn't for the defense industry, there \nwould be very little optics industry left.\n\nWhen I say optics, I'm saying, lenses, lens systems, and things like that.\n\n\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes. Is that the same in China or is there more-- MR. PATTON: Well, in China, \nthere are so many large plants that make optics. It's all done by hand, and there are 5,000 people sitting at desks \nand polishing things on little machines.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: What about the demand? Consumer demand? Is there more-- MR. PATTON: \nWell, the consumer demand is highest in China.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Yes.\n\nMR. PATTON: Because most of the optics that are produced go into consumer cameras, you know, et cetera, \nconsumer items.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: So there's more consumer demand in China than-- 147 MR. PATTON: Well, \nthere's more consumer products using optics made in China, Asia, Asia per se.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: I see. Mr. Barons, I also would like to thank you for testifying, and we do go back \nand forth a lot about multinationals and the role, and so just out of ignorance really, my question is can you give a \ngeneral explanation for the benefits and value that a company such as yours provides back here in the United \nStates? You say your have operations and production and manufacturing and research and development in-- MR. \nBARONS: That's in Monroe County, 7,000 people I think we-- COMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: 7,000 people-- \nMR. BARONS: I think probably about 25,000 nationally.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: And besides the employees, what other- - I mean your profits are kept here? \nCan you just give the general picture? MR. BARONS: Our profits are distributed to our shareholders, many of which \nare U.S. pension funds, private individuals, whatever. Some of the profits are reinvested. We're an American \ncompany. We do get about $225 million PBT from our investments in Fuji Xerox operations. So those are all \nrepatriated back to the U.S.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Would you be as profitable if you weren't operating in some of these other \nplaces? MR. BARONS: Well, we may be bankrupt if we weren't operating in other places.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Okay. Thank you. Again, my questions are from ignorance.\n\nMR. BARONS: No, I mean, David Kearns, whom I quoted already, for anyone who knows any history of Xerox, \nwent out to Japan in the '70s, in the late '70s, early '80s, when we were getting killed domestically. We were a \nmonopoly, and as soon as competition came in from Japan, we were just getting decimated, and we went out and \nfound that we had to become much more productive at home, but also globally competitive in what we do, and if \nthat meant sourcing offshore where it made sense to protect the rest of the jobs back home, that's what we had to \ndo.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: How would you compare the jobs that are back here in your company, back in \nthe United States, with the jobs around the world in terms of salary, lifestyle, benefits, that sort of thing? The idea \nbehind free trade was that better jobs would come back here? Are you seeing that sort of thing? MR. BARONS: \nWell, it's interesting. This is a sunrise R&D discussion, and as an old company, you could say our sunrise, our first \nsunrise was in the '60s, and we're going through a change where we're now moving away from physical hardware \nto software and services, and a lot of the software and services, jobs and technologies in the service industry have \nto be close to the customer.\n\nSo we are seeing some of that migration, and one way we look at it is the 148 older technologies we're moving over \nto China, Southeast Asia, things like that, and quite frankly, I think India is probably more of a threat to U.S. \nsoftware and service jobs than China.\n\nCOMMISSIONER BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you.\n\n\n\nMr. Patton, in your very first paragraph of your testimony, you hit a point that came up earlier, that is that there's a \ndivergence of interest that has happened in this country between the national interests, working people, country, \nand the multinational corporations.\n\nYou state--the system we have is focused on shareholder value-- you say we believe the federal government could \nbe better aligned with industry and our state and local governments, and then you also say that the photonics \nindustry, it's very important that it remain on shore here in the United States, and you say it's not only an economic \nissue; it's a national security issue.\n\nDo you see this divergence between the interest of the corporations, and if it's a national security issue, do you \nhave ideas on how we can bring them back into alignment? MR. PATTON: I think on the national security interests, \nthere are an awful lot of today's weapons systems that have optics on them, that are driven by optics, and as more \nand more of the jobs get displaced to China in the optics industry, and more and more of the businesses go away, \nwe're left with not much in new development, and there are new developments that happen in optics. They've been \naround for many hundreds of years, but there are new developments all the time in shapes and designs and things \nlike that.\n\nSo we lose that opportunity, and we lose that superiority that we have today. One of the reasons why we are so \nsuperior is because of the optics, because of night vision.\n\nWe own the night or we have owned the night, and so to lose that superiority and to lose the next step, wherever \nthat might be, wherever we go, to have the basis that we have to go buy the technology, it would be terrible.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Dr.. Nasr, do you have any comment on that question? DR. NASR: Well, I believe \nin the importance of manufacturing to national defense and economic security and national security. It is very \nimportant for us to have a strong manufacturing base to be able to supply our military with all the latest equipment \nand the guidance for our missiles and so on. So this is a clear area of importance to our national security and \neconomic security, as well.\n\nOne thing I would like to highlight is that the issue with China is that we are in a phase in the development of the \nChinese industrial infrastructure. If you take a look at examples of how they entered certain markets with their \nindustrial policy -- and I should mention it's a very well managed and financed industrial policy -- they go into \nphases. And many times those phases have tremendous impact on small and medium-sized companies in the U.S., \nwhich are basically the economic engine for us and the backbone of our industry here.\n\nI think the example that was mentioned earlier about the trade show, where 149 New York State does not have any \npresence while there are many other countries investing heavily in this area, basically shows the misalignment we \nhave in this area. But I can't emphasize enough the importance of our manufacturing sector to our national security \nand economic security.\n\nOur military uses a lot of equipment today that you cannot mandate has to be made in the U.S. because we \nwouldn't be able to supply all the equipment that is needed today.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Yes. As I understand it, when a major manufacturer moves, there are lot of guys \nthat supply the major manufacturers, and then they either have to move or they go out of business, right? DR. \nNASR: Right. I was in China not too long ago, and we were talking about some of the Chinese advisors to their \ngovernments in the industrial side and addressing some of the evolution of their development and their industrial \ninfrastructure.\n\nAnd one of the things that we talked about was machine tools. Machine tools are very difficult to get into that \nbusiness. It takes many, many years, especially when you go to precision machining like grinding and so on, and \nthey gave us some really interesting examples of how their approach is not to develop their industry in this area in \nan evolutionary way.\n\n\n\nThey went to Germany and bought some of those companies that were in financial trouble and, as a result, they \nhave state-of-the-art equipment manufacturers in this area that are very, very strong. And they brought all this \nequipment and the German experts to China to make sure that they do this technology transfer.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: If my colleagues will let me just ask one more question. Mr. Barons, I was reading \nBusiness Roundtable back in 1983. I think there was a guy named Reg Jones, General Electric, who was the head \nof Business Roundtable. He was the CEO of General Electric.\n\nAnd they gave their list of things that the corporations should be focused on, community, workers, and shareholder \nvalue was like number six on that list.\n\nAnd I think something has shifted here in the last 25 years, and you've been in the company for 35 years.\n\nAm I mistaken or has there been an emphasis on shareholder value above everything else that's crept into our \nculture in the last 25 years? MR. BARONS: Okay. I'm worried I'm going to go too much off script here.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. BARONS: Let me answer this question in a different way. The current CEO of General Motors was \nthe CFO. The prior three CEOs also came from treasury, accounting, and audit. And as you begin to wonder \nwhether companies lose focus of the customer and earning success from the quality of the product and the \ninnovation of the product and pleasing and delighting the customer, and I when I hear--again, I'm going way off, off \nthe reservation here--I think Xerox went on a path of increasing shareholder value through a stock buy- 150 back \nscheme where we started buying stock at 15. Today it's eight, $7.50. Sorry.\n\nSo when you hear companies buying back stock to increase shareholder value, you wonder if there's not a better \npurpose for that money such as R&D, acquisitions, market development, or whatever.\n\nSo, Commissioner Mulloy, I think I would agree to that statement, that I think the--actually, the Internet pressures \nwhere people are watching and daytrading the market, the expectations on the quarter, has caused many \ncompanies to act very, very tactically quarter-to- quarter, whereas, China, Japan, certainly, Southeast Asia, thinks \nlong term. As the Japanese took us on, the Koreans are taking the Japanese on; the Chinese will take everybody \nelse on eventually.\n\nAnd there is no way we can cut our costs to compete with China so we have to provide something of greater value, \nand I think that value comes from intellectual property. So long answer to your question. I don't know if-- DR. \nLaVIGNE: I might just jump in on that as well. After having been with two small companies who went public, \nnoticeable difference.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Once they go public? DR. LaVIGNE: Yes, absolutely. My advice to my current \nsmaller companies is to stay private as long as you can. In New York State, one of our key medical device \ncompanies, Welch Allyn, is about a half million dollars a year in top-line revenue, still--was family owned, kind of just \nshifted over slightly, but several thousand employees.\n\nI think that we need to look at what's driving our economy here and understand that the bigger companies who \nhave gone public and the smaller ones who decided to take that plunge, less so now as the economy is the way it \nis, but I can tell you that it definitely took us off our strategic plan, and for a young company you cannot afford to do \nthat. You just don't have the resources.\n\nSo I think that we as an overall economy need to understand how to focus on our small and medium companies, \nwho are driving so much of our economy, and also have a strategy for the larger companies who-- absolutely--that \nanalyst call every quarter is what you all live and die for, and when it comes to a point when even doing an \nacquisition can cause your stock value to go down, you know, people are sort of guessing at what the best strategy \nis from day to day.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR MULLOY: Thank you. That's a very helpful point.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Slane.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Mr. Patton, on March 24, we had hearings in Washington on why American high-tech \ncompanies are moving to China. And one of the industries that testified was the optoelectronics industry, and the \ntestimony from the trade association was that due to massive subsidies by the Chinese government, the entire \nindustry with the exception of some chip manufacturing plants has moved to China.\n\nAnd when we asked them about some of the incentives, they said to us what the Chinese had offered them was five \nyears of no income taxes after they started making a profit, and after that, the rate was at 15 percent, the rebate of \nthe 17 percent VAT tax on exports, and the most important thing was free R&D, which 151 they said in some \ncompanies, it's ten to hundreds of millions of dollars a year that they spend on R&D.\n\nAnd it seems to me that unless we are able to institute some kind of national strategy to deal with that, the \nsituation, at least in your industry, is almost hopeless. I mean can you talk about that? MR. PATTON: I don't think \nit's necessarily just our industry. I think it's all industries actually. Way back when, I was with a company--it was \nEG&G Optoelectronics; it's now PerkinElmer. And they had a company that they bought from GE in Pennsylvania. \nIt was probably the original high-power laser diodes that GE had developed. It was in Pennsylvania. Well, the \nincentives were in Canada to move it there so it moved to Canada.\n\nI'm not sure about the policies of the U.S. and the incentives that we give other countries to bring technology here. I \ndon't know if it exists, but I do know that certainly China is giving incentives for businesses to be there.\n\nI think it's also above and beyond that. I think in our case, and what I've seen on a smaller basis, is if you're not in \nChina, and there is a market there in China, then it's very hard to compete. There are markets for us in China, \nbecause of special kinds of things that we do, and if we're trying to sell it from the U.S., there's not as much interest \nthan if you had a facility in China.\n\nBut there are great incentives. There are great tax incentives and they have the free trade zones, and that was \nwhere we set up our facility. It's there.\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: I would just point out as, one of our former speakers was saying, he has a tie to this region, he \nwants to stay in this region, and I think we need to capitalize on that. Where we force an individual like that to go--I \nthink it was Mr. Vargovich--is when we do not coordinate our resources at all, and frankly that's what it looks like to \na lot of these companies.\n\nCompletely put together comprehensive package that is unbeatable versus 20 different organizations I have to go \nto and beg them to give me anything. And then I have to hope that I can actually put the resources to fulfill those \npromises. I think that's the choice we're putting in front of people.\n\nWe only have to improve this package a little bit to let them say it's worth me staying here in New York and in the \nUnited States.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: We constantly hear that you can't do business in China unless you're there, and maybe \nwhat we have to say to the Chinese is you can't do business here unless you're here.\n\nMR. PATTON: Good point.\n\nCOMMISSIONER SLANE: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Chairman Bartholomew.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thank you very much for very interesting testimony.\n\nFirst, Mr. Barons, that was a very interesting observation about the CEOs coming out of treasury and audit, which is \nnot out of strategic planning or product division or any of these things that we're identifying.\n\n\n\nSeveral years ago, I had dinner with the senior management of an American 152 manufacturing company, and I \nremember distinctly they were talking about what they create is shareholder value, and I said but you also create \nproduct. This is a manufacturing company; you create product. And they burst out laughing, and they said to me, \noh, you're so naive.\n\nAnd perhaps, perhaps this global economic crisis and the economic crisis we're facing here will give us the chance \nto press the reset button and start thinking about the longer-term health of some of the companies.\n\nYou all represent sectors that are a big proportion of what many experts say is the economic future of this country, \nand earlier today we heard from Ed Kowalewski, who is the Director of International Trade Programs for Empire \nState Development, and the issue came up about encouraging Chinese investment.\n\nThis is a slightly different direction than Mr. Slane was going. But when you link it with what Dr. Nasr said--I think it \nwas you who said--that the Chinese were buying German companies, German know-how, German technology, is \nthis a good idea to be encouraging Chinese investment in some of these sectors? Mr. Kowalewski specifically said \nthe Chinese investors are looking at knowledge-based industries such as solar energy, biotech and \npharmaceuticals.\n\nAre we going to find out that this is kind of a short-term infusion of capital into companies and sectors that end up \nbeing hollowed out? Can you speak to your own sector about that? DR. LaVIGNE: I'll comment that I do think \"the \nworld is flat,\" and we have to figure-- and our sector I think is a little different than some of the others-- so life \nsciences, first of all, for any of the Chinese- based companies to market anything here, they need to get through our \nregulatory system, and we have the opposite issue. So they have a lot of incentive to work with us, and I actually \nbelieve we need more talent to figure out the best win-win for everyone in that arrangement.\n\nSo they need us; we need them. I don't feel that taking their dollar is going to create a problem for us in the future. \nThey have markets we want to get into, and the reality is at the federal level, I would tell you that in terms of \nregulation of medical devices and other products like therapeutics, we need to have more of a relationship so that \nthey're not keeping us out of their markets as well as you're seeing in these other cases.\n\nI would argue that we have to start opening up, and particularly in biotech, because it is a virtual supply chain, no \nquestion about it, and it isn't just manufacturing, but we're actually seeing a lot of R&D taking off in China, and \nsome of it is very high quality, but they can't do it all, and they also seem to lack some of the relationships here that \nour feet on the street can provide.\n\nSo I would argue that we have to figure out a better way to work together than necessarily staying away from them.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Mr. Patton.\n\nMR. PATTON: I definitely agree. I think it is a small world today, and I think there are some things that can be done \nto protect ourselves. I think the protection of the IP, not sending out deliberately, you know, certain things like 153 \nthat that we should be doing, but as far as just free trade, and I think we need to figure the way out.\n\nWe're a creative civilization-- look at us, in the short period of time where we are today, and we're a very creative \npeople so I have no doubt we can find our way through it, but I think there are certain things that need to be looked \nat, and I hate to use the word, but regulated. And IP, I think, is one of those.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Dr. Nasr.\n\nDR. NASR: I'd add my observation. In the automotive industry, many of the medium-size companies that were \nactually seeking investment from Chinese counterparts ended up over time becoming a marketing arm for them \nhere in the U.S., and all the manufacturing operations that existed here are gone.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: It was branding. They wanted the brand.\n\n\n\nDR. NASR: It was entry to market and the know-how. We have significant examples of companies where we have \nseen that happen over time.\n\nSo the issue, I think, in terms of investment from China or any other country, is really how do we govern that and \nhow do we develop a policy or a long-term plan or guidelines to make sure that many of the small and medium-\nsized companies that actually enter this arrangement are also protected? Companies like GE, when they actually \nhave deals with China, face certain rules in terms of how much work has to be done in China, how many parts you \nshould get in China. The government requires them to transfer some know-how to some of their suppliers to make \nsure that they can do that in China. So I think many of our small and medium-sized companies, for example, when \nthey enter into this kind of arrangement, don't have anything to protect them, and we don't have the--well, the \nsensitive issue of an industrial policy always comes up when you discuss something like this.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Mr. Barons.\n\nMR. BARONS: I think you have to pick your battles. I was involved in Brazil in the '90s, and I used to call it \"Fortress \nBrazil\" because they had high import tariffs, local manufacturing requirements, and any country or company like \nthat to me is inherently uncompetitive and unsustainable.\n\nAbsolutely defense, things like that, are very, very important. I think we have to be very strategic about the \nindustries we look to protect. We had the same angst in the '80s when the Japanese were so strong and were \nbuying up the golf clubs and the studios and manufacturing and whatever, and that hasn't proved to be the end of \nAmerica.\n\nI believe that the Panama Canal is serviced and managed by a Chinese company, and if 14 percent of the world's \nGDP goes through that, and the Chinese have control over the locks, I would say that would be a little more \nworrying than them taking over the auto industry, which, in fact, is my history because I worked for British Leyland, \nand MG was finally bought out by a Chinese company.\n\nSo I think consumer goods, things like that, are certainly nonstrategic, but military, defense, logistics like the \nPanama Canal, absolutely, we should be very, very concerned about that.\n\n154 CHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: I'll ask the last questions. I apologize for missing part of your testimony.\n\nI just want to get back to this issue of short-term approach, corporate, the pressure on corporate management to \ntake the short-term approach. What can we do? What policy recommendations would you suggest to encourage \ncompanies to take more of a longer vision? Should we abolish the 10-Q and just have an annual report or a semi-\nannual report, or should we change the incentive structure for Wall Street analysts who watch these companies like \nhawks--the share price? Any ideas? DR. NASR: I can tell you my idea here. I think in my mind the government \ncannot change a lot of this structure that exists in industry. However, they can heavily influence it. And I would say \nthat the incentive for R&D, many, many other, many initiatives can happen from the government regarding support \nfor R&D, incentive for R&D, that happen within the company, as well as the government funding for R&D, and \nputting some of the caveats to ensure that a company is going to develop a long-term plan for compliance with \nsome of these requirements can help influence that.\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: I'm not sure if I can speak to the public company scenario, but the privately-held company, when we \nincentivize private investors, whether that's angels or VCs, to actually stay in for the long haul, so, in other words, \nyou create an investment fund that's public dollars, but if it's going to be used and matched, that has to be for a \nfive-year to seven-year to ten-year.\n\nRight now any of our young companies, while they're not publicly traded, they still have those investors who are \nknocking on their door saying I want out in 18 months or three years or whatever the case may be.\n\n\n\nSo we do know that we can create those programs, and there's a number of states who have effectively done that, \nand I feel that we need the federal government to help pressure the states to move in that direction. New York State \nhas actually been regressing, as many of you might surmise, over the past couple of years.\n\nOur economic development programs have actually gone back to more traditional silos, and we really have kind of \nlost focus on moving to the new economy, and there's a lot of verbiage around new economy, but the reality is \nthose programs are not happening.\n\nSo, right now, in New York State, the comptroller has been doing a sweep across the state, talking about common \nretirement funds, and how they're seeing a 30 percent IRR, which is terrific.\n\nThe group in Buffalo that's handled the funds has actually seen over 50 percent IRR so we're thrilled with that. But \nwe're saying move slightly earlier in the pipeline and incentivize our private sector folks to jump in next to you \nbecause now this Valley of Death, we can address this with private money and public money for a long haul.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Let me ask one final question. Tell me a 155 little bit about the tax and regulatory \nenvironment in New York State. Is it difficult? How would you rank it? You've traveled, you've been in other \nlocations in the United States? DR. LaVIGNE: Yes, clearly it is among the worst, and so you almost wonder how we \ncan manage to keep companies here, and that's why I tell you that this package--Mr. Vargovich, truly, there is \nsomething that keeps folks here. We do have talent; we have a lot of other pieces. But that is absolutely the worst \npiece of it.\n\nSo we certainly are on the most extreme end of the spectrum on both of those issues, and it is only getting worse, \nand so what ends up happening is our economic development programs end up being a way to counterbalance the \nexcessive taxation and regulation.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Okay. Do you want to add anything, Mr.\n\nBarons or Mr. Patton? You feel like you've been off the script too much today.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. BARONS: If we have the Empire State investment-- I've closed down a lot of factories which were \nput up for tax reasons. All right.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: I'm sorry? They were put up? MR. BARONS: They were put up for tax reasons.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: They were built for tax reasons? MR. BARONS: Yes, built for market access or tax \nreasons in India, in Brazil, or wherever. And you have to have the incentive--you can't bribe. You know an incentive \nis close to a bribe. So if you have to bribe people to go somewhere, there's something wrong.\n\nSo the best that we can do is to keep the talent base, the infrastructure, the resources here, and then take away the \nbarriers that suppress that, and I'd rather see lower taxes that bribes. Right. I'd like to see a more proactive \nbusiness environment.\n\nI went over to Ireland to set up a factory over there. The Irish Development Agency were unbelievable in terms of \nthe way they networked with the companies. I asked the head of Intel who just built a $5 billion facility why did you \ncome to Ireland, expecting the answer to be because it's 12.5 percent tax rate, and he said because when we came \nto build the facility, every place in the world had a deficit of critical skills, and Ireland was the only place that had the \ncritical skills.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: That's interesting.\n\nMR. BARONS: So if we can get the good things right and take away the bad things, we'll get it right. But we're \ncarrying a hell of a burden, as Dr. LaVigne says, in terms of regulation and taxes and benefits and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: I would almost toss out to you, as a New York State resident, I'm stymied at how to change any of \nthis. It's so clear that we have too many people who own these programs. The CAT program that I mentioned with \nthe 20-to-one return on economic impact, it was on the chopping block last December. So I spent three months \ndoing advocacy work.\n\n156 HEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Educational work.\n\nDR. LaVIGNE: Educational work. But my point is when I looked into it, it wasn't that people really understood the \nprogram. It was that we have so many layers here in New York State government and I, as a citizen, I honestly do \nnot know what to do about it, and I don't know if the federal government can assist us with that. But we're stuck.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: I don't think you'll see the federal government telling the state what to do on some \nof these things, but again, Mr.\n\nBarons, it's interesting. What you point out with the Ireland example is--and I think my colleagues who have been \non this get rid of taxes theme here--but having the trained workforce is something that's not sort of a traditional \nbottom line as you look at the corporate expenses or the corporate profits. And having that trained workforce is paid \nfor, the training is paid for by the taxes that people pay in this society.\n\nSo it's not simply that if you reduce the taxes, then the problems all go away because if you reduce the taxes, you \noften are losing the services that add up to these intangibles that are the reason that people are where they are.\n\nI mean I've heard several times just in the past day in Rochester that there's an incredible quality of life here, all of \nthe problems aside, which is an incentive for people to want to live in a community where they feel that there are \ncultural activities or a lot of interesting things going on. There are always those intangibles that go into it, and I \nwould just counsel my colleagues to remember that those intangibles are often paid for-- COMMISSIONER \nBLUMENTHAL: We're a bipartisan Commission.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: --by taxes.\n\n[Laughter.] MR. PATTON: Well, I moved, 20 years living in Florida to New York, you know, really moved a year ago. \nI commuted for a year. It's outrageous living here as far as the tax burden.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: And the weather.\n\nMR. PATTON: No, the weather was fine. I grew up in the Northeast--it was okay--but real estate taxes, et cetera. \nRochester is a great city. It has very well educated people. Everything is close. It's a wonderful thing. There's been \nBausch & Lomb, Xerox, Kodak. So you have all these people, cultural things, but creating jobs here, I mean it has \nto be difficult. I moved here, but I can't see a lot of other people moving.\n\nCHAIRMAN BARTHOLOMEW: Interesting. Thank you.\n\nHEARING COCHAIR SHEA: Thank you all for your time and the effort you put into preparing your testimony, and I \nofficially close the witness panels of the hearing, and in about five minutes, at four o'clock, we will accept any \nstatements from the public.\n\nThank you.\n"}
