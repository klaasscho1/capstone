{"title": "ELLIS ISLE WEB SITE SWAMPED", "body": "\nOn the very first day it opened to the public, a Web site that provides information on some 22 million immigrants \nwho came through Ellis Island was inundated yesterday with an average of 27,000 hits a second.\n\nDespite the overwhelming traffic, the site was expected to have successfully processed 8 million requests by \nmidnight, said a spokeswoman for the newly opened American Family Immigration History Center on Ellis Island.\n\n\"We felt we were absolutely prepared for the big traffic,\" said Peg Zitko, director of communications for the Statue of \nLiberty-Ellis Island Foundation, which runs the center and the Web site. \"We have a terabyte and a half of storage \nspace, and I'm told that's a lot.\"\n\nHowever, countless unlucky information seekers got this computer-generated message instead: \"Due to an \nextraordinary number of visitors, we must limit access to the site. Please keep trying, or check back later.\"\n\nThe new Web site, www.ellisislandrecords.org, contains the names of 22 million immigrants who arrived at the Port \nof New York between 1892 and 1924.\n\nIt also holds photographs of such documents as ship manifests listing immigrants' ages, ethnicities and hometowns, \nas well as artists' renderings of ships.\n\nThe site operates on 10 servers and can accommodate 100,000 users at a time, Zitko said. But the demand for \nfamily roots far exceeds the servers' capacity, and the site plans to add five more.\n\n\"After I tried at 8 in the morning and then a couple of more times until 8:30, I knew that I wasn't going to get in,\" said \nVirginia Cole, 39, a librarian in upstate Ithaca. \"I'm not surprised. I think it's enormous to be able to actually see the \noriginal documents on your computer screen.\"\n"}
