{"title": "The Overlooked Value of Immigrants", "body": "\nAs a child and grandchild of immigrants from Europe, I was disturbed by columnist Marc Fisher's description of a \n\"stampede\" of bills in the Virginia legislature that are targeting undocumented immigrants [Metro, Jan. 31].\n\nSetting aside the obvious irony, that all of the original settlers in the commonwealth were undocumented \nimmigrants, I wonder why folks don't understand the value of these low-paid workers, who help raise our crops, \nwork on chicken farms, pack seafood, build our roads and houses, and raise our children while their parents are at \nwork earning enough to help pay our overpriced mortgages.\n\nIf these low-wage workers depart, I see a future of more imported fruits, vegetables and canned goods because \nlocal farmers won't have the laborers they need to bring in their crops. We know that this is the worst possible way \nto supply our needs -- the petroleum reserves required to ship in foreign food are diminishing, and the amount of \npollution created so we can eat strawberries from Chile, for example, gives one pause.\n\nThese immigrant workers are our best resource at home: They pay taxes, buy cars and houses, rent apartments, \nand so on, contributing to our economy while enabling us to eat locally grown foods. Let legislators in Virginia and \nall over our nation think more carefully before jumping on the bandwagon to bar undocumented workers from \nbecoming citizens.\n\nAnd as for the resolution introduced by Sen. Ken Cuccinelli II (R-Fairfax), which would ask Congress to seek a \nchange to the 14th Amendment so that any child born in the United States would not be automatically a citizen? \nThat is shameful.\n\nCHRISTEL STEVENS\n\nUniversity Park\n"}
