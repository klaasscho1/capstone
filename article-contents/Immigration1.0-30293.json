{"title": "SHARRON ANGLE SAYS HARRY REID WANTS TO GIVE ILLEGALS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS", "body": "\nHarry Reid has voted \"to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally.\"\n\nSharron Angle on Tuesday, September 14th, 2010 in a campaign commercial\n\n* * *\n\nTHE RULING: BARELY TRUE\n\nWe've rated one claim in an ad by Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle as False. That was a \nclaim that Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid voted \"go give special tax breaks to illegal aliens.\"\n\nThe second charge in the ad is that Reid voted \"to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they \nwere here illegally.\"\n\nUntil a change in the law in 2007, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for \nSocial Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social \nSecurity number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine \nSocial Security number. As much as several billion dollars a year are typically collected from illegal immigrants by \nthe Social Security system.\n\nReid voted twice to uphold this system.\n\nDuring a Senate debate over immigration reform in 2006, Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to \nprevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security \nnumber -- a provision that would mostly if not entirely affect illegal aliens. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a \nmotion to table -- that is, to stop consideration of -- the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the \nchamber voted to table the amendment. Reid's was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling.\n\nThen, on July 19, 2007, Ensign tried again, proposing a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of \n2007. Under the rules in effect, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. Reid was one \nof the senators who voted against the amendment.\n\n\nSo the fact that Reid voted \"no\" twice provides support for Angle's claim. But it isn't foolproof.\n\nFirst, Reid also cast another vote on this issue that Angle's camp doesn't mention. On Oct. 23, 2007, during \nanother immigration bill debate, Ensign offered a similar amendment. This time, the Senate passed it by an \noverwhelming 92-2 vote. Reid was one of 92 senators to support the amendment.\n\nBut that's not all. We also see problems with the ad's explanation of what was being voted on. For one thing, the \nvote wouldn't have given current illegals Social Security benefits, as the ad implies. Instead, Reid's votes \naffected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal. For another, the vote was not about giving \nbenefits but rather on whether to change the calculation process so that former illegals could get credit for money \nthey had paid into the system years before, when they were illegal.\n\nWe consider these descriptions misleading, and in combination with the ad's decision to ignore Reid's contrary \nvote, we feel the this part of the statement deserves a rating of Barely True.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout this statement:\n\nPublished: Friday, September 17th, 2010 at 1:53 p.m.\n\nSubjects: Immigration, Message Machine, Social Security\n\nSources: Sharron Angle for Senate, \"Best Friend\" (television ad), Sept. 14, 2010; Sharron Angle for Senate, \nbackup information on \"Best Friend\" television ad, Sept. 14, 2010; Harry Reid for Senate, critique of Sharron \nAngle's \"Best Friend\" television ad, Sept. 15, 2010; Harry Reid for Senate, \"Sharron Angle's Immigration Ad: Pure \nUnsubstantiated Lies\" (news release), Sept. 15, 2010; U.S. Senate, roll call vote on the motion to table Ensign \namendment 3985, May 18, 2006; U.S. Senate, text of amendment 3985, May 18, 2006; U.S. Senate, roll call vote \non Ensign amendment 3352, Oct. 23, 2007; U.S. Senate, text of amendment 3352, Oct. 23, 2007; Text of 2006 \nimmigration bill; FactCheck.org, \"Republican Campaign Theme Debunked: Social Security for Illegal Immigrants,\" \nOct. 10, 2006; E-mail interview with Judith Gans, program manager for immigration policy at the Udall Center for \nStudies in Public Policy at the University of Arizona, Sep. 15, 2010; E-mail interview with Kevin Johnson, dean of \nthe law school at the University of California-Davis, Sep. 15, 2010; E-mail interview with Michelle Mittelstadt, \nspokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, Sept. 15, 2010; E-mail interview with Mark Krikorian, executive \ndirector of the Center for Immigration Studies, Sep. 15, 2010; E-mail interview with Jon Summers, spokesman for \nSen.
