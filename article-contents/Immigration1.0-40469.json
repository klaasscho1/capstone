{"title": "National identity cards won't stop illegal aliens", "body": "\nNATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS, a trial balloon floated recently by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, is a \nproposal that deserves early burial.\n\nIt's an impractical, extremist remedy for the problem of illegal immigration and is also an affront to privacy.\nCompulsory fingerprinting, which would be required, would provoke a response that would make the protest over \ngun control look tame. And finally, we've no real confidence that such cards could be made counterfeit-proof or \nwould stop illegal aliens.\n\nThe commission would do well to concentrate on more realistic reforms before its final report is released in \nSeptember. Overhauling the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service certainly warrants high priority. The INS \nfails to deport three out of four illegal aliens. And if the commission feels compelled to be provocative, it can \nsuggest that the White House cease using immigration and political asylum as foreign policy tools, which \ninconsistently welcome foreigners to and shun them from our shores.\n"}
