{"title": "A disregard for personal freedom", "body": "\nRegarding the June 18 front-page article \"Alabama law casts a long shadow\":Alabama has made it a crime for \nundocumented immigrants to purchase a home, pay a utility bill or sign a contract - the latest case of Republicans \nblatantly advocating for big-government measures whenever it advances their political agenda.\n\nWhether it is through ignorance or an impudent disregard for personal freedom, conservatives who claim to love \nliberty use their power to implement roadside checkpoints and to require drivers to provide their immigration status \nto authorities.\n\n If we believe in the American values of equality, the free market and liberty, we would agree that, in Alabama at \nleast, conservatives are the biggest threats to social and economic freedom.\n\nNatural rights are held by all, not just by those who carry around their identification papers. \n\nCarlos Alfaro, Washington\n\nThe writer is an executive board member of Students for Liberty.\n"}
