{"title": "Political Conditions United-Kingdom", "body": "\nIntroduction\n\nSince taking office in 1997, the Blair government  continued to propose legislation that is consistent with \"New \nLabour's\" doctrine of the \"Third Way.\" Generally, the \"Third Way\" is characterized as a policy outlook that is \nbusiness friendly, but still sensitive to social welfare and a goal of greater democratization in the United Kingdom. \nExamples include legislation that made monetary decisions by the Bank of England independent from government \ndecisions, various proposals for reforming British welfare programs, and different constitutional changes. These \nchanges are outlined in the \"Government\" section of this country review.\n\nAlso as noted in the \"Government\" section, the maximum parliamentary term for the House of Commons is five \nyears, but the prime minister may ask the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time. \nThis may occur after a government has lost an important vote, or if the government feels a new election is \nnecessary to increase or maintain its majority in Parliament.\n\nEarly in 2001, there was much speculation that Prime Minister Blair would call early parliamentary elections -- on \nMay 3 -- to coincide with previously scheduled local elections. The February outbreak and subsequent spread of \nfoot and mouth disease throughout the United Kingdom, however, caused the prime minister to delay both the local \nelections and calling parliamentary elections.\n\nFoot and mouth is known to be an extremely infectious viral disease that affects livestock such as cattle, goats, \nsheep, and swine. It can be readily transmitted from place to place on clothing, shoes, tires, etc., and can even be \nspread by airborne dust particles. While it is believed to not affect humans - and usually kills only very young or very \nold animals - it is commercially devastating to farmers. Animals infected with the disease put on less weight, \nproduce less milk, etc., and so become commercially unviable.\n\nSince the disease is so highly contagious, the United Kingdom government instituted a policy whereby animals \ninfected with the disease were culled - as were all other animals within the vicinity of those afflicted. By July 2001, \nthere had been about 1,800 confirmed cases of animals infected with foot and mouth, and approximately 3.5 million \nanimals had been culled. In an attempt to halt the spread of the disease, farms with - or near - infected animals \nwere quarantined; travel throughout the countryside was severely curtailed; procedures to disinfect travelers and \nvehicles were implemented; and the military was called in to assist with the disposal of the culled animals. The \nBritish agricultural sector suffered terrible losses - as did the tourism industry and businesses in rural settings, more \ngenerally.\n\n\nPrime Minister Blair delayed both the previously scheduled local elections and the call for parliamentary elections \nbecause the quarantines and travel restrictions would have made campaigning and voting in the countryside \ndifficult. In addition, the Labour Party did not want to seem uncaring in the face of the farmers' and other rural \nresidents' plight. Eventually, in early May -- when the foot and mouth crisis at last appeared to be coming under a \nsemblance of control -- Blair announced that both local and national elections would be held on June 7.\n\nElections of  2001\n\nIn the run-up to the parliamentary elections, Blair's Labour Party focused on further reforming public services, in \nparticular, education, health care, and transportation and other infrastructure. In contrast, the Conservatives (also \nknown as the Tories) ran a campaign based on \"keeping the pound,\" that is, keeping the United Kingdom out of the \nEuropean Union's Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nThe elections returned Blair's Labour government to power. With 40.8 percent of the vote, Labour took 413 seats \n(out of 659) in the House of Commons. Although a decrease from the party's showing in the 1997 elections (down \nfrom 43 percent and 419 seats), it was still a landslide victory over second-place finisher, the Conservative Party, \nwhich only managed 31.8 percent of the vote and 166 seats (up from 30.7 percent and 165 seats in 1997).\n\nThe Conservatives' loss was so crushing that party leader, William Hague, resigned in the aftermath of the election. \nThe battle for leadership of the Tories became a long, drawn-out debate over the future direction of the party lasting \nwell into the autumn.\n\nOne of the main points of contention was the Conservative Party's position on joining the European Union's \nEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU), and adopting the single European Union (EU) currency, the euro. As noted \nabove, the Conservatives campaigned against EMU membership, but key elements within the party, in particular, \ncertain financial and business interests, are increasingly pro-EMU. Finally, at the party conference in autumn 2001, \nIan Duncan Smith was chosen party leader.\n\nAlthough Ian Duncan Smith was much more opposed to EMU membership than some of the other potential \nConservative Party leaders - in particular, Kenneth Clarke, Duncan Smith's election should not necessarily be \nviewed as a decisive move on the part of the Conservative Party away from the euro. In fact, the party remained \nsplit over this issue; the internal divisions became deeper throughout 2002 when the reality of the euro -- as an \nactual currency -- hit home, both on the European continent and on the British Isles.\n\nIn contrast to the Conservative's election troubles, the other main opposition party, Charles Kennedy's Liberal \nDemocrats, fared quite well, capturing 52 seats with 18.3 percent of the vote (up from 46 seats and 16.8 percent in \n1997). Six other, largely regional, parties and an independent candidate shared the remaining 9.1 percent of the \nvote. The Scottish National Party (SNP) won five seats, down from its previous six. \"Playd Cymru\" (the Party of \nWales or PC) kept its four seats. David Trimble's more moderate Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost ground to the \nmore extremist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Ian Paisley. The UUP only managed six seats at Westminster \nthis time around, down from ten in the 1997 election. In contrast, the DUP won five seats, up from its previous two. \nThe United Kingdom Unionist Party (UKUP) lost its one seat. The moderate nationalist Social Democratic and \nLabour Party (SDLP) of John Hume kept its three seats in the House of Commons, while Gerry Adams' more \nradically nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in (SF) picked up two, for a total of four. These national election results were mirrored in \nthe local elections, with both the Democratic Unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in gaining at the expense of the Ulster Unionists \nand the Social Democrats.\n\n\n\nDespite Labour's strong showing, it was worth noting that voter turnout, at approximately 59 percent, was the \nlowest in a general election since 1918. In other words, more people failed to go to the polls than voted for Labour. \nThis lack of participation may have been the result of many factors, among them the opinion polls in the run-up to \nthe election indicating a commanding lead for Labour. Perhaps people simply did not bother to vote in a race that \nseemed to have a \"foregone conclusion.\" Labour's opponents, primarily the Conservatives, suggested that the \nlevel of citizen apathy was indicative of a lack of support for the Blair government and its policies.\n\nAfter the election, the Blair government promised to take seriously the \"mandate\" to reform public services. In \nkeeping with this pledge, the initial agenda submitted to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in June 2001 focused on \nimproving education, the National Health Service, the rail and road systems, the criminal justice system, and many \nother public services. (By tradition, the Queen delivers the opening speech to Parliament, known as the \"Queen's \nSpeech,\" although the cabinet government writes the text).\n\nPresumably for the purpose of better implementing the government's election pledges, Prime Minister Blair \nreshuffled his cabinet after the election. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott retained his post - while also taking on \nthe newly-created position of first secretary of state at the Cabinet Office. There, he was placed in charge of \ncoordinating the implementation of the government's election promises. In the aftermath of the foot and mouth \ndisease crisis, the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food was, in essence, taken over by a new ministry \n- Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. Former leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, assumed that \nportfolio. Perhaps the biggest change of all was the replacement of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook with former \nHome Secretary Jack Straw. Speculation about the cause of this particular change centered on disagreements over \nthe United Kingdom's relations with Europe between then Foreign Secretary Cook and the Chancellor of the \nExchequer, Gordon Brown. Cook was perceived to be more \"pro-Europe\" than Brown, especially with regard to \njoining the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Many view new Foreign Secretary Straw as more euro-\nskeptical than Cook.\n\nPolitics of the European Bloc\n\nAlthough Labour played down this issue in the run-up to the election, persuading a skeptical public of the benefits \nof joining the EMU has currently been one of the most difficult challenges facing the Blair government. Along with \nDenmark and Sweden, the United Kingdom was not (and still is not) a participating member of the EMU. The other \ntwelve EU states, however, do belong to the EMU. As of Jan. 1, 2002, euro banknotes and coins had become legal \ntender in the EMU countries. Within the next two months of 2002, these states' former currencies were phased out - \nleaving the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden the last EU members states to retain their national currencies.\n\nThe Blair government has stated a willingness to join the EMU and adopt the single European currency, the euro, \nprovided the United Kingdom's economy meets five economic tests. These tests, as laid out in October 1997 by \nChancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, were as follows:\n\n1. Are the United Kingdom's and the euro-zone's business cycles and economic structures compatible? That is, are \nthese business cycles largely moving in unison, or not? Are economic structures sufficiently similar that business \ncycles could be expected to move largely in tandem? Joining the EMU means that U.K. interest rates, as for the \nentire euro-zone, would be set by the European Central Bank. If the U.K. economy were largely in sync with the \nEMU members, then the loss of control over this monetary policy instrument would be less of a concern. If, \nhowever, the U.K. economy were to experience a downturn, the inability unilaterally to adjust interest rates could be \nhighly problematic.\n\n\n\n2. Is the United Kingdom's labor market flexible enough to absorb economic problems that might develop due to \nEMU membership?\n\n3.Would EMU membership increase investment (both foreign direct investment and investment by U.K. firms) in the \nUnited Kingdom?\n\n4. Would EMU membership positively or negatively affect \"the City\" (London), the center of the U.K.'s financial \nservices sector?\n\n5. How will EMU membership affect (un)employment in the U.K.?\n\nEarly in 2001, Prime Minister Blair promised that, if re-elected, the Labour government would assess these criteria \nwithin two years -- in essence, by a deadline of mid-2003. Provided that the United Kingdom's economy passed \nthese five tests, EMU membership would then be put to the British public in a national referendum. The Blair \ngovernment has repeatedly stated that the United Kingdom would only join the EMU if a majority of citizens vote in \nfavor.\n\nIn addition to the five domestic criteria for EMU membership and the national referendum, the United Kingdom \nwould have to meet the Maastricht Treaty's Growth and Stability Pact criteria. Those criteria, in brief, are as follows:\n\n1. U.K. government debt cannot exceed 60 percent of the state's GDP.\n\n2. The U.K. annual budget deficit cannot exceed three percent of GDP.\n\n3. U.K. inflation can only exceed that of the three lowest-inflation EMU members by 1.5 percent.\n\n4. The U.K. exchange rate must be stable for an agreed-upon period of time.\n\nUnfortunately for the Blair government, the pronounced drop in the value of the euro since its inception (over 15 \npercent against the pound and over 30 percent against the United States dollar) increased the already strong \nopposition to joining the EMU. Opinion polls consistently indicated that a majority of the British continued to be \nhighly skeptical, to say the least, about EMU membership. (Note: The rise in the value of the value of the euro \nagainst the United States dollar in 2002 and 2003, however, might well shift opinion in favor of EMU inclusion.)\n\nThroughout 2001, the Blair government, in particular, Chancellor Gordon Brown, continued to insist that the United \nKingdom would not put EMU membership to a national referendum prematurely, but as promised, the five economic \ntests of membership would be conducted by the aforementioned deadline of mid-2003. Such statements seemed \nlargely a response to the precipitous, post-election drop in the pound (around 15 percent against the euro) caused, \nmost probably, by financial markets' belief that the Blair government would push for an early referendum on EMU \nmembership. Since the pound was widely believed to be overvalued against the euro (perhaps by 10 to 20 percent), \nthe markets were anticipating a necessary, pre-EMU membership devaluation.\n\nThe Blair government's stance on EMU was part of a broader effort by the government to reverse Britain's isolation \nfrom European affairs, especially those in the European Union (EU). This effort has been impeded by the continuing \nsituation regarding \"mad cow disease.\" Although the EU lifted its 1996 ban on British beef in 1999, the French \ngovernment continued its ban based on the recommendation of its own Food Safety Agency. The French policy  \nstrengthened anti-European sentiment in the United Kingdom and led to the European Commission taking legal \naction against the French.\n\nDomestic Agenda\n\nOn the domestic front, despite dire predictions about the fate of the British pound and the effects of EMU \ninvolvement, in early 2002, the British housing market appeared to be in the midst of a boom period. Prices of \nhouses increased at an exponential annual rate and economists and financial pundits wonder if the British housing \nmarket was out of control.\n\n\n\nIssues surrounding the British monarchy featured prominently in the media in the first half of 2002. In February \n2002, Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, died at age 71, following a stroke and associated heart \nproblems. Her death was followed by the death of the Queen Mother in March 2002. The Queen Mother, who lived \nto the age of 101 years old, had grown increasingly frail in the years leading up to her passing away. In the \naftermath of her death, there were some inferences that she had accrued a substantial overdraft by the time she \ndied. In fact, her overdraft was quite modest in comparison with the millions of pounds that she was rumored to \nhave owed the bank. The summer of 2002 promised to be a more optimistic time for the reigning Queen Elizabeth II \nas she celebrated her Golden Jubilee -- 50 years on the British throne. Although periodic speculation abounds \nregarding the viability of the British monarchy in a post-colonial world, as was predicted, the Golden Jubilee shored \nup public support for this enduring institution.\n\nMeanwhile, by mid-June 2002, the Blair government had reportedly lost a great deal of public support. The \ndecrease appeared to be attributable to the ever-rising rate of crime, the perception that the Blair government was \nensconced in a game of political spin-doctoring in the media, and the associated view that the Blair government \ncould not be trusted. Whether or nor these perceptions will have long-term political effects, including an increase in \nsupport for conservative factions, is yet to be seen. A political scandal involving a friend of Cherie Blair, the wife of \nthe prime minister, did not help to rehabilitate a rather unfavorable view of Blair's government.\n\nGeopolitics and Global Security\n\nMeanwhile, following the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001, the government of the United \nKingdom pledged support for the global war on terrorism. The United Kingdom also contributed troops toward \nmilitary action in Afghanistan aimed at removing the ruling Taliban regime, which had sponsored terrorist activities \nby the al-Qaida group.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, as the war in Afghanistan continued and as concerns over terrorism remained in the public \npurview, European law enforcement agencies were given extensive -- and arguably, indiscriminate -- powers to \nmonitor telephone, internet and e-mail traffic. Detractors have condemned the measures as being some of the most \ndisturbing in a generation; they note that they jeopardize privacy rights in a substantial manner.\n\nAt the start of 2003, the world was bracing itself for the possibility of a war against Iraq. Blair stated his country \nwould not rush into such a war and that before embarking on any such action, the United Kingdom would seek \napproval from the United Nations.\n\nYet, the prime minister in January 2003 faced increasing scrutiny at home as people and parliamentarians \nwondered about military action when no conclusive evidence against Iraq had been found. As well, other European \ncountries, such as France and Germany, expressed great resistance to the notion of military action against Iraq, \nespecially as the weapons inspections process was ongoing.\n\nIn mid-January 2003, Prime Minister Blair asserted that he was committed to disarming Iraq via the United Nations. \nHe said he believed that the United Nations Security Council would back military action against Iraq if it \ncontravened against the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which requires the relinquishment of \nweapons of mass destruction. Blair, however, warned against unilateral voting by any Security Council member. In \nthe event of a veto, Blair reiterated the United Kingdom's right to take military action against Iraq if the country failed \nto give up its alleged weapons arsenal. By Jan. 20, 2003, up to 31, 000 British troops -- much more than initially \nexpected -- were deployed to the Gulf for a possible war with Iraq.\n\nInternally, the country faced its own turmoil. Also in January 2003, Prime Minister Blair expressed outrage over the \ndeath of a policeman who was killed during a terrorism investigation which centered on a discovery of the deadly \npoison ricin. Three North Africans were detained in a raid; one broke free and stabbed the policeman.\n\nShortly after the policeman's death, seven persons were detained in another terrorism-related raid at a mosque in \nnorth London. Those detained were believed to be tied to terrorist organizations and allegedly linked with the ricin \n\n\n\ndiscovery. Six of the seven detained men were North African and the seventh was reported to be east European. \nPolice authorities asserted that the mosque had been instrumental in both the recruitment of terrorists, as well as \nthe support of terrorism in the United Kingdom and abroad. Early investigations showed that some weapons and \ndocuments (passports, credit cards and identity cards) were found at the mosque. The significance of these items \nare not yet known.\n\nSheikh Abu Hamza, the cleric of the mosque that had been raided, insisted there was no terrorism connection to be \nfound. Hamza, however, was facing expulsion from this very mosque for polemical preaching. The Charity \nCommission was hoping to have him removed as the agent of the mosque's trust because of his political and \nvitriolic speeches.\n\nIn the wake of the unfortunate death of the British policeman mentioned above, Blair pledged in early 2003 to \nredouble his country's efforts in fighting militant groups and terrorism. Both groups of detainees were arrested \nunder the aegis of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000. As the year began, the United Kingdom was \nconducting a national operation to root out a network of Algerian militants. The United Kingdom's Home Secretary, \nDavid Blunkett, expressed complete support for such anti-terrorism efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for a prospective war against Iraq was emerging. As the United States and the United \nKingdom faced opposition from various key European states, such as France, Germany, Belgium and Russia, on \nusing military action against Iraq, they were hit with allegations of discredited intelligence. An intelligence report \nfrom the United Kingdom, which was also cited by United States Secretary of State Colin Powell to bolster his \nargument for military action against Iraq at a presentation to the United Nations, was criticized for gross plagiarism. \nA British academic recognized certain features in the report from an article in a journal called the Middle East \nReview of International Affairs. Further review showed that various excerpts from a thesis on the build-up to the \nGulf War in 1991 by a California doctoral student, Ibrahim al-Marashi, had been copied verbatim and used in the \nintelligence report. The thesis was later published in the journal identified by the British academic. Other excerpts \nfrom the intelligence report were plagiarized from Jane's Intelligence Review. All of the plagiarized material showed \nconsistent grammatical and stylistic errors, making it clearly apparent that the material had been copied directly and \nwithout editing.\n\nBritish government representatives brushed aside criticism of the plagiarized report by stating they had never \nclaimed the material to be original. They also maintained the view that the information was credible, regardless of \nits sources. Various critics, including some parliamentarians, however, observed that if the information came from \nopen sources, such as published articles and reviews, it could hardly be classified as intelligence in the first place. \nThey also questioned the credibility of the information, given the scandal surrounding its composition.\n\nOther problems have also arisen for the government in regard to the report. First, it appears that the information \ncited was ten years out of date and as such, it hardly represented the current scenario in the area of Iraq. Second, \nthe content itself in the original source had referenced \"opposition groups\" and not terrorists, yet in the plagiarized \nversion, which was used for the intelligence report, the term \"opposition groups\" was replaced with terrorists \ninstead. Both issues have been highly damaging to British intelligence, and by extension, to American intelligence \nsources as well. Moreover, they contributed to the argument that the \"proof\" about Iraq's weapons arsenal and \nconnections to al Qaida may well have been specious allegations. Indeed, some critics in the United Kingdom have \nsaid that the intelligence report demonstrated an attempt to \"mislead\" the public as to the justifications for a war \nagainst Iraq. British parliamentarian Glenda Jackson went so far as to say, \"And of course to mislead is a \nParliamentary euphemism for lying.\"\n\nA peace rally in London in Feb. 15, 2003, like many others held across the world, saw over a million people \ndemonstrate against a prospective war against Iraq. Tony Blair was faced with opposition within his own party and \nmass opposition among the people of the United Kingdom.\n\nOn March 17, 2003, United Kingdom Ambassador to the United Nations Jeremy Greenstock announced that the \ndiplomatic process in relation to Iraq had been concluded and that his country would withdraw its second draft \n\n\n\nresolution. Despite the unsuccessful effort by the Prime Minister Tony Blair to get a second resolution passed, the \nUnited Kingdom intended to pursue military action anyway, albeit under the aegis of the existing United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 1441, which warned of consequences in the event of Iraqi non-compliance. Although \nmany legal experts disagree as to whether or nor it is possible to preserve the legality of such action by relying on \nSecurity Resolution 1441, United Kingdom Attorney General Lord Goldsmith asserted that action against Iraq would \nbe legal, based on the protections of this existing resolution. Contrary opinions by legal experts and the United \nNations Secretary General Kofi Annan were not addressed by Lord Goldsmith.\n\nNevertheless, Blair faced a crisis within his own government as a consequence of his choices regarding Iraq. One \nof Blair's cabinet ministers, Clare Short, the Minister for International Development, announced that she would \nresign if the United Kingdom involved itself in a war without legitimate United Nations support. Saying that she could \nnot \"stay and defend the indefensible,\" Short explained that if there was no United Nations authority for military \naction, and if there were no provisions made for the reconstruction of Iraq, she would not uphold a breach of \ninternational law, and she would not condone the undermining of the United Nations (as stated in an interview with \nthe BBC). Short also noted that she was quite shocked at Prime Minister Tony Blair's \"recklessness\" in regard to \nIraq, and that despite the government's responsiveness to her concerns in private, she had seen no moderating \nshift in the current rush to war against Iraq.\n\nShort's announcement came as an unwelcome surprise to the rest of the government, and other Cabinet \nSecretaries criticized her untimely lack of discretion. Nevertheless, Member of Parliament, Andy Reed, also \nannounced that he was resigning as Parliamentary Aide to Environment Secretary, Margaret Beckett. Four other \nParliamentary Secretaries -- Members of Parliament who assist Cabinet Ministers -- announced that they would \nalso resign if military action was pursued without sanction from the United Nations. Earlier, Conservative Whip, \nJohn Randall, resigned after stating that the case had not yet been made for war. Robin Cook, the country's former \nForeign Secretary and Leader of the Commons issued the most significant resignation.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of parliamentarians were drafting amendments intended to express support for British troops, \nwhile challenging the moral authority of unsanctioned military action against Iraq.\n\nOnce British forces commenced fighting in Iraq, Blair reported to the British parliament that the war against Iraq was \ngoing according to plan. Still, he warned of \"difficult days ahead\" and predicted pockets of resistance in certain \nareas. In the early days of fighting, British troops had been killed and Blair expressed gratitude for their service. \nThree helicopters and a Royal Air Force Tornado had been lost in accidents. The Tornado may well have been shot \ndown in friendly fire by a United States Patriot missile. An investigation was pending in this regard. There were also \nseveral combat casualties.\n\nAs the war ensued, the political developments at home did not bode well for Prime Minister Blair. In a recent vote, \nseveral Members of Parliament from his own Labor Party voted against him in regard to Iraq. Although he did not \nimmediately face a threat to his leadership, the number of dissenting voices and the force of active opposition was \nsure to increase. Many Labor members who had either abstained from the vote on Iraq or agreed to go along with \nBlair's position for reasons of loyalty, promised that they would not take the path of least resistance again.\n\nWhile not experiencing the resounding support for the war as his counterpart in the United States, Blair received a \nspike in support just after the start of the war. That spike lessened as the war progressed and new polls showed \nthat the British public was reacting to inaccurate reporting about the fall of Basra, military casualties, and reports of \nIraqi resistance. (Source: Daily Telegraph poll taken on March 30, 2003)\n\nIn April 2003, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George Bush met for a \nsummit at Hillsborough Castle on the outskirts of Belfast in Northern Ireland. The summit focused on an \nadministrative agenda for a post-war Iraq. The leaders of both countries concurred on the basis of a three-part \nstrategy: (1) security and infrastructure control by the United States Pentagon; (2) a multi-ethnic Iraqi interim \nauthority; and (3) transition to full Iraqi autonomy. Nevertheless, the details of the plan were largely unspecified and \n\n\n\nofficials from both countries have issued contradictory statements about the role of the United Nations and other \ninternational bodies in a post-war Iraq. Middle East peace was also be on the agenda.\n\nA Matter of Peace \n\nThe summit was followed with peace process discussions that included Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the \nleaders of the three major Good Friday Agreement parties -- the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and the SDLP. The \ntalks aimed at restoring devolution and would prepare the political agenda for elections to the Northern Ireland \nAssembly in May. A large anti-war protest was expected with demonstrators coming from all across Ireland to \ndeliver their message to Blair and Bush of dismay regarding the controversial war in the Middle East.\n\nImpact of Iraq on Domestic Politics\n\nIn local elections held in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party \nsuffered its poorest showing since 1979. Labor garnered only 30 percent of the votes cast while the conservative \nTories garnered 34 percent themselves. While the Tories hardly commanded a victory, the real story of the election \nwas not the showing of the Tories, but that of Labour. Indeed, despite growing support for Prime Minister Blair \nduring the course of military action against Iraq, the war seems to have caused a backlash of sorts for the Labour \nparty.\n\nIn some predominantly Muslim constituencies -- usually a Labour stronghold -- people felt that their voices of \nprotest against the war went unheard. As such, these constituencies did not feel compelled to support Labour. \nSimilarly, in areas such as Bristol, where public services have been severely degraded, the usual Labour party \nsupporters did not feel compelled to show their approval for a party and a prime minister who (in their collective \nview) appeared to be more focused on international affairs than domestic concerns. For them, improving the lives \nof people in Basra did not seem to be quite as important as the improvement of the quality of life at home.\n\nCompounding matters was the fact that statistic showed that about 60 percent of people in the United Kingdom did \nnot believe that the war in Iraq would stave off terrorism. Instead, respondents and experts concluded that it has \nmade the United Kingdom more of a target than before. People also feared that no weapons of mass destruction \nwould be found -- the primary impetus for taking pre-emptive action in the first place. Should such weapons be \nfound in the future, the discovery would be helpful to Blair, and by extension, his party. In the meanwhile, people \nhave also been concerned that the war has damaged inter-European relations.\n\nThe convergence of all these factors were believed to have contributed to the abysmal showing of Labour in these \nlocal elections.\n\nPost-War Issues\n\nIn May 2003, following the cessation of military action in Iraq, United Kingdom International Development Minister, \nClare Short (mentioned above), resigned from the cabinet of the Prime Minister because of the United Nations' \nminor role in a post-war Iraq. In her resignation statement, Short blasted Blair for breaking promises and \nassurances about the role of the United Nations. Short also accused Blair of being unduly concerned about his \npolitical legacy and referred to his government as excessively controlled.  Some political insiders suggested that \nBlair had already intended to sack Short.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, the United Kingdom's coalition partner -- the United States -- presented a resolution to \nthe United Nations Security Council in regard to Iraq. The resolution would suspend sanctions; legalize the sale of \noil -- the revenues of which would be used for reconstruction purposes -- and transition the Iraqi \"oil-for-food\" \nprogram into the realm of United States control. The resolution would also ensure that products of Iraq and \nassociated proceeds would be immune from judicial and administrative challenges. The interests of any entities not \nassociated with the United States-led coalition in Iraq would be removed. The passage of the resolution would also \nfacilitate the eventual involvement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Although the United \n\n\n\nNations would be involved in appointing a coordinator to help with reconstruction efforts, this role would be nominal \nin its authority. Moreover, any role for United Nations weapons inspectors would be officially eliminated.\n\nThe resolution would retroactively convey international approval to the United States-led coalition's endeavors in \nIraq. The list of propositions exceeded the degree to which states opposing the war, such as France and Russia, \nhave been willing to compromise. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom -- the United States' main coalition partner -- was \nbelieved to have found the tone of the resolution rather antagonistic. That very tonality, however, might have been \nintended to compel international concurrence on the issue of Iraq.\n\nAs questions increased about the credibility of its intelligence on Iraq in mid-2003, Downing Street was hit by \nanother scandal. David Kelly, a scientist called to give testimony before a parliamentary inquiry panel on Iraq \nintelligence, was found dead from an apparent suicide. Kelly had been accused by panel members of being an \ninformant who gave information to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which ultimately led to allegations \nthat Downing Street had \"sexed up\" its dossier on Iraq. The matter led to a nasty row between the BBC and Prime \nMinister Tony Blair's communications director, Alistair Campbell. Kelly's family said the accusations by the panel \nhad led to Kelly becoming very despondent. The actual cause of the apparent suicide, however, remained \nunconfirmed, but questions still arose as to whether pressure placed on Kelly by the panel members contributed to \nthe suicide.\n\nThe BBC was not exempt from accountability and admitted that Kelly was the principal source of its allegations \nagainst the British government. As well, it was revealed that the account offered by Kelly to the inquiry panel on Iraq \nintelligence did not precisely correspond with claims made by the BBC. Kelly told the panel that he could not believe \nthat he was responsible for the claim that the 45-minute deployment of banned weapons had been overstated. The \n45-minute claim was precisely why the government was accused of inflating the evidence in the dossier. The \ndisconnection between Kelly's account to the inquiry panel and what the BBC actually reported has evoked \nquestions of the BBC's credibility. Although the BBC maintained it \"accurately interpreted and reported\" the \ninformation conveyed by Kelly, several board members resigned as a result of the episode.\n\nA judicial inquiry regarding the apparent suicide by Kelly was set to begin in early August. Prime Minister Tony Blair \nsaid his government would fully cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nFaced with the media firestorm both at home and across the Atlantic regarding allegations of spurious intelligence, \nhowever, Prime Minister Tony Blair began to suffer politically. At home, the general consensus has been emerging \nthat the prime minister overstated the evidence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Indeed, a poll by ICM \nfor the Daily Mirror last week showed that about two-thirds (66 percent) of those questioned believe that Blair \nmisrepresented the facts -- and either knowingly or unknowingly -- misled the British public before sending troops to \nfight a war in Iraq. A YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph this week showed that 68 percent of those questioned \nbelieved that the government was not trustworthy on issues related to Iraq. The same poll also showed that over 70 \npercent of those polled thought it was wrong of the government to have allowed Kelly's identity to become public, \nthus subjecting the mild-mannered scientist to the stress of the media spotlight. The turmoil seemingly led to slide in \nthe value of the British pound, possibly demonstrating a general climate of political uncertainty. \n\nBy early 2004, however, the judicial inquiry into Kelly's death exonerated the Blair government and heavily criticized \nthe BBC for its coverage of the situation.\n\nIn May 2004, reports of abuse surfaced implicating United Kingdom forces in the mistreatment of Iraqi detainees.  \nAt first, officials denounced the incriminating photographs claiming they were inauthentic.  With Downing Street's \nconfirmation of a Red Cross report from February 2004 raising allegations of abuse and mistreatment, Prime \n\n\n\nMinister Tony Blair apologized in an interview on French television and promised punishment under military rules of \nthose responsible. In London, Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon was expected to respond to questions by Members of \nParliament in the House of Commons.  The incriminating pictures, however, were later determined to be of \nquestionable credibility.\n\nRelations with European Union\n\nThe war in Iraq had been an illustration of the United Kingdom's \"special relationship\" with the United States, which, \nin and of itself, strained relations between the United Kingdom and other European countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom was still faced with the possible prospect of a referendum on EMU inclusion in \n2003. The government continued to promise a referendum on this issue while cabinet ministers studied the United \nKingdom's Treasury analysis about the possible implications of adopting the euro currency. One significant \ndifference that has shifted perspectives on EMU inclusion has been the increasing strength of the euro against the \nUnited States dollar. By mid-2003, the British government decided to delay a  possible date for a referendum on \neuro adoption.  Ultimately, the decision regarding the adoption of the euro and disbanding the British pound has \nbeen a significant constitutional matter affecting notions of sovereignty.\n\nIn June 2004, early indications from the European Union (EU) parliamentary elections showed there had been a \nrecord low turnout of only 44.2 percent for the EU. Early indications also showed that turnout among the 10 new \nmember states was even lower than the overall average at only 26 percent. Insofar as the actual election results \nwere concerned, gains for opposition parties across Europe appeared to be on the horizon. Early results in the \nUnited Kingdom suggested that Tony Blair's Labour Party lost 10 percent of their expected voter share while the \nConservatives fared little better, losing about 6 percent of the expected vote share. Meanwhile, the Independence \nParty, known for its skepticism toward the EU, won its first representative at the EU Parliament. \n\nDomestic Scene\n\nOn the domestic political scene, in late 2004, following the resignation of David Blunkett from the cabinet post of \nhome secretary, former British Education Secretary Charles Clarke was named as his replacement.  Meanwhile, \nRuth Kelly took over as education secretary.  At the age of 36, Kelly became the youngest Cabinet minister in \nBritish history. \n\nElections of 2005\n\nIn April 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair called a snap election to be held a month later in May 2005. On May 5, \n2005, citizens of the United Kingdom went to the polls to elect its new government. Voters were to select members \nof parliament in 645 constituencies. The party that secured the majority in parliament was expected to form the \ngovernment. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labour Party hoped to secure a third consecutive term in office. \nTurnout was predicted to be around 60 and was just over 61 percent in actuality.\n\nLeading up to the elections, both Tony Blair's Labour Party and Michael Howard's Conservatives (or Tories) were \nexpected to focus on matters pertaining to the economy. Whereas the Labour Party concentrated its campaign \nplatform on the regeneration of the inner cities, the Conservatives chose to highlight tax incentives and a plan \nbenefiting business interests.  The Conservatives also wielded an anti-immigration platform. For its part, however, \nCharles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats decided to direct their efforts to the war in Iraq. Indeed, they repeatedly \ncalled for a full public inquiry into the Iraq war, and they also demanded that the attorney general's full legal advice \non the war be released to the public. The demand by the Liberal Democrats came after a newspaper reported on a \nmemorandum that allegedly raised questions about the legality of the war. The leaked memorandum was eventually \npublished, and both main opposition parties stepped up their attacks on the prime minister for his perceived deceit \n\n\n\nover the legal implications of the Iraq war. Moreover, the media's attention remained almost singularly fixated on \nthe matter.\n\nDespite the preoccupation by the media with this issue of the war, Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a rigorous \ncampaign across the country on the basis of his party's economic record and with a focus on domestic concerns. \nTo his benefit, some voters who had been surveyed expressed scant interest in prioritizing Iraq as an election \nissue. Instead, they generally noted their decisions would be far more broad-based. Still, Blair and the Labour Party \nwere faced with the prospect of a diminished majority in parliament due to the Muslim and pacifist voters for whom \nthe war was a key concern.\n\nCharles Kennedy's campaign schedule across the country was slightly more strenuous than Tony Blair's and \ngarnered much positive attention. As the only major party to oppose the war, the Liberal Democrats also hoped to \ngain from the fact that they were the only main political party to stake out unambiguous anti-war terrain. Indeed, \nKennedy and the Liberal Democrats were positioned uniquely to frame the election as a \"referendum on the war.\" \nKennedy's Liberal Democrats were also trying to push a strong challenge to the Tories in conservative areas where \nthe Labour Party was not a factor.\n\nMeanwhile, even though the Conservative Tories attempted to capitalize on the Iraq memorandum scandal, the fact \nthat Howard's party did not actually oppose the war put them at a comparative disadvantage among the anti-war \ncrowd. As such, Howard's Conservative Tories were hoping to yield positive results from their aforementioned anti-\nimmigrant campaign. They also hoped to consolidate support in the south and southwest, where they have \ntraditionally done well,  despite the challenge from the Liberal Democrats.\n\nPolls taken on the eve of the election in late April 2005 showed Blair's Labour Party commanding a lead over his \nopponents, but the same polls showed he might ultimately end up with a smaller majority in parliament. Some polls \nshowed Howard's Tories holding steady while others showed the party losing ground somewhat. Finally, Kennedy's \nLiberal Democrats, according to the polls, showed increased support. A full 25 percent of those surveyed just prior \nto the election, however, said they were still undecided.\n\nAs exit polling data was released at the close of election day, it appeared that Tony Blair and the Labour Party \ncould potentially assume an historic third term in office, albeit with a diminished majority in parliament. The exit poll \ntrends held steady and in the end, Blair and the Labour Party garnered approximately 36 percent of the votes cast \nand held a majority in parliament with 355 seats. The Conservative Tories of Michael Howard had about 33 percent \nof the votes cast and a slightly enlarged presence in parliament with 197 seats. The Liberal Democrats had about \n22.2 percent of the votes cast and 62 seats in parliament. Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats were confident they \nhad met their goals of a better overall election performance than the last time. (Note: At the time of writing, six seats \nwere undeclared).\n\nSome of the key members of Blair's cabinet, such as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, held their constituencies. But \nelection night was also filled with several surprises. Ousted Labour Party member George Galloway, who had been \nan outspoken  opponent to the war in Iraq, defeated Labour Member of Parliament Oona King in the Bethnal Green \nconstituency. The Conservative Tories took back Putney and Wimbledon from Labour, secured Shipley, and \nseemed to have had a somewhat better showing in parts of London. The Tories also took Newbury from the Liberal \nDemocrats. At the same time, an Independent grabbed Labour's safest Welsh seat of Blaenau Gwent. Meanwhile, \nthe Liberal Democrats held on to Cheadle despite attacks by the Tories, and were victorious over Labour in key \nconstituencies, such as Birmingham Yardley, Manchester Withington, and Cardiff Central.\n\nBlair actually increased his vote share in his constituency of Sedgefield to win his seat convincingly. However, one \nof his opponents was the father of a soldier killed in Iraq. He ran against Blair purely to protest the war, its \n(perceived)  questionable legality, and the loss of soldiers like his son. For Blair's part, his sober victory speech \ngiven at Sedgefield reflected his cognizance that Labour's overall victory was a muted one. Blair and the Labour \nParty's success has been likely due to his stewardship of the economy, but the diminished majority in parliament \nmade it apparent that Iraq  was a factor in the election outcome. This was something Blair took time to acknowledge \nin his speech thanking the voters for returning him as the Sedgefield Member of Parliament, and possibly as the \n\n\n\nhead of government. He said, \"It seems clear ... that also the British people wanted the return of a Labour \ngovernment but with a reduced majority.\"\n\nIndeed, Blair went on to resume the leadership over government as the only Labour leader to ever achieve three \nconsecutive election wins.  But Blair also bore the responsibility of presiding over the lowest vote share for a ruling \nparty in recent history.\n\nAs a result, some political experts initiated a debate as to how long Tony Blair would stay on as prime minister \nbefore he turned the reins over to a successor -- more than likely to be Foreign Minister Gordon Brown.  Before \nsuch changes were made, however, the immediate business was the formation of a new government.  A day after \nthe election -- which was also Blair's birthday -- he was asked by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government and \nwent on to orchestrate a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nIn a similar case of \"mixed results,\" even as the Conservatives could claim they had increased their popularity and \nseats in parliament, they were also faced with the reality that it was one of the worst performances for their party. \nThe day after the election Tory leader Michael Howard said he would step down in order to make room for younger \nleadership of the party.\n\nLikewise,  Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats achieved both positive and negative election results.  Whereas \nKennedy's Liberal Democrats were not able to pick off certain key targets in Tory strongholds, they were able to \nenjoy the achievement of an overall improved election performance and increased popularity among voters.\n\nMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland,  there were fears that the moderate parties may be routed.  Speculation abounded \nas to whether David Trimble of the Ulster Union would hold his Upper Bann seat.  This news was later confirmed.  \nIan Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party picked up Trimble's seat and enjoyed other gains.  Sinn Fein President \nGerry Adams held on to his West Belfast seat with an increased vote share.  In general, Sinn  Fein retained their \nseats. Largely due to the defeat of David Trimble and the Ulster Union in Northern Ireland, the prospects for peace, \nset forth by the Good Friday Agreement, were very much in doubt.  Trimble, who resigned due to his party's \nshowing, noted that the people had voted against progress on the peace process and \"for stalemate.\" The \ndepressed prospects for peace, however, were nont long-lasting as several months later , the IRA officially \nannounced an end to its armed campaign after three decades of violence.  See the section  titled \"Northern Ireland\" \nbelow, as well as the Appendix: Northern Ireland,\"  for more  details. \n\nDevelopments in the Monarchy\n\nIn the backdrop of these political developments was the April 2005 wedding of Heir Apparent Prince Charles \nto Camilla Parker-Bowles -- a rather controversial figure since the death of the mother of the Prince's children, \nPrincess Diana.  After Bowles wed Prince Charles, she was to be known as the Princess Consort.  Whether or not \nthis position automatically makes her Queen when the Heir Apparent accedes to the throne is a matter of \ndiscussion.\n\nTerrorist Attacks in London\n\nAt 8:51 a.m. GMT on July 7, 2005, the first in a series of blasts exploded through London's transport network.  The \nfirst blast occurred about 100 yards from Liverpool Underground Station, in the direction of Algate East.  Five \nminutes later between Russell Square and King's Cross Station, there was another explosion on a train.  At 9:17 \na.m., a third blast occurred at Edgware Road Station. Then at 9:47 a.m., there was a fourth blast -- this time on a \ndouble decker bus at the corner of Tavistock Square and Upper Woburn Place.  All the explosions on the \nUnderground appeared to have involved the Circle Line or possibly the Central Line.  Both are older Underground \nlines located closer to ground level in the tube system.\n\n\n\nAbout 50 people were reported to have been killed and more than 700 injured.  It was believed that several people \ndied at each of the four blast sites although most appeared to have died in the blast on a train between Russel \nSquare and King's Cross Station.  It was unknown as to how many people died in the bus blast.\n\nOn the ground in London, emergency services said they had treated scores of injured patients.  The types of \ninjuries ranged from minor lacerations and smoke inhalation to more critical cases of burns, amputations, fractured \nlimbs and  chest injuries.  While Underground train services were suspended for at least a day, bus service \nresumed within London's Zone One, and mainline train service was open. As well, many of the Metropolitan Police \nofficers who had been sent to Scotland for the G-8 summit were expected to return to London.\n\nWhen the explosions first occurred within the Underground, many early reports suggested they were due to a power \nsurge.  These initial assumptions were laid aside as it became increasingly clear that the blasts were the work of \nterrorists.  Officials noted there had been no advance warning.  They also said they were trying to determine if the \nblast on the bus had been the work of a suicide bomber, although they noted it could very easily have been a \nsimple explosive device left on the bus.\n\nAlthough there was no confirmation as to the validity of its claims, a hitherto unknown group called  Secret \nOrganization Group of al-Qaida - Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility in a statement posted on an \nIslamist website.  The group stated that its motivation for the attacks was to avenge the \"massacres\" committed by \nthe United Kingdom in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It also expressed the hope that the United Kingdom was \"burning with \nfear and panic.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair responded by promising,  \"the most intense police and security service \naction to make sure we bring those responsible to justice.\"\n\nHe also made note of the contrast between the purpose of the G-8 summit he was attending and the purpose of the \nterrorists responsible for the London attacks.  In this regard, he said, \"It's particularly barbaric that this has \nhappened on a day when people are meeting to try to help the problems of poverty and Africa.\"  The prime minister \nthen returned to London from the summit, vowing, however, that the meetings would go on.\n\nAlso in the United Kingdom, the British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, expressed deep shock at the events, and \nconveyed her deepest sympathies to those affected.  She also ordered the Union flag to fly at half mast over \nBuckingham Palace.  London's Mayor, Ken Livingstone, who was in Singapore for the announcement of London as \nthe venue for the 2012 Olympics, extolled the strength of London's diverse people who have lived in harmony and \nwho would not be divided by the \"cowardly attack.\"  From Vatican City, Pope Benedict described the blasts as \n\"barbaric acts against humanity\" and sent a message of condolence to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal \nCormac Murphy O'Connor.  United States President George W. Bush, who was in Gleneagles in Scotland for the \nG-8 summit, said: \"The war on terror goes on.\"\n\nMohammed Sidique Khan, Hasib Mir Hussein, Shehzad Tanweer and Germaine Lindsay were the four men \nidentified as the suicide bombers responsible for the July 2005 terrorist attacks in London. A report in the media \nrevealed that MI5 had investigated  Mohammad Sidique Khan, but concluded that he was not a threat.  \nNevertheless, no official inquiry was convened on the question of why the bombers were not tagged as threats by \nUnited Kingdom's security services.  Instead, attention was focused on new anti-terrorism measures and \nlegislation. These new laws included the following:\n\n-Outlawing \"acts preparatory to terrorism\"\n\n-New offence of indirect incitement to commit terrorist acts\n\n-New law for those providing or receiving terrorist training\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as the investigation about the attacks were ongoing, Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair expressed \nanticipation about a  \"clear al-Qaeda link.\"  As well, the authorities were searching for those who supported, \nfinanced, or armed the attackers. In another development, an Egyptian chemistry student, Magdi El-Nashar, was \ndetained in Cairo in connection with the attacks.  Finally, explosives were found in a house in Leeds -- the town \nwhere most of the July 2005 suicide bombers lived.\n\nIn another development, Chatham House released a report in mid-July 2005  which said in its conclusion: \"There is \nno doubt that the situation over Iraq has posed particular difficulties for the UK, and for the wider coalition against \nterrorism.\" Although it did not suggest that the issue of Iraq laid at the heart of the London attacks, it intimated that \nthere was a connection.  The report also noted that while the United Kingdom has been carrying out counter-\nterrorism policy in tandem with the United States, it was not an equal decision-maker in the relationship.  Instead, \ndirectives were being driven by the United States. \n\nTwo weeks after the fatal bombings across London's transport network, an apparent attempt to replicate those \nattacks ensued on July 21, 2005 on three Underground trains and one bus.  The bombs detonated but failed to \nignite, thus sparring London of further tragedy. Four suspects fled the scene and authorities issued images of the \nmen thought to be responsible for attempted suicide attacks.  Three men were arrested under the Terrorism Act in \nconnection with the attempted attacks and were being questioned.  As the days wore on, all the apparent attempted \nsuicide bombers had been apprehended along with several other suspects.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after the attempted bombings, a man was shot dead at the Stockwell Underground Station after \nfailing to respond to police who were pursuing him. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said at a news \nconference that the shooting was part of anti-terrorist operations. Days later, however, the authorities admitted that \nthe man killed, Jean Charles de Menezes, was a Brazilian national who was not connected to any terrorist \nactivities.  Sir Ian Blair apologized to the man's family, characterizing his untimely death as a \"tragedy,\" but also \nwarning that more people could similarly be shot as the police searched for the suspects.\n\nAt the diplomatic level, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim met Foreign Office officials in London to seek an \nexplanation for the killing of the 27-year old electrician. He noted that while Brazil stood in solidarity with the United \nKingdom against terrorism, it deplored the loss of innocent life.  He also said that Foreign Minister Jack Straw had \npromised a full investigation.\n\nDeath of a Political Icon\n\nIn early August 2005, former British Cabinet Minister and Leader of the Commons Robin Cook died after collapsing \nin north-west Scotland. He was pronounced dead at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. As news of his untimely death \nspread, friends and colleagues paid tribute to the parliamentarian who was known for his strong opinions on the \npolitical issues of the day. Prime Minister Tony Blair characterized Cook as \"an outstanding, extraordinary talent\" in \na statement released by Downing Street. Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative Party in the United \nKingdom said: \"He is a very great loss. He was someone who made an immense contribution to our political life.\" \nCharles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats said: \"Scottish, British and international politics have lost a good \nand gifted man.\"\n\nRobin Cook first became a Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He was appointed the shadow \nHealth Secretary in 1989, and became shadow Trade and Industry Secretary in 1992. Two years later in 1994, he \nbecame the shadow Foreign Secretary and he held that position until the 1997 election. With the Labour Party's \nlandslide victory, he then held the portfolio for the Foreign Secretary within the British Cabinet. In 2001, there was a \nreshuffle and he took on the job of Leader of the Commons instead, with Jack Straw replacing him at the Foreign \nOffice. Cook's strenuous opposition to the war in Iraq led to his resignation from that post in 2003 (noted above). \nOn the matter of the Iraq war, Cook notably said, \"I cannot support a war without international agreement or \ndomestic support.\" He then continued to be a strong critic of Tony Blair's foreign policy from the backbench of the \nBritish Parliament.\n\n\n\nRegarding the Monarchy\n\nApril 21, 2006 marked Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday. The British monarch celebrated this personal milestone at \nWindsor Castle.  Thousands of well-wishers were on hand to greet her while Irish Guards played the song, \"Happy \nBirthday\" in the background.  She was scheduled to join her family for a private birthday dinner hosted by her son \nand Heir Apparent, Prince Charles.\n\nState of the Blair Government\n\nMay 2006 was marked by a cabinet shakeup in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe changes appeared intended to highlight Prime Minister Tony Blair's continued governing power, even in the \nface of scandals and other negative news coverage.\n\nOpposition leaders, however, said that cabinet shakeups could not mask the need for a new government \naltogether.\n\nThe most significant change centered on the dismissal of the country's Foreign Secretary.  It was believed that \ngrowing philosophical differences and concomitant tensions between Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign \nSecretary Jack Straw precipitated the move.  Indeed, there were reports that Straw had privately conveyed his \nconcerns about the Iraq war.  As well, he publicly rebuked the notion of military action against Iran, and even went \nso far as to characterize the United States' contingency plans for a tactical nuclear strike against Iran as \n\"completely nuts.\"  Prime Minister Blair replaced Straw with the head of the Department of Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs, Margaret Beckett.  Her appointment was notable since she became the first woman to hold the \nForeign Affairs portfolio in the British government.\n\nAnother important change was the dismissal of Home Secretary Charles Clarke.  It was believed that Clarke's \ndismissal was due to a politically-heated and particularly damaging imbroglio involving a failure to deport foreign \ncriminals.  That issue involved the government's acknowledgment that over 1,000 foreign criminals slated for \ndeportation were not screened before freeing them from prison.  Although Prime Minister Blair initially expressed \nsupport for Clarke, he subsequently made the decision to dismiss his Home Secretary saying, \"I felt that it was very \ndifficult, given the level of genuine public concern, for Charles to continue.\" Clarke was replaced with Defense \nSecretary John Reid, while Des Browne, Chief Secretary at the Treasury,  took on the Defense portfolio in his \nstead.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister John Prescott's responsibilities were curtailed after his scandalous admission that he had an \naffair with a secretary. He was, however, allowed to keep his title.\n\nThe cabinet shuffle occurred on the heels of local elections, which were largely regarded as a referendum on the \nBlair government.  The election resulted in a poor showing by the Labour Party and led to some calls for Prime \nMinister Blair to step down.  In those elections, Labour suffered something of a rout -- exemplified by a loss of \nseats along with significant gains for the Conservative Party.\n\nWithin the Labour Party, there was increasing factionalism between the Blairists and standpoint Labour members.  \nGordon Brown, the Treasury Head and the de facto \"heir apparent\" to Blair, warned that in order to stem the \npolitical losses to Labour in the long term, voters' concerns regarding crime, terrorism, employment and financial \nsecurity had to be addressed in the very near future. \n\n\n\nPolicy issues aside, there were demands for a strong shift in the direction of the party itself. Frank Dobson, a former \ncabinet secretary, called for new management of the party in short order.  Even more radical were the emerging \ncalls for Prime Minister Blair to step down from office.  In fact, cabinet secretary John Reid said that there was a \nleft-wing plot to oust Blair out of his leadership role.  Certainly, there were reports that approximately 50 Labour \nparliamentarians issued a letter to Blair asking him to identify a departure date, for the purpose of ending the \ndamaging speculation about the leadership of the party. Of course, the counterpoint argument was that changing \nthe leadership would be terribly damaging at a time when party unity was needed. \n\nOn September 5, 2006, a week after British Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected the notion of a timetable for his \ndeparture, 17 parliamentarians from the Labour Party dispatched a letter asking him to resign. The call for Blair to \nresign had been increasing in mid-2006, prompting news that Blair might step down within 12 months.  This \ntimetable was deemed acceptable by several parliamentarians who signed a statement to that effect.  However, \nanother cadre of Labour parliamentarians said that Blair's resignation should be immediate.\n\nThese developments came amidst revelations about an apparent leaked memorandum, which suggested that Blair \nwould embark on a farewell tour. The memorandum was reported to have been crafted by a number of Blair's allies, \nincluding  pollster Philip Gould, and said, \"He needs to go with the crowd wanting more.\"  The document emerged \naround the same time that a Populus poll was published showing that Conservatives were advancing strong \nsupport over Labour, regardless of whether or not Blair stayed on in power.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair confirmed that he will step down as prime minister within a \nyear.\n\nSpeaking at a London school, Blair said, \"The next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party \nconference as party leader.\"\n\nSome members of Blair's Labour Party suggested that Blair would announce a timetable for stepping down from \noffice in early 2007, followed by a handover of power in May.  However, others noted that no  specific timeline had \nbeen decided other than the general timeline of 12 months.\n\nIn late September 2006, Blair bid his party goodbye in final swansong speech as Labour Party leader.  In his \nspeech before the party faithful, he declined to give a precise date of departure, instead focusing on \nthe accomplishments of the party while he was at the helm.\n\nIn the meanwhile, relations within the Labour Party remained rather fractious over the issue of Blair's tenure as \nprime minister, as well as the question of succession.  In this latter regard, Blair and his possible successor, Gordon \nBrown, were reported to have had a contentious discussion on the prospective schedule for the prime minister's  \ndeparture.  Brown apparently advocated a faster departure, ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England, \nwhile Blair allies urged a later departure date. The matter led to something of a conflict between respective Blair \nand Brown camps within the Labour Party, as well as a spate of resignations from members of government. \n\nNorthern Ireland Developments in 2006\n\nIn 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern traveled to Northern Ireland to \nreveal their plan for restoring devolution.  To this end, they gave Northern Ireland Assembly members a deadline of \nNovember 24, 2006  to establish power-sharing governance.\n\n\n\nMay 2006 marked the first time since October 2002 that Northern Ireland's politicians took their seats at the \nStormont assembly.  There was no expectation that a power-sharing executive government would be immediately \nformed.  Still, it was hoped that the process of convening Assembly Members at Stormont would at least facilitate \nthe possibility of an agreement being forged ahead of the November 24, 2006 deadline.  Essentially, politicians \nwere given six weeks to form an executive.  Should the six week period pass without agreement, they would be \ngiven another 12 weeks to do so.  But if the November deadline was reached without resolution, the salaries of \nAssembly Members would be halted. Ultimately, implementation of the Good Friday Agreement was at stake.\n\nSeptember 2006 saw the DUP begin an internal consultative process by which it was considering whether or not to \nshare power with Sinn Fein. A month later, intensive multi-party talks were convened at St. Andrews in Scotland \naimed at moving the sides toward a commitment to devolution.  A deadline of November 10, 2006 was set by which \nall Northern Ireland parties were to respond to the St. Andrews Agreement. This new deadline was followed by the \nunveiling of a roadmap to devolution, in which the date March 26, 2007 was set for the establishment of a new \noperational executive. Also in October 2006, an anticipated meeting between Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley at \nStormont was postponed after the DUP insisted on a pledge of policing in Northern Ireland.  This issue came to the \nfore again at the close of 2006 when Sinn Fein announced that it was convening a special meeting to discuss \npossible republican support for policing. Such support would essentially remove a major obstacle to the devolution \nprocess.\n\nIn November 2006, in keeping with the aforementioned deadline, a transitional assembly was established.  The \ntransitional assembly was to be in effect until the close of January 2007.  As well, March 2007 was confirmed as the \ntime  when elections would be held for the new executive.  Proceedings to hear ministerial choices of the DUP and \nSinn Fein were interrupted when an apparent loyalist assassin, Michael Stone, tried to enter into the compound at \nStormont.  He was subsquently charged with attempted murder.\n\nTerror Attacks Foiled in United Kingdom\n\nOn Aug. 10, 2006, British authorities announced that they had foiled an attempt by terrorists to bring down several \nairliners, ultimately killing thousands of people.  British police said that following a lengthy probe starting more than \nsix months earlier, over 20 people had been arrested in connection with the terrorist plot, which, according to \nreports, involved approximately 10 airliners traveling from the United Kingdom to the United States.  Details \nemerging about the plot suggested that the terrorists intended to carry concealed bomb-making materials with them \nin their carry-on luggage and, presumably, construct and detonate the bombs in-flight over the Atlantic.  A day after \nthe attacks were reported to have been foiled, Italian authorities detained around 40 suspects for questioning in \nconnection with the planned terrorist attacks.  A few days later, Pakistani authorities also arrested several people in \nthat country, including two British nationals with Pakistani roots, in connection with the apparent terrorist plot.  In the \nUnited Kingdom, even as suspects in custody were being interrogated, British police were still carrying out \ninvestigations, including the search for evidence in wooded areas of Buckinghamshire.\n\nWhile United States spokespersons and media quickly speculated that the terrorist plan was, perhaps, carried out \nby the notorious Islamic militant group, al-Qaida, British counterparts were far more reticent about expressing ideas \nabout who might be responsible.  British analysts acknowledged that the terrorist plan bore the hallmark of typical \nal-Qaida operations -- complex and coordinated orchestration of attacks intended to be extensive in scope and \nyielding maximum carnage.  That said, they suggested that if those responsible had not been trained at al-Qaida \ncamps, they were at least likely to be al-Qaida inspired.\n\nWhile little information was initially released about the individuals arrested, it appeared that many of them were \nBritish-born Muslims, many of  Pakistani ethnicity.  Two of the suspects were reported to have traveled to Pakistan \nand later received money from a source there.  Another suspect was believed to be a worker at an Islamic charity.  \nYet another was reported to be an employee of Heathrow Airport with an all-area access pass. Two suspects \napparently left \"martyrdom tapes\" typical of Islamic suicide bombers. Overall, it was surmised that this group of \n\n\n\nwould-be terrorists were much like the self-radicalized types who carried out the attacks on London's Underground \nin July 2005. (Although largely self-radicalized, even that group had links to al-Qaida, as was discovered some time \nafter the attacks took place.)\n\nIt was also revealed that British police had ideally wanted to continue its investigation further, in order to glean even \nmore information.  However, when signs began to indicate that the terrorists were ready to activate their plan, the \npolice had no choice but to immediately arrest those believed to be conspiring to carry out the terrorist attacks. \nApparently following a number of arrests in Pakistan, information came to light suggesting that a terrorist act was \nimminent. Following the arrests on Aug. 10, 2006 came the revelation that while as many people were detained as \npossible, there was no guarantee that all members of the terrorist enclave had been taken into police custody.  With \na possible security threat still in the offing, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States \nimmediately raised their security threat indices to the highest levels.  In addition,  transportation authorities in the \nUnited Kingdom and the United States immediately instituted draconian measures on air travel.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all hand luggage was immediately banned, forcing travelers to place only identity \ndocuments, cash, credit cards and keys into clear plastic bags during travel. In the United States, international \ntravelers were to be subjected to stringent security procedures, while all travelers on overseas and domestic flights \nwere prohibited from carrying all liquid, lotion, cream and gel-like substances in their hand luggage.  These policies \nwere instituted in response to revelations that the would-be terrorists intended to detonate a liquid-based explosive, \ncomposed of a sports drink and peroxide-based paste.  Ignition of the explosion could, theoretically, be achieved \nusing an electrical device such as a cell phone.\n\nAir transport across the world was compromised.  London's Heathrow Airport -- the world's busiest airport and the \nconnection hub for global carriers -- was at the center of the plot.  As such, air carriers flying from or to Heathrow \ncancelled or delayed flights.  From Europe in the east and west across the Atlantic to the United States, \nrepercussions were felt as air traffic came to a halt.  At the same time, at airports where flights were still departing \nand arriving, passengers were dealing with particularly lengthy security lines.\n\nWhile British Home Secretary John Reid acknowledged on Aug. 13, 2006 that the new regime of security \nrestrictions was taking a particularly difficult toll on the air travel industry, he noted that it was necessary given the \n\"substantial threat\" posed by terrorists.  Still, a day later, the United Kingdom's threat level was downgraded from \ncritical to severe, indicating that an attack was now considered \"highly likely\" rather than \"imminent.\"  The change \nwas made by the Joint Terrorism and Analysis Centre on the basis of recent intelligence. The downgraded status \nindicated the possibility that some of the security restrictions might be eased, such as the re-introduction of limited \nhand luggage.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, a British Airways flight from Heathrow Airport en route to New York was forced \nto turn back when a mobile phone, which has been officially banned, rang on board.\n\nAlso on Aug. 13, 2006, Home Secretary Reid declared that the recent terrorist plot -- involving the use of liquid \nexplosives on trans-Atlantic flights -- was among at least four such plots, which  had been thwarted in the last year \nsince the July 7, 2005 attacks on London's transit system.  Reid, however, noted that al-Qaida activities had been \noperational in the United Kingdom as far back as 2000.\n\nIn other developments, Reid responded to a letter written by a group of British Muslim leaders expressing the view \nthat the country's foreign policy was linked with the terror threat.  He said that such a position was a \"dreadful \nmisjudgement that foreign policy of this country should be shaped in part, or in whole, under the threat of terrorism \nactivity.\"  Shadow Home Secretary  David Davis reflected a similar sentiment saying, \"There are plenty of people \nwith legitimate arguments with the government's foreign policy on Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Lebanon and the Middle \nEast but none of them take the stance of attempting to murder many thousands of their fellow citizens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his gratitude to security personnel for their efforts \nin foiling the terrorist attack. United States President George W. Bush reminded people that the United States was \nstill at war with \"Islamic fascists.\" Bush also thanked Blair for \"busting this plot.\"\n\n\n\nBritish Policy on Iraq\n\nOn February 21, 2007, British Prime Minister Blair announced the withdrawal of some troops from Iraq over the \ncourse of the following months.  He said that the 7,100 British troops serving in southern Iraq would be reduced to \n5,500 and he hoped that another 500 troops could leave by late summer.  He expected the remaining troops to stay \nin Iraq until 2008.  Prime Minister Blair defined a new objective for British troops in Iraq, saying that they would be \nexpected to provide requisite support for Iraqi forces and securing the borders.  He also made clear that Iraqis \nwould write the next chapter\" in their country's history.\n\nThe announcement by the British prime minister was soon followed with news that the few Danish troops operating \nin Iraq would also be withdrawn.  As well, Lithuania said that they were considering the removal of their troops from \nIraq.\n\nEven as the news from these three countries was being made public, the United States was moving to increase its \ntroop presence in Iraq under President George W. Bush's controversial plan for escalation.  For its part, the United \nStates characterized Blair's announcement as a positive sign of success in Iraq.  Still, the fact of the matter was \nthat the period had seen an exodus of coalition troops from Iraq, as the war in that country became ever more \nunpopular across the globe.  Indeed, troops remaining in Iraq from countries belonging to the coalition numbered \nfew in comparison with their United States counterpart.  United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \nresponded to criticism of the dwindling presence of foreign forces in Iraq by saying that  that the coalition \"remains \nintact.\"\n\nImbroglio with Iran\n\nThe British presence in Iraq was a key issue in March 2007 when 15 members of the British Navy were captured by \nmembers.  The incident occurred on March 23, 2007  when the British Navy personnel boarded a vessel just off the \ncoast of Iraq on the basis of suspected smuggling activities.  The servicemen from the HMS Cornwall were \napparently seized by gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.  British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett \ndemanded both the immediate and safe return of the servicemen, as well as a \"full explanation\" from Iran about its \nactions.\n\nOn March 26, 2007, the Iranian government in Tehran said that the British Navy personnel had illegally entered \nIranian waters.\n\nThe Iranian government also noted that the 15 Navy servicemen were undergoing questioning, and offered \nassurances to the British ambassador about the good health of those captured. In addition, Iran dismissed the \nnotion that they had been taken in exchange for five Iranian diplomats who had earlier detained in Iraq by the \nUnited States military.\n\nThe British government countered the claim made by Iran saying that its Navy personnel were conducting routine \npatrols in Iraqi waters.  To this end, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, \"It simply is not true that they went into \nIranian territorial waters and I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us.\"  \nBlair characterized the detention of the 15 members of the Royal Navy as \"unjustified and wrong.\"\n\nTo underline the gravity of the situation, the British government also suspended bilateral contacts with Iran.\n\nIt was yet to be seen how Iran would react, given the fact that the diplomatic climate abroad, as well as the political \nclimate at home, were not particularly favorable in March 2007.  First, new sanctions were being imposed by the \nUnited Nations (U.N.) Security Council on Iran in regard to its nuclear program.  As well, students at home were \nreacting to the government's claims about the Royal Navy personnel entry into Iranian waters by calling for them to \nface trial.\n\n\n\nDays later, Iranian authorities published excerpts of letters by Leading Seaman Faye Turney -- one of the Royal \nNavy personnel captured.  In the letters, Turney allegedly wrote that she was sorry that she and her fellow Royal \nNavy servicemen entered Iranian waters.  On March 28, 2007, Iranian state television showed an interview with \nTurney in which she said, \"Obviously we trespassed\" into Iranian waters.  Nevertheless, Iran said that Turney would \nbe released within days.\n\nBritish officials responded saying that they expected that Turney had been forced to express such a position, and \nthey did not believe the letters or interview statements were willingly offered.  As well, Prime Minister Blair told the \nHouse of Commons that the time had come to \"ratchet up\" pressure on Iran.  Earlier, Blair warned of a \"different \nphase\" in diplomatic efforts if current initiatives to free the 15 crew members failed.  Meanwhile, the Royal Navy \noffered Global Positioning Systems (GPS) evidence making clear that the 15 crew members, who were functioning \nunder a United Nations mandate, were 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they were seized.\n\nOn March 29, 2007, following a request by the United Kingdom (U.K.), the United Nations Security Council issued a \nstatement conveying  \"grave concern\" for the capture of the British Navy personnel by Iran, and calling on Iran to \nensure that the U.K. received consular access.\n\nFor its part, Iran released video footage depicting the 15 British crew members being seized in what it has claimed \nto be Iranian waters.  Iran also announced that it was freezing the scheduled release of Leading Seaman Turney on \nthe basis of the U.K.'s supposed \"incorrect attitude.\"\n\nA day later, Iranian state television aired an interview with a second British Royal Navy serviceman, Nathan \nSummers.  In that footage, Summer apologized for \"trespassing\" in Iranian waters.  Prime Minister Blair disparaged \nthe footage, saying that the exploitation of the British crew would serve only to \"enhance people's sense of disgust \nwith Iran.\"\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Iran sent a formal note to the U.K. in which it condemned the Royal Navy's \"illegal act\" and \ncalled for guarantees that such trespassing would not be repeated.  Meanwhile, the European Union expressed \n\"unconditional support\" for the position of the U.K. and urged the \"immediate and unconditional release\" of the 15 \nRoyal Navy personnel.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, two other Royal Navy servicemen were shown on Iranian state television.  Captain Chris Ayre and \nLieutenant Felix Carman were respectively shown in front of an Iranian map of the Gulf.  Ayre noted that the Iranian \nmaps depicted the area in which he and his associates were captured as Iranian territorial waters.  He said, \n\"Approximately about ten o'clock in the morning we were seized - apparently at this point here from their maps on \nthe GPS they've shown us - which is inside Iranian territorial waters.\"  Carman expressed understanding for the \nIranian perspective about the \"intrusion.\"\n\nOn the ground in Iran, hard-line students hurled rockets and firecrackers into the compound housing the British \nembassy, presumably to protest the brewing dissention between the two countries.  As well, about 200 students \ntook to the streets to demonstrate against the alleged trespassing by the British Navy personnel into Iranian waters.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the British Foreign Office decried the televised footage and characterized it as \nboth \"a charade\" and \"unacceptable.\"  The statement by the British Foreign Office included the following assertion: \n\"It is completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on television, given the potential to cause distress to \ntheir families.\"\n\nA day later, the climate appeared to have calmed somewhat, despite the airing of new footage of the 15 who had \nbeen detained.\n\nIran noted that a shift from the U.K. could help to resolve the crisis, and in so doing refined its hard-line tone.  \nMeanwhile, the U.K. Defense Secretary Des Browne said that diplomatic efforts to end the crisis were ongoing, and \nthat London and Tehran were engaging in \"direct bilateral communication.\"\n\n\n\nOn  April 4, 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmandinejad held a media conference in Tehran.  At that media \nevent, which was held to present medals of honor to the Republican Guard who had detained the British crew \nmembers, he also announced that the British Navy servicemen would be given amnesty and released.  \nHe intimated that the decision was gesture of goodwill to the British,  and that it was being offered in honor of two \nupcoming events -- the  birthday of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed and  the Christian celebration of Easter.  \nIranian state television showed Ahmadinejad greeting the 15 servicemen in what appeared to be a climate of amity.\n\nSome analysts characterized the display as being \"a piece of theater.\"\n\nRegardless, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reacted to the news saying that the release of the 15 Britons would \nbe \"a profound relief\" to the crew and their families.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Iranian leader said that no concessions or deals had been made with the British \ngovernment to secure the release of the 15 servicemen, although the U.K. made it clear that such an incident would \nnot be repeated.  Meanwhile, the British prime minister did not offer either an apology to Iran for the alleged \nintrusion into Iranian waters, or thanks for the release of the British Navy personnel.  However, Blair addressed the \nIranian people saying,  \"We bear you no ill will. On the contrary, we respect Iran as an ancient civilisation, as a \nnation with a proud and dignified history. The disagreements we have with your government we wish to resolve \npeacefully through dialogue. I hope - as I've always hoped - that in the future we are able to do so.\"\n\nNote: The 15 released servicemen later noted that their statements to Iranian state media had been coerced.\n\nNorthern Ireland Developments in 2007\n\nAt the start of 2007, the issue of policing (discussed above) returned to the political purview when Sinn Fein \naccused DUP leader Ian Paisley of not providing a \"positive enough\" response to the special meeting its was \nconvening to deal with the crucial issue of policing. The situation took another turn when  Paisley denied ever \nagreeing to the transfer of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly by 2008.  Paisley also \nnoted that there was no provision for such a move in the St. Andrews Agreement.\n\nRegardless, on January 28, 2007, at a special party conference in Dublin, Sinn Fein voted to support policing in \nNorthern Ireland.  The vote was carried overwhelmingly with 90 percent support. It was the first such move in the \nparty's history and was considered a key component in the progress toward devolution in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnother key aspects on the path toward restoring devolution has been the question of the DUP's  commitment to \npower-sharing with Sinn Fein in a devolved government by the target date of March 26, 2007. \n\nIn March 2007, the election for the new Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland took place.  Results showed the \ntwo hard-line Protestant/Unionist and Catholic/Nationalists parties winning most of the seats at stake.\n\nThe election was intended to facilitate the creation of a new power-sharing government, which would represent \ndiverse sectarian interests.  That power-sharing executive entity had to be formed by a deadline of March 26, 2007, \nin order to move away from direct rule.  However, a failure to do so would leave little chance of restoring the \ndevolved government, and ultimately, it would result in the abandonment of the Northern Ireland's Legislative \nAssembly at Stormount.  At issue was the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nNow, with the elections completed, and with the March 26, 2007 deadline looming ahead, Secretary of State Peter \nHain said that he would require a status report from the parties within two weeks, in order to meet the deadline for \n\n\n\ndevolution. He warned that the assembly would be abandoned if the parties were not signatories to a power-sharing \nexecutive.  That power-sharing executive, if formed, would be made up of four DUP ministers, three Sinn Fein \nministers, two UUP ministers and one SDLP minister.  Absent from the executive would be the Alliance Party, the \nGreen Party and the PUP\n\nAs midnight struck heralding March 26, 2007, Peter Hain signed an order restarting devolution and effectively \nrestoring power to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  But its revived existence could have had a short life if the \ndeadline for the formation of the power-sharing executive was  not met.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland warned that the assembly at Stormount would be dissolved if agreement \non the power-sharing executive was not forged by the deadline.\n\nThat said, Hain also suggested that he was willing to consider alternative arrangement if the parties could come to \nsome consensus on the issues at stake. \n\nFor its part, the DUP said that it would enter into a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, however, it also \nissued a caveat of sorts by stating that it would not enter into such an arrangement until May.  In response, Sinn \nFein charged the DUP with attempting to \"frustrate the will of the electorate.\" DUP parliamentarian Jeffrey \nDonaldson defended his party's decision by noting that the decision to agree to govern jointly with Sinn Fein was \none of historic proportions, but that more time was needed to resolve outstanding issues, including departmental \npre-briefings, the finalization of a government program, as well as raising confidence levels within the community \nregarding devolution.\n\nNevertheless, before the passage of the deadline, the DUP and Sinn Fein announced an historic agreement to form \na power-sharing executive on May 8, 2007.  Two main rivals -- the DUP's Ian Paisley and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams  \n-- met for direct talks to discuss the deal.  It was agreed that Paisley would be the first minister in the new \nadministration and Sinn Fein's  Martin McGuinness would be deputy first minister.\n\nFollowing the unprecedented meeting between Paisley and Adams, the DUP leader  expressed full commitement \nsaying, \"The DUP executive overwhelmingly endorsed a motion committing our party to support and participate fully \nin government in May of this year - this is a binding resolution.\"  Paisley's  nationalist counterpart, Adams, \nresponded to the DUP's endorsement and commitment to joint governance saying,  \"I believe the agreement \nreached between Sinn Fein and the DUP - including the unequivocal commitment made by their party executive \nand reiterated today - to the restoration of political institutions on 8 May marks the beginning of a new era of politics \non this island.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Blair  said that the agreement between the DUP and Sinn  Fein was an important one for the \npeople and the history of Northern Ireland.  Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern  reacted to the developments by \ncharacterizing the agreement was both unprecedented and very positive. \n\nThen, May 8, 2007 saw the establishment of the historic power-sharing at Stormount in Northern Ireland.  Direct \nrule ended as DUP leader, Ian Paisley, and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, took office as the first and deputy \nministers of the new executive respectively.  Paisley marked the occasion saying, \"Today we are starting upon the \nroad which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province.\"  McGuinness expressed confidence that he would \nbe able to work with Paisley  despite the challenges of the past, saying, \"We must overcome the difficulties which \nwe face in order to achieve our goals and seize the opportunities that now exist.\"  Witnessing the occasion, British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair noted that Northern Ireland now had the opportunity to be freed from \"the heavy chains of \nhistory\" while charting a new course.  His Irish counterpart, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern expressed his gratitude to \npoliticians who had worked hard to achieve peace.  \n\n\n\nNote: The creation of a new power-sharing government at Stormount was intended to both restore the devolved \ngovernment and to represent diverse sectarian interests.  The historic occasion marked the implementation of the \nGood Friday Agreement.\n\nDevelopments on Domestic Agenda\n\nMay 2007 saw Tony Blair's Labour Party suffer some defeats in local elections.  These defeats were largely \nblamed on the unpopular war in Iraq as well as a domestic scandal involving payments for honor.  Nevertheless, \nBlair characterized his party's performance as being unexpectedly good noting, \"You always take a hit in the \nmidterm, but these results provide a perfectly good springboard to go on and win the next national election.\"  \nIndeed, the Labour Party's performance was slightly better than in local elections of 2006.\n\nThese elections were held for local councils across England.  As well, elections were held in Scotland for local \nrepresentatives, as well as representatives to the Scottish Parliament, seated in Edinburgh.\n\nIn Wales, voters chose representatives to the National Assembly, seated in Cardiff.\n\nWhile the Labour Party's overall loss was smaller than had originally been anticipated, the most significant shift \nwas seen in the closeness of the election in Scotland, typically viewed as a Labour Party stronghold.  There, the \nLabour Party lost its advantage over the Scottish nationalists. In fact, the strong showing of the Scottish National \nParty, which promised to hold a referendum on independence by 2010 if it won power, evoked questions about the \npolitical terrain there.\n\nIn Wales, the Labour Party lost some seats but still tallied twice as many in the end, as compared with the \nnationalist party, Plaid Cymru.\n\nThe election came ahead of Blair's anticipated announcement that he would resign as prime minister.  There was \nsome speculation that his likely successor, Gordon Brown, would benefit from the fact that despite the losses just \nsuffered by the Labour Party, the Conservatives in opposition were hardly enjoying a notable ascendant trend. \n\nOn May 10, 2007, Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom issued his long-awaited announcement that he \nwas stepping down from the Labour Party's leadership position and head of government. Blair's announcement \nmade in his Sedgefield constituency and was of an emotional nature.\n\nThe prime minister made clear the triumphs achieved by the Labour Party under his leadership, saying, \"There is \nonly one government since 1945 that can say all of the following: more jobs, fewer unemployed, better health and \neducation results, lower crime and economic growth in every quarter.\"  At the same time, he also appeared to \nacknowledge with regret some of the failings of his administration saying,  \"I give my thanks to you, the British \npeople for the times that I have succeeded and my apologies for the times I have fallen short.\" In what some \ninterpreted as a nuanced reference to British involvement in the Iraq war, Blair also said, \"I may have been wrong, \nbut I did what I thought was right for our country.\"\n\nNow with Blair's departure imminent, attention turned to his likely successor. The head of the Treasury, Chancellor \nof the Exchequer Gordon Brown, has been viewed as Blair's \"heir apparent\" for some time.  With several leading \nmembers of the Labour Party bowing out, Brown was expected to win the party's internal contest for the leadership \nposition.\n\nIn the third week of June 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown officially became the new leader of the United Kingdom's \nLabour Party.  The move came days before outgoing Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to step down as the \nBritish head of government on June 27, 2007.  On that day, Brown would become the new prime minister and head \nof government in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Brown praised Blair for his service to the Labour Party and to the country, and promised \nto forge not merely political policies, but also a \"soul\" for the country's leading political party, as it responded to the \nchanging needs of the British people.  To this end, he began his speech stating, \"It is with humility, pride and a \ngreat sense of duty that I accept the privilege and the great responsibility of leading our party and changing our \ncountry.\"  On policy, he identified priority areas as being education, affordable housing, childhood poverty, \nconstitutional reform, and modernizing the National Health Service (NHS).  In the area of foreign affairs, Brown said \nthat lessons had to be learned, and he acknowledged the divisive nature of the war in Iraq.\n\nIn other developments in the Labour Party, Harriet Harman won a slim victory over five rivals to take the position as \ndeputy party leader, thus succeeding John Prescott.  Brown announced that Deputy Leader Harman would also act \nas party chairman, and he noted that all party members would have a say in the development of policy initiatives.  \nNo deputy prime minister was announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the change in leadership at the helm of the Labour Party appeared to be yielding positive results for a \nparty that had suffered waning public support in recent times.  Now, an Ipsos/Mori opinion poll showed that support \nfor the Labour Party had risen to 39 percent in June 2007, while both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats \nhad lost support, with the two parties slipping to 36 percent and 15 percent respectively.\n\nOn June 27, 2007, Tony Blair issued his resignation from office to the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, following \na short private meeting.  As he left parliament for the final time, Blair received a rousing standing ovation. He also \ntraveled to his constituency of Sedgefield where he bid farewell to local party members following his tenure as their \nparliamentarian for 24 years.  Blair was set to move on to work as the new Middle East peace envoy for the Middle \nEast quartet, composed of the European Union, the United Nations, United States and Russia.\n\nBlair's exit was followed by the Queen appointing Gordon Brown, as the head of the Labour Party, to be the United \nKingdom's new prime minister.  Queen Elizabeth II also spent almost an hour in a private audience with Brown.  In \nhis first address as head of government, Prime Minister Brown said, \"Let the work of change begin.\" He  pledged to \nmeet his expressed policy goals \"try my utmost\" \u2013 a reference to his student motto.  Just before entering 10 \nDowning Street, Prime Minister Brown said, \"I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action in the \nservice of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.\"\n\nA new cabinet was announced a day later on June 28, 2007, with significant changes at stake. Every portfolio in \ncabinet, with the exception of Defense Minister Des Brown, was changed.  Certain key Blairites were leaving the \npolitical scene.  John Reid was retiring as Home Secretary and Patricia Hewitt was resigning both as Health \nSecretary and from government.  Margaret Beckett was leaving the role of Foreign Secretary. Of note was the fact \nthat the country would have its first female Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.  A stalwart of the Brown camp, Alistair \nDarling, was set to become the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, while David Miliband was the new Foreign \nSecretary.  Jack Straw was to become the new Justice Secretary.\n\nThe new cabinet convened on June 28, 2007 for the first time.\n\nNew Prime Minister Confronts Renewed Threat of Terrorism\n\nOn June 29, 2007, two cars loaded with explosives, nails and gas cylinders, were found in London.  Neither car \ndetonated, thus sparing people from the potential violence and loss of life that might have been caused by the car \nbombs exploding.  A day later, a burning vehicle, also loaded with gas cylinders, rammed into the main terminal of \nGlasgow Airport in Scotland.  Again, that incident yielded no loss of life.\n\nThe attempted attack in Glasgow was deemed to be related to the two earlier attempted attacks in London.\n\n\n\nBritish authorities later said that all three incidences were clearly attempted acts of terrorism attributable to \nassociates of al-Qaida.  Several people were soon arrested in connection with the apparent terror plot, including the \ntwo individuals responsible for driving the burning Jeep into the airport at Glasgow.  Also included in those detained \nwere a handful of doctors studying or practicing medicine in the United Kingdom.  Searches were being carried out \nacross the country for others who might have been involved in these attempted acts of terrorism.  At least one \nsuspect was said to be \"on the run.\"  None of the suspects were said to be of British origin, with certain suspects \nbeing identified as being of  Iraqi and Jordanian background.\n\nThe timing of the incidences -- about two years after the July 2005 terror attacks on London's transit system, along \nwith the fact that Gordon Brown had only assumed governing power days before -- appeared to be significant.  \nNevertheless, Prime Minister Brown signaled his intent to take the threat of terrorism in the United Kingdom \nseriously,  raising the terror alert in the country to \"critical,\" and urging the British people to stay \"constantly vigilant\" \nagainst what he warned would be a \"long-term and sustained threat.\"  In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister \nBrown said, \"It's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country, but round the world - who're \nprepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians, irrespective of the religion of \nthese people who are killed or maimed.\" He also noted that his country would not yield, despite the violent intent of \nal-Qaida.\n\nHome Secretary Jacqui Smith was granted no grace period in her new position.  She convened meetings at the \ngovernment's emergency response unit, known by the name Cobra.  Following the fourth Cobra meeting within the \nspace of days, Smith noted that the British people would not be intimidated and that life would go on as ever.  She \nalso announced that a formal statement would be offered before the House of Commons on July 2, 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, attention was turning toward the authorization to hold terror suspects for up to 90 days without charges \nbeing levied.  This measure had been defeated a few years prior in parliament by a coalition of Conservative, \nLiberal Democratic and Labour backbenchers, however, in light of the current landscape, it was expected to be \nrevived.\n\nOther Developments\n\nThe close of July 2007 saw new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hold official talks with his American \ncounterpart, United States President George W. Bush, for the first time since succeeding Tony Blair.  The two \nheads of government  met at Camp David in the United States. At issue was the state of the trans-Atlantic \nrelationship, given Tony Blair's exit from the office of the prime minister, and Brown's entry into that role.  Brown \nsignaled goodwill by noting that the world owed the United States a debt of gratitude for its leadership in the global \nwar on terror.  Yet unknown was the matter of whether or not there would be a change in the United Kingdom's role \nin Iraq.\n\nThen, on October 8, 2007, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that his country's troops in Iraq would be \nreduced to 2,500 by the spring of 2008.  Speaking to parliamentarians, Brown said that the reduction was possible \nbecause Iraqis were now better positioned to take responsibility for their own security.  He also noted that the \nhandover of Basra would ensue on a phased basis.\n\nTwo days before British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the reduction of troops in Iraq, he said that he \nwould not be calling an election anytime soon, since he needed time to put forth his \"vision\" for the United \nKingdom.  The political opposition blasted the move, saying that Brown was opting out of an immediate election \ncontest because of his party's poor polling numbers.\n\nSpecial Entry:\n\nGlobal credit crisis; effects felt in Europe\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nA financial farrago,  rooted in the credit crisis, became a global phenomenon by the start of October 2008. In the \nUnited States, after failure of the passage of a controversial bailout plan in the lower chamber of Congress, an \namended piece of legislation finally passed through both houses of Congress.  There were hopes that its passage \nwould calm jitters on Wall Street and restore confidence in the country's financial regime.\n\nHowever, a volatile week on Wall Street followed, most sharply characterized by a precipitous 18 percent drop of \nthe Dow Jones.  With the situation requiring rapid and radical action, a new proposal for the government to bank \nstakes was gaining steam. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe, with banks also in jeopardy of failing, and with \nno coordinated efforts to stem the tide by varying countries of the European Union, there were rising anxieties not \nonly about the resolving the financial crisis, but also about the viability of the European bloc.\n\nNevertheless, European leaders were able to forge an agreement aimed at easing the credit crunch in that region of \nthe world.  Following is an exploration, first, of the situation in the United States, and, second, of the situation \nunfolding in Europe.\n\nReport:\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2008, as the United States was reeling from the unfolding credit crisis, Europe's banking sector was \nalso hit by its own woes  when the Dutch operations of the European banking and insurance entity, Fortis, was \npartly nationalized in an effort to prevent its ultimate demise.  Radical action was spurred by anxieties that Fortis \nwas too much of a banking and financial giant to be allowed to fail.  The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg \nforged an agreement to contribute more than 11 billion euros (approximately US$16 billion) to shore up  Fortis, \nwhose  share price fell precipitously due to worries about its bad debts.\n\nA day later, the  mortgage lender -- Bradford and Bingley -- in the United Kingdom was  nationalized when the \nBritish government took control of the bank's  mortgages and loans.  Left out of the nationalization scheme were the \nsavings and branch operations, which were  sold off to Santander of Spain. Earlier, the struggling mortgage lender, \nNorthern Rock, had itself been nationalized.  The head of the British Treasury,  Alistair Darling, indicated that  \"big \nsteps\" that would not normally be taken were in the offing, given the unprecedented nature of the credit crisis.\n\nOn the same day, financial  woes came to a head in Iceland when the government was compelled to seize control \nof the country's third-largest bank , Glitnir, due to financial problems and fears that it would go insolvent.\n\nIceland was said to be in serious financial trouble, given the fact that its liabilities were in gross excess of the \ncountry's GDP.  Further action was anticipated in Iceland, as a result.\n\nOn Sept 30, 2008, another European bank -- Dexia -- was the victim of the intensifying global banking and financial \ncrisis.  In order to keep Dexia afloat, the governments of France, Belgium,  and Luxembourg convened talks and \nagreed to contribute close to 6.5 billion euros (approximately US$9 billion) to keep Dexia from suffering a demise.\n\nOnly days later, the aforementioned Fortis bank returned to the forefront of the discussion in Europe.  Belgian Prime \nMinister Yves Leterme said he was hoping to locate a new owner with the aim of restoring  confidence in Fortis, \nand thusly,  preventing a further downturn in the markets.  Leterme said that the authorities were considering \ntakeover bids for the Belgian operations of the company (the Dutch operations were nationalized as noted above.)\n\nBy Sept. 5, 2008, one of Germany's biggest banks, Hypo Real Estate, was at risk of failing.  In response, German \nChancellor Angela Merkel said she would exhaust all efforts to save the bank.  A rescue plan by the government \nand banking institutions was eventually agreed upon at a cost of 50 billion euros (approximately US$70 billion).  \nThis agreement involved a higher cost than was previously discussed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as intimated above, Iceland was enduring further financial shocks to its entire banking system.  As \nsuch, the government of Iceland was involved in intense discussions aimed at saving the country's financial regime, \nwhich were now at severe risk of collapse due to insolvency of the country's commercial banks.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sept. 4, 2008, the leaders of key European states -- United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy -- \nmet in the French capital city of Paris to discuss the financial farrago and to consider possible action.  The  talks, \nwhich were hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended without consensus on what should be done to deal \nwith the credit crisis, which was rapidly becoming a global phenomenon.  The only thing that the four European \ncountries agreed upon was that  there would not be a grand rescue plan, akin to the type that was initiated in the \nUnited States.  As well, they  jointly called for more greater regulation and a coordinated response.  To that latter \nend, President Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"Each government will operate with its own methods and means, but in a \ncoordinated manner.\"\n\nThis call came after Ireland took independent action to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis.\n\nNotably, the Irish government decided days earlier  to fully guarantee all deposits in the country's major banks for a \nperiod of two years.  The Greek government soon followed suit with a similar action.  These  actions by Ireland and \nGreece raised the ire of other European countries, and evoked questions of whether Ireland and Greece had \nviolated any European Union charters.  An investigation by the European Union was pending into whether or not \nIreland's guarantee of all savings deposits was anti-competitive in nature.\n\nNevertheless, as anxieties about the safety of bank deposits rose across Europe, Ireland and Greece saw an influx \nof new banking customers from across the continent, presumably seeking the security of knowing their money \nwould be safe amidst a financial meltdown.\n\nAnd even with questions rising about the decisions of the Irish and Greek government, the government of Germany \ndecided to go down a similar path by guaranteeing all private bank accounts. For his part, British Prime Minister \nGordon Brown said that his government would increase  the limit on guaranteed bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \n\u00a350,000.\n\nIn these various ways, it was clear that there was no concurrence among some of Europe's most important \neconomies. In fact, despite the meeting in France, which called for coordination among the countries of the \nEuropean bloc, there was no unified response to the global financial crisis.  Instead, that  meeting laid bare the \ndivisions within the countries of the European Union, and called  into question the very viability of the European \nbloc.\n\nPerhaps that question of viability would be answered at a forthcoming G8 summit, as recommended by those \nparticipating in the Paris talks.\n\nA week later, another meeting of European leaders  in Paris ended with concurrence that no large institution would \nbe allowed to fail.  The meeting, which was attended by leaders of euro zone countries,\n\nresulted in an agreement to guarantee loans between banks until the end of 2009, with an eye on easing the credit \ncrunch.  The proposal, which would apply in 15 countries, also included a plan for capital infusions by means of \npurchasing preference shares from banks.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which is outside the euro zone,  had already announced a similar strategy.  Indeed,  British \nPrime Minister Gordon Brown gained cachet for his steady handling of the financial crisis.  Brown said that his \ngovernment had to be the \"rock of stability\" during the crisis and explained that injections of capital by the British \nTreasury and the government takeover of banks was \"unprecedented but necessary.\"\n\n\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy  argued that these unprecedented measures  were of vital importance.  The \nFrench leader said, \"The crisis has over the past few days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for \nprocrastination and a go-it-alone approach.\"\n\nHe also tried to ease growing frustration that such measures would benefit the wealthy by explaining that the \nstrategy would not constitute  \"a gift to banks.\"\n\nWhile these developments were aimed at restoring confidence in the financial regime in Europe, Iceland continued \nto struggle.  Indeed, the country's economy stood precipitously close to collapse.  Three banks, including the \ncountry's largest one -- Kaupthing  -- had to be rescued by the government.  Landsbanki and Glitnir had been \nnationalized.  A spokesperson for Iceland's Financial Supervisory Authority  said, \"The action taken... was a \nnecessary first step in achieving the objectives of the Icelandic government and parliament to ensure the continued \norderly operation of domestic banking and the safety of domestic deposits.\"\n\nWith the country in a state of economic panic, trading on the OMX Nordic Exchange  was suspended temporarily, \nalthough it was expected to reopen on October 13, 2008.  Once re-opened, the OMX Nordic Exchange experienced \na high degree of volatility -- initially plunging before recouping some losses.  \n\nIceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde said that his country was considering whether to seek assistance from  the \nInternational Monetary Fund to weather the crisis.  As well, Iceland's Central Bank drew upon more than half-billion \ndollars from Scandinavian  swap facility, thus enabling access to euros as the stock exchange reopened after a \ntemporary suspension, as discussed above.\n\nIceland was also courting financial assistance from Russia; to that end, Icelandic authorities were seeking a loan \nfrom Moscow of about four billion euros or $5.5 billion USD.  \n\nIceland was also ensconced in a mini-imbroglio with the United Kingdom over that country's decision to freeze \nIcelandic bank assets.  At issue was the United Kingdon's reaction to the unfolding crisis in Iceland, which the \nBritish authorities said left deposits by its own citizens at risk.  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown particularly \ncondemned the government of Iceland for its poor stewardship of the situation and also its failure to  guarantee \nBritish savers' deposits (Icelandic domestic deposits, by contrast, had been guaranteed by the country's Financial \nSupervisory Authority).\n\nThat said, the United Kingdom Treasury was eventually able to arrange for some British deposits to Kaupthing to be \nmoved under the control of ING Direct.  There were also arrangements being made for a payout to Landsbanki's \ndepositors.\n\nEurope facing financial crisis as banking bail-out looms large in early 2009:\n\nAccording to the European Commission, European banks may be in need of as much as several trillion in bailout \nfunding. Impaired or toxic assets factor highly on the European Union bank balance sheets, with credit default \nswaps on Irish debt running at 355 basis points higher at the time of writing -- the highest rate in Europe and well on \nits way down the path of Iceland. Anxieties were so high in Dublin that tens of thousands of people took to the \nstreets to protest the growing financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the housing bubble was deleteriously affecting the United Kingdom, with anxieties being \nstoked about whether British banks could at all be saved.\n\nIn Spain, unemployment was in double digit territory and industrial production plunged 20 percent from where it was \na year earlier. It was anticipated that credit default swaps for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece would double over \n\n\n\nthe course of the next year. In other parts of Europe, according to economist Nouriel Roubini, the economies of \nUkraine, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania appeared to be on the brink of disaster.\n\nRegarding Ukraine, there were fears that it would might not abide with terms of a loan from the International \nMonetary Fund and thusly default on its debt. Meanwhile in Poland, the currency was falling and in Russia, even as \nthe rouble fell, the Kremli warned of economic contraction.\n\nOverall, Eastern European countries borrowed heavily from Western European banks. Thus, even if the currencies \non the eastern part of the continent collapse, effects will be felt in the western part of Europe as well. For example, \nSwiss banks that gave billions of credit to Eastern Europe cannot look forward to repayment anytime soon. As well, \nAustrian banks have had extensive exposure to Eastern Europe, and can anticipate a highly increased cost of \ninsuring its debt.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has warned that as many as 16 European Union countries will require \nassistance. Indeed, his statements suggest the need for a regional rescue effort. Of consideration is the fact that, \naccording to the Maastricht Treaty, state-funded bailouts are prohibited.\n\nBy the close of February 2009, it was announced that the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe would \nreceive a rescue package of $31 billion, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the \nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. The rescue package was aimed at assisting the survival of \nsmall financial institutions and included equity and debt financing, as well as access to credit and risk insurance \naimed at encouraging lending.\n\nEuropean Union backs financial regulation overhaul:\n\nWith the global financial crisis intensifying, leaders of European Union countries backed sweeping financial \nregulations. Included in the package of market reforms were sanctions on tax havens, caps on bonus payments to \nmanagement, greater hedge fund regulation, and increased influence by the International Monetary Fund. \nEuropean leaders also backed a charter of sustainable economic activity, that would subject all global financial \nactivities to both regulation and accountability by credit rating agencies.\n\nThese moves were made ahead of the Group of 20 summit scheduled for April 2, 2009, in London. It was not \nknown whether other countries outside Europe, such as the United States, Japan, India and China, would support \nthe new and aggressive regime of market regulation. That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin \nthat Europe had a responsibility to chart this track. She said, \"Europe will own up to its responsibility in the world.\"\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in Washington did not provide particularized feedback on the measures \nbeing pushed forward in Europe. However, the Obama administration indicated that it wanted to work with the \ninternational community to advance improvements, including regulation, to the financial regime.\n\nLeaders forge $1 trillion deal at G-20 summit in London\n\nLeaders of the world's largest economies, known as the \"G-20,\" met in London to explore possible responses to the \nglobal financial crisis. To that end, they forged a deal valued at more than one trillion dollars (USD).\n\nCentral to the agreement was an infusion of $750 billion to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was aimed \nat helping troubled economies. Up to $100 billion of that amount was earmarked to assist the world's very poorest \ncountries -- an amount far greater than had been expected. In many senses, the infusion of funding to the IMF \nmarked a strengthening of that body unseen since the 1980s.\n\nIn addition, the G-20 leaders settled on a $250 billion increase in global trade. The world's poorest countries would \nalso benefit from the availability of $250 billion of trade credit.\n\nAfter some debate, the G-20 leaders decided to levy sanctions against clandestine tax havens and to institute strict \nfinancial regulations. Such regulations included tougher controls on banking professionals' salaries and bonuses, \n\n\n\nand increased oversight of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. A Financial Stability Board was to be \nestablished that would work in concert with the IMF to facilitate cross-border cooperation, and also to provide early \nwarnings regarding the financial system.\n\nAside from these measures, the G-20 countries were already implementing their own economic stimulus measures \nat home, aimed at reversing the global recession. Together, these economic stimulus packages would inject \napproximately $5 trillion by the end of 2010.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown played host at the meeting, which most concurred went off \nsuccessfully, despite the presence of anti-globalization and anarchist protestors. Prime Minister Brown warned that \nthere was \"no quick fix\" for the economic woes facing the international community, but he drew attention to the \nconsensus that had been forged in the interest of the common good. He said, \"This is the day that the world came \ntogether to fight back against the global recession, not with words, but with a plan for global recovery and for reform \nand with a clear timetable for its delivery.\"\n\nAll eyes were on United States President Barack Obama, who characterized the G-20 summit as \"a turning point\" in \nthe effort towards global economic recovery. He also hailed the advances agreed upon to reform the failed \nregulatory regime that contributed to the financial crisis that has gripped many of the economies across the globe. \nThusly, President Obama declared the London summit to be historic saying, \"It was historic because of the size and \nthe scope of the challenges that we face and because of the timeliness and the magnitude of our response.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, there were reports of a growing rift between the respective duos of France and Germany -- \nand -- the United States and the United Kingdom. While France and Germany were emphasizing stricter financial \nregulations, the United States and the United Kingdom were advocating public spending to deal with the economic \ncrisis. Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy had threatened to bolt the meeting if his priority issues were not \naddressed. But such an end did not occur, although tensions were existent.\n\nTo that end, President Obama was hailed for his diplomatic skills after he brokered an agreement between France \nand China on tax havens. The American president played the role of peacemaker between French President \nSarkozy and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao, paving the way for a meeting of the minds on the matter of tax havens.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the concurrence reached at the G-20 summit were \"more than we could \nhave hoped for.\" President Sarkozy also credited President Obama for the American president's leadership at the \nsummit, effusively stating: \"President Obama really found the consensus. He didn't focus exclusively on stimulus ... \nIn fact it was he who managed to help me persuade [Chinese] President Hu Jintao to agree to the reference to the \n... publication of a list of tax havens, and I wish to thank him for that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also expressed positive feedback about the success of the summit \nnoting that the new measures would give the international arena a \"clearer financial market architecture.\" She \nnoted that the agreement reached was \"a very, very good, almost historic compromise.\" Finally, Chancellor Merkel \nhad warm words of praise for President Obama. \"The American president also put his hand into this,\" said Merkel.\n\nNote: The G-20 leaders agreed to meet again in September 2009 in New York to assess the progress of their \nagenda.\n\nSpecial Entry: \n\n\"Real IRA\" claims responsibility for attack on British army base\n\nMarch 2009 was marked by an attack by two gunmen at an army base, which left two soldiers dead. Both soldiers \nwere due to be deployed to Afghanistan.  At the Antrim army base, the gunmen also injured four people, including \ntwo pizza delivery men.  The incident marked the first killing of soldiers in Northern Ireland since the assassination \nof Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick in 1997.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the attack as \"evil\" and vowed that it would not impeded the peace \nprocess. He also promised to bring those responsible to justice saying, \"We will do everything in our power to make \nsure that Northern Ireland is safe and secure and I assure you we will bring these murderers to justice.\"\n\nGerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, characterized the attack as and attempt to derail the peace process and \nnoted that it was \"wrong and counter-productive.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness, who was a former member of the Irish Republican Army \n(IRA), decried the attack saying, \"I supported the IRA during the conflict, I myself was a member of the IRA but that \nwar is over. Now the people responsible for that last night's incident are clearly signaling that they want to resume \nor restart that war.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson, who was also  Democratic Unionist Party leader, said that cast the \nattack as a \"terrible reminder of the events of the past.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the \"Real IRA\" claimed responsibility.  The \"Real IRA\" emerged due to a split within \nthe Provisional IRA in 1997 due to Sinn Fein's decision to participate in the peace process.  The \"Real IRA\" was \nbehind the bombing of the County Tyrone town of Omagh that left 29 people dead in 1998.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nJune 2009 saw British Prime Minister Gordon Brown try to hold onto power by carrying out a cabinet reshuffle.  At \nissue was an unfolding scandal involving the expense accounts of parliamentarians. The matter contributed to a \nwave of resignations from parliamentarians within Prime Minister  Brown's cabinet, including Home Secretary \nJacqui Smith and Communities and Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears.\n\nBut the decision to keep Chancellor Alistair Darling in his post as the head of the Treasury, despite the allegations \nthat he inappropriately charged services to his parliamentary account, was decried even from within the Labour \nParty.  Indeed,  Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell said he was resigning  \"for the good of the Labor \nParty\" and expressed no confidence in Prime Minister Brown himself.  Defense Secretary John Hutton, however, \nexpressed support for the prime minister, who himself was accountable for the sage.  Prime Minister Brown said, \"I \nadmit mistakes have been made and I accept full responsibility.\"  He promised an independent audit of \nparliamentarians' expense accounts, pledge to stamp out the abuses, and expend his effort on economic recovery \nand political reform.\n\nIn the background of the political chaos for Prime Minister Brown's government were local English elections, as well \nas elections to the parliament of the European Union.  Observers noted that if Brown's Labour Party fared badly in \nthese two sets of elections, it would intensify the calls for either the prime minister's resignation -- or -- snap \nelections. Either option would not bode well for the political fate of the Labour Party.\n\nTo that end, the Labour Party suffered a trouncing at the local level.  Indeed, the party was no longer in control of \nany country council in the country. Results showed Conservatives winning 38 percent of the vote, the Liberal \nDemocrats took 28 percent, and the Labour Party slid into decline with a poor 23 percent showing.\n\nIn European Union elections, Labour also suffered a weak third place performance. The Conservatives took little \nsolace in the fact that they were unable to significantly increase their share of seats at the European parliament. \nPerhaps more important was the success of small parties, including the extreme right-wing British Nationalist Party, \nwhich gained representation to the dismay of both the Labour Party and the Conservatives.  But that result was \nexpected to hit Brown and Labour most hard, with those from within the party blaming the ongoing  political chaos \non the outcome that an extremist political party would have seats in Brussels.\n\nWith an increasing chorus for snap elections to be held, broader polling data indicated that the Labour Party (at 22 \npercent support) was now trailing the Liberal Democratic Party (25 percent) in popular support for the first time in \nmore than two decades. The expense scandal was largely to blame for the loss of support, although the \n\n\n\nConservatives, who polled highest (40 percent), were also viewed as having been damaged as a result of the \nscandal, suggesting that voters were generally disillusioned by the politicians of the two main parties. In this way, \nthe Liberal Democrats were the only major party to see a marked amplification in political fortune.\n\nScotland's jurisprudence came under fire in the aftermath of the decision to free  Abdel Baset al-Megrahi -- the man \nresponsible for the bombing of the Pan American flight that exploded over the town of Lockerbie in 1988.  \nScotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill justified the decision on compassionate grounds since al-Magrahi \nwas terminally ill with prostate cancer.  MacAskill said the decision \"was not based on political, economic or \ndiplomatic considerations\"  but was one that he made alone and he would have to live with the consequences.  \nMacAskill conceded that Libya had acted wrongly by giving al-Megrahi a hero's welcome when he arrived back \nhome on Libyan soil. In an address to parliament, he said, \"It is a matter of great regret that Mr. Megrahi was \nreceived in such an inappropriate manner. It showed no compassion or sensitivity to the families of the 270 victims \nof Lockerbie.\"  Indeed, the matter has been a source of embarrassment for the Scots at home who were chagrined \nto see their flag being waved in Libya in support for the return of a convicted terrorist.\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic -- and home to many of the Lockerbie victims -- the United States Department of \nState made it clear that it \"passionately\" disagreed with the decision.  Still, the United States acknowledged that the \nmatter would not rupture good relations with the United Kingdom.  State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said: \n\"We made it quite clear that we disagreed passionately with this decision, because we thought it sent the wrong \nsignal to, not only the families, but also to terrorists. But I really discourage you from thinking that we necessarily \nhave to have some kind of tit-for-tat retaliation because of it. I just don't see it - not with Britain.\"  That said, there \nremained grassroots rumblings of a trade boycott of Scotland as a result of the situation.\n\nThe case became marred by further controversy after a Times of London news story was published suggesting  an \n\"oil for freedom\" deal between Libya and the United Kingdom.  But on Aug. 31, 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown said that al-Megrahi was not released as part of an oil exploration deal with Libya.  The office of the prime \nminister insisted there was no deal associated with the release of al-Megrahi,  and denied the Times of London \ncharge that the move was made in order to facilitate oil exploration rights in Libya by the British energy company, \nBritish Petroleum.\n\nIn November 2009, former Prime Minister Tony Blair's role in the rationale for the Iraq war re-emerged.  According \nto the British newspaper, the Telegraph, secret documents indicated a \"critical failure\" in the  government's case for \nwar in Iraq.  The Telegraph alleged that in 2002,  former Prime Minister Tony Blair misled the public and parliament \nwhen he said that the United Kingdom's objective was \"disarmament, not regime change\" and there was no plan for \nmilitary action. Instead, the documents reportedly showed that there was indeed preparation for the invasion and \nand overthrow of the regime of  Saddam Hussein in 2002. The documents also reportedly showed that British \nforces were unprepared and poorly equipped for the 2003 invasion. The Telegraph did not confirm whether or not it \nwould publish the secret documents that formed the basis for the news article.\n\nIn the first week of 2010, two former British cabinet ministers challenged the authority of British Prime Minister \nGordon Brown by calling for a secret ballot on his leadership.  The call, which was issued by Geoff Hoon and \nPatricia Hewitt of Brown's own ruling Labour Party, came only months ahead of general elections in the United \nKingdom.  In a letter to fellow Labour Party parliamentarians, Hoon and Hewitt wrote: \"As we move towards a \ngeneral election, it remains the case that the Parliamentary Labour Party is deeply divided over the question of the \nleadership.  Many colleagues have expressed their frustration at the way in which this question is affecting our \npolitical performance. We have therefore come to the conclusion that the only way to resolve this issue would be to \nallow every member to express their view in a secret ballot.\"  The office of the prime minister rejected the call for \nsuch a vote on Brown's leadership, in fact characterizing the move as \"ludicrous\" and unhelpful to  the Labour \nParty ahead of the general election.  While the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Tony Lloyd, said there \nwas \"very little support\" for a secret vote on Brown's leadership, there were nonetheless elements within the party \n\n\n\nwho have viewed Brown's performance as a likely death knell to their electoral prospects.  Indeed, polling data \nahead of the anticipated elections have shown the opposition Conservatives with a double-digit lead over Labour. \n\nOn January 29, 2010, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his decision to draw his country into the \nUnited States-led invasion of Iraq and ensuing war, explaining that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks changed \nthe way in which the threat of terrorism could be viewed.  Speaking at a commission charged with inquiring into the \nevents leading to British involvement in the Iraq war, Blair said: \"Here's what changed for me: the whole calculus of \nrisk. The point about this terrorist act was over 3,000 people had been killed, an absolutely horrific event. But if \nthese people -- inspired by this religious fanaticism -- could have killed 30,000, they would have.\"  He went on to \nexplain that terrorism with a direct political purpose, such as violence by the Irish Republican Army,  was \"within a \nframework you could understand.\"  He also suggested that before the terror attacks of 2001, the policy of \ncontainment against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq made sense.  However, Blair testified that the terror attacks \nof 2001 were of such a different variety that it required action against countries such as Iran, Libya, North Korea, \nand Iraq.\n\nOn Feb. 23, 2010, a car bomb exploded close to a court house and popular cafes and bars in the city of Newry in \nNorthern Ireland.  The explosion was blamed on Irish  republican dissidents, according to authorities on the scene.  \nNo one was hurt as a result of the attack.  Anonymous warnings were issued to businesses and a hospital stating \nthat a bomb would explode within 30 minutes.  In actuality, the car bomb was detonated less than 20 minutes after \nthe warnings were issued.  The bombing occurred only weeks after a  compromise deal was struck, aimed at \ntransferring responsibility for the justice system (police and courts) to the government of Northern Ireland. That \ncompromise deal was sanctioned by both the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein.  Because the bombing \noccurred close to a courthouse, there was some speculation that it was motivated by republican dissidents' \nfrustration over that agreement. For some time,  the justice system in Northern Ireland has been a source of \nconsternation with Catholics viewing the police and courts as unfairly favoring the majority Protestant population.  \nSee \"Appendix\" for more details related to Northern Ireland.\n\nA spy scandal that implicated Israeli nationals on March 23, 2010 led to the decision by the United Kingdom to \nexpel an Israeli  diplomat.  At issue was the use of forged British passports in the suspected Mossad  assassination \nof a Hamas commander,  Mahmoud Al Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel room.  The move came after an investigation into \nthe matter and was made official with an address by British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to parliamentarians in \nthe House of Commons.  To date,  Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the apparent targeted \nassassination of al-Mabhouh.\n\n2010 Parliamentary Elections\n\nSummary\n\nWith the votes counted, it was clear that the anticipated inconclusive election outcome had come to pass with no \nparty winning a clear majority. The last time a British election produced such a result was in 1974.  While the \nConservatives or Tories were set to become the largest party in parliament, they were yet short of a parliamentary \nmajority.  As expected, Labour lost their majority.  But with a \"hung parliament\" looming before the United \nKingdom, all eyes were on the Liberal Democrats, whose party was likely to be the most influential player in the \nelection.  To that end, the Liberal Democrats entered negotiations with both potential coalition partners, yielding \nmore positive results with the Conservatives rather than Labour.  As a result, Prime Minister Gordon Brown \nresigned as head of government, paving the way for David Cameron to become the new prime minister of the \nUnited Kingdom.\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nOn April 6, 2010, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that a general election would be held on May 6, \n2010.  He said the anticipated elections would allow the British citizenry to decide whether to give his Labour Party \na clear mandate for his main policy initiative: job creation. Prime Minister Brown sought consent from the head of \nstate,  Queen Elizabeth II, to dissolve parliament at a meeting in Buckingham Palace. He then said, \"It will come as \nno surprise to all of you, and it's probably the least well kept secret of recent years but the queen has kindly agreed \nto the dissolution of parliament and a general election will take place on May 6.\"\n\nThe actual dissolution of parliament was scheduled for April 12, 2010, offering less than one month for an election \ncampaign.  To that end, Prime Minister Brown indicated that his roots derived from an \"ordinary middle class family \nin an ordinary town\" had informed his desire to fight on behalf of families of modest means.  Prime Minister Brown \nalso emphasized his economic credentials by noting that the country was on the road to economic recovery, and \nthat the leader of government should get the \"big decisions right.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Conservative Party leader and opposition leader David Cameron expressed \ndelight that he would finally be able to commence campaigning.  For his part, Cameron offered up the \nConservatives or Tories as the party that would offer the United Kingdom a fresh start. Speaking to this theme, \nCameron said, \"If we win this election, there will be real change. You don't have to put up with another five years of \nGordon Brown.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was quick to offer a far more substantive transformation for British \ncitizens, noting that his party offered something completely new, as compared with the dichotomous old politics of \nthe two main parties.\n\nAhead of election day, British citizens would for the first time be subject to three televised debates between the \nthree main political leaders.  Traditional election themes of economic development, deficits, taxation, and public \nservice were expected to factor highly in those exchanges.\n\nPolling Data and the Debate Effect\n\nAt the time the election was called, polling data  showed the Conservatives were leading Labor, albeit by varying \nmargins. An ICM survey showed the Conservatives  (Tories) with 37 percent, Labour with 33 percent and the \nLiberal Democrats with 21 percent.  A survey by YouGov poll gave the Tories a 10 percent lead over Labour -- a \nnecessary margin if Cameron hoped to secure an outright parliamentary majority  (326 seats) in the United \nKingdom's \"first past the post\" system.\n\nBy mid-April 2010, following a televised debate among the three main parties' leaders, a shift of fortune had \nunfolded.  A strong performance by Clegg -- hitherto an unknown commodity on the British political landscape -- \nappeared to have resulted in increased  public support.  Snap polls conducted after the debate showed that Clegg \nwas the clear winner, according to the newspaper, the Telegraph.  Indeed,  a survey by YouGov for The Sun gave \nClegg the most impressive polling result with  51 percent of respondents favoring him, as compared with Cameron, \nwho had 29 percent, and Brown with 19 percent. Similar results were registered by a ComRes poll for ITV News, \nshowing  that 43 percent of respondents thought Clegg was the debate winner, compared to Cameron's 26 percent \nand Brown's 20 percent.  Sky News' text-message poll showed closer results but, again, with Clegg as the winner \nwith 37 percent; Brown was in second place with 32 percent and Cameron was in third place with 31 percent.\n\nWhile the public's perceptions of which political leader won the debate was not a clear indicator of voting \npreferences, it certainly opened the possibility  that the election contest was wider than originally conceived.  To this \nend, Jeremy John Durham Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrats leader, declared that Clegg's debate \nperformance had \"made this a three-way race.\" He continued, \"Nick made it clear that change to the Tories or to \nLabour is not change.\"\n\nWith an eye on electoral strategy, Ashdown said, \"If the Liberal Democrats can win 25 percent in the polls and \nLabour gets 27 percent, then you have changed the dynamic of this election.\"\n\n\n\nCleggs's success may have rested not only on his strong performance but on another factor.  Specifically, the \ndisaffection by the British electorate for the two major parties, partially fueled by the public's disgust regarding a \nparliamentarians' expense accounts.  That scandal, which forced several parliamentarians into early retirement \nahead of the polls, appeared to be pushing many voters toward a third viable option in the form of the Liberal \nDemocrats.\n\nIndeed, by the third week of April 2010, it was clear that the public's perception of the debate had actually \ntranslated into transformations in voters' preferences. A post-debate ComRes poll for the Independent showed the \nConservatives with a receding lead of 31 percent, the Liberal Democrats now surging past Labour into second \nplace with 29 percent, and Labour trailing with 27 percent.\n\nA YouGive poll actually  showed the Liberal Democrats now carrying a lead with 33 percent, the Tories in second \nplace with 33 percent, and Labour again in third place with 26 percent.  The polling variances notwithstanding, it \nwas apparent that in the United Kingdom's first past the post system, these forthcoming elections could well end in \na hung parliament.  With the rising fortune of the Liberal Democrats, there was now no party likely to have enough \nseats in parliament to form a majority government.\n\nAttention soon refocused on the second televised debate, which was to concentrate on foreign policy.  The two \ninstitutionalized parties were banking on Clegg's lack of expertise in this arena to reassert themselves in the \nelectoral race.  Indeed, the second debate was marked by fractious exchanges. Brown accused Cameron of being \n\"anti-European\" and Clegg of being \"anti-American.\"  Burnishing his internationalist credentials, Brown said: \"I am \nafraid David is anti-European, Nick is anti- American. Both of them are out of touch with reality.\" But Cameron \ncountered with a populist  argument, saying that decisions made in Brussels -- the headquarters of the European \nUnion -- should always be questioned in favor of the nationalist interests. Meanwhile, Clegg tried to outline what the \nLiberal Democrats' foreign policy would look like by saying, \"I want us to lead in the world and I want us to lead in \nEurope, not complain from the sidelines.\"\n\nDespite greater media scrutiny in the days leading up to the second debate, Clegg appeared to have pulled off \nanother debate victory with post-debate surveys showing him to be the winner again in the eyes of viewers.  A poll \nby ComRes showed that 33 percent of respondents believed Clegg to be the debate winner; both Brown and \nCameron garnered 30 percent respectively.  While Clegg's held a more modest advantage  the second time \naround, the public's reaction nonetheless demonstrated that he had surpassed the critics' expectations that he \nwould not fare as well, now that the novelty of a viable third choice had worn off.  It was yet to be seen how the third \ndebate, which would focus on the economy,  would affect the impending elections.\n\nIn the backdrop appeared to be a growing sense of anxiety among the Conservatives who, until recently, had \nexpected to defeat the incumbent Labour Party and cruise to victory. Now, their anticipated victory was slipping \naway. In many senses, the meteoric rise of the Liberal Democrats was translating into a far more complicated \nvoting landscape, which would not benefit the Conservatives' fortune at the polls.  Indeed, as noted by Foreign \nSecretary David Miliband, \"There is deep panic in the Tory ranks and in Tory-supporting newspapers.\"\n\nMiliband's reference to Tory-supporting newspapers related to a new trend by conservative journals to pillory Clegg \nover bank account contributions, which ultimately was resolved when the Liberal Democratic leader disclosed all \nthe banking details showing that there was no impropriety.\n\nIronically, as this dissonance was breaking out,  Clegg and the Liberal Democrats had found an unexpected ally in \nthe form of the  Labor Party, which had suddenly jumped to the defense of Clegg.  It was quite likely that Labour \nwas realistic about its prospects at the polls; Labour likely  realized that its only hope of hanging onto power would \ninvolve a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.\n\n\n\nFortune smiled on the anxiety-stricken Conservatives at the close of April 2010 when the party leaders participated \nin the third and final debate.  Tory leader, Cameron, was perceived as having won the debate by 36 percent of \nthose surveyed; 30 percent said Clegg won the debate, while 23 percent said Brown was the debate winner.\n\nThe  Angus Reid poll also showed that Tory leader, Cameron, enjoyed the best performance in that debate, and \nwas viewed as \"a better person to handle most economic policy issues.\" Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was \nviewed as having the best advantage when in came to connecting with undecided voters.  Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown suffered his  worst performance, despite his warning that a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats \nwould put the economy \"at risk.\"  Brown's debate performance aside, his election prospects were not helped by the \nfact that around the same time, he referred to a voter as a \"bigot\" spurring controversy, and fueling the flames of \nsuspicion that he had a temperament problem.\n\nIndeed, days ahead of the election, some of the earlier bloom on the Liberal Democrats appeared to have faded \nwith voters returning to their baseline preferences.  Polling data  by ComRes for ITV News and the Independent \nnewspaper at that time showed that the Conservatives had 37 percent support, Labour had 29 percent,  and the \nLiberal Democrats on 26 percent.  This data appeared in line with survey results from YouGov/Sun showing the \nConservatives with 35 percent, Labour with 30 percent, and the Liberal Democrats with 24 percent.\n\nElection Results\n\nWith the votes counted, it was clear that the anticipated inconclusive election outcome had come to pass with no \nparty winning a clear majority. The last time a British election produced such a result was in 1974.  In 2010, there \nwere suggestions that the inconclusive election result was tantamount to a no-confidence vote in government at \nlarge.  That being said, the Conservatives or Tories were set to become the largest party in parliament, event \nthough they had been denied a parliamentary majority  by the British voters.  As expected, Labour lost their \nmajority and was relegated to the second largest force in parliament.  But with a \"hung parliament\" looming before \nthe United Kingdom, all eyes were on the third place finisher -- the Liberal Democrats -- who were very likely to \nbecome the most influential player in the election.\n\nQuick to take control over the public relations aspect of the election result after winning his own constituency, \nConservative leader, David Cameron said, \"We have to wait for the full results, but it is clear the Labour \ngovernment has lost its mandate to govern this country.\"  But Foreign Secretary David Miliband of the Labour Party \npushed back saying in an interview with British Sky News, \"If no party has a majority in the House of Commons, no \nparty has a moral right to a monopoly of power.\" Prime Minister Brown appeared to acknowledge that the election \nresult delivered a message to the Labour Party, but stopped short of suggesting that the message was one of \ndefeat.  He said.  \"The voters have given us an injunction to talk to each other to see if strong and stable \ngovernment can be secured.\"  Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic leader, Nick Clegg, admitted his party's \ndisappointment that his strong debate performance had not translated into more parliamentary seats.  He called on \nall the political players to \"take a little time\" to ensure people got the government they deserved.\n\nThe full results ultimately gave the Tories  306 parliamentary seats --  short of the 326  needed to command control \nof 650-member House of Commons.  The Labour Party placed second with 258 seats.  The Liberal Democrats \nsecured 57 seats and the right to play kingmaker in the quest for the future government.  Also winning seats were \nthe nationalist Welsh and Scottish parties that could also become crucial players in coalition deal-making that was \nsure to follow.  As intimated above,  a \"hung parliament\" would necessitate the formation of a coalition government, \nwith the other parties expected to play crucial roles therein.  Absent from that group of likely players was the ultra-\nright wing British Nationalist Party, often regarded as xenophobic in orientation, which suffered dwindling support at \nthe polls.\n\nCoalition Prospects\n\nIn regards to the formation of a coalition government, both Cameron and Brown made it clear that they were looking \nto the Liberal Democrats for partnership in forming a coalition government. In a clear call for cooperation from \nLiberal Democratic leader, Clegg, Cameron said, \"I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the \nLiberal Democrats.\"  Cameron also urged a quick government formation process, noting the need to calm volatile \n\n\n\nmarkets that were in dire need of stabilizing moves. Meanwhile, Brown made a similar overture to the Liberal \nDemocrats.  For his part, Clegg made clear that the country and not party politics were at stake.  He said, \"It is vital \nthat all parties, all political leaders, act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage.\"\n\nBrown signaled quickly that he would welcome a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and indeed a Labour-Liberal \ncoalition would appear to be the easiest ideological alliance.  For example, the Liberal Democrats and Labour have \nagreed that spending cuts should not be imposed until a time when economic recovery in the United Kingdom has \nbeen advanced.  In contrast, the Conservatives have backed aggressive deficit reduction.\n\nBut Liberal Democratic-Labour synergy was especially emphasized by the fact that Labour has backed the Liberal \nDemocrats' biggest demand -- that of electoral reform. Indeed, in a bid to show solidarity with the third place \nfinisher, Brown said: \"My view is clear - there needs to be immediate legislation on this to begin to restore the \npublic trust in politics and to improve parliament's standing and reputation, a fairer voting system is central.\"\n\nNevertheless, Brown's cause would not be helped by the fact that Clegg made clear that he was not keen on Brown \nstaying on as prime minister, although he did not dismiss the idea of a coalition with Labour under the stewardship \nof another leader.  As well, Clegg said that with the Conservatives winning the most seats, they should have the \nfirst chance to try to form a government.  But whether or not such a government could include the Liberal \nDemocrats was yet to be seen.  Of concern for the Liberal Democrats has been the Tories' opposition to the notion \nof electoral reform to a proportional system.  Such a move would practically foreclose political domination of any \none party going forward -- an idea that has left the Tories balking in dismay.\n\nNonetheless, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats entered talks aimed at forging a possible coalition \narrangement.  Liberal Democratic leader, Clegg, laid down the proverbial gauntlet as he asserted:  \"It is now for the \nConservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.\"\n\nHis Tory counterpart, Cameron, offered his response saying, \"I want us to work together to tackle the debt crisis, \nsocial problems and the broken political system.\" It was yet to be seen whether or not these two statements by \nClegg and Cameron were signs of a foundation  for a forthcoming coalition.\n\nWhile both parties characterized their initial talks as \"constructive,\" there remained several unresolved issues. \nSignificantly, Cameron indicated that there would be little room for compromise in areas such as defense, relations \nwith the European Union, immigration, and the timing of public spending cuts. On that latter issue, Cameron said, \n\"The biggest threat is the deficit. Starting to deal with the deficit this year is essential.\"  As well, the aforementioned \nmatter of electoral reform continued to be a sticking point. The Conservatives were making clear electoral reform \nwould only be considered in a committee of inquiry, while the Liberal Democrats were affirming its priority status.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Brown appeared to acknowledge the reality of the political landscape with the Liberal \nDemocrats first engaging with the Conservatives.  Opening the door for possible talks between the any of the other \nparties and his Labour Party, Brown said, \"I understand and respect the position of Mr. Clegg in saying he first \nwishes to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party.\" He continued, \"Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg \nshould clearly be entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary. For my part I should make clear I should be \npleased to see any of the party leaders.\"\n\nPolitical wrangling was expected to dominate the landscape for the immediate future.  With no written constitution in \nthe United Kingdom, the job was left to senior civil service to craft rules aimed at the government formation \nprocess.  At the intra-party level, activists from all three parties were urging the respective leadership branches not \nto cede excessive accommodation in their discussions with potential coalition partners. Indeed, party loyalists  were \nconcerned about that seizing the levers of power  would come at too high a price to pay -- specifically, in the way of \ncore party principles.\n\nBy May 10, 2010, reports had emerged that a deal was in the works between the Liberal Democrats and the \nConservatives.  Central to that deal was a \"final offer\" by the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats to  hold a \n\n\n\nreferendum on electoral reform.  Another possible option would be a \"bare minimum\" agreement in which the \nLiberal Democrats would agree not to bring down the Conservative government in a confidence vote.\n\nWhether or not that deal would involve the Liberal Democrats as part of a coalition government, or, as the enablers \nof an effective minority Conservative government was yet to be seen.\n\nWith the Conservatives eagerly seeking to seal the deal via such  overtures, there were suggestions that a new \ngovernment might be afoot.  Moreover, Clegg , leader of the Liberal Democrats, appeared to place a stamp of \napproval on the deal-making process.  He said that he was  \"very grateful to David Cameron and his negotiation \nteam\" and noted that the negotiations yielded a \"great deal of progress.\"  Nevertheless, Clegg, leader of the Liberal \nDemocrats, sought to calm such speculation, asking instead for patience as the negotiations process was \nexhausted.  To that end, he said: \"Bear with us a little bit longer and we hope we will be able to provide you with full \nannouncement as soon as possible.\"  At the same time, the Liberal Democrats were indicating that they would not \nshut the door on negotiations with the Labour Party, however, such a move would be contingent upon Brown \nstepping down as prime minister.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to advance their prospects with the Liberal Democrats, on that same day -- May 10, 2010 -- \nGordon Brown announced he would indeed step down as Labour leader and prime minister  by September 2010.  \nThis move made it clear that Brown was inclined to put party and progressive principles before personal ambitions. \nIndeed, Brown noted that the United Kingdom was home to  a \"parliamentary and not presidential system\" and \nobserved that there was a \"progressive majority\" of voters.  In an attempt to show the Liberal Democrats that he \nwould not be a key player for long, Brown\n\nalso said that he would not participate in a forthcoming leadership race within the Labour Party, saying, \"I will play \nno part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate.\"\n\nClegg of the Liberal Democrats indicated tacit approval of the move saying. \"Gordon Brown has taken a difficult \npersonal decision in the national interest.\"\n\nThis statement came ahead of anticipated negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, with Clegg \nnoting that such talks would be  \"sensible and in the national interest.\"\n\nPolitical Change: Brown out; Cameron in\n\nOn May 11, 2010, it was clear there would be no Labour-Liberal Democratic coalition.  Thus, Gordon Brown \nresigned as prime minister of the United Kingdom, ending 13 years of Labour rule in that country.\n\nIn his resignation address to the British people, Brown said,  \"I loved the job not for its prestige, its titles and its \nceremony -- which I do not love at all. No, I loved the job for its potential to make this country I love fairer, more \ntolerant, more green, more democratic, more prosperous and more just - truly a greater Britain.\"  It was clear that  \nthe Labour Party would move into the position of being the only progressive option among the major parties on the \nBritish political scene.\n\nBrown's resignation paved the way for David Cameron to become prime minister.  To that end, Cameron went to \nBuckingham Palace to officially accept Queen Elizabeth II's request to form the next government of the United \nKingdom, and then entered 10 Downing Street at the country's new prime minister.  David Cameron had the \ndistinction of  being Britain's youngest head of government in about 200 years.\n\nCameron  lauded Gordon Brown for his years of public service and then gave some indication of the type of \nleadership to come.  Cameron said that his government's priorities would concentrate of immediate challenges, \nsuch as the debt crisis as well as the loss of public trust in the political system.  He warned that \"difficult decisions\" \nlaid ahead, but struck a positive tone saying he looked toward \"better times ahead\" for the British people.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Cameron said: \"I think the service our country needs right now is to face up to our big challenges, to \nconfront our problems, take difficult decisions, lead people through those decisions, so that together we can reach \nbetter times ahead.\"\n\nOn the matter of the type of government to be formed, it was yet to be determined of Cameron would be at the helm \nof a minority government, or would hold sway over a majority government with the help of the Liberal Democrats.  \nTo that end, Cameron said his objective was to  form a \"proper and full coalition\" with the Liberal Democrats, in the \ninterests of  \"strong, stable government.\"  Cameron added that he hoped he and\n\nNick Clegg could \"put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and the national interest.\"\n\nThat being said, Clegg had not yet received majority consent from members of parliament from his party, as well as \nthe federal executive ruling body of the party, to enter a coalition with the Conservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, members of both the Liberal Democrats and Labour began to offer explanations of the failure of their \nnegotiations.  From the perspective of the Liberal Democrats, the talks failed because Labour did not seem \nseriously invested in forging a reformist-minded, progressive government.  In fact, according to BBC News,  one \nspokesperson for the Liberal Democrats suggested that core members of the Labour team \"gave every impression \nof wanting the process to fail.\"  The spokesman said that some Labour cabinet ministers \"were determined to \nundermine any agreement by holding out on policy issues and suggesting that Labour would not deliver on \nproportional representation and might not marshal the votes to secure even the most modest form of electoral \nreform.\"\n\nBut on the other side of the equation, Labour suggested that the negotiations were fatally hindered by impediments \nerected by the Liberal Democrats.  Lord Mandelson of the Labour Party said in an interview with BBC News, that \nwhile his party sanctioned the notion of an agreement with the Liberal Democrats, that party \"created so many \nbarriers and obstacles that perhaps they thought their interests lay on the Tory side, on the Conservative side, \nrather than the progressive side.\"\n\nPost-Election Policy Agenda\n\nAt the broader level, the issue of economic and financial stability was at stake.  Indeed, the new government would \nhave to deal with formidable challenges as the United Kingdom grapples with recession and budget deficit \nreduction.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, the new coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick \nClegg held an unprecedented news conference aimed at delineating its policies, and demonstrating a sense of \ncoalition unity.  At the rhetorical level, Cameron said that the coalition government was emblematic of  a \"historic \nand seismic shift\" in the  political landscape of the United Kingdom.  He described the alliance as follows:  \"It will be \nan administration united behind three key principles: freedom, fairness and responsibility.\"  He continued, \"And it \nwill be an administration united behind one key purpose ... the strong and stable and determined leadership that we \nneed for the long term.\"\n\nAt stake would be the practical application of the allied interests of the center-right Conservatives and the center-left \nLiberal Democrats.  Of particular note was the compromise struck on  the timetable for a reduction of public \nspending.  To that end, the Liberal Democrats made the concession of signing onto the Conservatives' aggressive \nagenda to address the United Kingdom's debt woes.\n\n\n\nSuch a move, while necessary in practice, was likely to come with a political cost.  Resultantly, some analysts were \ncasting the new government as a kind of sacrificial lamb that would enact difficult but requisite economic policies.  \nSuch moves, though, could enrage the public and exact a political price in the longer term.\n\nAlso at stake was the Conservatives' concession to the Liberal Democrats -- electoral reform.  As noted above, \nagreement was forged on holding a referendum to ratify the proposed alternative voting system to replace the \nexisting \"first past the post\" system.  Should the move be ratified, then voters could specify two candidates in terms \nof ranking, with the vote for the top choice going to the alternate option if that top choice was ultimately eliminated.  \nIf implemented, the change could boost the presence of smaller party candidates in parliament.  Still, even \nagreement on a referendum was not reform-minded enough for the Liberal Democrats, however, that party could \ntake heart in changes to be made in the House of Lords where rolling elections would now be implemented.\n\nOne controversial proposal by the new coalition has been the plan for  fixed term parliaments.  In essence, the plan \nwould commit a government to a five-year tern, precluding the prime minister from calling an election at any time \nwithin a five year period.  While the current threshold for a no-confidence vote to bring down a government has \nbeen 50 percent plus one parliamentarian, the new rule would  provide for dissolution with the backing of 55 \npercent or more in parliament.\n\nIn the face of criticism, Cameron characterized the change as a good one.  However, members of his own party, as \nwell as the opposition Labour Party, have railed against it as potentially damaging for democracy.  Indeed, Tory \nChristopher Chope went further in characterizing the rule change as a \"recipe for anarchy.\"  He explained in an \ninterview with the BBC,  \"It could mean, in practice, that if the present government was to lose its majority in \nparliament, and wasn't able to operate as a minority government because it didn't enjoy the confidence of a \nsufficient number of MPs ... it would be able to carry on. But that would be basically a recipe for anarchy, because it \nwould mean that the government wouldn't have a majority.\"  Labour figures David Blunkett characterized the move \nas \"a stitch up\" while  Jack Straw said that it was  \"completely undemocratic and totally unworkable.\"\n\nIn terms of representation, the Liberal Democrats were given several important portfolios in Cameron's cabinet, not \nthe least of which was the position of deputy prime minister going to Clegg himself.  Other than Clegg, these \nincluded the first secretary to the treasury David Laws, Chris Huhne as energy secretary; and Vincent Cable as \nbusiness secretary.  That being said, the three key ministerial roles -- finance, foreign affairs and the home office -- \nwere to be held by Conservatives George Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May respectively.\n\nThe first test of the new Cameron-Clegg coalition government would come within 50 days with a vote on an \nemergency budget.  It would be a sign of  whether theoretical concurrence on policy could translate into practical \napplication.  It would also be a harbinger of the likely stability and viability of the Conservative-Liberal Democratic \nalliance.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Queen Elizabeth II presided over the  opening of a  new session of Britain's parliament.  \nFollowing tradition, the queen delivered the speech detailing the policy agenda of the incoming government, which \nis this case was that of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.  Consistent with the agreement forged \nbetween the two allied parties, that policy agenda included tackling  the country's problematic deficit, restoring \neconomic growth, and establishing a new Office for Budget Responsibility.  There were also plans for certain \nreforms to the political system, such as a referendum on a new voting system for members of the House of \nCommons, and, a proposal to make the House of Lords \"wholly or mainly elected,\" according to Queen Elizabeth II. \nAs well, there was the intent to abolish the notion of a national identity card. Encapsulating the thrust of the \nreformist agenda, the Queen announced: \"My government will propose parliamentary and political reform to restore \ntrust in democratic institutions and rebalance the relationship between the citizen and the state.\"\n\nForeign relations were on the agenda months later as the British-based energy company, British Petroleum (BP)\n\n\n\nwas in the news due to a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The disaster in Gulf intersected with global politics \nas BP was subject to increased scrutiny, ultimately resting on the question of whether that company played a role in \nthe early release of the Libyan Lockerbie bomber al-Megrahi (discussed above), and spurring  debate again as to \nwhether or not BP lobbied for his release in exchange for lucrative oil deals in Libya.\n\nIn fact, BP acknowledged that it had conveyed concern over the slow action being taken to transfer Megrahi out of \nBritish jurisdiction and home to Libya. The company stopped short of admitting that it played a part in the release of \nthe terrorist.\n\nAs well, British Prime Minister David Cameron, in the United States for meetings with President Barack Obama, \ndismissed a request for a new investigation into the matter. Scottish Secretary, Michael Moore, insisted before the \nHouse of Commons that the decision to release the Libyan terrorist was made \"in good faith.\" Still, with this scandal \nbrewing, pressure was building on both sides of the Atlantic -- in the United States for a investigation into the \nallegations against BP related to the bomber's release, and in the United Kingdom for a full and independent inquiry \ninto the bombing itself and the decision to grant a terrorist freedom on compassionate grounds.\n\nIn the autumn of 2010, following a battle for the leadership of the United Kingdom's Labor Party, Ed Miliband \nclaimed victory at the helm of the country's major opposition party.  Ed Miliband beat out his older, more well-known \nbrother former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, for the party's top post.  For his part, David Miliband said that he \nwould not be involved in Ed Miliband's leadership team, while the new Labor leader made clear that he would be \nforming his own shadow cabinet without his brother.\n\nOn May 6, 2011,  British voters rejected electoral reform in a highly-anticipated referendum.  Up to 69 percent of \nvoters opposed the change whole only 31 percent voted in its favor. At issue were proposed changes from a \"First \nPast The Post\" (FPTP) system to an \"Alternative Vote\" (AV) system.  While Conservative Prime Minister David \nCameron has eschewed this change, it was championed by hiscoalition partner, Nick Clegg of the Liberal \nDemocrats and the referendum itself was a key component of the coalition deal formed between the two parties at \nthe helm of power in the United Kingdom.  Now, with the proposal going down to defeat, a season of discontent was \nexpected to prevail between the two coalition partners.  That coalition was formed in the aftermath of the \ninconclusive  2010 general election, which brought an end to the 13-year  rule of the Labor Party but gave no party \nan outright majority to form a government.  Following coalition talks, the Conservatives entered a pact with the \ncenter-left Liberal Democrats, and formed a government.  As noted here, the coalition deal was contingent upon the \nholding of this referendum.  With the vote out of the way and the cause of electoral reform almost lost, Clegg and \nthe Liberal Democrats were being left in a weakened position in relation to Cameron and the Conservatives.\n\nOther Recent Developments\n\nOn May 25, 2011, United States President Barack Obama made history by becoming the first United States \npresident to address the British parliament at Westminster Hall. In that speech, President Obama emphasized the \nstrong and enduring bond between the two countries -- the United States and the United Kingdom -- characterizing \nthe trans-Atlantic relationship as \"one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known.\" President \nObama also noted that the primacy of the West -- of the United states and allied European countries -- would be \n\"indispensable\" in the 21st century, given the ascendancy of new world powers, and the spread of democracy. \nLinking these two themes, President Obama said, \"There are few nations that stand firmer, speak louder and fight \nharder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown, and Sir John Major, were in attendance for President Obama's address at Westminster Hall. The reception \n\n\n\nby British members of parliament and peers to President Obama was extraordinarily warm, with the United States \nleader receiving extended standing ovations at the start and at the close of the address respectively. The prior \nnight, President Obama and Mrs. Obama were guests of the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and her consort, \nPrince Phillip, at an official state dinner.\n\nJune 2011 saw riots rock Northern Ireland's capital of Belfast, with police saying that several hundred people had \ntaken to the streets to participate in sectarian violence. The epicenter of the violence appeared to be a Catholic \nenclave in the eastern part of the city, which has endured tensions between Catholics and Protestants in the past. \nStill, with petrol bombs, fireworks, and missiles being hurled at police, and gunshots being fired, it was clearly the \nworst episode of violence in Belfast in at least a decade.  Several people were reported to have been injured, \nincluding a photographer,  and calls for calm had gone unheeded. \n\nJuly 2011 saw a resurgence of sectarian violence as petrol bombs were hurled at police during rioting in the \nnorthern part of Belfast.  The explosion of violence occurred at a parade by the Orange Institution, a Protestant \nfraternal order, in the area of Ardoyne, which is nationalist enclave.  It should be noted that the nationalists are no \nlonger united in Northern Ireland with those loyal to Sinn Fein pledging allegiance to the peace process, and other \nrepublicans  who do not.  It would seem that the latter group was involved in the fracas that ensued when riot police \ntook up positions.  Indeed, the presence of riot police  appeared to raise the ire of people on the scene who began \nto throw stones, glass bottles, bricks, and even petrol bombs at the police as the security forces used water \ncannons to try to quell the angry crowds.\n\nSee \"Appendix\" for more information related to Northern Ireland.\n\nAt the start of August 2011, London was rocked by riots as  young people took to the streets to protest the shooting \ndeath of a man in Tottemham  at the hands of police. The situation began when the relatives of Mark Duggan, the \nman who died in the police raid, decided to participate in a peaceful protest, which  soon turned violent. The \nsituation escalated  when a young man was searched by police who found nothing incriminating in the individual's \npossession.  Soon, the protesters were embroiled in a rampage of street violence that was stretching from the \nBritish capital to parts elsewhere in the country. In London, angry youth set shops and a bus ablaze, threw rocks at \npolice,  and  vandalized police vehicles. Widespread looting was also reported to have taken place.  Bursts of \nviolence erupted in Manchester, the West Midlands, and elsewhere outside of London.\n\nThe clashes with police left 35 police officers injured.  By Aug. 11, 2011, more than 1,000  people had been \narrested and more than 400 persons had been charged with crimes of violence, disorder, and looting in London.  \nElsewhere in the country, more than 330 people were arrested in the West Midlands and about 140 people were \narrested in Manchester and Salford.\n\nThe uprising by youth appeared to be driven by a sense of outrage over perceived victimization by the Metropolitan \nPolice Force. That is to say, the killing of Duggan may well have tapped into latent frustration from young minority \nand immigrant communities who have for some time been subject to particular scrutiny by the police over the \nyears.  Certainly, the  Metropolitan Police Force has earned a  notorious reputation for the beating  death of a \npeaceful protester  as far back as 1979, and the more recent killing of a man by police at the G-20 meetings in \n2009. These incidences of apparent injustice were -- to some extent --  linked with broader social and economic \ngrievances; however, the explosion of unrest and violence over a course of days  soon overshadowed any notion of \nrational explanation or background causal factors.  Indeed, what began as street protests to register discontent over \npolice injustice had effectively been transformed into massive riots, rampant criminality, and a climate of chaos in \npockets across the country.\n\nIn a perplexing twist, while many youth involved were described as individuals suffering from socio-economic \nchallenges, a good many young people detained were university students pursuing professional paths without \n\n\n\nprevious criminal records.  Those records were set to change since most deemed to have committed crimes would \nface serious charges in the crown court.\n\nIn terms of security, riot police were being deployed across the city to try to quell the violence.  Meanwhile, \nLondon's Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May were expected to meet with the Metropolitan \nPolice (Met) to determine what action should be taken in regard to the unrest.  For her part,  Home Secretary  May \npromised the London rioters would  \"be brought to justice\" and would \"face the consequences of their actions.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron returned home from his vacation to monitor the unfolding situation, convened \na special meeting of his cabinet,  and initiated an emergency recall of the British Parliament.  In an address to the \nHouse of Commons, he placed blame for the unrest gripping the country on \"criminality pure and simple.\"  Prime \nMinister Cameron also noted that the police had initially used ineffectual anti-riot tactics, which may have added to \nthe destruction and harm  suffered by innocent bystanders, homes, and businesses. Prime Minister Cameron \nadditionally acknowledged that \"there were simply far too few police deployed\" on to the streets and \"the tactics \nthey were using weren't working.\"\n\nMore police were being sent to \"hot spot\" areas and the number of security personnel would be boosted with the \ninclusion of police officers from Scotland to assist in maintaining law and order. The increased deployment of police \non the streets of London was expected to remain in place for the immediate future.\n\nWith an eye on responding with a firmer hand to the unrest, Prime Minister Cameron said, \"To the law abiding \npeople who play by the rules, and who are the overwhelming majority in our country, I say: the fightback has begun, \nwe will protect you. If you've had your livelihood and property damaged, we will compensate you. We are on your \nside. And to the lawless minority, the criminals who have taken what they can get, I say this: We will track you \ndown, we will find you, we will charge you, we will punish you. You will pay for what you have done.\"\n\nThe prime minister said that the authorities were banning the use of face masks, considering limits of social media \namong people known to be plotting acts of violence, reviewing the implementation of curfews, and readying the use \nof water cannons to disperse crowds.  Also under consideration was the strengthening of court sentences, the  \nexpansion of powers for landlords to evict criminals from welfare housing, in addition to the introduction of  anti-\ngang programs.  Prime Minister Cameron emphasized that all efforts would be made  to restore law and order to \nthe streets of the country.  It should also be noted that the prime minister announced a plan to assist and/or \ncompensate people whose homes and businesses were vandalized or destroyed by youth rioters.\n\nThe unrest reached into the political dimension, as it drew attention to the Conservative government's plans to cut \nfunding for police as part of the government's overall austerity thrust.  Now, with the exacerbation of the unrest \nbeing partially blamed on insufficient police on the streets, questions were being raised about the wisdom of such \nspending cuts.  In the House of Commons, Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, called for a reconsideration of the \nplans to reduce police  saying, \"The events of the last few days have been a stark reminder to us all that police on \nour streets make our communities safer and make the public feel safer.\"  He continued, \"Given the absolute priority \nthe public attaches to a visible and active police presence, does the prime minister understand why they would think \nit is not right that he goes ahead with the cuts to police numbers? Will he now think again on this issue?\"  For his \npart, Cameron maintained that the cuts could be achieved without reducing the visible presence of police on the \nstreets.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 2011, British Defense Secretary Liam Fox resigned following a scandal involving one of his closest \nfriends.  Adam Werritty -- a self-proclaimed \"adviser\" to Fox -- was exposed for  funding links to companies that \nmight benefit from government decisions, and was reported to have been granted extremely close access to Fox, \neven accompanying him on foreign visits of an official nature.  The situation resulted in questions about a conflict of \ninterest for Fox. For his part, Fox said in his letter of resignation, \"I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my \npersonal interest and my government activities to become blurred. The consequences of this have become clearer \nin recent days. I have also repeatedly said that the national interest must always come before personal interest. I \nnow have to hold myself to my own standard.\" The scenario also forced  British Prime Minister  David Cameron  to \n\n\n\ncarry out a cabinet shuffle.  Transport Minister Philip Hammond was given the defense portfolio, while Justice \nGreening replaced Hammond with the transport portfolio.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nIran under isolation; effects on ties with the United Kingdom  --\n\nDue to revelations about Iran's nuclear development program,  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n passed a resolution expressing \"deep and increasing concern\" about Iran's nuclear program, and demanded that \nIran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was adopted following a \nvote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes inits favor and only Cuba and Ecuador voting \nagainst it. Iran's IAEA envoy,  Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , dismissed the development and  said the resolution would only \nstrengthen Iran's resolve to go forward with its nuclear development.  He said, \"It will be business as usual... We \nwill continue our work as before.\"\n\nWhile Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would \nserve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. \nUnder consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh \nsanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and \nCanada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.\n\nIn addition to the IAEA resolution discussed above, Iran was also subject to further diplomatic pressure and went \nfurther down the road to global isolation when the United Nations General Assembly voted  overwhelmingly in favor \nof a resolution condemning an alleged assassination plot targeting the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The \nresolution stopped short of directly accusing Tehran of the plot,  but nonetheless demanded that Iran \"comply with \nall of its obligations under international law\" and \"co-operate with states seeking to bring to justice all those who \nparticipated in the planning, sponsoring, organization and attempted execution of the plot.\"\n\nWith international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out \nat the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be \ntaking aim at the United Kingdom.  To this end,  by the close of  November 2011, Iran's  Guardian Council of the \nConstitution unanimously voted to reduce diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom. The change would downgrade \ndiplomatic ties with the United Kingdom from the ambassador level to the level of charge d'affaires within a two-\nweek timeframe. Ratification by the Guardian Council came after a vote in the Iranian Majlis or parliament, \napproving  this move.  Iranian radio reported that during the vote, several members of parliament changed \"death to \nBritain.\"  Iran was reacting to pressure from Western countries, including the United Kingdom, to place greater \npolitical and economic pressure on Iran, and particularly, the Central Bank of Iran, in the wake of the \naforementioned report by the IAEA.\n\nIn a further sign that Iran's relations with the countries of the West were on a downward slide, Nov. 29, 2011 saw \nmilitant students aligned with the hard line conservative government in Tehran storm the British embassy \ncompound.  This action appeared to be part of a violent demonstration against the government of the United \nKingdom, which joined the United States in issuing new financial sanctions against Iran.  The militant activists \nreportedly chanted, \"death to England ,\" vandalized the embassy offices, seized sensitive documents, briefly \ndetained some diplomatic personnel, and burned the British flag in acts that constituted  flagrant violations of \ndiplomatic norms.  A separate attack by militant students and activists on a British diplomatic compound in northern \nTehran was also confirmed by the British Foreign Office.  The scenario disturbingly  recalled the shocking assault  \non the American Embassy in 1979 following Iran's Islamic Revolution.\n\nAlthough Iran expressed \"regret\" over the attacks on the British embassy and secondary diplomatic compound, \nwitnesses on the ground in Iran suggested that Iranian security forces did little to quickly end the outbreak of \n\n\n\nviolence against a diplomatic interest.  Indeed, police reportedly allowed the scene to play out for several hours \nbefore taking control of the situation.  There were serious allegations mounting that the assault on the British \nembassy compounds had taken place with approval from Iranian authorities. Furthermore, speculation rested on \nthe involvement of the regime-backed Basiji militia. For his part, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"The \nattack on the British embassy in Tehran today was outrageous and indefensible.\"  British authorities warned its \ncitizens in Iran to remain indoors and await advice; they also warned of consequences for Iran in the offing, and \nsummoned the Iranian charge d'affaires.\n\nThe United Kingdom on Nov. 30, 2011 officially downgraded its ties with Iran.  The United Kingdom withdrew all its \ndiplomats from Iran, closed its embassy in Tehran, urged its citizens to exit that country, and  gave Iran 48 hours to \nremove all its staff from the Iranian diplomatic mission in London. Officials in the United Kingdom also went on the \nrecord to note that they believe the attacks on the British embassy in Tehran and the secondary compound were \ncarried out with the tacit approval of Iran's leadership. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, asserted that there \nhad been \"some degree of regime consent\" in the attacks on the embassy and the other diplomatic compound in \nTehran. Dominick Chilcott, the newly-appointed British ambassador to Iran, said: \"This was a state-supported \nactivity.\" In an interview with BBC News, Ambassador Chilcott said that Iran was a country in which an attack on an \nembassy was conducted only \"with the acquiescence and the support of the state.\" These moves collectively \nmarked the worst deterioration of ties between the United Kingdom and Iran in decades.\n\nThe United Kingdom was backed by the  15-nation United Nations Security Council, which condemned the attack \n\"in the strongest terms.\"  Separately, United States President Barack Obama called for the Iranian government to \nensure those responsible faced justice. Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle characterized the attacks \non the British embassy compounds as \"a violation of international law.\"  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe placed \nthe blame on the Iranian government, saying: \"The Iranian regime has shown what little consideration it has for \ninternational  law.\"\n\nSeveral European countries -- such as France, Germany,  Italy and the Netherlands -- wasted no time in joining the \nWestern thrust to diplomatically isolate Iran by recalling their own ambassadors from Tehran.  France took a further \nstep by withdrawing its embassy staff from Iran.  French officials said the move was being made out of an \nabundance of caution, given the security risks in Iran to Western interests. France's calls for a ban on Iranian oil \nimports and a freeze on central bank assets was expected to heighten bilateral tensions, and effectively place \nFrance in Iran's  firing line, along with the United Kingdom. Russia, which has often been accused by the West of \nbeing \"soft\" on Iran joined the condemnation of the attacks.\n\nAt home in Iran, militant activist students in that country were  at the airport in Tehran, waiting to welcome the \nexpelled Iranian diplomats from London, and chanting slogans, such as \"Death to Britain.\"  The returning diplomats, \nhowever, never had any direct encounters with the students at the airport.\n\nThe situation appeared to highlight cleavages in the Iranian leadership regarding the diplomatic farrago. For \nexample, in an interview with Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi  said,  \n\"There is no doubt that Britain is one of the oldest enemies of Iran.\"  He appeared to offer a slight rebuke to the \nmilitant activists who attacked the British embassy, adding:  \"Young revolutionaries should not go beyond the law.\"  \nMeanwhile, the Iranian government targeted the United Kingdom for exacerbating tensions between that country \nand the West, as Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: \"The British government is trying \nto extend to other European countries the problem between the two of us.\"\n\nSpecial Report\n\nU.K. outside the European Union circle as bloc looks to new financial compact\n\nIn the first part of  December 2011, the leaders of the two biggest players in the euro zone -- French President \nNicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- issued a joint call for serious changes to Europe's \ngoverning treaties, aimed at ameliorated economic governance for the 17 countries that make up the euro currency \n\n\n\nbloc. French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel met for talks on the matter in Paris as the euro \nzone countries continue to grapple with the sovereign debt crisis, emanating from \"ground zero\" in Greece, but \nextending regionally across the European bloc.  This crisis  has left the euro vulnerable, risked fragmenting the \ncurrency union, and could yet imperil the fragile global economic recovery.\n\nAt issue has been the problematic debt to GDP ratio in countries across the euro zone of the European Union (EU), \nand concomitant anxieties about  various countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland,  defaulting on \ntheir respective debts. These mostly  southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also \ninherent structural economic weakness, which could affect other countries in the euro zone in something of a \ncontagion.  While rescue packages for Greece and Ireland were put into effect, such measures forlarger \neconomies, such as Italy and Spain, was simply unaffordable. General expectations were that Spain might barely \nescape default because its debt-to-GDP ratio -- while poor -- was still better than that of Italy.  But at the broader \nlevel, attention began to rest on the need to expand a rescue  fund for  Europe's heavily indebted countries, which \nin September 2011 led to what is now known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).\n\nWhile the expansion of the EFSF breathed necessary life into the euro stabilization entity, it should be noted that \nthe treatment for the debt ailment infecting the euro zone has become imbued by controversy. While  the \nparticipants of the global economy have been anxious for action to be taken in response to the debt crisis, German \nstakeholders have been incensed that they would be the major contributors to the rescue fund, which would benefit \ncountries, such as Greece.  Stated differently, the debt crisis in Europe has led not only to instability in the \ninternational markets, but also to political imbroglios across the euro zone.\n\nOf equally significant has been the growing chorus of complaints about the slow and protracted political response to \nthe sovereign debt crisis in Europe and theassociated euro zone challenges, which were largely due to the EU's \ninstitutional structure.  It was with an eye on addressing that latter issue that French President Sarkozy and German \nChancellor Merkel were meeting in Paris to seek a pathway to stabilizing the euro zone.  That meeting resulted in \nthe aforementioned call for radical changes to Europe's governing treaties, characterized by heightened economic \ngovernance in the EU.\n\nIncluded in their proposal were:  (1) the creation of a monetary fund for Europe, (2) automatic penalties for countries \nthat exceed European deficit limits, and (3) monthly meetings of European leaders. The proposal entailed \ncompromises by both European leaders.  President Sarkozy had to accept the notion of automatic sanctions for \ncountries in violation of debt limit rules, while Chancellor Merkel had to accept that the European Court of Justice \nwill not be empowered with the power of veto over budgets.  Meanwhile, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), \nwhich was intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in 2013, would be advanced earlier \nin 2012.\n\nPresident Sarkozy said that they were looking to March 2012 to complete negotiations on the new treaty.  Ideally, \nthe new treaty would be ratified by all 27 member states of the European Union.  However, if concurrence at that \nlevel proved impossible, then the 17 states of the euro zone would have to approve it.  It should also  be noted that \nEuropean Council President Herman Van Rompuy has said that tougher budget rules for the euro zone may not \nrequire changing any existing European Union treaties.\n\nPresident Sarkozy emphasized the imperative that such a crisis not re-emerge in the future.  He said, \"We are \nconscious of the gravity of the situation and of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders.\" For her part, \nChancellor Merkel said her country, working in concert with France, was \"absolutely determined\" to maintain a \nstable euro.  She also advocated for \"structural changes which go beyond agreements.\"\n\nWhile the new measures would certainly go a long way to addressing the issue of improved economic governance \nin the euro zone, they did not deal with the question of how many euro zone countries would deal with their debt \nchallenges in a climate of low growth. Nevertheless, in the short run, the steadfast and unified message of intent by \nthe two European leaders was, at least, expected to calm markets and facilitate lower borrowing costs for debt-\nridden economies such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.\n\n\n\nThe proverbial \"fly in the ointment\" emerged on Dec. 5, 2011 when the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, \nplaced the countries of the euro zone on a \"credit watch\" with negative implications.*  Even power house \neconomies of Germany and France were included in the move, which presaged a downgrade to come in the future.  \nA day later,  Standard and Poor's even warned that the euro zone bailout fund -- the EFSF -- could lose its own \nAAA rating.  These moves have raised eyebrows across the world as regards the credibility of the ratings agency, \nwhich failed to warn the world of the sub-prime meltdown in 2008 that ultimately let to the global financial crisis.  \nThere were suggestions that this downgrade threat to euro zone countries, in conjunction with the downgrade of the \nUnited States months earlier following a particularly ferocious debt ceiling debate in that country, were evidence \nthat the credit ratings agency was trying to \"save face\" by proving its tougher standards at this time.  Standard and \nPoor's newly-discovered hard-line stance was being questioned by analysts, who pointed to the timing of the \nwarning against euro zone countries. But  this warning came precisely at a time when France and Germany were \nleading the charge in the EU to solve the regional debt crisis, as discussed here.\n\nThe move by Standard and Poor's aside, Europe re-focused on the task at hand: to institute ameliorated economic \ngovernance in the EU. By mid-December 2011, 26 out of the 27 EU member states backed the notion of a new tax \nand budget concord that would amend the Lisbon Treaty -- the EU's operational  and constitutional foundation.\n\nIncluded in the cadre of 26 affirmative countries were all of the 17 euro zone countries. Of course, for many \ncountries, support was contingent upon additional political ratification either in parliament or via referendum. Still, \nthe signals of positive joint action were clear from these 26 countries.\n\nThe United Kingdom emerged as the lone \"holdout\" with British Prime Minister David Cameron insisting that he had \nto act to protect key British interests, including the financial markets.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy noted that \nthe sticking point for Prime Minister Cameron involved a protocol that would allow the United Kingdom to opt-out of  \nchanges on financial services. President Sarkozy said that measure wasunacceptable . Explaining his position, \nPrime Minister Cameron said, \"We were offered a treaty that didn't have proper safeguards for Britain, and I \ndecided it was not right to sign that treaty.\"  He continued by noting that the United Kingdom remained in the EU, \nsaying, \"We're still in the single market.\"\n\nNevertheless, this move by the United Kingdom was an operational veto of the initiative to get all 27 EU countries to \nsupport changes to the bloc's Lisbon Treaty.  As intimated above, it would effectively force the EU to go down the \nroad of instituting a \"fiscal compact,\"  rather than a new treaty.  While the institution of a fiscal pact could probably \noccur more quickly than ratification of a new treaty, it would entail far less rigor and strength as a guiding maxim of \nthe EU.\n\nAcross Europe, the British government was being criticized for plunging the United Kingdom into a position of \nisolation, while economic analysts from the Economist and the Financial Times, warned that Europe was now being \nfaced by fragmentation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the move by Prime Minister Cameron was creating tensions within his own coalition \ngovernment.  Notably, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg -- the leader of the Liberal Democrats --  said that David \nCameron's veto of EU treaty changes was \"bad for Britain\" and he warned that it could leave his country  \"isolated \nand marginalized\" in Europe. He continued, \"I don't think that's good for jobs, in the city (re: London) or elsewhere, I \ndon't think it's good for growth or for families up and down the country.\"  Clegg's bitter denunciation of the veto by \nCameron exposed fissures in the British ruling coalition between the Conservative Euro-skeptics and the pro-\nEuropean Liberal Democrats.  The Labour Party -- the main political opposition in the United Kingdom -- was more \nscathing in its rebuke of Cameron's decision. Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said of Cameron: \"He did this because \nthe Euro-skeptic wing of the Conservative Party has effectively taken over and that isn't good for the national \ninterest.\" Miliband also appeared to encourage the Liberal Democrats to look to Labour to overturn the decision as \nhe said: \"What I say to Liberal Democrats and others is that we will work with anybody who thinks this position can \nnot stand. We must find a better way forward for Britain.\"\n\n\n\nBy the start of 2012, 25 of the 27 European Union member states agreed to join the new fiscal agreement.  The two \nholdouts were the United Kingdom  and the Czech Republic.Earlier in late 2011  (as discussed here), British Prime \nMinister David Cameron said that his country would not sign on to the notion of a new treaty, and effectively forced \nthe European Union to go down the road of instituting a \"fiscal compact,\"  rather than a new treaty.  But now in \n2012, the United Kingdom was continuing its opposition, and said that the compact would threaten British interests \nand that there were \"legal concerns\" about the use of European Union institutions in enforcing the fiscal compact. \nMeanwhile, the  Czechs said that there were \"constitutional reasons\" for their refusal to sign on to the compact.  At \nissue was the fact thateuro skeptic President  Vaclav Klaus has been a vocal opponent to the compact.\n\n*Note: In January 2012, the credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, downgraded the status of a number of \nEuropean countries.\n\nThe stability of the euro zone and the European Union has become a major concern in recent years, largely \nemanating from the Greek debt crisis, but extending regionally, as discussed here.\n\nPolitical Update (2010-2012):\n\nAfter coming to power following close parliamentary elections in May  2010, the Conservatives formed a ruling \ncoalition with the Liberal Democrats.  Now, more than two years later in April 2012, polling data has found that the \nbloom was off the proverbial rose and British voters were now disenchanted with both ruling parties.  Conversely, \nthe opposition Labor Party, which lost the control of government in those elections, was enjoying a reversal of \nfortune as the favored political party in the country.  According to a YouGov-Sun poll,  Labor had a lead of 11 \npercentage points ahead of the Conservatives or \"Tories.\" Another poll  by Populus for The Times of London \nshowed showed similar results with Labor ahead of the Tories by nine  percentage points. The Liberal Democrats \nwere slipping the most precipitously  with the  Euro-skeptic United Kingdom Independence Party edging into the \nthird place slot in terms of popularity.\n\nOne of the policy issues that may have contributed to the ascendancy of Labor, along with the associated erosion \nof support for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, included the  budget put forth by Chancellor of the Exchequer \nGeorge Osborne.  At issue were policies such as the so-called granny tax that infuriated retirees, as well as the \n\"pasty tax,\" which would involve a value-added tax on hot \"takeout\" food, and adversely affect wide swaths of the \npopulation.  Also of concern was the proposal to  expand value added taxes on repairs to listed historic buildings, \nwhich would affect the Church of England.\n\nPolicy aside, the ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats was experiencing cleavages at the end of \nApril 2012.  At issue was the announcement by British Prime Minister David Cameron that a referendum be held on \nconverting the House of Lords to a largely elected body. This move  evoked the tensions of  Liberal Democrat \nleader, Nick Clegg, who pointed to the fact that all three of the country's main political parties promised reform of \nthe upper house of parliament during  the 2010 election campaign.  Clegg said that those campaign commitments \nshould make a referendum unnecessary.  But in an  interview with BBC News, Prime Minister Cameron appeared \nunwilling to step away from the notion of a ratification vote saying, \"My view is that you shouldn't rule it out.\"\n\nPolitical challenges for Prime Minister Cameron continued as April 2012 came to a close.  At issue was the status of \nhis  Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.  At issue was Hunt's involvement in News  Corp.'s bid to acquire BSkyB. \nSpecifically, Hunt was accused of being improperly involved with the deal -- a claim that came to light  after the \nLeveson Inquiry released e-mails between Hunt's special adviser, Adam Smith, and News Corp. Public Affairs \nDirector Frederic Michel. The details of the email led to Smith's resignation but have so far left Hunt unaffected. For \nhis part, Prime Minister Cameron said: \"I don't think it would be right in every circumstance if a special adviser gets \nsomething wrong to automatically sack the minister. I think he's doing an excellent job on the Olympics and, frankly, \nI do think people deserve to have these things looked into properly.\"\n\n\n\nEditor's Note on the Monarchy:\n\nThe year 2012 saw the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II, mark the 60th anniversary of her \naccession to the throne.  While the official celebration of Queen Elizabeth's six-decade long rein as the United \nKingdom's ruling monarch was to be held mid-year, the official date of accession was at the start of February 2012. \nof course, the date also marks the commemoration of the death of her father, the beloved KingGeorge VI.  Queen \nElizabeth II said that she was  dedicating herself \"anew\" to the service of the British people and that she  was \n\"deeply moved\" by the massive outpouring of popular support for her Diamond Jubilee.  Those Jubilee celebrations \nensued in the summer of 2012.  Elizabeth II joins her great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria, as the only other \nBritish monarch to achieve this milestone.\n\nSpecial Report:  \n\nLondon 2012 -- The Games of the XXX Olympiad\n\nLondon -- the capital city of the United Kingdom -- welcomed the world on July 27, 2012, at the start of the Games \nof the XXX Olympiad. The Opening Ceremony on July 27, 2012, was witnessed by 80,000 people in Olympic \nStadium as well as up to one billion people watching via broadcast across the world.  That ceremony culminated \nwith the symbolic lighting of the Olympic Cauldron from the Olympic flame that has journeyed across the host \ncountry of the United States for the previous months.  National and international dignitaries, including the reigning \nmonarch of the United Kingdom - Queen Elizabeth II - would be in attendance. Ahead of the ceremony, Big Ben -- \none of London's landmark features -- rang for three minutes.  It was the first such tribute to the historic nature of the \nevent since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.\n\nWhile attention on July 27, 2012, would rightly be on the highly-anticipated Opening Ceremony, which was being \ncoordinated by Oscar-award winning film director Danny Boyle, the preparation for 2012 Olympics had been \nongoing for several years, with attention to appropriate infrastructure, facilities, logistics, and security in one of the \nworld's largest and most dynamic cities. Of particular note has been the revitalization effort of East London, which  \nInternational Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge lauded, saying that leaves London with a \"tangible \nlegacy\" of the Games of the XXX Olympiad.  While these costly and inconvenient preparations often raised the ire \nof Londoners in the period leading up to the 2012 Olympics, now most citizens appeared to be proud and excited \nabout the historic event on their home country, with crowds dressed in national colors in a rare extroversion of \npatriotism.\n\nSpeaking in a tone of national pride, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron said of the London Olympics, \n\"It's a great opportunity to show the world the best of Britain, a country that's got an incredibly rich past but also a \nvery exciting future.\" Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, who served as head of government in 2005 \nwhen London won the right to host the Olympics,  said in an interview with BBC News: \"It's a party atmosphere but \nalso an immense sense of national pride -- of what we are and what we can show the world.\"  London Mayor Boris \nJohnson spoke of the so-called \"Olympic fever\" spreading across the city in an interview with the BBC, saying, \n\"What's so amazing is just the wave of excitement seems to pass from person to person like some benign form of \ncontagion. Everybody is getting it.\"\n\nThe London 2012 Olympics included participation from about 10,000 athletes representing about 200 countries or \nnational entities (operating under the aegis of National Olympic Committees).  The athletes would compete in 26 \nsports, further sub-divided into 39 disciplines.\n\nVisitors from across the world were present in London -- arguably the world's most cosmopolitan capital city already \n-- in a show of global goodwill  and enthusiasm. The premise of the modern Olympics have been to provide a venue \nfor  individuals, rather than states or nations, to compete against each other in sports held every four years, and in \npeaceful competition, without the burden of politics, war, ethnicity, or religion.\n\n\n\nThe ancient Olympics -- the roots of the modern Olympics -- can  trace their origins to the eighth century before the \ncommon era (B.C.E.). The games were dedicated to the 12 Olympian Gods and were hosted on the ancient green \nplains of Olympia.  Those games in Greek antiquity constituted a time of union, where athletes from across the \nGreek world came together to compete for the prize of the olive wreath and would return to their home city-states \nmarked as heroes.  Political and religious dynamics -- such as the conquest by the Romans and accusations about \nthe Pagan connection to the games' origins in the post-Christian world -- contributed to the demise of the Olympics. \nThey were revived as the modern Olympics in the late 19th century by the French Baron Pierre de Coubertin in the \nlate 19th century.\n\nCoubertin's background in philosophy and education informed his emerging advocacy for sports.  Particularly, he \ndrew upon the notion of competition among amateurs rather than professional athletes. The legacy of a political \ntruce during the ancient games also imbued its own flavor onto the modern games, influencing the emerging \nunderstanding of the Olympics as an international venue to promote peace and spread cultural understanding. \nThese ideals have been transposed into the purpose of the modern Olympics that go forth in contemporary times.  \nIndeed, according to the Olympic Charter, the Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or \nteam events and not between countries. Moreover, as expressed in the Olympic Creed: \"The most important thing \nin the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the \nstruggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\"\n\nIt should be noted that contentious politics and shocking world events have, occasionally, often crept into the \ndomain of this international sporting event.  There have been boycotts including that of African countries to protest \napartheid in South Africa in the 1970s, and the Cold War boycotts of the Moscow and Los Angeles games in the \n1980s. There was also the domestic terrorist bombing at the  Atlantic games of 1996. Perhaps more importantly, \nthere was the notorious massacre of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972.\n\nIn these London 2012 Olympics, a Greek athlete, Paraskevi Papachristou, was expelled from the games ahead of \nthe opening ceremony because of a racist Twitter message.  As well, United States Republican presidential \nnominee Mitt Romney set off a blaze of controversy when he questioned London's readiness for the 2012 \nOlympics, during a trip intended to burnish his foreign policy credentials against incumbent President Barack \nObama.  Such incidences aside, attention of the world was quickly refocused on the Olympics themselves, and the \nrare opportunity for the world to come together to compete in the interests of sport and amity.\n\nThe closing ceremony of the Games of the XXX Olympiad would commence on Aug. 12, 2012, and include a \nhandover by London Mayor Boris Johnson to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro -- the host city of the 2016 \nOlympics.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nEcuador grants asylum to WikiLeaks founder; U.K. threatens to storm embassy\n\nOn Aug. 16, 2012, the government of Ecuador announced it would grant asylum to Julian Assange, the founder of \nWikiLeaks.  In June of 2012, Assange took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy  in the United Kingdom to avoid \nextradition.  Now, months later,  the United Kingdom was making it abundantly clear that Assange would not be \ngranted safe passage out of the country.\n\nWikiLeaks is an online database of leaked classified documents and private diplomatic cables from government \nsources, news organizations, and whistleblowers. Launched in 2006 by Assange, an Australian Internet activist, \nWikiLeaks  has led to outrage across the world, embarrassment for several governments,  and accusations that the \ndissemination of classified materials constitutes to a threat to global security. Assange's personal legal problems \n(as regards to alleged sexual offenses in Sweden) has been viewed as the means to apprehend him, with the \npossibility of extradition to the United States to face charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of private diplomatic \ncables.\n\n\n\nTo these ends, and with news emerging that Ecuador was providing sanctuary to Assange via its embassy in \nLondon, the United Kingdom wasted little time in warning that it would fulfill its \"obligation\" to extradite Assange.  \nIndeed, the United Kingdom did not foreclose the possibility of storming the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nIn response, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said during a news conference:  \"Today we received from \nthe United Kingdom the express threat, in writing, that they could assault our embassy in London if Ecuador didn't \nhand over Julian Assange. We want to make this absolutely clear. We are not a colony of Britain.\"\n\nBut the United Kingdom was in no mood to back down, posting a message via social media that read: \"We have \nconsistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador. U.K. has a legal obligation \nto extradite Mr. Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offenses.\" The Foreign Office \ncontinued,  \"Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadorians' attention to relevant provisions of our law. \nFor example, extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or to legal status of diplomatic \npremises in the U.K.\"\n\nAmping up the rhetoric, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague said, \"Under our law, with Assange \nhaving exhausted all options of appeal, the British authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to \nSweden. We must carry out that obligation and, of course, we fully intend to do so.\"  Explaining that the United \nKingdom was not bound by legal instruments requiring the recognition of diplomatic asylum by a foreign embassy, \nHague  said that diplomatic asylum \"should not be used for the purposes of escaping the regular processes of the \ncourts.\"\n\nFor his part, Assange himself entered the debate on Aug. 19, 2012, when he appeared on the balcony of the \nEcuadorian embassy and offered a statement. In that statement, he urged the United States to end its \"witch-hunt\" \nagainst Wikileaks.  He specifically demanded that the United States stop going after whistleblowers, saying: \"The \nUnited States must pledge before the world that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes \nof the powerful.\" Assange also  called for the release of Bradley Manning, who faces trial due to  accusations that \nhe [Manning] leaked the classified documents to  Wikileaks.\n\nNote that as the end of August 2012 was near, the diplomatic standoff between the United Kingdom and Ecuador \ncame to a close.\n\nEcuador's President Correa announced that the United Kingdom had  withdrawn its threat to enter Ecuador's \nembassy in London to arrest Assange.  Ecuador's government said  it had received  a message from the British \nForeign Office confirming that \"there was no threat to enter the embassy.\"\n\nSpecial Note on the Monarchy\n\nAt the start of December 2012, legal measures were underway to change the rule of royal succession.  At issue \nwas the prevailing principle of male primogeniture, by which male heirs take precedence over women in line to the \nBritish throne. The new measures were intended to ensure that the first born of monarch would be the heir \napparent, regardless of gender. The new measures would  effectively  end the dictate that privileges males over \nfemales in the line of succession and ensure that the first child of the current Duke and Duchess of Cambridge \nwould become monarch, whether that offspring is a boy or a girl.  To that end, all Commonwealth realms concurred \nwith the proposed legislation, facilitating the path for the British parliament to introduce the  new Succession to the \nCrown Bill in the House of Commons.\n\n\n\nThat succession bill would require certain amendments to constitutional documents, including the Bill of Rights and \nCoronation Oath Act of 1688.  Passage of the legislation would come at a time when the Duchess Catherine of \nCambridge was hospitalized for acute morning sickness, or hyperemesis gravidarum, ahead of the birth of the child \nwho would be third in line to the throne after Heir Apparent Prince Charles and the Duke William of Cambridge \nrespectively. It should be noted that the Succession to the Crown Bill  would also end the prohibition of anyone in \nthe line of succession from marrying a Roman Catholic.\n\nSpecial Note on Economy\n\nIn the last week of February 2013, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded the United Kingdom from its top \nAAA rating to AA1. It was the first downgrade since 1978.  Moody's said that the United Kingdom's austerity \nmeasures were contributing to subdued growth, and that the British government's debt reduction program faced \nsignificant challenges, cautioning the United Kingdom's debt burdens were not likely to be reversed until 2016 \nanyway. Moody's further said that all expectations were that  growth would \"remain sluggish over the next few \nyears.\" Still, Moody's maintained that the United Kingdom's outlook was stable.\n\nThe downgrade did not appear to deter the conservative government from following the path of austerity. Instead, \nChancellor George Osborne said that Moody's decision was \"a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our \ncountry.\"  He continued, \"Far from weakening our resolve to deliver our economic recovery plan, this decision \nredoubles it.  We will go on delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter.\"  Shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, \nwasted no time in blasting the government for its measures.  He said the decision by Moody's to downgrade the \nUnited Kingdom's credit rating was a \"humiliating blow to a prime minister and chancellor who said keeping our \nAAA rating was the test of their economic and political credibility.\"\n\nSpecial Entry: Death of Britain's  conservative \"Iron Lady\" Margaret Thatcher\n\nOn April 8, 2013, Baroness Margaret Thatcher died following a stroke at the age of 87 years.  The conservative \nicon, known as the \"Iron Lady,\"  served as the United Kingdom's prime minister for 11 years, starting in 1979.\n\nThatcher has been regarded as a transformational figure, not only on the British political landscape, but also socio-\npolitically across the world in modern times.\n\nAs the first female head of government of a major world power, Thatcher was culturally regarded as a trailblazer for \nwomen in politics.  And on the matter of policy, her austere and hardline conservative outlook shifted the British \npolitical and economic scene by breaking open the path towards greater privatization. As well, her alliance with \nformer United States President Ronald Reagan has been credited with ending the Cold War. At home, she was \nlauded for leading the charge to win the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982.\n\nHer record as a female leader and champion of capitalism and democracy aside, Thatcher's domestic policy record \nhas to be understood as deeply divisive.  Indeed, her poll tax proposal and anti-union policies led to protests, and \nultimately to her exit from the leadership faction of the Conservative Party.  It could also be argued that Thatcher \nstood on the wrong side of history in the international realm as regards apartheid South Africa. She did not back \nsanctions against apartheid South Africa and infamously referred to Nelson Mandela's African  National Congress \n(ANC) as \"a typical terrorist organization.\"\n\nThis mixed record aside, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to Thatcher's legacy, \ncharacterizing her as \"a great Briton.\" He said, \"Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds. The real thing is \nshe didn't just lead our country; she saved our country.\"  Queen Elizabeth II expressed sadness over the news of \nThatcher's death, while United States President Obama  noted that \"America has lost a true friend.\" Meanwhile the \nUnion Jack at Number 10 Downing Street was being flown at half mast, and the country prepared to say goodbye to \nher at a formal funeral at London's St Paul's Cathedral, where she would be accorded full military honors.\n\n\n\nSpecial Note on Attack by Islamic Extremists in London\n\nIn the last week of May 2013, two men attacked and brutally murdered a British soldier in the south eastern London \nsuburb of Woolwich.  The victim was identified as Lee Rigby, while his two attackers were identified as Michael \nAdebolajo and Michael Adebowale -- British citizens of Nigerian descent who were adherents of Islam. The two \nmen did not seem eager to flee the scene of their vicious and bloody assault on Rigby; instead witnesses on the \nscene were able to film one of the two suspects justifying the murder of British soldiers on the basis of the fact that \nthey killed Muslims during the course of their military duties abroad. The grizzly attack on Rigby notwithstanding, \nAdebolajo was shown on the footage claiming, \"These people are mistreating us, we are innocent.\"  Both Adebolajo \nand Adebowale  were reported to be in police custody.\n\nWhile British citizens awaited news over what type of charges the two men would ultimately face, the British Foreign \nOffice soon acknowledged that Adebolajo was given consular assistance when he was arrested in Kenya in 2010.  \nIt was now believed that  Adebolajo had been in Kenya en route to Somalia where he may have intended to join the \nal-Qaida affiliated terror group, al-Shabab.\n\nThe British government would undoubtedly face criticism for their consular assistance to an individual with terrorist \nconnections.\n\nSpecial Note on Northern Ireland\n\nIt should be noted that sectarian violence erupted in Northern Ireland in January 2013 as a result of a contentious \ndebate over flying the British flag at City Hall in Belfast.  Officials voted to limit the number of days the British flag \nmight be flown at City Hall.  The decision spurred outrage by loyalists  and sparked an outbreak of riots, which were \nmarked by violent clashes between protesters and police that left more than 100 police officers dead and as many \nas 120 arrests made.  A banned loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, was blamed for fueling the ire of people \nand even orchestrating some of the riots and  chaos that ensued as a result of the outrage.  With passions inflamed \nand a rising casualty list in what was now being called the \"Union Flag crisis,\" government ministers convened talks \nwith the Northern Ireland secretary of state and the Irish foreign minister.\n\nSecretary of State Theresa Villers then released a statement that read as follows: \"The violence is intolerable and \nthese protests have to come off the streets. They have to be replaced by dialogue.\"  Meanwhile,  a number of \npolitical groups from varied backgrounds echoed the call for an end to the violence.  Indeed, appeals for an end to \nthe crisis were backed and sanctioned by dozens of organizations, including loyalist entities,  Irish paramilitary \ncadres, community groups, and church leaders.\n\nIn mid-July 2013, the capital of Northern Ireland -- Belfast -- was rocked by riots. On July 12, 2013, alone, more \nthan 30 police officers and member of parliament, Nigel Dodds, were injured in the violence unfolding in Belfast. \nIndeed,  despite his appeal for calm and an end to the violence, Dodds was knocked unconscious when loyalists \nhurled missiles in the direction of the police.  He was hospitalized at the Royal Victoria Hospital as a result of the \nincident.\n\nAt issue was a ban on a proposed march by the Orange Order (i.e. the Protestant unionist movement).  Police \nmoved to enforce that ban but were met with resistance in the northern part of the city as the Orange Order called \nfor mass protests along the thoroughfare that divided Republican (Catholic Irish nationalist) and Orange Order \n(Protestant unionist) communities.  Although the Orange Order subsequently said it would suspend its \ndemonstrations, violence nonetheless erupted and engulfed families and children.  Weapons ranging from bricks \nand stones to petrol bombs and ceremonial swords were hurled at police; in response, police attempted to disperse \nthe crowds  by using water cannons and  plastic batons.\n\n\n\nTypically, Orange men march from April to August, with particular attention on the July 12 date, which marks the \noccasion when William of Orange won victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in \n1690. The July 12 annual parade  commemorates that victory. For Catholic Irish nationalists, the marches, and \nparticularly, the July 12 parade, denotes triumphalism.  As such, power brokers have noted that they serve only to \nstoke sectarian and political tensions  between Catholic nationalists and Protestant loyalists.  The decision to ban \nthe parade in northern Belfast was intended to prevent an outbreak of violence but resulted in outraging unionists \nand particularly the Orange Order, ultimately resulting with  the riots discussed here.\n\nThe rioting went on for a second day, with hundreds of police being deployed to quell the violence. Although the \nunrest continued on July 13, 2013, the violence was not as acute as the day before.  Authorities appeared to blame \nthe Unionists for using reckless language and behavior to spark hostilities. Secretary of State Theresa Villiers \n\"utterly condemned\" the rioting and urged the Orange Order to call off its mass action saying, \"It is the clear \nresponsibility of everyone who has influence, including the Orange Order, community leaders and politicians, to do \nwhat they can to calm the situation. We need temperate language over coming days.\"\n\nBut unionists were quick to defend their ranks with Ulster Unionist councilor Mark Cosgrove suggesting that it was \n\"irresponsible\" of police  to blame the Orange Order for the unrest.  He said, \"There were hundreds of thousands of \npeople from both the loyal orders and the bands, the supporters out in Belfast and all over Northern Ireland \nyesterday and, I think, to try and apportion blame to the Orange Order is totally wrong.\"  Not surprisingly, \nnationalists had a very different view of the events unfolding in Belfast. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein said: \"In \nmy opinion, the leadership of the Orange Order failed the Orange Order and they failed these communities.\" He \ncontinued, \"The decision announced some hours ago, that they are suspending their protests, was a massive \nadmission by themselves that they were culpable for what happened here last night.\"\n\nJust ahead of the \"marching season\" in Northern Ireland in 2014, police were investigating a 1972 murder arrested \nIrish nationalist leader, Gerry Adams.  He was released following several days of extensive interrogations.  At issue \nfor the police was  the murder of Jean McConville, who was kidnapped in full view of her children in 1972 when the \nIrish Republican Army was carrying out its violent and hardline nationalist campaign.\n\nIn the background of this particular investigation were prevailing  accusations that Adama was involved in the Irish \nRepublican Army's more nefarious activities.  For his part, Adams has denied being involved in the murder of \nanyone -- including McConville.  Regardless of the veracity of his statement,  the police referred the case against \nAdams -- a member of parliament in the Republic of Ireland -- to prosecutors who would decide whether charges \nshould be advanced.\n\nBut the investigation into Adams appeared to have sparked sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants \nin Northern Ireland with supporters of Adams' Sinn Fein party outraged over his arrest, and pro-unionists angry that \nhe was released from police custody. Indeed, unionists blockaded a road and threw petrol bombs to register their \nanger over Adams' release.\n\nWhile the tensions did not immediately contribute to a fierce outbreak of violence, there were fears that the overall \npolitical climate was negatively affected ahead of the so-called \"marching season.\"  The summer \"marching \nseason\" typically featured Protestants parades marking their historic victories against Catholics. Of particular \nimportance was the July 12 march marking the victory of  William of Orange over the Catholic King James II at the \nBattle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690.\n\nFor their part, Catholics regard the  parades as provocations and they have been particularly incensed over the July \n12 march, saying that it smacked of triumphalism. As such, power brokers have noted that the  parades serve only \nto stoke sectarian and political tensions  between Catholic nationalists and Protestant loyalists.  The decision  in \n\n\n\n2013 to ban the parade in northern Belfast was intended to prevent an outbreak of violence but instead managed to \noutrage the unionists and particularly the Orange Order. Ultimately,  violent riots erupted in Belfast in 2013. Indeed, \nit was the worst outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland since the late 1990s.\n\nNow in 2014, with the Gerry Adams case featuring prominently ahead of the marching season, anxieties were \nelevated along with renewed Catholic versus Protestant tensions.\n\n2014 Political Update\n\nAt the start of February 2014, Minister of Immigration Mark Harper of the United Kingdom resigned from office \namidst revelations that he employed an illegal immigrant  as a house cleaner at his home.\n\nThe discovery that Harper -- a  Conservative member of parliament and immigration minister since 2012  -- had \nemployed  a worker in the United Kingdom illegally to clean his home caused an embarrassing quasi-scandal, \nreflecting negatively on Prime Minister David Cameron's government.  Of note was the fact that the Cameron \ngovernment was trying to stave off a threat from the anti-immigration far right flank by promising to reduce \nimmigration.  This revelation about the immigration minister employing an illegal immigrant undoubtedly cast a \nnegative light on the Cameron government's seriousness on the issue.  \n\nAs a result, Harper announced his resignation from his cabinet post, although he would continue to function as a \nmember of parliament. In his resignation letter to Prime Minister Cameron, Harper insisted that he had, in fact,  \nchecked the cleaner's immigration status when he first employed her in 2007.  He added, \"When you then \nappointed me as Immigration Minister ... I went through a similar consideration process and once again concluded \nthat no further check was necessary.\"  According to Harper, the problem was that he had not checked the worker's \ncredentials more \"thoroughly.\" \n\nFor his part,  Prime Minister Cameron, whose Conservative Party was languishing in pre-election polls, accepted \nHarper's resignation saying, \"There is no suggestion that Mr. Harper knowingly employed an illegal immigrant.\"\n\nIn April 2014, United Kingdom's Culture Minister Maria Miller was forced to resign from office amidst an emerging \nscandal over her expense accounts.  At issue were allegations that Miller over-claimed mortgage costs and other \nexpenses amounting to as much as  45,000 pounds ($75,400). She was cleared of the allegation that she used her \nexpense allowance to fund her parents, however, the other accusations appeared to hold merit. The issue of \nexpense accounts by politicians has been a controversial one in the United Kingdom since 2009 when legislators' \nexpense reports were leaked to the press thus exposing gross abuse.\n\nAt the political level, the resignation of Miller exposed  United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron to criticism \nover his bad judgment and political leadership. Cameron's critics excoriated him for his failure to take charge of the \nsituation by simply sacking Miller from the onset.  Instead, Cameron clung to the fact that Miller was cleared of one -\n- but not all -- of the allegations against her (as discussed above), and continued to tout Miller as being an excellent \npublic servant. For her part, Miller prevailed for some time, hanging onto her portfolio and delivering a weak apology \nthat only did further damage to the already dismal image of the Conservative Party.  Ultimately, Miller bowed to \npublic pressure and resigned from office, saying that she believed the scandal was becoming a distraction from the \nwork of the government.\n\nOpposition parties wasted little time in casting the Conservatives (also known as \"Tories\") as elitist and out of touch \nwith the common populace. As stated by Labor leader, Ed Miliband, of Prime Minister Cameron: \"He still doesn't \n\n\n\nunderstand what she (Miller) did wrong...\" Miliband continued, \"The reason the public was so appalled was if it had \nhappened in any other business there would have been no question about them staying in their job. Why was he \nthe last person in the country to realize her position was untenable?\"\n\nNote:  Prime Minister Cameron named  Sajid Javid -- a rising star in the Conservative Party -- as the person to \nreplace Miller as the new Culture Minister. Prime Minister Cameron also announced other cabinet changes such as \nthe appointment of Nicky Morgan as financial secretary at the Treasury, and the appointment of Andrea Leadsom \nas  the new Economic Secretary.\n\nIn July 2014, United Kingdom (U.K.)  Foreign Secretary William Hague announced his resignation as the  country's \ntop diplomat after four years at that post.  He was set to assume the position of Leader of the House of Commons \nwhere he would be tasked with coordinating relations between the executive government and the lower \nparliamentary chamber.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Hague wrote: \"Tonight I am standing down as Foreign \nSecretary after 4 years to serve as Leader of the House of Commons.\"  The move was part of a cabinet shuffle \nundertaken by Prime Minister David Cameron. That overhaul of the cabinet appeared to be in preparation for \nparliamentary elections, which were scheduled to be held in 2015.\n\nA year ahead of those elections, it was not Prime Minister Cameron's governing Conservatives who had the edge, \nbut the opposition Labour Party. Led by Ed Miliband, Labour was  in the lead in terms of voters' preferences by \nabout four percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.  That being said, Miliband was being weighed down by \nthe fact that most British voters did not view him as a future prime minister.  At issue for Miliband was the public's \nperception that he was socially awkward, overly-intellectual, and a clear contrast to telegenic Cameron, whose \npublic relations background aided his self presentation style. Cognizant of this contrast,  Miliband took on his \n\"image\" problem in a direct fashion, saying that if the focus was on policies and substance rather than photo \nopportunities and superficialities, he would have no trouble leading his left-leaning Labour Party to victory.\n\nIn a speech to supporters, Miliband said, \"David Cameron is a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a \npolitics driven by image. I am not going to be able to compete with that. And I don't intend to. I want to offer \nsomething different.\"  He continued, \"If you want the politician from central casting, it's just not me, it's the other \nguy. And if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don't vote for me ... I \nbelieve people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op.\"\n\nSpecial Note on Northern Ireland\n\nIn the second week of September 2014, Ian Paisley, the former leader of Northern Ireland's  Democratic Unionist \nParty died at the age of 88. Known for his decision to enter a power-sharing executive with the Irish nationalist Sinn \nFein movement at Stormont, Paisely was one of the keystone figures of the decades-long struggle between \nunionists and republican nationalists in Northern Ireland. United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron paid \ntribute to Paisley saying he was \"one of the most forceful and instantly recognizable characters in British politics for \nnearly half a century.\" Cameron continued, \"In particular, his decision to take his party into government with Sinn \nFein in 2007 required great courage and leadership, for which everyone in these islands should be grateful.\"  Martin \nMcGuinness of Sinn Fein expressed sadness over the news of Paisley's death, saying, \"Over a number of decades \nwe were political opponents and held very different views on many, many issues but the one thing we were \nabsolutely united on was the principle that our people were better able to govern themselves than any British \ngovernment.\" He continued, \"I want to pay tribute to and comment on the work he did in the latter days of his \npolitical life in building agreement and leading unionism into a new accommodation with republicans and \nnationalists.\"\n\n\n\nSpecial Report on Scottish Independence:  \n\nThe Union holds as Scotland votes \"no\"  in landmark independence referendum --\n\nSummary:\n\nA referendum on Scottish independence was held on Sept. 18, 2014.  The referendum posed  the following \nquestion: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" Scotland's future status was at stake.  In the months \nleading up to the independence vote, the pro-unity side of the debate had the advantage; however, in the weeks \njust before the referendum was set to take place, nationalist passions flared to the benefit of the pro-independence \nflank.  Pre-referendum polling data showed a close race to the finish with the current structure of the United \nKingdom poised for possible transformation.  Would that transformation be limited to increased autonomy within the \npreserved United Kingdom, or would that transformation see a fully independent Scotland emerge on the global \nscene?  The answer to these questions came democratically on Sept. 18, 2014, with a decisive \"no\" to \nindependence and in favor of holding together the United Kingdom.  That being said, there would be changes afoot \nfor increased self-determination for Scotland under the aegis of a unified British nation state. With a voter turnout \nrate of between 85 and 90 percent, the Scottish independence vote stood as a reminder to the world of how \nparticipatory democracy works in a mature nation state.\n\nBackground:\n\nGoing back to February 2013, the  Scottish National Party  declared that if voters ratified sovereignty and \nindependence in a referendum to be held\n\nin 2014, Scotland would become an independent country in March 2016.  Scottish nationalists released an \nambitious timetable for independence that included a detailed itinerary of measures to be undertaken that would \nremove Scotland from the United Kingdom, establish a separate Treasury, and apply for accession to the European \nUnion in less than 20 months after ratification.\n\nA year later in February 2014, with an independence referendum set to be held in September 2014, the government \nof the United Kingdom made an impassioned plea for Scotland to stay within the union.\n\nAt the start of 2014, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said, \"We would be deeply diminished without \nScotland.\"  He continued, \"If we lost Scotland, if the U.K. changed, we would rip the rug from under our own \nreputation. The plain fact is we matter more in the world together.\"  If his positive and affirmative message of unity \nfailed to resonate with Scottish nationalists, Prime Minister Cameron was also willing to argue for a unified country \non the basis of negative consequences.  To that particular end, his government warned that an independent \nScotland would not be able to use the British pound sterling as its currency.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party (in a coalition government with Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives), as well as \nthe opposition Labor Party, joined the Conservatives in issuing a warning to Scottish nationalists.  Regardless of \ntheir partisan divisions, all three parties closed ranks to caution Scottish nationalists that an independent Scotland \nwould be prohibited from retaining the British pound sterling as its currency.  As noted by the United Kingdom's \nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, \"There's no legal reason why the rest of the U.K. would need to \nshare its currency with Scotland.\"\n\nThe pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) seemed undeterred by the threat, casting it as just an attempt \n\"to bully and intimidate.\" However, the notion that an independent Scotland would not have access to the \nestablished British pound sterling as the national currency would likely cause some referendum voters to think \n\n\n\ncritically about the costs of sovereignty.  Already, they would have to consider the ambitious independence \ntimetable of holding a referendum in September 2014, followed by independent nation state status in the first part of \n2016.\n\nFor its part, the SNP has said that its aggressive plan for independence  was in keeping with other shifts in the \nstatus of nation states in Europe, such as the splitting of the former Czechoslolvakia into  the Czech Republic and \nSlovakia.  But representatives of the  government of the United Kingdom were not quite so sanguine about the \nprospects of a sovereignty and independence schedule of less than two years.  Alistair Darling, the former press \nsecretary of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and current leader of an anti-independence group, Better Together, \nwas on the record dismissing the timetable as unrealistic.  He said, \"Even with the best will in the world, even if \nthere is no disagreement over some of the major issues like what happens to our currency, how we divide up our \npension system, and how we split the national debt, achieving this timetable is a tall order.\"\n\nIndeed,  in less than 20 months after ratification (assuming there was a \"yes\" vote), Scotland  would have to be \nremoved from the United Kingdom, and then establish a separate Treasury,  and apply for accession to the \nEuropean Union. other issues would be the division of military interests, such as the United Kingdom's submarine \nfleet, which was based in Scotland, as well as the  United Kingdom's claim to a permanent seat at the United \nNations Security Council.\n\nRegardless, the Sept. 18, 2014, date  set for a referendum on Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom \nwas moving forward.  The date was set to coincide with a re-enactment of the 700th anniversary of the Battle of \nBannockburn, a historic Scottish victory over the English.  In accordance with the  Scottish Independence \nReferendum Bill,  the referendum would pose the following question to voters for a \"yes\" or \"no\" response: \"Should \nScotland be an independent country?\"\n\nOn the issue of the Scottish independence, Salmond said, \"It will be a historic day and one on which this ancient \nnation decides its place in the world.\"  For his part, United Kingdom  Prime Minister David Cameron has said that \nScotland would be better off if it remained under the collective flag of  the United Kingdom.  He warned that \nfragmentation of the United Kingdom would result in diminished economic strength, national security, and \ninternational influence.  Perhaps not surprisingly,  Scottish First Minister Salmond held a different view, believing \nthat Scotland would be better positioned as a sovereign nation state.  To this end, Salmond argued: \"Only the \npowers of an independent parliament with control of the economy, of international representation and of security will \nallow us to make the most of our huge national potential.\"\n\nThe road to the Independence Referendum --\n\nAt the start of March 2014, with the independence referendum only months away,  Salmond -- the Scottish leader -- \ncalled on British citizens to support the independence campaign.  He argued that\n\nan independent Scotland would act as a countervailing power against London-centered domination.  He said, \"After \nScottish independence, the growth of a strong economic power in the north of these islands would benefit everyone \n-- our closest neighbors in the north of England more than anyone.\"  He continued, \"There would be a 'Northern \nLight' to redress the influence of the 'dark star' -- rebalancing the economic center of gravity of these islands.\"\n\nBut British Prime Minister David Cameron was carrying out his own pro-unity campaign (colloquially referred to as \n\"love bombing\")  in which he called on British citizens in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to remind their \nScottish friends and relatives that they were all better off together.\n\n\n\nFormer United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- a Scot --  entered the debate in mid-March 2014 to join the \nnon-partisan call for national unity, and to advocate for more increased autonomy for Scotland rather than \nindependence.  Speaking from Glasgow, Brown said, \"The majority of Scottish people do not want separation but \nequally they do want change.\"  He continued, \"I want to move us from the old highly centralized, uniform Britain \ndominated by out-of-date ideas of an undivided Westminster sovereignty to a new diverse power-sharing, risk-\nsharing, resource-sharing U.K. which is best defined ... as a modern, constitutional partnership of nations.\"\n\nPolling data has -- for some time --  indicated that most people in Scotland actually do not favor independence from \nthe United Kingdom, preferring to maintain the current union.  In March 2014, an Ipsos-Mori poll showed only 32 \npercent support for  Scottish independence, with 57 percent against it, and 11 percent undecided  Nevertheless, the \npro-independence forces planned for a robust campaign and with the intent of persuading people of their \nsovereignty argument.\n\nIn August 2014, with only a month to go before the referendum on Scottish independence was set to take place in \nSeptember 2014, the advantage appeared to reside with the pro-unity side. This advantage was displayed during \nan initial debate between Alex Salmond, the head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) and the  \nleader of the campaign for Scottish, and Alistair Darling, the leader of the campaign to retain Scotland as part of the \nUnited Kingdom.\n\nThe energetic debate, which was broadcast in the media, ended with the conclusion that Salmond -- usually a \npowerful speaker -- had not effectively made the case for independence, particularly as regards the economic path \nfor a sovereign Scotland.  On the other hand, Darling -- not known for his command of rhetoric -- offered a solid \nperformance by challenging Salmond's vision for post-independence currency and revenue.  Drawing attention to \nthe fact that an independent Scotland would not be allowed to use the British pound sterling,  Darling posed the \nfollowing question to Salmond: \"What is plan B?\"  Salmond was unable to substantially address this challenge, and \ninstead asserted, \"I am in favor of keeping the pound sterling,\" while claiming that that the pound belonged to both \nEngland and Scotland.  But the fact of the matter was that the United Kingdom had already rejected the notion of a \ncurrency union that would allow Scotland to use the British pound sterling as its legal tender.  To this end, Darling \nnoted that the use by an independent Scotland of the British pound would be like another country in the Americas \nusing the United States or Canadian dollar.  He declared: \"That's using sterling like Panama or Ecuador uses the \ndollar.\"\n\nIt should be noted that a second debate was held in the last week of August 2014.  During that engagement, \nSalmond enjoyed a much better performance with most observers concluding that he had \"won\" the argument \nagainst Darling -- at least for the night. It was to be seen if this strong rhetorical presentation  would persuade \nvoters to move to the pro-independence  position ahead of the actual referendum.\n\nNote that as August 2014 was coming to a close, polling data showed little movement in the views of voters.  While \nthere was some mild improvement towards the pro-independence side of the equation, the pro-unity faction \ncontinued to command the advatage.  A so-called \"poll of polls\" in mid-August 2014 showed that support for \nScottish independence  stood at 43 percent  while support for United Kingdom's unity stood at 57 percent.\n\nAt the start of September 2014, the landscape shifted significantly.  A YouGov survey for the Sunday Times showed \nthat, for the first time, the pro-independence side had taken the lead.  The \"Yes\" to Independence campaign now \nwas yielding 51 percent of support while the unionists had close to 49 percent.  Clearly, for advocates of Scottish \nindependence, the movement was peaking at precisely the right time -- just two weeks ahead of the referendum.  \nThe shift was attributed to the strong performance of pro-independence orchestrator, Salmond, in the second \ntelevised debate.\n\n\n\nUnderlining the reality that the referendum would go down to the wire and that Scots might, in fact, opt for \nindependence, a INS poll showed the \"no\" vote dropping to 39 percent with the \"yes\" vote within the statistical \nmargin of error with 38 percent. Several other polling surveys at the start of September 2014 showed momentum \nfor the \"yes\" vote.\n\nIndependence for Scotland would involve negotiations over usage of the pound sterling currency -- something the \n\"Better Together\" unity camp has warned would not end well for a sovereign Scotland, as discussed above.  Also to \nbe determined would be the division of the national debt of the United Kingdom, control over oil in the North Sea, \nand the fate of the nuclear submarine base located in Scotland. Other likely consequences of an independent \nScotland would be the loss of defense and financial sector jobs, along with obstacles to European Union accession.\n\nPolitically, the consequences of a successful \"yes\" campaign in Scotland would create dire consequences for both \nof the two major parties in the United Kingdom.  Should Scotland vote to exit the United Kingdom, the humiliation \nfor Prime Minister David Cameron would be great, and would likely include demands that the Conservative leader \nresign from office.  But the situation would be no rosier for the Labor Party, which would lose key support since the \ncurrent Scottish members of parliament would be effectively removed from the scene.\n\nWith such possible  ends at hand -- especially given the sudden burst of support for the independence movement --\nthere were plans afoot from the \"Better Together\" unionist campaign.  At issue was an attractive package that would \noffer  more powers to Scotland over its taxes, as well as its social and economic affairs.  This so-called \"devolution\" \nplan was intended to regain support of Scots looking for more autonomy and control, while not entirely interested in \nexiting the United Kingdom.  It was to be seen if this federal powers package would gain support.\n\nFormer United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on fellow Labor Party supporters to consider his \nparty's plan for devolution of powers, saying, \"This moves us as close to federalism as we can. Scotland is already \na nation. We are proud of our history and culture. Do we want to sever all constitutional links with our friends, our \nneighbors, our relatives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland?\"\n\nA week later, on the eve of the referendum, the official devolution package (brokered by former Prime Minister \nBrown) offered Scotland a guarantee of high levels of public spending as well as self-determination over health care \nspending.  At the end of the day, even if Scotland were to vote \"no\" to independence, as shown by this package,  \nthe structure of the United Kingdom was destined to change.  That change would involve the devolution of powers \naway from the central government in London.\n\nMeanwhile, the British political establishment was making an impassioned plea for unity.  United Kingdom  Prime \nMinister David Cameron declared, \"In the end, it is for the Scottish people to decide, but I want them to know that \nthe rest of the United Kingdom -- and I speak as prime minister -- want them to stay.\"\n\nPrime Minister Cameron subsequently emphasized the significance of a \"yes\" vote to ratify Scotland's \nindependence aspiration.  He warned that saying \"yes\" to independence would be a final stance with no room for \nreversal, as he declared: \"There's no going back from this. No re-run. If Scotland votes 'yes' the U.K. will split and \nwe will go our separate ways forever. \"\n\nThe Bank of England issued a stark reminder to Scots that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the \nBritish pound sterling currency.  The bank's governor, Mark Carney, warned that a currency union between an \nindependent Scotland and the remainder of the United Kingdom would be incompatible with the very notion of \nsovereignty.\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter was that there would be nothing stopping an independent Scotland from using the British \npound sterling as its currency.  However, without a currency and monetary arrangement -- something the Bank of \nEngland has said it will not entertain -- an independent Scotland would need a stockpile of pound sterling.  As well, \nthere would be potentially disastrous consequences for Scotland  since the Bank of England would no longer be \nlast lender of resort for Scotland's banking industry. Moreover, Scotland would have no say in monetary policy, \nwhich would be dictated by the Bank of England.\n\nMeanwhile, in an open letter, 14 former heads of the United Kingdom's Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force \nwarned that a \"yes\" vote for independence would be detrimental to the defense of both the United Kingdom and a \nfuture independent Scotland.  As stated in the piece, \"The division of the U.K. may or may not be politically or \neconomically sensible, but in military terms we are clear: it will weaken us all.\"\n\nOn the eve of the referendum, a slate of polls showed a close race to the finish, with the \"no\" vote recouping a slight \nadvantage. The closeness of the pre-election polls suggested that there was no known guarantee of the outcome of \nthe referendum. Three pollsters -- ICM, Opinium, and Survation -- showed support for independence at  48 percent \nwhile support for retaining the union stood at 52 percent. With a significant share of Scotland's voters (around 10 \npercent) still undecided, the result could conceivably go either way.\n\nReferendum and Result\n\nUltimately, on Sept. 18, 2014, Scottish voters were set to give their answer -- \"yes\" or \"no\" -- to the question,  \n\"Should Scotland be an independent country?\".\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the current structure of the United Kingdom was destined to change. Would that \ntransformation be limited to increased autonomy within the preserved United Kingdom, or, would that transformation \nsee a fully independent Scotland emerge on the global scene?\n\nThe answer to these questions came democratically on Sept. 18, 2014, with a decisive \"no\" vote to independence \nand in favor of holding together the union.  The pro-union vote share outperformed the pre-referendum polling data \nwith 55 percent voting \"no\" and in favor of remaining in the United Kingdom, and 45 percent voting \"yes\" and for \nScottish independence.\n\nOf the 32 councils in Scotland, only four voted \"yes\" in favor of independence, while 28 voted \"no\" and in favor of \nstaying in the United Kingdom. The divided sentiment of the electorate was illustrated by the fact that  Glasgow -- \nthe largest city in Scotland -- was a stronghold for the \"yes\" vote while Edinburgh -- the capital of Scotland -- voted \n\"no.\" That being said, the breakdown of the vote results from the 32 councils in Scotland suggested that the \"no\" \nvote was stronger in constituencies with better socio-economic conditions than in less comfortable constituencies \nwhere the \"yes\" vote saw a better performance.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Scottish independence referendum on Sept. 18, 2014, was marked by the highest voter \nturnout rate -- between 85 and 90 percent -- in a national election.  As such, the Scottish independence vote stood \nas a reminder to the rest of the world of how participatory democracy works in a mature nation state.\n\nAlistair Darling, the head of the \"Better Together\" pro-unity campaign declared victory, saying, \"We have chosen \nunity over division, and positive change rather than needless separation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond conceded defeat but warned that the government in London \nwould have to honor its commitments to extend greater powers to Scotland.  He said, \"There are 1.6 million people \n\n\n\nwho made a choice for independence.  I think the 1.6 million people will speak and speak loud if there is a retreat \nfrom the commitments made.\"  Salmond also announced that he would resign as leader of the Scottish Nationalist \nParty, saying: \"For me as leader my time is nearly over but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream will \nnever die.\"  Salmond's  deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, was seen as a likely successor and the favored choice to be the \nfuture leader of the Scottish Nationalists.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister David Cameron issued a public statement  hailing the referendum result, and noting that \nthe question of Scottish independence had now been settled for a generation.  He said, \"There can be no disputes, \nno re-runs, we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.\"  Cameron also promised to honor the \ncommitments to convey greater powers of self determination to Scotland, while also addressing nationalist \nsentiment in Northern Ireland, Wales, and England, as he asserted:  \"Just as Scotland will vote separately in the \nScottish parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England, as well as Wales and Northern \nIreland should be able to vote on these issues.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth issued a statement of national unity, declaring: \"Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no \ndoubt that Scots ... are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual \nrespect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country.\"\n\nWhile the question of Scottish independence was now settled, there would nonetheless be changes afoot for \nincreased self-determination and autonomy for Scotland under the aegis of the United Kingdom.  The question of \nhow those proposed transformations would go forward remained a matter of debate.\n\nOf note was the fact that Prime Minister Cameron's proposal was not being embraced by former Labor Prime \nMinister Gordon Brown, who lobbied hard for unity. Brown and other Labor leaders were  highly skeptical of \nCameron's call for increased autonomy for the other member state of the United Kingdom -- particularly in England, \nwhere Labor's influence could be diminished.  Labor Leader, Ed Milliband, made it clear that his party -- which \nhelped to seal the \"no\" vote -- would not sign on to Prime Minister Cameron's plan to use the Scottish devolution \nmeasures to give more power to English members of parliament.  Instead, he has called for a national constitutional \nconvention that would be tasked with crafting a plan to move forward.\n\nPrime Minister Cameron was also facing headwinds from within his own Conservative party with some members of \nparliament angry that Scotland should be \"rewarded:\" for its independence aspirations and at the expense of the \nrest of the United Kingdom, particularly England. It was for this reason that Cameron had introduced the notion of \nspecial provisions for all parts of the union.  But, as discussed here, that was a proposition was not being embraced \nby the Labor Party.\n\nAt the same time, Cameron's proposal caused grave consternation among Scottish nationalists, with the outgoing \nleader, Salmond, accusing the prime minister of \"tricking\" Scottish voters with promises of enhanced autonomy and \nspecial powers over taxes, social welfare, and spending before the vote, only to subsume those pledges as part of \na restructuring plan guaranteed to help his own Tory base with English constituents.  Addressing this complaint, \nCameron was forced to respond with a promise that  there would be no linkage between an eventual Scottish self-\ndetermination plan and a deal to assuage English conservatives.  His office was compelled to issue a statement \nconfirming that Scotland would receive more autonomy with no \"ifs or buts.\"\n\nIn practical terms, the scale of constitutional changes that would be necessitated to meet Scotland's needs for \ngreater autonomy and self determination would be significant, and thus promised to be a laborious endeavor.\n\nEditor's Note on the United Kingdom:\n\n\n\nLocated in Western Europe, between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, just to the northwest of France, \nthe United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is to be found \non the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland.\n\nIt should be noted that the terms \"Great Britain\" and \"United Kingdom\" cannot correctly be used in an \ninterchangeable manner.\n\nGreat Britain refers to the island to the west of France and east of Ireland that consists of three related regions -- \nEngland, Scotland, and Wales.  However, Great Britain is not the proper name of any current sovereign nation \nstate, as it excludes Northern Ireland, which is also part of the country called  the United Kingdom.  In fact, the \nofficial name of the country is \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nScotland and England were joined in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded his cousin, Queen Elizabeth \nI, to claim the British throne. In 1707, the Act of Union created a new country, Great Britain. Ireland had been \nconquered by the early 17th century, and the 1801 British Acts of Union established the United Kingdom of Great \nBritain and Ireland. In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland gained independence from London, with the other six counties \nremaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in \n1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully \ncompleted in March 2010.\n\nIn 2013, a process was started to allow for a referendum for Scottish independence.  That vote was to take place in \n2014.\n\nThe result of that referendum gave  a decisive victory to the pro-union side, effectively squashing the independence \nthrust at least for a generation in favor of increased Scottish autonomy.  It should be noted that in order for Scotland \nto become independent, regardless of the result of the internal referendum, the British Parliament would have to \ndissolve the Acts of Union.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the British Empire had been the foremost global power, stretching over one-\nfourth of the earth's surface. But World War I significantly weakened the United Kingdom, and the years following \nWorld War II saw the demise of the empire with many colonies gaining independence. Nevertheless, the country \nremains a major world economic and military power, with considerable political and cultural influence around the \nworld. As the world's first industrialized country, the economy of the United Kingdom is one of the largest in the \nworld as well as one of the strongest in Europe, and is considered to be a leading trading power and financial \ncenter.\n\nIt should also be noted that the United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary \ndemocracy and in advancing literature and science. The country has a long history as a major player in international \naffairs and fulfills an important role in the European Union, the United Nations and NATO. The United Kingdom is \nalso an active member of the European Union, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary \nUnion. The government has said a series of economic criteria must be met before the issue can be put to a \nreferendum.\n\nLast British combat troops exit Afghanistan \n\n\n\nIn late October 2014, United States and United Kingdom forces exited their main military bases in Helmand \nprovince, effectively turning security over to Afghan forces.  While the complete withdrawal of United States forces \nwould not ensue until 2016, a phased draw-down was certainly taking place and would continue over the course of \nthe next year.  At the same time, this particular exit from Helmand  was significant for the United Kingdom as it \nmarked the withdrawal of the last British combat forces from Afghanistan after being in the Afghan combat zone for \nmore than a decade.  For its part, the Afghan military said that it was prepared to take responsibility for the security \nof the country, pointing to the fact that increasingly, support from United States and United Kingdom forces had \nbecome more psychological than in the battlefield.\n\nUnited Kingdom and United States announce plans for counter-terrorism cooperation\n\nDuring a state visit to the United States, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron  joined his American \ncounterpart, President  Barack Obama, in announcing a plan for counter-terrorism cooperation.  Among the \nmeasures to be implemented were the establishment of a counter-terrorism  task force and the deployment of more \ndrones aimed at targeting the terror group, Islamic State. In the effort to track terrorists, the two leaders were \nadvocating greater cooperation with technology companies, with an eye on accessing encrypted communications \nthat terrorists may use to plot attacks.\n\nThe leaders of the two countries emphasized the closeness of the trans-Atlantic partnership, with both men offering \nfulsome assurances of their personal friendship as well as the strength and depth of the United Kingdom-United \nStates alliance.  Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama made clear that their two countries were committed \nto sharing information, intelligence, and expertise in the effort to prevent Islamist radicalism and to address \"violent \nextremism\" in their respective countries.\n\nSpeaking of the threat posed by Islamist terrorists in the wake of the Paris attacks, Prime Minister Cameron noted \nthat his country, along with the United States,  faced a \"poisonous and fanatical ideology.\"  He said: \"We face a \npoisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert one of the world's major religions, Islam, and create conflict, \nterror and death. With our allies we will confront it wherever it appears.\"  President Obama struck a similar tone, \nsaying that his country would work with the United Kingdom and other allies \"seamlessly to prevent attacks and \ndefeat these terrorist networks.\"  Explaining the challenge posed by radicalized extremists who carry out acts of \nterror, he said \"This is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction. But it is one that \nultimately we are going to defeat.\"\n\n2015  parliamentary elections in United Kingdom\n\nCitizens of United Kingdom make their choice in parliamentary elections; PM David Cameron's Conservatives \nsecure decisive victory while the Labour Party is routed by nationalists in Scotland --\n\nSummary:\n\nThe citizens of the United Kingdom were set to go to polls to vote in parliamentary elections to be held on May 7, \n2015. While the major dividing line in the election stood between the Conservative Party (known colloquially as the \nTories) and the Labour Party, the traditional political dichotomy was cross-cut by popular support for the nationalist \nparties -- the right-wing United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) and the the left-leaning Scottish National Party \n(SNP).\n\nGoing into the election, pre-election polling data suggested that no one party would secure an outright majority, and \ninstead the election was likely to produce yet another \"hung parliament.\"  The expected election discussion was to \n\n\n\nfocus on the party receiving the plurality of seats, and thus being positioned  to form a coalition government. \nDespite their contracting support, the Liberal Democrats -- the junior party in the outgoing Conservative-led \ngovernment -- insisted they would again play a kingmaker role.  In truth, however, the Scottish Nationalists were \nhoping that they would gain that kingmaker status even as the major contest would be set against Prime Minister \nDavid Cameron's Conservative Tories and Ed Milliband's Labour Party.\n\nIn reality, however, pre-election polling data turned out not to be predictive of what actually happened on election \nday. Instead, Prime Minister David Cameron and the Conservative Party secured a decisive election victory and a \nparliamentary majority. For its part, the Labour Party endured a disappointing performance, as well as a rout in \nScotland where the Scottish Nationalists won the lion's share of seats. This result augured the end of Ed Milliband's \ncareer at the helm of Labour.  Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats -- the junior partner in the outgoing Tory-led \ngovernment -- saw a spectacular erosion of support, albeit not complete decimation.  The leader of the Liberal \nDemocrats, Nick Clegg,  quickly made clear that it was time for his exit at the helm of his party.  Finally, while Nicola \nSturgeon could celebrate the triumph of the Scottish Nationalists, it was to be seen what role that party would play \nin the political environs of parliament.\n\nIn Detail:\n\nParliamentary elections were set to be held in the United Kingdom on May 7, 2015. At issue would be control over \nthe legislative branch of government.  In the United Kingdom, the bicameral parliament consists of the House of \nLords and the House of Commons.  The House of Lords has 788 seats; there are approximately 670 life peers, 92 \nhereditary peers, and 26 clergy; membership is not static.  The House of Commons has 650 seats; members \nelected by popular vote to serve five-year terms unless the House is dissolved earlier.  Political leadership is based \non control over the lower chamber -- the House of Commons -- where the leader of the majority party or coalition is \nthe prime minister and head of government.  As such, in the United Kingdom, election action is concentrated on the \nHouse of Commons.\n\nSince the last elections, which were held in May 2010, the United Kingdom has been politically led by Prime \nMinister  David Cameron (of the Conservative Party or \"Tories\") and  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (of the \nLiberal Democrats) in a coalition government.  In those 2010 elections, no one party had control over the House of \nCommons.  Cameron's center-right Conservatives garnered a plurality of the vote count but not an absolute \nmajority; they entered a coalition government with the third place center-left Liberal Democrats, while second place \nleft-leaning Labour Party moved from being the party in power into the party in opposition.  Former Prime Minister \nGordon Brown stepped down as leader of the Labour Party and moved to the position of backbench member of \nparliament.\n\nIn 2015, it was to be seen which party would be victorious.  The main parties expected to contest these electons \nincluded the center-right Conservative Party (known colloquially as the Tories), led by Prime Minister Cameron; the \ncenter-left Liberal Democrats and junior partner in the outgoing coalition, led by Deputy Prime Minister Clegg; the \nleft-leaning Labour Party, led by Ed Milliband, who was aspiring to become the new prime minister;  the right-wing \nUnited Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP), led by Nigel Farage; and the left-leaning Scottish National Party, led by \nNicola Sturgeon.  Also contesting the election would be a number of other  nationalist parties, such as  the \nDemocratic Unionist Party or DUP (Northern Ireland);  Ulster Unionist Party (Northern Ireland); Sinn Fein (Northern \nIreland); Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP (Northern Ireland); and Party of Wales, also known as Plaid \nCymru.\n\nSurvey data released in February 2015 ahead of the elections indicated that no one party would likely gain an \nabsolute majority at the polls. The research compiled by by the pollster group, Populus, and the public affairs \ncompany, Hanover, suggested that while Labour would lose several seats in Scotland to the Scottish nationalists, it \n\n\n\nwould nonetheless have a better chance of forming a majority leftist or center-left coalition than the Conservative \nTories, who would likely have to rely on consolidating their seats with the Liberal Democrats again in order to \ncontrol parliament.  They might also have to look to the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP in Northern Ireland to \nhold a majority.  The Conservatives would themselves lose seats to the right-wing  UKIP.\n\nHowever, polling data by Ashcroft in early February 2015 gave Prime Minister Cameron's Conservative Party a \nthree percentage point lead over Milliband's Labour Party -- 34 percent to 31 percent respectively.  In third place \nwas UKIP with 14 percent, followed by the Liberal Democrats with nine percent, and then the Greens with six \npercent. While this polling result offered a more positive pathway to victory for Prime Minister Cameron, he would \nstill need a far more significant lead to win an outright majority in parliament.  As before, were he to secure a \nplurality of the vote share but not a majority, he would once again have to form a coalition government.\n\nBy mid-February 2015, two polls gave contradictory forecasts of the elections to come.  The Guardian/ICM poll \ngave the Conservatives (Tories)  36 percent -- an increase of  six points from the previous month and the highest \nlevel since 2012.  Labour had fallen one point to 32 percent. The Liberal Democrats were at ten percent, UKIP was \nat nine percent, the Green Party was at seven points.  However,  a Populus poll gave the  Labour Party with lead \nwith  33 percent, with the Conservatives slightly behind with 31 percent.\n\nAt the start of March 2015, these trends remained roughly in place with the Tories holding a slight lead over \nLabour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP in competition for the right to play \"kingmaker\" in the case of a \"hung \nparliament.\" Of note was the consistently significant vote share being carried by the Scottish Nationalists to the \ndetriment of the Labour Party.  It was apparent that in the aftermath of the Scottish Independence referendum, and \nthe slow movement in achieving the promises advocated by the pro-unionists, Scottish voters were going their own \nway in these polls.\n\nAlso of note at the start of March 2015 was the fact that a political imbroglio was unfolding. At issue was the fact \nthat the Conservative leader David Cameron would consent to only one 90-minute televised debate ahead of the \nelections. His rivals from other parties, including Labour leader Ed Miliband, Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg, \nUKIP leader Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Green Party, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and \nLeanne Wood of Plaid Cymru, pilloried the Tory leader for refusing to engage in a thorough competition.\n\nA spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats noted that it was not right for one party to \"dictate their terms\" regarding \nthe debates. A UKIP spokesperson offered a more painful rebuke, saying, \"After praising what a good thing debates \nwere for democracy as recently as 2014, why is David Cameron now acting chicken and running as far away from \nthem as possible?\" Meanwhile, Douglas Adams of the Labour Party said, \"This is an outrageous attempt from the \nprime minister to bully the broadcasters into dropping their proposals for a head-to-head debate between David \nCameron and Ed Miliband.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another issue was brewing as regards the splitting of the right-wing vote between the Conservatives \n(Tories) and UKIP.  At issue was the South Thanet constituency of southern England, which has been  a \nConservative stronghold held by the Tories for most of the last 130 years.  In 2015, polling data indicated that  \nUKIP's leader, Nigel Farage, had a decent chance of winning this seat and grabbing control of a parliamentary seat \nlong-thought to be a safe win for the Tories.  For his part, Farage said if he failed to win the South Thanet seat, he \nwould resign as the leader of UKIP.  As stated by Farage,  \"The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for \nmyself in the Commons would be significant for both myself and the party.\" He continued, \"It is frankly just not \ncredible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat ... If I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains \nfor me. I will have to step down.\"\n\n\n\nTory leader Cameron entered the fray with his own pledge.  The prime minister said that if his Conservative Party \nwere to win the forthcoming  parliamentary elections, then  he would not seek a third term in office.  Instead, \nCameron said he would serve the full five-year term in government, if his party were to gain victory; however, he \nwould not seek to lead the country beyond that next five-year term.  In the interview with BBC News, Cameron said, \n\"There definitely comes a time when a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good, and the Conservative \nParty has some great people coming up.\"  Cameron's pledge did not resonate positively with the main opposition \nLabor Party.  David Alexander, the head of Labor's election campaign, said, \"It is typically arrogant of David \nCameron to presume a third Tory term in 2020 before the British public have been given the chance to have their \nsay in this election.\"\n\nPlaying to the nationalists and euro-skeptics -- an ultra-conservative voting base that might be vulnerable to \ntransferring their support to UKIP -- Cameron was promising to hold a referendum on European Union \nmembership.  The move was yielding results and boosting Cameron's prospects (as noted below) to hold onto his \njob as his Tories were now advancing a lead over Labor.  In response, Miliband was warning voters that a win for \nthe Conservatives could herald the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, with financial and \nbusiness woes to follow. The fact of the matter, however, was that in late March 2015, the advantage appeared to \nbe with Cameron and the Tories as discussed below.\n\nPolling data by ComRes for ITV News and the Daily Mail newspaper in late March 2015 showed Prime Minister \nCameron's Conservatives leading Miliband's Labour Party by four percentage points.  The Conservatives were \nnow sporting 36 percent support, with Labour holding onto 32 percent support.  UKIP was at 12 percent; the Liberal \nDemocrats were sitting just short of double digits with nine percent; and the Greens had five percent. It was to be \nseen if this trend would hold until election day.\n\nA televised political debate on April 2, 2015,  produced no clear winner, with post-debate data showing that Prime \nMinister Cameron, Labour leader Miliband, Scottish Nationalist leader  Nicola Sturgeon and UKIP leader Farage, \nall scoring well in terms of performance.\n\nThat debate performance was translating into a similarly close pre-election polling results with a  Guardian/ICM poll \nshowing Miliband slightly ahead of Cameron -- 25 percent to 24 percent -- in terms of which candidate was viewed \nas the debate winner. A separate YouGov opinion poll surveyed overall voting preferences and showed Cameron's  \nConservatives slightly ahead  of Miliband's Labour Party -- 37 percent to 35 percent respectively.  Meanwhile, a \npoll for the Daily Mirror publication gave the reverse result with Labour slightly ahead of the Conservatives -- 33 \npercent to 31 percent respectively.\n\nBy mid-April 2015,  YouGov polling data showed a close race between Labour and the Conservatives.  A series of \npolls by YouGov showed Labour hovering about 34-35 percent, just slightly ahead of the Conservatives, who had \n33 percent. UKIP was in third place with 13 percent, the Liberal Democrats had eight percent and the Greens had \nfive to six percent.\n\nTaken together, these results presaged a close election, with no one party likely to gain an outright parliamentary \nmajority, and with many citizens opting for other parties, such as UKIP and the Scottish Nationalists.  That being \nsaid, research by Deutsche Bank in mid-April 2015 suggested that while the election would very likely produce no \nclear winner and thus a \"hung parliament,\" Labour might be better positioned to form a government than the \nConservatives.\n\n\n\nLabour, in pure numbers, would lose significant seats in Scotland to the Scottish Nationalists due to Scottish \noutrage that few of the pre-independence referendum promises were kept.  But the Scottish Nationalists would \nnevertheless throw their support behind a Labour-led government, whereas they would shun the Conservatives. \nWhile the Liberal Democrats -- the junior partner in Cameron's Conservative-led government -- were actually \neroding support; they remained aware that they could play kingmaker in either a Labour-led or a Conservative-led \ngovernment in the future.  By contrast, the Conservative Party was losing support to UKIP, an unlikely coalition \npartner, while its current coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats was not likely to see a particularly strong \nperformance, and so could provide only limited (albeit crucial) support in a future Conservative-led government.  \nStated differently, even with its outgoing coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, the road to a coalition would thus \nbe comparatively more difficult for the Conservatives.  As such, the conclusion was that in a close election, Labour \nwould have more options of secondary parties in forming a sustainable coalition government.\n\nLabour received a boost in the third week of April 2015 following a final televised debate. Post-debate surveys -- \nwhich actually did not include Cameron  -- concluded that Miliband, the Labour Party leader, had won the rhetorical \nexercise.  However, that success was not necessarily translating into a boost at the polls. Instead, most polls taken \nduring this period actually gave the Conservatives the edge.  The daily YouGov poll gave Labour a one point \nadvantage -- 35 percent -- to the Conservatives with 34 percent, but its assessment in the next few days  showed \nthe Conservatives gaining support. A subsequent poll by YouGov showed the two main parties ties at 34 percent, \nwhile another one showed the Conservatives capturing the lead and holding 35 percent with Labour at 34 percent.  \nA separate poll by Survation showed a similar result with the Conservatives holding 34 percent and Labour was \ndown to 33 percent.\n\nAs April 2015 came to a close, the daily YouGov poll showed the Tories with a single percent lead of 35 percent to \n34 percent ahead of Labour. That one percent advantage was also reflected in an Opinium poll for the Observer \nnewspaper that showed the  Tories with a single point lead of 34 percent to 33 percent ahead of Labour.  But soon \nthereafter, another daily poll by YouGov showed Labour with the one point lead -- 35 percent -- against the \nConservatives, who had 34 percent.  As before, neither party could claim it was on track for an outright majority in \nparliament.\n\nIn the final days before the election, the two  parties made their final case for support.  For  Prime Minister David \nCameron's Conservative party, the emphasis was on their stewardship of the economy, matched by dire warnings \nof increased taxation, should the country by led by Milliband and Labour.  In an attempt to curry favor with the euro-\nskeptics and xenophobes that the Tories were losing to UKIP, Prime Minister Cameron also promised that, should \nhe hold onto power, a referendum would be held to decide whether the United Kingdom should remain in the \nEuropean Union.\n\nThe prime minister also mocked a  move by Labour leader Milliband to burnish his leadership credentials by \nproducing campaign promises literally engraved \"in stone\" upon a stone block. To this end, some critics acerbically \ncast Milliband as the biblical Moses. For his part, Cameron referred to the stone block as a \"tombstone,\" suggesting \nthat Milliband's political ambitions were about to see a death of sorts.  But despite Cameron's glib words, the fact of \nthe matter was that his Tories were unable to advance a notable lead against their main rivals, the Labour Party.\n\nIt was apparent that Milliband's passionate advocation of the United Kingdom's reverred national health service had \nstrong resonance among a significant portion of the population.  Likewise, Milliband had managed to challenge \nCameron's claimed accomplishments on the economy by reminding frustrated voters that all too often, impressive \nmacroeconomic data points did not translate into improved economic conditions in the quotidian lives of people. \nLabour's effort to cast the Tories' budget, which cut welfare spending, as mean-spirited also bolstered the \nargument that the Conservatives were not just indifferent to those struggling to make ends meet, but also balancing \nthe budget on the backs of the poor.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the final pre-election polls continued to show a close race, consistent with the slate of polling data \ndiscussed above. For example, both the daily YouGov poll and the Populus opinion poll  showed the two parties \ntied at 33 percent and 34 percent respectively, while the  Survation opinion poll showed Labour Leading by a single \npoint -- 34 percent -- to the Conservatives with 33 percent; the Ashcroft poll had the Conservatives ahead slightly \nwith 32 percent against Labour with 30 percent.\n\nAs the voters of the United Kingdom prepared to go to the polls to cast their ballots on May 7, 2015, the political \nlandscape remained static: No one party expected to secure an outright majority, and instead with the election likely \nto produce yet another \"hung parliament.\" Accordingly, all expectations were that the party receiving the plurality of \nseats would have the chance to form a coalition government. Despite their contracting support, the Liberal \nDemocrats -- the junior party in the outgoing Conservative-led government -- could again play a kingmaker role.  In \ntruth, however, the Liberal Democrats would compete with the UKIP and SNP for that kingmaker status, even as \nthe major contest would be set against Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Tories and Ed Milliband's \nLabour Party.\n\nNote on Political Procedure:\n\nTypically, the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons is the head of government and is appointed \nofficially by the British monarch. The government (prime minister and cabinet ministers) must maintain the support \nof a majority of the members of the House of Commons to remain in office.\n\nIf an election produces a \"hung parliament,\" there is the possibility of another election being called -- presumably \nwith the objective of garnering a more decisive result in the Round 2 election.  However,  the Fixed-Term \nParliaments Act of 2011 makes it difficult for early elections to be called.  In the past, a prime minister could simply \nchoose to dissolve parliament and call an election.  Since the advent of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, there are \nonly two routes to an early election. One option would require the parliament to approve the early election with the \nsupport of a two-thirds majority.  It was conceivable that the two-third majority support would only be secured with \nsome sort of alliance across party lines. The second option would involve a motion of no confidence in the \ngovernment, requiring only a simple majority. If the no confidence motion passed successfully,  a 14-day  timeline \nwould follow in which there would be  attempts to form a new government. The failure of those attempts failed \nwould facilitate an early election.  Given those parameters required for early elections to be called, the more \nattractive (and practical) option would be to form a sustainable coalition government.\n\nElection Results:\n\nWith most constituencies reporting their results, it was apparent that Prime Minister David Cameron had won a \nshock victory and would form a Conservative government.\n\nIn contrast to the predictions of the pre-election polling data, which forecast that no one party would likely secure a \nmajority, the  voters in United Kingdom had a different idea on election day and instead delivered an outright \nmajority to the Conservative Party. With very few constituencies yet to count at the time of writing, the Tories won \n330 seats -- just over half of the 650 parliamentary seats in total needed for a simply majority -- and  37 percent of \nthe total vote share.\n\nThe Labour Party saw a slight decline in the overall popular support from what was expected in the pre-election \ndata and and secured about 31 percent of the vote share.  The Labour Party was on track to secure approximately \n232 seats.  It should be noted that Labour's best performance was actually in the London area.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats appeared to have been punished at the polls, presumably for being the junior party in the \noutgoing Cameron-led coalition government.  The Liberal Democrats were on track to win less than ten seats and \nsaw about eight percent of the vote share.\n\nThe Scottish Nationalists enjoyed an overwhelmingly strong performance at the polls, wiping out the Labour Party \nfrom this northern stronghold and winning all but a handful of seats there.  Indeed, the SNP garnered 56 seats.\n\nDespite all the nationalist and sometimes vituperative rhetoric, there were only limited gains for UKIP to celebrate. \nIndeed, UKIP was on track to win only one or two seats.\n\nOther smaller parties, such as the Greens, as well as the regional parties, such as Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein, and the \nDemocratic Ulster Union were also  expected to gain representation in parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Cameron celebrated the victory of his Conservative Party, which outperformed the polling surveys \nwith impressive results.  On the morning of May 8, 2015, he traveled to Buckingham Palace for an audience with \nQueen Elizabeth II, the head of state in the United Kingdom, where he was  asked to lead the next government.\n\nMeanwhile,  Nick Clegg resigned as the head of the Liberal Democrats, citing the disastrous performance and \n\"catastrophic losses\" of his party at the 2015 polls.  He noted that it was the worst election experience of Liberal \nDemocrats since the founding of the party.\n\nWhile Labour's defeat was not quite so punishing as the Liberal Democrats' experience at the polls, Ed Milliband \nnonetheless took responsibility for the losses endured by his party, offered his congratulations to David Cameron,  \nand tendered his resignation, saying, \"I am truly sorry I did not succeed.\"\n\nNigel Farage of UKIP, who did not win his own seat, indicated there would have to be a fresh leadership contest \nwithin the party to set the course moving forward.\n\nThe only party leader other than Cameron celebrating was Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish Nationalists, who saw a \nrout in Scotland, winning almost every seat there.  Of course, it was hard to say how the strength of the SNP would \ntranslate into political strength since the SNP has made clear it would never work with a Tory government, while the \nTories were not in need of assistance in parliament from the Scottish Nationalists to advance their agenda.\n\nNevertheless, the election result for the Scottish Nationalists, juxtaposed against the Scottish independence \nreferendum earlier in the year, showed that the position of Scotland in the Union would  have to change in some \nform or fashion.  It was to be seen how that change might be envisioned.  For his part, Prime Minister Cameron \nquickly foreclosed the notion of another independence referendum for Scotland, saying in an interview with the \nmedia:  \"We had a referendum. Scotland voted emphatically to stay in the United Kingdom. There isn't going to be \nanother referendum.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with Cameron making a campaign promise regarding a future referendum on the United Kingdom's \nparticipation in the European Union, it was also clear that regional relations were on the agenda.  Of course, given \nthe close friendship between David Cameron and President Barack Obama in the United States, the trans-Atlantic \nrelationship was expected to remain strong. \n\nForeign Relations Note on Syrian Crisis\n\n\n\nSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an \naddition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in  2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding the \nresignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end corruption. \nBut over time, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hardline crackdown on dissent, \ntensions escalated between the government and the protesters.  The result was a full-scale civil war.\n\nAs of 2015, Syria was beset by two sets of intersecting challenges -- the ongoing civil war between the Assad \nregime and rebel forces on one end, and the horrific dangers posed by the notorious terror group, Islamic State, \nwhich had seized wide swaths of territory in Syria and left an appalling death toll.  It was generally understood that \nthe civil war conditions in Syria, to some extent, facilitated the emergence of Islamic State in  that country.  Syrian \nPresident Assad's priority to hold onto power, and thus the center of power in Damascus, had allowed a power \nchasm to flourish in other parts of the country, which Islamic State has been able to exploit.  The result has been a \nmass exodus of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in Europe.  The so-called migrant influx in  Europe \nhas raised questions as to how to legally and humanely deal with a burgeoning humanitarian refugee crisis.\n\nFollowing devastating terror attacks by the Islamist terror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French \ncitizens in the autumn of 2015,\n\nRussia and France intensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria .  At issue was the fact that \nIslamic State was claiming responsibility for a bomb that exploded on a Russian jet flying from the Egyptian resort \nof Sharm-el-Sheikh, killing more than 200 Russians on board.\n\nAlso at issue was the Islamic State claim of responsibility for a spate of appalling terror attacks in the French capital \ncity of Paris, which killed approximately 130 people.  Islamic State made clear that its brutal acts were being carried \nout because of the international community's engagement in Syria.  Islamic State also promised that attacks were \nto come in the United States and other Western countries.\n\nIn response to what could only be understood as acts of war by Islamic State, in November 2015, Russian and \nFrench warplanes had wasted no time before stepping up their respective air campaigns in Syria,  targeting Islamic \nState targets in the terror group's stronghold of Raqqa in a sustained manner.\n\nFrance also deployed its air craft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, to the Middle Eastern region for the purpose of \nsupporting the effort against Islamic State.  Of note was the fact that France was not limiting its air strike campaign \nfrom the Charles de Gaulle only to Islamic State targets in Syria, such as the terror group stronghold of Raqqa; \nindeed, France soon expanded its scope to hit Islamic State targets in Ramadi and Mosul in Iraq.\n\nWhile the United Kingdom was not, at the time, engaged in the Syrian crisis, the British government gave France \nthe use of its air base in Cyprus from which it could strike Islamist terror groups in the region.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron said that his country would provide  air-to-air refueling services and \nthat he would recommend that the  British parliament vote in favor of the his country joining the United States-led air \ncampaign to strike Islamic State targets. \n\nTo that end, a vote in the United Kingdom's House of Commons on Dec. 3, 2015 ended with overwhelming support \nfor that country to enter the multilateral air campaign against Islamic State in Syria.  Following more than 10 hours \nof passionate debate in the British legislative chamber, 397 members of parliament voted in favor of the measure \nwhile 223 members of parliament voted against it.  The vote tally was bipartisan with 66 members of parliament \nfrom the Labour Party siding with Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Cameron hailed the vote outcome, saying that the House of Commons had  \"taken the right decision \nto keep the country safe.\"  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the vote was a move in the right direction \nas he declared,  \"Military strikes alone won't help Syria, won't keep us safe from Daesh. But this multi-strand \napproach will.\"  Of course, the vote outcome generated outrage from\n\nboth inside and outside parliament.  Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted that the United Kingdom's \nengagement in Syria would only make the country less safe.  Outside the parliamentary buildings, anti-war \nprotesters from various groups including the  \"Stop the War\" Coalition gathered to oppose the move.\n\nSpecial Entry on \"Brexit\"  and Political After-effects\n\nSummary\n\nIn July 2016, in the aftermath of a referendum on the United Kingdom's engagement in the European Union, the \npolitical landscape was marked by tectonic political shifts.  Notably, following the decision by the people of the \nUnited Kingdom to ratify its withdrawal from the European Union, known as \"Brexit,\" there was also a concomitant \ntransformation at the political level.  Of note was the turmoil within the opposition Labour Party over leader, Jeremy \nCorbyn,  and more significantly, the decision by Prime  Minister David Cameron to step down. Suffering a \ncatastrophic loss of political capital over the Brexit vote, which did not go his way, he noted that the time was right \nfor new leadership. To that end, he was succeeded on July 13, 2016, by Theresa May as the new Conservative \nleader and prime minister.\n\nIn Detail\n\nA highly anticipated referendum was set to take place on June 23, 2016, on the future of the United Kingdom's \nparticipation in the European Union (EU).  The choices before the people of the United Kingdom (UK) was either to \nopt out of the EU with a \"leave\" vote, or, to \"remain\" in the EU.\n\nThe so-called \"Brexit\" vote promised to be a close contest with anti-immigrant sentiment and a Syrian refugee crisis \nfueling intensified support for nativism, and thus boosting the \"leave\" vote.  Indeed, at the start of June 2016, polls \nshowed that it could go either way, with  a small but significant advantage for those opting out of the EU.\n\nThe UK's exit from the EU, from which it was a part since 1973, was being viewed through the lens of trepidation, \nwith far reaching consequences of the political and economic variety at hand.\n\nThe chance of a Brexit was contributing consternation to the business front, with fears arising about the devaluation \nof the UK's pound sterling currency,  and concerns emerging about the effects on the value of British government \nbond yields.  Other anxieties revolved around the country's  trade deals -- all of which would have to be \nrenegotiated, as well as the country's investment prospects.  Indeed, the Bank of England  entered the fray to warn \nvoters in the UK that  there would be dire consequences and significant financial disruption to come from a Brexit -- \nindeed, it would by a deleterious move on the economic front not only in the UK but internationally.\n\nThese warnings appeared to be falling on significant deaf ears, with immigration-based anxieties and arguments of \nnational sovereignty trumping the reality of catastrophic economic consequences.\n\n\n\nThe dynamics shifted in mid-June 2016 when a  British member of parliament was assassinated by an ultra-right \nanti-immigration activist.  The death of Jo Cox, a  member of parliament from the Labour Party,  who was known \nfor her advocacy of Syrian refugees and for her advocacy of the \"remain\" campaign, was stabbed and shot to death \nin West Yorkshire by an assailant screaming \"Britain First.\"\n\nThe assailant was later identified as Thomas Mair and was reported to have connection to far-right and extremist \nhate groups, along with a record of psychiatric problems.\n\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron  expressed horror of Cox's assassination, saying the country was \"rightly \nshocked.\"  He also praised Cox's legacy of community and tolerance, as well as her reputation for compassion for \nthose in need.  Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, cast Cox's murder as \"extreme political violence\" and \"an attack on \ndemocracy.\"  Members of parliament from the major parties joined in mourning for their late colleague with multi-\npartisan sobriety  over not just the loss of life -- but the loss of someone who whose  generous character embodied \nthe most respected national values.\n\nOverall, there was some restraint from expressly linking the death of Cox to the Brexit referendum.  But there was \nnonetheless a sense that the ideological struggle between inclusion and xenophobia very likely fueled the tragic \nscenario.  There was also a feeling of shock that gripped not only the UK but the entirety of Europe where such \nassassinations have been a rarity for decades.\n\nBy the last week of June 2016, with the Brexit vote only days away, the climate in the UK had shifted somewhat.  It \nremained unclear if the shocking death of Cox had been a factor in the change in dynamics, although it was clear \nthat the country was weary from the bitter and divisive debate that had gone on, and a  national trauma had swept \nthe nation with Cox's murder.\n\nRegardless of whether this played a role or not was unknown, but now the \"remain\" camp had the advantage in \ndeciding whether or not the UK would stay in the EU.\n\nNote:  On July 23, 2016, after British voters cast their votes in the Brexit referendum and their choices were tallied, \nit was clear that people had chosen to leave the European Union.  The final vote was 52-48 in favor of \"leave\" over \n\"remain.\"\n\nWith his political capital expended, and now with his legacy  now tainted with the distinction of being the prime \nminister under whose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, David Cameron resigned as the \nhead of government.  Cameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down \nahead of the Conservative party's conference.  In a national address, he said, \"I love this country and feel honored \nto have served it. Will of British people must be respected.\"\n\nHe continued,  \"The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt \nabout the result.\"  He urged new leadership, saying, \"I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This \nwill require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the news of Brexit immediately spurred a financial meltdown in the global markets with \nobservers noting that in  the Bank of England was poised to play a crucially important stabilizing role.\n\n\n\nIn the days after the Brexit referendum and Prime Minister Cameron's announcement that he would be resigning, \nthere was a meeting of the European Parliament in the Belgian capital of Brussels.  On the agenda was the \nimpending withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\n\nOf note was the fact that some EU leaders were making it known that the UK would not be allowed to \"cherry pick\" \naspects of the regional bloc to retain for its own benefit.  As well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,  said that the \nbloc would \"respect the result\" of the  vote, but that the UK needed to flesh out its exit strategy as quickly as \npossible.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker echoed this sentiment, saying that the UK did not have \n\"months to meditate\" on  its exit schedule and strategy.\n\nTo that end, the EU argued that the UL had to  formally invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to trigger the \nwithdrawal talks.  However, outgoing UK Prime Minister  Cameron said Article 50 should  only be invoked by his \nsuccessor, who would have the duty of guiding the country through that process.\n\nOf course, that successor would not likely be chosen until the autumn of 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, there were reverberations on the domestic political landscape in the UK from the Brexit vote. In  \nparticular, the vote appeared to have spurred intra-party turbulence and turmoil within the ruling Conservative Party \nand the official opposition party, Labour, with leadership struggles anticipated to ensue.\n\nAs discussed above, Prime Minister Cameron had announced his resignation, thus triggering a leadership fight \namong the Tories (Conservatives) .  One of the first aspirants for Tory leadership was Liam Fox, the former \nDefense Secretary and a  well-known \"Leave\" campaign advocate.  Other contenders included  Work and Pensions \nSecretary Stephen Crabb  and Home Secretary Theresa May.  But it was former London Mayor Boris Johnson -- a \nprominent \"Leave\" advocate -- was believed to have the edge thanks to the support of 100  members of parliament.\n\nHowever, Johnson shocked the country by eventually stating that he did not intend to run for the leadership post, \nthis generating criticism for his role in sending the country into chaos and bailing before the hard work needed to be \ndone.\n\nWith the Labour Party, the leader -- Jeremy Corbyn -- was being pilloried with many of his own party in revolt \nagainst him.  At issue was the perception that he had not doing enough to prevent the \"Leave\" campaign from  \nwinning.  In fact, on June 29, 2016, Corbyn lost a confidence vote within the party, while a large swath of his \nshadow cabinet resigned.  Although Corbyn vowed that he would not be pushed out, the fact of the matter was that \nhe has limited power and influence at his disposal at the close of June 2016.\n\nWith both the Tories and Labour in the midst of these respective power struggles, Liberal Democrat leader, Tim \nFarron,  said in an interview with BBC News \"The last thing we need\" was for the country's  two major parties \nconfronting  leadership crises.  That being said, Farron seemed willing to leverage the situation to the benefit of the \nLiberal Democrats as he declared his party to be  \"the gathering place for progressives.\"  Farron called for a \npolitical  realignment, warning that without it, \"We will be left with a Tory government forever.\"\n\nBy mid-2016, the post-Brexit political drama was unfolding.  Within the Labour Party, political plots were being \nhatched to oust party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who lost a confidence vote but remained in place.  Labour member of \nparliament, Angela Eagle, soon indicated that she would be willing to challenge Corbyn for the party's leadership.\n\n\n\nBy mid-July 2016,  Eagle had lodged her official bid to take Labour's leadership reins.  In a speech making her \nannouncement, she said, \"Today I am announcing my decision to stand for the leadership of the Labour Party.\"She \ncontinued, \"Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership that this party needs \u2013 I believe I can. I am not a \nBlairite, I am not a Brownite and I am not a Corbynista, I am my own woman.\"\n\nFallout was also occurring within the nativist UK  Independence Party where \"Leave\" champion, Farage, announced \nhis resignation as the party's leader.\n\nAs one of the  UK's most passionate advocates for leaving the EU, Farage's announcement was met with shock.  \nFarage defended his move saying that he had achieved his goal -- that of exiting the EU.  He said, \"I have never \nbeen, and I have never wanted to be, a career politician. My aim in being in politics was to get Britain out of the \nEuropean Union.\"  He added, \"During the referendum campaign, I said 'I want my country back.' What I'm saying \ntoday, is, 'I want my life back,' and it begins right now.\" The truth of the matter was that his departure left a gap to \nbe filled in the \"Leave\" camp.\n\nFor the Tories, party stalwart,  Theresa May, and an advocate of the \"Remain\" campaign was regarded as a \nfrontrunner to succeed Cameron now that Johnson telegraphed that he did not want the job of leading the party or \nthe country on its path out of the EU.  Following a leadership race in the first part of July 2016 involving  Andrea, a \njunior energy minister, Michael Gove, another junior secretary, and  former defense minister, Liam Fox, it was May \nwho emerged victorious after successive waves of internal party votes.\n\nBy  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen \nElizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that \npost since Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn her first address after becoming prime minister, May stood outside  10 Downing Street and declared that her goal \nwas said to \"build a better Britain.\" In an appeal to the British people, she said,  \"The government I lead will be \ndriven, not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more \ncontrol over your lives.  When we take the big calls, we'll think not of the powerful, but you.\"\n\nIn her initial round of cabinet appointments, May retained  Philip Hammond -- the foreign secretary under Cameron \n-- but with the position of  chancellor.  Meanwhile, she shocked the public by selecting  Boris Johnson  -- not known \nfor his international statesmanship  and notorious for his Brexit advocacy -- as the new foreign secretary.  Another \nappointment of note was that of  David Davis, a Euroskeptic,  who was selected to lead negotiations on exiting the \nEuropean Union.\n\nMeanwhile, there were also effects of the Brexit vote on the status of Scotland, with some analysts suggesting that \nperhaps there might be a renewed  push for independence.  However, a post-Brexit poll indicated there was no \nappetite for another independence referendum, despite the fact that Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made \na declaration about  another referendum being \"highly likely.\"\n\nFormer UK PM Cameron announces resignation as MP; UK readies for Brexit\n\nIn September 2016, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Cameron announced that he was resigning his post as \na Member of Parliament.\n\nGoing back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from \nthe European Union, Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. With his political capital \n\n\n\nexpended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under whose stewardship the \nUnited Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government.\n\nCameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative \nparty's conference.  In a national address, he said, \"I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of \nBritish people must be respected.\"\n\nHe continued,  \"The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt \nabout the result.\"  He urged new leadership, saying, \"I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This \nwill require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.\"\n\nBy  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen \nElizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that \npost since Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn September 2016, Cameron further announced that he would be resigning from his position as an elected \nMember of Parliament. Cameron said that he would step down from his role as the elected representative of his \nOxfordshire constituency, and allow someone else to take on that role.  He explained that his presence as a  \"back \nbencher\" in parliament was something of a distraction.  A by-election would be called to fill his seat.\n\nIn October 2016, UK Prime Minister Therea May announced that her country would trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon \nTreaty and begin the formal process of her country withdrawing from the European Union. May also foreclosed the \nnotion of an early general election, noting that such a course would only augur instability in the UK.  Instead, ay said \nthat she would advance the repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which took the United Kingdom into the \nEuropean Common Market, now knowns as the European Union.  She said in an interview with the media, \"We will \nintroduce, in the next Queen's speech, a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European Communities Act from the \nstatute book.\"  The act would become effective upon the formal exit of the UK from the European Union.\n\nUK formally commences Brexit process of withdrawing from the European Union\n\nOn March 29, 2017, British  Prime Minister Theresa May formally began the process known colloquially as \"Brexit' \nof withdrawing the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn keeping with Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May notified European Union \nCouncil President Donald Tusk via a hand-delivered letter that her country would exit the European bloc after \ndecades of participation dating back to 1973.\n\nIn a speech to parliament, she declared, \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.\" She added, \"This is \nan historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\"\n\nA difficult process lasting up to two years was in the offing whereby the United Kingdom would seek to negotiate the \nterms of its exit from the European Union. Those negotiations would largely center on the United Kingdom's \nrelations with the European Union with regard to trade and security.\n\nNote that  Brexit set to be finalized in May 2019.\n\nTerror attack at Ariana Grande concert in Manchester leaves more than 20 dead\n\nOn May 22, 2017, a terror attack after a concert for pop singer Ariana Grande  in Manchester in the United Kingdom \nleft more than 20 people dead and approximately 50 others injured.  Among the dead were children, teenagers, and \nyoung people attracted to Grande's music.\n\nThe  blast occurred just after Grande left the stage at Manchester's largest indoor arena. The pop star expressed \nher shock and grief via the social media outlet, Twitter, saying, \"Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so \nsorry. I don't have words.\"\n\n\n\nAuthorities soon announced that a suicide bombing caused the bloodshed.  The assailant was identified as  22-\nyear-old Salman Abedi -- a United Kingdom-born son of Libyan refugees.  The terror group,  Islamic State, soon \nclaimed responsibility for the bombing, which was deemed the worst terrorist attack in the United Kingdom since the \ndeaths of 56 people in the July 7, 2005 London bombings.\n\nGiven the horror of the 2017 attack,  the Conservatives, Labour, Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats \ntemporarily suspended campaigning for the general election. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May \ncondemned the attack, convened an  emergency meeting, and raised the terror alert level nationally to \"severe.\"\n\nTerror attack on London Bridge; Islamic States says its fighters responsible\n\nOn June 3, 2017, the British capital city was struck by a terrorist attack when Islamist extremist assailants in a white \nvan rammed their vehicle into people on London Bridge.  After that initial attack, three male assailants wearing fake \nsuicide vests exited the van and attacked the crowd using knives while screaming, \"This is for Allah.\"  They then ran \ntowards Borough Market where they continued their rage of terror, attempting to stab random people at restaurants \nand bars in the area.\n\nPolice arrived on the scene, opened fire, and ultimately killed the attackers in short order.  However, by that point, \nat least seven people in total had died and approximately 50 others had been injured -- about half of them being in \ncritical condition.\n\nIt should be noted that the notorious terror group, Islamic State, soon claimed responsibility, saying its \"fighters\" \ncarried out the attack.  To that end, the killers were identified as Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane of \nBarking in the United Kingdom, and  Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-Italian man.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May convened an emergency meeting in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room \nA, where crisis response discussions are typically held.  Prime Minister May decried the \"evil\" ideology of Islamist \nterrorists who carried out the bloodshed.  She warned of counter-terrorism measures  to come, saying that her \ncountry \"cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are.\"  Of particular note was her call for \nregulation of the Internet where Islamist extremists have been radicalized.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, a global political imbroglio had been sparked when United States President Donald \nTrump accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of offering \"pathetic excuses\" when Khan assured  Londoners that there \nwas no reason for people to be alarmed.  In fact, the London mayor was assuring the people that they should not \nbe alarmed by the increased police presence.  However, Trump used the truncated quote to further his oft-repeated \nclaim that politicians are often too politically correct regarding terror. Trump appeared to suggest that the London \nmayor -- a Muslim --  was downplaying the horror of the act of terrorism, even though there was a misrepresentation \nof Khan's actual words.\n\nFor his part, Khan's spokesperson initially dismissed Trump's accusations saying that the mayor \"has more \nimportant things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context.\" \nLater, in an interview with  BBC News, Khan said: \"We've got to recognize that some people want to divide our \ncommunities, some people thrive on fueling division. That's not me, that's not the London I know, and we aren't \ngoing to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community.\"\n\nThe issue was becoming a political one with the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, saying: \"This is a man \ninsulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning.\"  Meanwhile, other politicians were urging that \nthe invitation to Trump for a state visit be revoked.\n\nPrimer on 2017 parliamentary elections in United Kingdom\n\nThe citizens of the United Kingdom were set to go to polls to vote in parliamentary elections to be held on June 8, \n2017 -- two years ahead of schedule. At issue for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May was the desire to seek \na governing mandate as she guided the country through the process of exiting the European union, known \ncolloquially as \"brexit.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the major dividing line in the election stood between the Conservative Party (known as the Tories) and the \nLabour Party, the traditional political dichotomy was cross-cut by popular support for the nationalist parties -- the \nright-wing United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP), the left-leaning Scottish National Party (SNP), and to a lesser \ndegree, by the center-left Liberal Democrats.\n\nAt issue would be the composition of the lower parliamentary chamber in the bicameral legislature - the House of \nCommons.  With that 650 seat body, members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms unless the \nHouse is dissolved earlier.\n\nIn the previous elections, the Conservatives (Tories) won the most seats.\n\nGoing into the 2017 contest, polling data gave the Tories a wide lead over Labour.  The main problem for the \nLabour Party appeared to be intra-party fighting  over its leader Jeremy Corbyn.  Labour was also finding that it \nwas on track to be obliterated in its former stronghold of Scotland, and quite possibly in Wales as well. \n Conservative Prime Minister May would also be helped by voters who had been inclined towards the nationalist \nUKIP party, which was strongly in favor of Brexit, but who were now turning to the Tories.\n\nIn the week ahead of the election, however, with Labour fighting back with a series of well produced advertising, an \ninspired manifesto, and a rousing debate performance by Corbyn, some of the polls tightened significantly. That \ntightening of the polls was also partially due to weakening support for the Tories following a harsh policy manifesto. \n That manifesto included a widely pilloried plan to make the elderly pay more for their care and was unfavorably \nblasted as a  \"dementia tax.\"\n\nAs such, in the days ahead of election day, some polls indicated that Labour was trailing the Tories only slightly -- \nand within the margin of error.  Still others, though, suggested that the Conservatives would win.  It was to be seen \nif Labour could pull off a shock surge, or, if a terrorist attack in London on London Bridge would be the decisive \nfactor in returning the Tories to power.\n\nOnce the votes were counted, it appeared that the polls showing a close race were predictive as the United \nKingdom was headed for a \"hung parliament.\" Indeed, while the Tories won the most seats -- 318, they remained \nshort of an absolute majority in the 650 seat parliament.  The Labour Party appeared to have put forth a valiant \neffort, winning several marginal seats, even winning seats in Wales that were forecast to be lost, and ultimately \ndenying Prime Minister May the mandate she was seeking.  Indeed, the Labour Party, under the leadership of \nleftist Corbyn, had consolidated its vote share and won  261 seats.\n\nFor her part, as she delivered a subdued speech from her Maidenhead constituency, Prime Minister May \n telegraphed that she would not be stepping down, despite the humiliating performance of her party after leading by \ndouble digits in the polls.  She made no mention of the fact that her party had squandered the opportunity to secure \na landslide victory.  Instead, May was insistent that she hold onto power and be the person who would manage the \nUnited Kingdom's exit from the European Union.\n\nThe following day,  Prime Minister May expressed regret for the  loss of Conservative seats, saying, \"I'm sorry for all \nthose candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful.\"  She added, \"As I reflect on the results I \nwill reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.\"\n\nMay also confirmed that she would stay on as prime minister at the helm of a minority government, and she would \nseek support from the  Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland to hold onto power.  While the DUP \nwould not be part of a formal coalition with the Tories, it would nonetheless offer operational support for the \nQueen's Speech and to pass a budget (effectively, a confidence vote).\n\nSpeaking of this arrangement, May said, \"Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and \nthis gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United \nKingdom.\"  It should be noted that DUP leader Arlene Foster offered a less than enthusiastic statement on the \nproposed alliance, saying: \"The prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with \nthe Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.\"\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Prime Minister May went to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a \ngovernment -- albeit of the fragile variety.  She also made clear that Brexit negotiations would commence on June \n19, 2017, as scheduled.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Corbyn, who was enjoying political vindication as a result of his party's surprisingly \nstrong performance, made  May should step down.  He also indicated that he was prepared to form a minority \ngovernment.  He said, \"The mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost \nconfidence.\" Corbyn added,  \"I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government \nthat will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.\"\n\nCorbyn and the Labour Party would be looking towards the Queen's Speech, which outlines the governing agenda, \nand the ensuing vote after as a sign of whether May could continue as head of government.  Should the vote at the \nend of debate after the Queen's Speech go favorably by winning a majority of support in parliament, May could then \nconceivably pursue passing a budget, which would also be a confidence measure of sorts.  However, if May were to \nbe foiled after the debate on the Queen's Speech, then Labour could, quite possibly, be given a chance to form a \ngovernment.\n\nHurricanes devastate the Caribbean\n\nEarly September 2017 was marked by the wrath of monster Hurricane Irma, which decimated several islands of the \nLeeward Caribbean before raging across the state of Florida in the United States.  Irma had the dubious distinction \nof being the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade.\n\nAs a Category 5 hurricane, Irma slammed into the island of Barbuda - part of the two-island state of Antigua-\nBarbuda -- with maximum sustained  winds of 185 miles per hour.  But the massive storm's wide expanse of \nexternal bands hit neighboring islands such as St. Martin/St. Maarten and St Barthelemy in the Netherlands and \nFrench Antilles, Anguilla in the British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States territories of \nthe Virgin Islands and\n\nPuerto Rico with destructive force.  The storm's path continued on across the northern coasts of Cuba, across \nportions of the Bahamas, and then sweeping over the Florida Keys  with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles \nper hour, before covering the rest of the state with dangerous floods and winds. \n\nIn the Caribbean, dozens of people were killed but no place suffered worse destruction than Barbuda.  According to \nPrime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda said Irma had wreaked \"absolute devastation\" on Barbuda, \nwhich was now \"barely habitable\" with 95 percent of the island's infrastructure  completely destroyed. \n\nUp to 90 percent of St. Martin's infrastructure had also been utterly decimated, essentially destroying the \nFrench/Dutch territory's tourism industry. \n\nCuba's north coast, which was home to much of its burgeoning tourism industry,  had now suffered a massive \nsetback in the already-struggling Communist country. Particularly hard-hit\n\nHavana, Matanzas, Camag\u00fcey and Ciego de \u00c1vila. Ten people were confirmed to have been killed in Cuba alone \nwith authorities noting they had not evacuated to shelters, as instructed to do so.  \n\nAcross the Leeward Caribbean, island nations and territories were being faced with dozens of deaths widespread \ndamage and destruction to infrastructure, as well as a  humanitarian crisis. \n\n\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May of the United  Kingdom pledged 32 million in British pounds for recovery assistance in \nthe Caribbean.  The Dutch monarch King Willem-Alexander,  visited Netherlands Antilles affected by Irma, including \nthe Dutch side of St Maarten to show solidarity with the people. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte promised an \nintensified security presence in affected Dutch territories to ensure order, and noted that security forces had been \nauthorized to function with a \"firm hand.\"  French President Emmanuel Macron was criticized for the lateness of his \nresponse to St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, but was also expected to make his way to the region to survey the \ndamage and offer assistance for French Caribbean territories' recovery and rebuilding efforts.  \n\nIndependent Caribbean island nations such as Cuba and Antigua-Barbuda would have a more difficult time on their \nlimited resources to recover from Irma's wrath.  In Barbuda more than 1,300 Barbadians were in shelters in Antigua \nwith no suggestion of when they might return home. Assistance was coming from regional neighbors such as \nJamaica, St Lucia, and Trinidad and promised assistance while a team from the Caribbean Disaster Emergency \nManagement Agency (CDEMA) was  on the ground in Barbuda carrying out an assessment.  A Go Fund Me fund \nhad been established to try to rescue animals left to roam free in Barbuda in the aftermath of the storm. \n\nLater in September 2017, the islands of the  Caribbean were bracing for yet another strike by Mother Nature -- this \ntime by Hurricane Maria. The Category five hurricane was forecast to hit the  Leeward Islands in the Caribbean on \nSept. 18, 2017.  Hurricane warnings were issued for the islands of Dominica, St. Lucia. St. Kitts-Nevis, the  French \noverseas territories of  Guadeloupe and Martinique, the United Kingdom overseas territories of Montserrat and the \nBritish Virgin Islands, as well as the United States Virgin islands.  Hurricane watches were issues for the French \nterritories of St Martin  (also partially under Dutch jurisdiction) and St Barts, as well as the United States territory of \nPuerto Rico.  The islands of Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla were also under hurricane watches.  Of concern was \nthe fact that some of these islands were still suffering the effects of  Irma, and were about to be struck again.\n\nNote that on Sept, 19, 2017, it was reported that Hurricane Maria had almost completely destroyed the Caribbean \nisland nation of Dominica.  The tiny island of less than 80,000 people was viciously struck with maximum sustained \nwinds of nearly 160 miles per hour, which according to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, had decimated most of the \ncountry's infrastructure.  His own home suffered catastrophic failure - as was the case for most Dominicans. Via the \nsocial media outlet Facebook, Skerrit said, \"So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest \nfear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely \nlandslides triggered by persistent rains.\" He added that the island nation's immediate priority was the rescue of \npeople trapped be the damage of the hurricane, and provision of  medical care to the injured.  \n\nIn the longer run, though, Dominican authorities would have to deal with the reality that the entire country was left in \n\"war zone\" conditions. \n\nFollowing Maria's destruction of Dominica, the hurricane went onto to strike Puerto Rico -- home to close to 3.5 \nmillion Americans -- with brutal force.  In the aftermath of Maria, the island was dealing with destructive and e-coli \ninfested flooding.  That situation was exacerbated when dams were breached. At the same time, large swaths of \nphysical infrastructure were left destroyed.  Meanwhile, the communications networks, including cellular phone and \ninternet service, were largely compromised.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister May and Dutch embassy publicly chastise U.S. President Trump for sharing anti-Muslim videos\n\nIn late November 2017, President Donald Trump shared anti-Muslim videos from a known extremist  entity, Britain \nFirst, on his favorite communications outlet, Twitter.  British First Britain First seeks to end all immigration, establish \na ban on Islam, and deport all persons found to be promoting Islamic ideology. The videos were initially posted by \nthe ultra-right xenophobic deputy leader of British First, Jayda Fransen.  Of note was the fact that Fransen was \ncharged for aggravated harassment and convicted of abusing a Muslim woman.\n\n\n\nTrump, whose campaign platform included a Muslim ban, has been known to tweet controversial content in the \npast. Indeed, he retweeted material from white nationalist groups before. But the White House defended these \nretweets of Franzen's anti-Muslim videos, emphasizing that the president was elected for his national security \nviews of immigrants and other groups viewed by his base as a threat to the United States.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said, \"Look, I'm not talking about the nature of the video. The threat is \nreal and that's what the president is talking about is the need for national security, the need for military spending, \nand those are very real things. There's nothing fake about that.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Franzen's videos surrounded the fact that she convicted of abusing a Muslim woman.\n\nMembers of parliament, as such, reacted with outrage at the notion of a United states president disseminating \ncontent from a discredited source such as Fransen, with a clear incendiary purpose.  Some members of parliament \nlamented Trump's reckless use of Twitter, while others called for the state visit invitation to the U.S. president to be \nrevoked.\n\nThe conservative prime minister herself weighed in, issuing a statement in which Theresa May declared: \"It is \nwrong for the president to have done this.\" May's office added: \"Britain First seeks to divide communities through \ntheir use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people.\"\n\nEven the Dutch government entered the fray as one video posted by Franzen and retweeted by Trump depicted \n was titled \"Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\"  The embassy of the Netherlands reacted via Twitter \nwith the following tweet: \"@realDonaldTrump Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was \nborn and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.\"\n\nBrexit: United Kingdom and European Union forge framework for \"long divorce\"\n\nWith Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations went into effect in 2017 to set the conditions for the \nUnited Kingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union.\n\nGoing back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from \nthe European Union, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. \nWith his political capital expended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under \nwhose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government.\n\nCameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative \nparty's conference.  In a national address, he said, \"I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of \nBritish people must be respected.\"\n\nHe continued,  \"The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt \nabout the result.\"  He urged new leadership, saying, \"I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This \nwill require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.\"\n\nBy  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen \nElizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that \npost since Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn September 2016, Cameron further announced that he would be resigning from his position as an elected \nMember of Parliament. Cameron said that he would step down from his role as the elected representative of his \n\n\n\nOxfordshire constituency, and allow someone else to take on that role.  He explained that his presence as a  \"back \nbencher\" in parliament was something of a distraction.  A by-election would be called to fill his seat.\n\nIn October 2016, the new prime minister, Theresa May, announced that her country would trigger Article 50 of the \nLisbon Treaty and begin the formal process of her country withdrawing from the European Union. May also \nforeclosed the notion of an early general election, noting that such a course would only augur instability in the UK. \n Instead, ay said that she would advance the repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which took the United \nKingdom into the European Common Market, now knowns as the European Union.  She said in an interview with \nthe media, \"We will introduce, in the next Queen's speech, a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European \nCommunities Act from the statute book.\"  The act would become effective upon the formal exit of the UK from the \nEuropean Union.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May formally began the process known colloquially as \n\"Brexit' of withdrawing the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom.  \n\nIn keeping with Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May notified European Union \nCouncil President Donald Tusk via a hand-delivered letter that her country would exit the European bloc after \ndecades of participation dating back to 1973.  \n\nIn a speech to parliament, she declared, \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.\" She added, \"This is \nan historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\"  \n\nA difficult process lasting up to two years was in the offing whereby the United Kingdom would seek to negotiate the \nterms of its exit from the European Union. Those negotiations would largely center on the United Kingdom's \nrelations with the European Union with regard to trade and security.\n\nWith Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations went into effect in 2017 to set the conditions for the \nUnited Kingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union.  \n\nBy December 2017,  the two sides had reached some concurrence on a framework that would ensure an orderly \nexit by the United Kingdom from the European bloc.  The framework also outline the terms of future trade ties.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister May hailed the achievement, saying, \"I very much welcome the prospect of moving \nahead.\"  The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, declared: \"I believe we have now made the \nbreakthrough we needed.\"\n\nA continuing wrinkle would be the matter of disconnecting the British mainland from European Union regulations \nwhile maintaining those rules for Northern Ireland.  But for European negotiators, that was a problem for the United \nKingdom to sort out.  \n\nThe Brexit transition would commence on March 29, 2019, when the United Kingdom would leave the European \nUnion, but would ensue over a phased basis of two years.  This process was thus dubbed \"the long divorce.\"\n\nPrime Minister May retaliates after nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spies in UK\n\nMarch 2018 was marked by international spy intrigue worthy of a motion picture movie.  At issue were the alleged \nassassination attempt by Russia on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy living in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and \nhis daughter, Yulia Skripal.\n\n\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May publicly accused Russia of being behind the attempted assassination, casting it \nas \"an unlawful use of force\" by the Russian state against the United Kingdom, and warning of consequences to \nfollow if Russia did not answer for its actions by a specified deadline on March 13, 2018.  She declared: \"We will not \ntolerate such brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia dismissed the charges and indicated that it would not be adhering to any such deadline to \nfurnish an explanation.  Moreover, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov  asserted that Moscow was \"not to \nblame\" and asked for information about the nerve agent believed to have caused the poisoning of Skripal and his \ndaughter. \n\nIt should be noted that the particular nerve agent used against Skripal and his daughter was linked with a \nconstellation of chemical weapons identified as Novichok, which was developed by the former Soviet Union in the \n1970s.  It should also be noted that the Skirpal case was not the first time poisoning of former Russian agents on \nBritish soil had ensued.  In 2006, the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned using \nradioactive tea. A British inquiry into the case found that Litvinenko's death was very likely orchestrated by the \nRussian state.\n\nDays after Prime Minister May's deadline elapsed, the British head of government announced the expulsion of 23 \nRussian diplomats from the United Kingdom.  There would also be a cessation of high level bilateral meetings with \nthe Russians, as well as a boycott of the World Cup to be held in Russia later in 2018.  \n\nExplaining her decision before parliament, May said, \"It is not in our national interest to break off all dialogue \nbetween the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. But in the aftermath of this appalling act against our \ncountry, this relationship cannot be the same.\"\n\nThe move was the initial gesture of reprisal by the government of the United Kingdom to the poisoning spy fiasco, \nwhich was quickly being understood as a quasi-act of state-sponsored terrorism. \n\nBut Russia remained undeterred, with the Foreign Ministry issuing a statement that read: \"The British government \nhas opted for confrontation with Russia. To be sure, our response will not be long in coming.\"\n\nNote that Skripal and his daughter remained hospitalized and in critical condition at the time of writing.  Also note \nthat as Prime Minister May was speaking about the Skirpal case,  UK authorities were opening a new  investigation \n-- this time into the mysterious death of Nikolai Glushkov, an associate of the deceased oligarch Boris Berezovsky, \nwho was regarded as quite a rival of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nCabinet shakeup amidst Windrush scandal\n\nIn late April 2018, Amber Rudd, the British Home Secretary, resigned from office  amidst what had come to be \nknown as the  Windrush scandal.\n\nAt issue was a plan to deport illegal\n\nimmigrants, and the ensuing discovery that some immigrants from Commonwealth countries who had settled in the \nUnited Kingdom  over the course of decades from the late 1940s to the 1970s were  declared to be illegal \nimmigrants.  Those immigrants were known as the \"Windrush generation\" and the plan that would see them ejected \nfrom the only home many of them had ever known evoked outrage.\n\nRudd claimed that she was unaware of the existence of the Home Office targets to remove illegal immigrants. \n Rudd then said that she \"inadvertently misled\" members of parliament over those targets.  However, the Guardian \n\n\n\nnewspaper published a letter showing that Rudd had, in fact, established an \"ambitious but deliverable\" goal of \ndeporting 10 percent more illegal immigrants over the  course of the \"next few years.\"\n\nThe full letter brought the scandal to a head and made Rudd's continued tenure impossible without considerable \npolitical damage, so she resigned.\n\nWith Rudd gone, pressure from the opposition would now refocus of United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May, \nwhom they have long viewed as the \"architect\" of the scandal.  The Labour Party particularly has emphasized the \nfact that the crisis was the fault of May and that conservative government would now have to find a way to quickly \ngrant citizenship to the Windrush generation, ensuring they not be subject to deportation.\n\nFacing defeat in parliament, U.K. PM May delays Brexit vote\n\nWith Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations have been in effect to set the conditions for the United \nKingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union.\n\nGoing back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from \nthe European Union, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. \nWith his political capital expended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under \nwhose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government.\n\nCameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative \nparty's conference.

But the Brexit strategy was in crisis \nfollowing an address to parliament by Prime Minister May about the plan to exit the European Union.\n\nAt the center of the Chequers proposal was a strategy that would allow the U.K. to depart the European bloc while \nadhering to the Brexit commitments on borders, finances, and jurisprudence, but at the same time, retain a stable \neconomy with as little turbulence as possible.

Among them was Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.\n\nWhile the details of their objections were not fully aired, the belief was that the continuing influence by the European \nUnion in areas like taxes, jurisprudence, and migration were regarded as dealbreakers of sorts.  Indeed, Johnson \nsoon released a letter detailing his objections, in which he explained that May's exit strategy would cause the \nUnited Kingdom to become a colony to the European Union. Of particular concern to Johnson were continued close \ntrading ties between the two sides.\n\nThe general consensus was that either the prime minister would have to abandon her Brexit plan, or Conservative \nmembers of parliament would abandon her.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn cast the resignations of the cabinet ministers as escapees  abandoning a \"sinking \nship,\" and declared: \"The Chequers compromise took two years to reach and two days to unravel. We have a crisis \nin government... it is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain.\"\n\nBy the end of August 2018, Prime Minister May was holding fast to her Chequers Brexit plan, which would enable a \nsoft exit from the EU bloc, but without additional compromise to the EU, which was sure to enrage hardline \neurosceptic factions at home.\n\n\n\nIn an opinion editorial in the Sunday Telegraph, the prime minister made clear that she would \"not be pushed\" into \ncompromises on her Brexit proposal that were not in the \"national interest.\"  At the same time, she said she would \nnot give into a call for a second \"re-run\" referendum on Brexit.  She indicated that such a move would be  a \"gross \nbetrayal of our democracy and trust\".\n\nIn her piece, May stated, \"We want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one.\"\n\nAs before, May was faced with objections from those within her own Tory ranks. Nick Boles - a former minister  and \nConservative who was part of the \"Remain\" faction that eschewed Brexit -  said that he could no longer the \nChequers exit strategy.  He warned that the U.K was facing \"the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels.\"  Boles, \ninstead, advocated for the U.K to become part of the European Economic Area for three years -- a time horizon \nlengthier and more flexible than the two-year exit schedule being advanced by may.  His view was that more time \nwas needed to negotiate a solid trade deal with the EU.\n\nIn late October 2018, the United Kingdom was bracing for mass protests as demonstratros demanded a new Brexit \nvote.\n\nBy November 2018, even as Prime Minister May was championing the Chequers Brexit plan, there was significant \nskepticism that it would have support in parliament.  In fact, more than one cabinet minister was expressing doubts \nabout it, with some warning that Prime Minister May's continued pursuit of the Chequers plan as a  \"self-harming\" \nmove by the head of government.\n\nWriting a column in the Daily Telegraph, Boris Johnson characterized the prime minister's plan as \"a recipe for \ncontinued strife, both in the Tory Party and the country.\" Former cabinet minister John Whittingdale warned that \nMay's viability as prime minister would be in doubt if parliament  failed to endorse her plan.  In an interview with \nBBC Radio, he said, \"I think if the PM's Brexit plan doesn't get through parliament, I think it's quite difficult to see \nhow the prime minister can continue because she has staked her credibility.\"\n\nFor her part, though, Prime Minister May appeared dogged in her pursuit of finalizing a Brexit plan prior to an \nimpending summit, expected to be held in Brussels, Belgium later in November 2018.  From the point of view of the \nprime minister, the deal \"delivers what people voted for.\"\n\nBy Nov. 14, 2018, Prime Minister May won the backing of senior cabinet ministers for a draft deal to exit the \nEuropean Union. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, May said, \"The collective \ndecision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political \ndeclaration.\" She added, \"I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement is the best that could be negotiated.\"\n\nThat hurdle cleared the way for the prime minister to try to procure approval from parliament.\n\nTo that end, Prime Minister May would need approximately 320  votes of 650-seat parliament where she \ncommands a minority government supported by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  But May's \nagreement included a provision that would prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of \nIreland.

Their opposition was largely focused on the proposal for Northern Ireland to \nhave a customs arrangement with the European Union, if the two sides could not come to an agreement that would \nprevent the establishment of a visible Northern Ireland border.  The prospect of  new regulatory barriers between \nNorthern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, as well as the continued influence of the European Union were \nconsidered objectionable.\n\nRegardless, with the failure of the Brexit deal vote looming, Prime Minister May canceled the vote in parliament \nscheduled for Dec. 11, 2018. But as before, May continued to champion the deal saying, \"It is the right deal for \nBritain.

But it was difficult to see if that effort would be successful since European \nCouncil President Donald Tusk made clear that the other EU countries would not \"renegotiate the deal.\"\n\nAt home, Prime Minister May's decision raised the ire of key opposition leaders.  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the \nLabour Party, said  May had \"lost control of events\" and urged her to stand down.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Vince Cable was even more excoriating, as he asserted, \"With the fiasco today, the \ngovernment has really lost all authority.

May was \nexiting from leadership with the core goals of her government unfulfilled -- to lead the United Kingdom out of the EU \nand unify the country.  All attention would now be on the leadership contest within the Conservative Party.\n\nThat new prime minister would be tasked with doing what May failed to do -- deliver the country out of the EU. The \nquestion was whether the U.K. would leave with a deal or in a \"no deal\" hard landing scenario by the newest \ndeadline of Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nBackground\n\nWith Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations have been in effect to set the conditions for the United \nKingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union.\n\nGoing back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from \nthe European Union, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. \nWith his political capital expended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under \nwhose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government.\n\nCameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative \nparty's conference.  In a national address, he said, \"I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of \nBritish people must be respected.\"\n\nHe continued,  \"The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt \nabout the result.\"  He urged new leadership, saying, \"I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This \nwill require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.\"\n\nBy  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen \nElizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that \npost since Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn September 2016, Cameron further announced that he would be resigning from his position as an elected \nMember of Parliament. Cameron said that he would step down from his role as the elected representative of his \nOxfordshire constituency, and allow someone else to take on that role.  He explained that his presence as a  \"back \nbencher\" in parliament was something of a distraction.  A by-election would be called to fill his seat.\n\nIn October 2016, the new prime minister, Theresa May, announced that her country would trigger Article 50 of the \nLisbon Treaty and begin the formal process of her country withdrawing from the European Union. May also \nforeclosed the notion of an early general election, noting that such a course would only augur instability in the UK. \n Instead, ay said that she would advance the repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which took the United \nKingdom into the European Common Market, now knowns as the European Union.  She said in an interview with \nthe media, \"We will introduce, in the next Queen's speech, a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European \nCommunities Act from the statute book.\"  The act would become effective upon the formal exit of the UK from the \nEuropean Union.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May formally began the process known colloquially as \n\"Brexit' of withdrawing the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn keeping with Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May notified European Union \nCouncil President Donald Tusk via a hand-delivered letter that her country would exit the European bloc after \ndecades of participation dating back to 1973.\n\n\n\nIn a speech to parliament, she declared, \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.\" She added, \"This is \nan historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\"\n\nA difficult process lasting up to two years was in the offing whereby the United Kingdom would seek to negotiate the \nterms of its exit from the European Union.

Instead, a Labour Party spokesperson said: \"We will put down \na motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful.\"\n\nWith headwinds against her, Prime Minister May was subject to a leadership challenge from within her own \nConservative Party.  Her apparent failures on Brexit led to hardline Tories wanting to see her removed as party \nleader, and thus, as prime minister.\n\n\n\nMay, however, survived that challenge, winning the support of 200 Tories in the party's 317-seat conference within \nparliament; 117 voted against her.  There was to be no new leadership challenge for another year, and as such, \npending a confidence vote in the full parliament, May was set to remain in place as the United Kingdom's head of \ngovernment for the immediate future.\n\nEmpowered by this show of support, she declared, \"We now have to get on with the job of delivering Brexit for the \nBritish people and building a better future for this country.\"\n\nMay, nonetheless, emphasized that she intended to step down as prime minister prior to the next general election \nset for 2022.  It was unclear if she could command a majority in parliament until that time.  Indeed, a tough test for \nher would be the March 29, 2019 deadline by which she would require parliamentary ratification for a draft Brexit \ndeal, with the actual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union scheduled for March 29, 2019.  To exit \nthe EU without a clear agreement in place would risk severe disruption to the country.\n\nPM May's Brexit deal crumbles leaving fears of a \"no deal\" hard landing for the U.K.\n\nPrime Minister May's Brexit deal came to a head in mid-January 2019 as it faced ratification in parliament.  The \nprime minister's Brexit strategy went down to crushing defeat with  432 members of parliament voting against her \ndeal and only 202 members of parliament voting for it.\n\nIn fact, more than 100 of Conservatives (Tories) from her own part joined with the opposition to kill the deal.  As \nsuch, they outperformed the record set in 1924 when a 166-vote defeat margin was set.  In this way, the Brexit deal \nvote was the worst political defeat  in modern British  history.\n\nAddressing parliament after the vote, May declared, \"It is clear that the House does not support this deal, but \ntonight's vote tells us nothing about what it does support.\"  She added that there was little indication if parliament \nwished \"to honor the decision the British people took in a referendum parliament decided to hold.\"\n\nMay appeared to carry some notion that aspects of her Brexit deal could still form the basis of an accord with the \nEuropean Union.  But many within her own party, including Boris Johnson, emphatically disagreed, saying in no \nuncertain terms: \"This deal is dead.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was action on the domestic political field. With an eye targeting a clearly weakened prime \nminister, opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn  called a vote of no confidence in May's government.  But \neven after the humiliating defeat of her Brexit deal, all expectations were that May would manage to cobble together \nsufficient votes to stave off the detractors hungry to bring down her government.  Indeed, to that end, May survived \nthe no-confidence motion and was able to hold on as the head of government although the extent of her political \npower was expected to be limited.\n\nMay's call for working with opposition parties to craft a new agreement with Brussels was likewise being dismissed. \n Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said, \n\n\"After two years of failed negotiations, the House of Commons has delivered its verdict on her Brexit deal, and that \nverdict is absolutely decisive. Her governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line.\"\n\nGiven its failure to bring down May's government, the opposition Labour Party signaled that its next move would be \nto shift to lobbying for a new referendum.\n\nWith no clear sense of the path forward, the Brexit vote result raised anxieties about a tumultuous \"no deal\" exit \nfrom the European Union. A \"no deal\" exit would mean a hard landing and was certain to cause turmoil not only in \nthe United Kingdom but quite possibly cause catastrophic  shocks across the global marketplace.\n\nU.K. PM May's wins mandate to return to Brexit negotiations but EU stands firm\n\nWith a deadline looming on March 29, 2019, for the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, there was little \nhope that a replacement agreement could easily be forged.  According to a spokesperson for the Labour Party, it \nwas more likely that the United Kingdom would have to request that the European Union delay the departure date \n\n\n\nrequired under the Article 50 withdrawal notice.  To that end, there were indications that Labour would back such a \nmove.\n\nMeanwhile, there was an effort afoot to try to find some concurrence on a new vision forward, that would yet include \na turbulence-free end to the Brexit drama. Michael Barnier, the European Union chief negotiator issued the \nfollowing warning: \"There appears to be a majority in the Commons to oppose a no-deal but opposing a no-deal will \nnot stop a no-deal from happening at the end of March. To stop 'no deal', a positive majority for another solution will \nneed to emerge.\"\n\nPrime Minister May's effort to find a soft landing was on life support as the House of Commons handed her a \nmandate to return to Brussels and try to renegotiate a Brexit accommodation that would satisfy her critics at home. \nSpecifically, members of parliament voted in late January 2019 to send May back Brussels to secure the removal of \nthe  Irish border \"backstop\" clause and replace it with \"alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border.\"\n\nAt issue here was the European Union's interest in preserving the Irish peace process, but which would also entail \nthe maintenance of European bloc trade rules in order to continue to free flow of commerce across the Irish border. \n While this element might make good commercial sense, it was considered objectionable by nationalists and other \npro-Brexit factions in the U.K.\n\nPrime Minister May indicated that she would demand a change to the Irish border backstop clause.  But May's \ninterest in negotiating a new deal with the European Union was clearly  messaging  aimed at her domestic \naudience and  not balanced by reality in Europe.\n\nPhilippe Lamberts, a member of the European Parliament's six-member Brexit steering group, disparaged the \nU.K.'s stance on the backstop issue saying, \"Saying you're against the backstop is like saying you're against bad \nweather. You might not like it, but you can't change it.\"\n\nAt the broader level, the European Union was signaling that there would be no further renegotiation.  As well, the \nEuropean Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker made clear that the vote in the United Kingdom's \nparliament served only to set the path for a \"disorderly withdrawal.\" Juncker added that preparations should be \nmade for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney characterized the U.K. landscape as  \"an extraordinary situation when a \nprime minister and a government negotiates a deal and then goes back and during the ratification process votes \nagainst their own deal.\"  In an interview with RTE, he offered this scathing commentary: \"That's like saying in a \nnegotiation, 'Well either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out of the window.'\"\n\nDonald Tusk, the chairman of European Union leaders, suggested the United Kingdom should reverse Brexit \naltogether. Via Twitter, he said, \"If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the \ncourage to say what the only positive solution is?\" Tusk later removed all doubt from the EU's position saying via \nTwitter, \"My message to PM @theresa_may: The EU position is clear and consistent. The Withdrawal Agreement is \nnot open for renegotiation.\"\n\nU.K. PM May tries to buy time; Labour pushes back\n\nIn the aftermath of a meeting on Feb. 8, 2019, between United Kingdom (U.K.) Prime Minister Theresa May and \nEuropean Union (EU) officials regarding an orderly exit from the European Union, there was no immediate \nbreakthrough forged.\n\nEU Council President Donald  Tusk said via Twitter,  \"Still no breakthrough in sight. Talks will continue.\"  Prime \nMinister May appeared to bristle from this assessment but sources inside Tusk's circle said that he simply \nresponded by noting,  that the \"truth hurts.\"\n\nWith the EU standing firm against changes to the Brexit schedule and plan, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was \nstill promising that she would negotiate a deal to please opponents of the controversial Northern Irish backstop by \nlimiting its applicability. To be clear -- these opponents in parliament have rejected May's plan, believing that it \n\n\n\nwould indefinitely link the U.K. to EU rules and thus limit the U.K.'s sovereignty.  Others including unionists have \nbeen concerned that  Northern Ireland would exist under a different system to the rest of the country.\n\nFor her part, with time running out on an orderly path forward, the only concrete promises Prime Minister May could \noffer were a series of non-binding votes in parliament through the end of February 2019 on possible Brexit \nalternatives.\n\nThe Labour Party was accusing May and the Tories of running out the clock and setting the country on a course \ntowards a \"no deal\" exit.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said Prime Minister May was \"pretending to make progress\" on \nthe Irish backstop issue while her true intention was to wait until the last possible moment -- after the European \nCouncil summit in May 2019 and just before the scheduled Brexit in late March 2019 -- thus forcing members of \nparliament into a \"binary choice\" between May's deal or no deal. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Starmer \nsaid, \"We can't allow that to happen.\"  As such, Labour was pushing for a final \"meaningful\" vote on whether to \napprove or reject the Brexit by the end of February 2019.\n\nLabour was joined by the Liberal Democrats in opposing such a course with that party's leader, Sir Vince Cable, \nsaying that a delayed  final vote on the Brexit deal was \"worse than irresponsible.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Labour was also advancing its own Brexit plan, which provides for the U.K. to remain in a \ncustoms union with the EU.  That plan, Labour has argued, would likely get support from a majority in parliament.\n\nFollowing negotiations with the May on Feb. 8, 2019, EU officials were urging the prime minister to take advantage \nof the moves being made by the Labour opposition to end the  impasse over the terms of the U.K.'s EU exit.  The \nEU officials were signaling clearly that Labour's proposals for a permanent EU-U.K. customs union could be a way \nto end the deadlock on the Irish border \"backstop\" controversy.\n\nLast chance for a Brexit deal\n\nIn the last week of February 2019, with only five weeks left before the U.K. was set to leave the EU, Prime Minister \nMay was facing a revolt within her own party if she failed to delay the country's exit from the European bloc. \n Conservative members of parliament who had given May repeated chances to try to find a resolution to the Brexit \nconundrum had lost patience.\n\nHaving voted repeatedly to support May in negotiating a Brexit solution with no results delivered, and with May \nthreatening a \"no deal\" exit, the prime minister had lost the trust of her party. Indeed, three members of her cabinet \nresigned in protest.  Although May's threat of a \"no deal\" exit was largely understood as a negotiating tactic - it was \nbeing used against her own parliament, with ramification for the British people whose livelihoods were now being \nused as pawns.  As such, without a promise of a Brexit delay, or, a viable option on the table on Feb. 27, 2019, May \n was in danger of losing a vote on that day.  That vote was intended to give her more negotiating space but it \nseemed that she had exhausted the patience of many within her own party.\n\nBut as before, May weathered the storm and won support in parliament for a plan that would give members of \nparliament the opportunity to vote to stop a \"no deal\" Brexit and extend the deadline to withdraw from the EU, \nshould an agreement not be reached.\n\nThe shift from the prime minister came due to pressure from her own party as cabinet ministers led by Pensions \nSecretary Amber Rudd warned that if the prime minister did not foreclose a \"no deal\" departure, they would vote \nagainst her \u2014 essentially voting in favor of a plan to remove Brexit policy from her quarters.  It was a radical move \naimed at making clear to the prime minister that they would effectively \"defang\" her  and curtail her powers as the \nhead of government.\n\n\n\nTo be clear:  It seemed increasingly possible that a \"no-deal\" Brexit could be avoided, with more time being given to \nforge a possible \"soft landing\" to ease the transition.  Action could be taken in attempting to extend  Article 50, thus \ndelaying the exit from the EU and allowing for more time to reach an agreement.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, Prime Minister May had forged an agreement to revise the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from \nthe EU. Central to the deal were three documents intended to legally ensure that the U.K. would not be beholden to \nthe backstop arrangement (and subject to EU customs protocols) on an indefinite basis.  Among these documents \nwas a unilateral declaration on untangling the U.K. from the backstop.\n\nThe deal was struck after Prime Minister May met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for \njust over two hours; the two leaders emerged after and at a joint press conference to announce the plan. Juncker \nsaid, \"Let's bring the U.K.'s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.\" He added, \"The choice is clear: it is \nthis deal, or Brexit may not happen at all.\"\n\nMay addressed her country, and specifically the U.K. parliament, as she declared, \"Now is the time to come \ntogether, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.\"\n\nIt was not clear that the terms of the new deal would be sufficient to gain majority support in parliament where her \nown Conservative Party remained terribly divided on the issue. The blueprint was expected to face scrutiny from \n skeptical members of parliament, along with a formal legal assessment, ahead of a vote scheduled for March 12, \n2019.  Should parliament reject the deal in a vote on March 12, 2019, then there would be a second  vote in the \nHouse of Commons to ratify a \"no deal\" exit from the EU.  If that path was rejected by members of parliament, then \nthere would be a third vote \u2014 this time to ratify a delay in the U.K.'s exit from the EU.\n\nIn mid-March 2019, the parliament of the U.K. held a series of key votes on Brexit.  Among the most significant was \nanother humiliating defeat for President May's proposed compromise Brexit deal, which she lost by 149 votes. \n Subsequently, the U.K. parliament voted against a no deal withdrawal from the EU with a final vote of 321-278.\n\nWith those votes out of the way, parliament took another vote -- this time on the issue of asking the EU for a delay \non Article 50, which was passed favorably. The verdict based on these vote results was that the U.K. was in favor of \nan exit from the EU with some kind of deal in place -- just not the one crafted by the prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, although there was concurrence on requesting an extension on the Brexit deadline, the move would still \nhave to be approved by all 27 EU member states and could not be a foundation for further negotiations with the EU.\n\nFor her part, May was taking a tactical approach in her delay strategy to force another vote on her Brexit deal. \n Specifically, she was requesting a short extension until June 30, 2019 -- but only if parliament passed her Brexit \nproposal by March 20, 2019 -- nine days ahead of the  official exit deadline.\n\nBefore parliament, the prime minister declared, \"If you don't like my deal, and you don't want to leave without a \ndeal, then Parliament \"needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken.\"\n\nPrime Minister May's plan to force another vote within parliament on her Brexit deal was thwarted in the third week \nof March 2019 due to an intervention from the speaker of parliament. At issue was Speaker John Bercow's ruling \nthat  May's deal had to be \"substantially different \" to be voted on again by parliament.  Bercow noted that the \ngovernment still had the option to recraft its proposal.  It was also possible that the parliament could vote to overrule \nhim.  Nevertheless, Prime Minister May's next move was to ask the EU to delay Brexit by at least three months.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, noted that an extension would be useful if it helped May's deal to be \nratified by the House of Commons.  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that a detailed plan would have \nto be offered on how May intended to get her deal approved by parliament before she could secure the EU's \n approval for an extension. The office for French President Emmanuel Macron was more forceful and warned \nFrance would veto any request for a Brexit delay if there was no feasible exit strategy presented out of the existing \n\n\n\nconundrum.  President Macron himself said, \"It is up to the British to sort out their own internal contradictions. As for \nus, we don't have any.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that time was of the essence, saying: \"I will fight until the last minute of \nthe time to March 29 for an orderly exit. We haven't got a lot of time for that.\"\n\nFollowing negotiations with European counterparts in Brussels, an agreement was forged to give Prime Minister \nMay a two-week reprieve - until April 12, 2019 \u2014 upon which the United Kingdom's would exit the EU.  It would be \nup to May to persuade members of parliament to support the withdrawal arrangement she forged with the European \nbloc.  According to reports, Prime Minister May had sought a longer extension \u2014 until June 30, 2019 \u2014 while some \nEuropean leaders had their eye on a May 22, 2019, date (the eve of EU parliamentary elections).  But May's failure \nto convince them that she could actually win a vote in parliament, along with pressure from French President \nMacron that the United Kingdom exit the union with or without a deal by May 7, 2019, resulted in the decision to \noffer a two-week reprieve.\n\nThe result was May would have until April 12, 2019, to either get her country behind a new withdrawal agreement \nor take the \"no deal\" plunge.  If she was able to secure parliamentary support, then the United Kingdom would \nleave the EU on May 22, 2019, in an orderly manner, with an agreement forged with the European bloc. Without an \nexit on that day, then the United Kingdom would be compelled to participate in European parliament elections.  The \nfinal exit date under those conditions would be June 30, 2019 \u2014 ahead of the convening of the new EU parliament. \n,\n\nIn late March 2019, Prime Minister May told members of parliament from her own Conservative Party that she \nwould resign as leader, pending parliament's approval of her Brexit deal, which would usher the United Kingdom \nout of the EU while facilitating discussions on a future trade agreement.  May appeared to be trying to coax \nConservatives to back her deal in exchange for her resignation. The move failed, however, as on March 29, 2019 - \nthe day the United Kingdom was scheduled to leave the EU, members of parliament rejected May's plan 344 votes \nto 286.  It was a humiliating defeat for May who had offered up her own resignation and was presented instead by \nanother defeat in parliament over her Brexit plan.\n\nPolitical implications over May's impotence aside, the move meant that the country was no longer in a position to \ndelay Brexit until May 22, 2019, and leave with an agreement in hand.  The loss for the prime minister emboldened \nLabour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who said \"this deal now has to change\" or the prime minister would have to step \ndown. For her, part, Prime Minister May said,  \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House\".She \nalso added that the country would have to find \"an alternative way forward.\"  It was not clear what that path would \ninvolve although May would have until April 12, 2019, to try to secure a longer delay from the EU.\n\nRecognizing the gravity of the situation, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted: \"In view of the rejection \nof the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April.\"\n\nIn the meantime, May would have to deal with the fact that she would not be helped by the Democratic Unionist \nParty, which was increasingly concerned about the Irish backstop, which could create a de facto split between \nNorthern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.  Nigel Dodds of the DUP said in an interview with BBC News, \n \"I would stay in the European Union and remain, rather than risk Northern Ireland's position. That's how strongly I \nfeel about the Union.\"\n\nThe Brexit Path Forward\n\nAt the start of April 2019, the reality was that the United Kingdom was at high risk of a \"no deal\" exit from the EU - a \nscenario guaranteed to carry with it no shortage of tumult and turmoil. Members of the Conservative party appeared \nto be moving towards this conclusion, regardless of the likely damage.  But this was not the feeling of everyone in \nparliament, although it was unclear if there was enough consensus in the body to force the British electorate to \n return to the voting booth. James Cleverly, the deputy chair of the Conservative Party, said that there was no plan \nfor a fresh election.  However, Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour Party,  indicated that his party was, in \n\n\n\nfact, getting prepared for an election.  Furthermore, Emily Thornberry, a spokesperson for the opposition party on \nmatters of foreign affairs, indicated that a vote of no confidence in May's government was in the offing.  She said, \n\"We don't know if she is going to remain prime minister, if we are going to get somebody else, who that other \nperson is going to be - it is a mess.\"\n\nElections aside, the prime minister was faced with the reality that she would have to do something to ensure that \nthe United Kingdom could exit the EU with a deal, as she noted that she had reached out to Labour with that goal \nin mind. Explaining her outreach to Labour, May said via a statement that after doing \"everything\" in her power\" to \npersuade her party and its Northern Ireland's DUP partners- to approve her deal, she had  been compelled \"to take \na new approach.\"  She said, \"We have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons.\" For some \nmembers of May's Conservative Party, Prime Minister May's outreach to Labour was viewed as undesirable.  The \nCommons Leader, Andrea Leadsom, went so far as to say that \"no deal\" would be preferable to canceling Brexit. \n Leadsom also condemned the notion of a fresh Brexit referendum, saying, \"It is appalling to consider another \nreferendum\"\n\nFor its part, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was reported to be taking a \"wait and see\" approach although he was \nunder pressure from his party not to agree to anything with the prime minister without the party's concurrence. \n Furthermore, shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, noted that if the country edged towards a \"no \ndeal\" exit, then Labour would have to consider \"very, very strongly\" voting to cancel Brexit.\n\nIn an interview with BBC News, Long-Bailey said that Labour would \"keep all options in play to keep no deal off the \ntable.\"  All options included a vote on revoking Article 50 - the legal provision authorizing the United Kingdom's exit \nfrom the EU. The reality was that the United Kingdom was now on track to leave the European Union on April 12, \n2019, and, without a deal in hand, Prime Minister May indicated that she would seek an extension from Brussels to \ndelay Brexit until the end of June 2019.  As before, there were differing views from various EU member states as to \nwhether this should be allowed.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, pre-empted May's request while also seeking to mitigate the \nconcerns of EU states by proposing a broad \"flextension\" until April 2020 for the United  Kingdom.  But such a move \nwould require that the United Kingdom participate in EU elections set to take place in May 2019.  The country's \nparticipation in that exercise has been considered to be highly unpalatable for pro-Brexit conservatives.\n\nLabor abandons Brexit talks and PM May's government edges towards collapse\n\nOn May 17, 2019,  the Labor Party of the United Kingdom (U.K) walked away from negotiations with the \ngovernment of Prime Minister Theresa May, which had been aimed at reaching a Brexit deal.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn informing Prime Minister May that the Brexit talks, which had been ongoing for more \nthan six weeks, had \"gone as far as they can\" given the intractability of her positions and the inherent instability of \nher government.  Corbyn wrote in a letter, \"We have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us.\" He \nadded, \"Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be \nconfidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.\"\n\nCorbyn made clear that the Labor Party would oppose May's deal in parliament.  At issue was an impending vote \non May's exit strategy, which was agreed upon with the European Union in 2018 but which was already rejected by \nBritish members of parliament three times.  But May was bringing the  Withdrawal Agreement Bill once again in \nearly June 2019 in the hopes that a fourth vote would end in approval.  It was difficult to see how that would \ntranspire with the opposition Labor Party making clear it would be voting against the deal. Indeed, in remarks to \nreporters, Corbyn  foreclosed the notion that any part of a Brexit deal could be ratified by the end of July.\n\nPrime Minister May was nonetheless planning to go forward with the June vote.  She said, \"When we come to bring \nthe legislation forward we will think carefully about ... the outcome of these talks, we will also consider whether we \nhave some votes to see if the ideas that have come through command a majority in the House of Commons.\"\n\n\n\nThe failure of the Brexit negotiations came after Prime Minister May set forth a timetable for her to step down from \nher post as head of government in June 2019.\n\nBoris Johnson, the most well-known pro-Brexit politician in the U.K. telegraphed that he would  be a candidate to \nreplace May as the new Conservative leader.  Polling data indicated that he very likely had the votes to achieve \nthat end.  As the leader of the Conservative Party, should he be successful, Johnson would then become the prime \nminister.  It would then be his responsibility to lead the U.K. through the Brexit process.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock was ticking with Oct. 31, 2019, being the new deadline for the U.K. to exit the European bloc.\n\nMay out as PM after failure to deliver Brexit setting the stage for a leadership contest\n\nOn May 24, 2019, United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May announced that she would resign as the leader of \nthe Conservative Party, effective  June 7, 2019.  May ended her national address declaring in choked tones and \ntears that serving as prime minister had been \"the honor of my life.\"\n\nMay would continue to serve as the head of government until a leadership contest could take place within the \nConservative Party.  Once a successor was selected, he/she would become the new prime minister of the country, \ngiven the fact that the Conservatives and their allies held a narrow majority in parliament.\n\nThe leadership contest within the Conservative Party would likely occur through July 2019 when Sir Vince Cable, \nthe leader of the Liberal Democrats, was himself slated to step down.  A new leader of that party would thus have \nto be selected.\n\nThe new Conservative leader and thus, the prime minister, would be charged with accomplishing what May failed to \ndo -- deliver the country out of the EU. The question was whether the U.K. would leave with a deal or in a \"no deal\" \nhard landing scenario by the newest deadline of Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nWith Jeremy Corbyn under some fire for Labour's handling of its cooperation with May over Brexit, there was also \nspeculation about his political future.  The poor performance of the Labour Party in European Union elections \nwould likely place additional pressure on Corbyn and quite possibly force the party to take a stronger line on Brexit, \nmaybe even with them standing squarely in the \"remain\" camp.\n\nIndeed, it was not accidental that the Liberal Democrats had seen some success in the EU elections as left-leaning \nvoters opted to rebuke Labour and go to the Liberal Democrats instead.\n\nOn June 7, 2019, as scheduled, Theresa May stepped down as prime minister of the United Kingdom. May was \nexiting from leadership with the core goals of her government unfulfilled -- to lead the United Kingdom out of the EU \nand unify the country.\n\nMay would continue to function as the head of government until a new leader could be selected.  As stated by her \nspokesperson, \"For the remainder of her time in office, she will be building on the domestic agenda that she has put \nat the heart of her premiership.\"\n\nMay's resignation set the stage for a leadership contest within the governing Conservative Party.  Nominations \nwere expected to commence on June 10, 2019, with the selection process completed by late July 2019.\n\nPossible successors likely to enter the leadership contest included Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former \nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson.  It should be noted that Johnson, who \nwas viewed as the \"favorite\" to win the leadership contest, was championing a hard \"no deal\" Brexit, if necessary. \nBy contrast, a surprise entrant to the contest was former U.K. Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah, who was \ncampaigning as the \"second referendum\" candidate. (Note:  Gyimah later decided to refrain from contesting the \nleadership election.)\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid, who was also running to be the new leader of the Conservatives, appeared to concur \nwith the view that a delay could very well be in the offing, although he didn't want one.  Javid, who was against a \n\n\n\nsecond referendum, a fresh general election, or revoking Article 50, supported May's negotiated EU exit, along with \na technological solution to the Irish border issue.  To this end, he said in an interview with the BBC: \"What I would \ndo is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs -- the upfront costs, the running costs -- of \na new digitized border.\"\n\nOther candidates included Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, and \nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove.  Hancock's Brexit plan contained the assumption that \"no deal\" was \nunrealistic and a solution to the Irish border problem would have to be found. Leadsom's proposal, though, roughly \ncovered a \"managed exit\" by the existing Oct. 31, 2019 deadline.  Gove was warning that people should be \nprepared for a Brexit delay until 2020.\n\nIn a first round of the leadership contest on June 13, 2019, Boris Johnson secured the most  support from \nConservative members of parliament. Johnson won the support of 114 Tory lawmakers from a total of 313 votes.\n\nHis closest rivals were Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, who garnered 43 votes. Environment Minister Michael Gove \ntook 37 votes;  former Brexit minister Dominic Raab carried  27 votes; Home Secretary Sajid Javid secured 23 \nvotes. Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart  won 20 votes and 19 votes respectively. Three candidates, Andrea \nLeadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey, were knocked out of contention.\n\nVia Twitter, Johnson said, \"Thank you to my friends and colleagues in the Conservative & Unionist Party for your \nsupport. I am delighted to win the first ballot, but we have a long way to go.\"\n\nA second round of voting was set to be held on  June 18, 2019, with further ballots expected on  June 19, 2019, \nand June 20, 2019, leading to a final ballot of two candidates. Voting by mail would then ensue from among  the \nwider Conservative Party membership  to select the leader.  That new Conservative leader would become the new \nprime minister, quite likely before the end of July 2019.\n\nJohnson's main rival, Hunt,  warned  Conservatives against Johnson, saying that \"the stakes have rarely been \nhigher for our country.\" He also urged the following via Twitter: \"This serious moment calls for a serious leader.\"\n\nFor his part, Johnson continued to emphasize his pro-Brexit credentials, promising that the country would be out of \nthe European Union by Oct. 31, 2019, as scheduled.  He said that the U.K. had to be prepared to depart without a \ndeal, and that it was only in so doing that  a no-deal Brexit could actually be prevented.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on radio, Johnson said, \"All those who say that we should delay ... I think they risk \ndoing terminal damage to trust in politics. We have to get on and do this. We've got to be out by Oct. 31.\"  He \nadded, \"If we have to get out on what is called no-deal terms, or WTO (World Trade Organization) terms, then it is \nour absolute responsibility to prepare for it. And it's by preparing for it that we will prevent that outcome.\"\n\nOn the second ballot, Johnson won 40 percent of the votes and  126 out of 313 votes, taking him to a third ballot. \n The real battle was for second place finisher as the ultimate alternative to Johnson.  To that end, the likely \nprospects were  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, International Development \nSecretary Rory Stewart, and Home Secretary Sajid Javid.\n\nOn the ensuing ballots, the leadership contest was whittled down, eliminating the rest of the field, most notably with \nStewart, Javid, and then Gove removed from contention.  With each ballot, Johnson was increasing his share of \nsupport from other members of parliament, working his way up to 160 affirmative votes in his favor.\n\nUltimately, Boris Johnson and Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt emerged as the only two candidates left in the race \n after the fifth ballot to lead the Conservative Party and become the new prime minister.\n\nJohnson remained the favorite to win the Conservative leadership contest and become the new head of \ngovernment, although the decision would be made by the grassroots membership of the Conservative Party via \n postal ballot. The winner was set to be announced during the week of July 22, 2019.\n\nBoris Johnson becomes the new U.K. prime minister as fractures emerge within the opposition\n\n\n\nWith pro-Brexit United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson promising his country a divorce from the European \nUnion with or without a transition agreement, there were indications that opposition parties were ready to bring \ndown the government with a vote of no confidence. But those plans to topple the fledgling Johnson government \nwere marred by fractures within the opposition ranks. In short, there was no consensus over how that path would be \ntraversed, how that next government would be envisioned, and who would lead it.\n\nGoing back to July 23, 2019, the winner of the Conservative Party's leadership contest was announced with Boris \nJohnson, as expected, securing victory and thus becoming the new prime minister of the United Kingdom. Johnson \ngarnered the votes of 92,000 members of the Conservative Party -- close to twice the tally for Foreign Secretary \nHunt.  This victory meant that Queen Elizabeth II, the reigning monarch of the U.K., officially called on Johnson at \nBuckingham Palace to become the new head of government.  This would thus trigger the departure of Theresa May \nin that post.\n\nThe reality was that any new prime minister would have to confront the prevailing question of how to deal with the \nIrish border issue.  At issue here was the European Union's interest in preserving the Irish peace process, but \nwhich would also entail the maintenance of European bloc trade rules in order to continue to free flow of commerce \nacross the Irish border.  While this element might make good commercial sense, it was considered objectionable by \nnationalists and other pro-Brexit factions in the U.K.\n\nJohnson has, throughout, been very clear that his intent was for the U.K. to exit the EU by Oct. 31, 2019, with or \nwithout a deal. Meanwhile, there was very little likelihood that parliament in the U.K. would ratify a no-deal exit, \nraising questions as to how this would be accomplished in the first place. On the other side of the equation, the EU \nhas insisted that the withdrawal agreement already negotiated with  former Prime Minister Theresa May  could not \nbe re-negotiated.  Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel emphasized this aspect when he said props to the vote \nwithin the Conservative Party: \"If they choose Boris Johnson, he will have to deal with us on the agreement we \nhave done with Theresa May.\"\n\nBut following his intra-party victory, Johnson was steadfast on the  path forward as he declared, \"We are going to \nget Brexit done on Oct. 31, and we are going to take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring in a new spirit of \n'can do'.:  He added, \"Like some slumbering giant, we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and \nnegativity.\"\n\nIt was to be seen if newly-inaugurated Prime Minister Johnson's promise to deliver Brexit would ensue with a new \ndeal or without one -- and thus ensure a \"hard landing\" for the economy of the U.K.\n\nIn the first week of August 2019, the prospect of a \"no deal\" exit from the European Union increased when that \nbody made clear that there was no basis for \"meaningful discussions\" over changing the terms of Theresa May's \ndeal. Of particular significance was the fact there was no possibility of removing the Irish backstop.\n\nAt the heart of the Irish backstop issue was the provision preventing a hard border from being implemented \nbetween the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Keeping the backstop in place would mean that some \naspects of the European Union single market would remain in place.  In this way, the United Kingdom would \neffectively be subject to the European Union customs union. For some Brexit hardliners, such a prospect was \nregarded as unacceptable.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Johnson attempted to flex his new muscle as head of government, as he pressured \nthe European Union  to \"change its stance.\"  But the European Commission made clear that there was no reason to \nreturn to the negotiating table since  the agreement forged with Johnson's predecessor, May, was the \"best \npossible deal,\"  and changes to it would not be entertained.\n\nThe new prime minister was undaunted and continued to promise a \"divorce\" of sorts from the European Union by \nOct. 31, 2019, and without a transition plan to ease the anticipated economic shockwaves.\n\n\n\nWith the ominous \"no deal\" Brexit looming, there was the possibility that members of parliament in the United \nKingdom could bring down the Johnson government with a vote of no confidence.  To that end,  by August 2019, \nthe opposition parties were launching their plans to topple the fledgling government of pro-Brexit Prime Minister \n Boris Johnson.  While there was no shortage of will from rivals of Johnson to prevent him from fulfilling his \"do or \ndie\" vow and withdrawing the United Kingdom from the European Union, there was also no consensus on how that \nmight be accomplished.\n\nThe leftist leader of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, was calling of lawmakers across party lines to support a vote \nof no confidence in the Johnson government.  The Corbyn proposal would see him then lead a \"strictly time-limited \ntemporary government\" that would postpone Brexit and pave the way for fresh elections.  Corbyn articulated his \nintent, declaring, \"This government has no mandate for No Deal, and the 2016 EU referendum provided no \nmandate for No Deal.\" He continued, \"I therefore intend to table a vote of no confidence at the earliest opportunity \nwhen we can be confident of success.\"\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Johnson condemned Corbyn's call for a no confidence vote and an ensuing temporary \ngovernment.  A spokesperson for the prime minister's office said, \n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn believes that the people are the servants and politicians can cancel public votes they don't like.\"\n\nStill, Corbyn's temporary government idea found resonance among his own party and was also supported by some \nof Prime Minister Johnson's own Conservative Party who were wary of a hard \"no deal\" landing for the country.  In \nan interview with BBC News, Guto Bebb, a Conservative member of parliament, said, \"A short-term Jeremy Corbyn \ngovernment is less damaging than the generational damage that would be caused by a no-deal Brexit.\"\n\nAs well. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), indicated that her party and SNP \nmembers of parliament would entertain all options to prevent Brexit from going forward.  Accordingly, Sturgeon was \nnot foreclosing the notion of backing Corbyn.\n\nBut Corbyn would not be helped by the Liberal Democrats, despite that party's anti-Brexit orientation.  Jo Swinson, \nthe head of the Liberal Democrats, railed against the notion of Corbyn leading a temporary \"emergency\" \ngovernment.  Swinson said, \"We are facing a national crisis. We may need an emergency government to resolve it \nbut if Jeremy Corbyn truly wants that to succeed, surely even he can see, he cannot lead it.\"  Swinson was instead \nchampioning the idea for a veteran member of parliamentarian to lead a national unity government.  That concept, \nhowever, was not expected to be well received  by Corbyn.\n\nThe reality was that there would have to be some consensus among the opposition ranks to successfully defeat \nJohnson working majority in parliament of just one seat -- slim as it might be. The clear fractures within the anti-\nBrexit movement could, thus, make it very difficult for any of them to succeed against Johnson.  Nevertheless, \nshould there be success in bringing down the Johnson government via a successful no-confidence vote, there \nwould be a 14-day window to allow a party with a majority in parliament to form a new government.\n\nAll eyes would be on parliament when members of House of Commons returned to the legislative chamber on Sept. \n3, 2019 to take up the Brexit battle.\n\nEU offers no leeway as deadline looms\n\nMeanwhile, on the agenda was the G7 summit in France in late August 2019.  Ahead of the G7 summit, European \nCouncil head, Donald Tusk, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson were ensconced in a contretemps \nover who would be to blame for a \"no deal\" Brexit with both men saying the other would dubbed \"Mr. No Deal,\" if \nthe impasse prevailed.\n\nJohnson's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the \nsummit presaged little progress on the matter.  Indeed, the two most powerful European Union leaders emphasized \nthat the deal brokered with Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, was the end of the line and there would be little \nroom to alter it.  In fact, Macron declared in unambiguous terms: \"I want to be very clear. In the month ahead, we \nwill not find a new withdrawal agreement that deviates far from the original.\"\n\n\n\nEditor's Note on the United Kingdom:\n\nLocated in Western Europe, between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, just to the northwest of France, \nthe United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is to be found \non the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland.\n\nIt should be noted that the terms \"Great Britain\" and \"United Kingdom\" cannot correctly be used in an \ninterchangeable manner.\n\nGreat Britain refers to the island to the west of France and east of Ireland that consists of three related regions -- \nEngland, Scotland, and Wales.  However, Great Britain is not the proper name of any current sovereign nation \nstate, as it excludes Northern Ireland, which is also part of the country called  the United Kingdom.  In fact, the \nofficial name of the country is \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nScotland and England were joined in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded his cousin, Queen Elizabeth \nI, to claim the British throne. In 1707, the Act of Union created a new country, Great Britain. Ireland had been \nconquered by the early 17th century, and the 1801 British Acts of Union established the United Kingdom of Great \nBritain and Ireland. In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland gained independence from London, with the other six counties \nremaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in \n1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully \ncompleted in March 2010.\n\nIn 2013, a process was started to allow for a referendum for Scottish independence.  That vote was to take place in \n2014.  In order for Scotland to become independent, regardless of the result of the internal referendum, the British \nParliament would have to dissolve the Acts of Union.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the British Empire had been the foremost global power, stretching over one-\nfourth of the earth's surface. But World War I significantly weakened the United Kingdom, and the years following \nWorld War II saw the demise of the empire with many colonies gaining independence. Nevertheless, the country \nremains a major world economic and military power, with considerable political and cultural influence around the \nworld. As the world's first industrialized country, the economy of the United Kingdom is one of the largest in the \nworld as well as one of the strongest in Europe, and is considered to be a leading trading power and financial \ncenter.\n\nIt should also be noted that the United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary \ndemocracy and in advancing literature and science. The country has a long history as a major player in international \naffairs and fulfills an important role in the European Union, the United Nations and NATO. The United Kingdom is \nalso an active member of the European Union, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary \nUnion. The government has said a series of economic criteria must be met before the issue can be put to a \nreferendum.\n\n--  August 2019\n\nWritten by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman, Editor in Chief, www.countrywatch.com .\n\nhttp://www.countrywatch.com/\n\n\nGeneral research sources listed in Bibliography.
