Lawmakers in Washington were taking prompt legislative action to ensure that any \ndevastating attack such as those on Sept. 11 would be far more difficult to carry out, and Canada was preparing to \nback Washington's effort with its own improved immigration controls.\n\nSince good fences make good neighbors, we've been justifiably worried about the border with our friend and \nneighbor to the north. Because of our special relationship with Canada, the \"fence\" between us was almost \nnonexistent before Sept. 11. Unfortunately, Canada's lax refugee and immigration controls became our problem. \nThey allowed numerous suspected terrorists to arrive in Canada and disappear --- sometimes into the United \nStates.\nAJC\n\nCanada's cooperation is essential and welcome: It plans to spend $165 million on anti-terrorism measures, \nincluding $36 million on technology at airports and border crossings to check fingerprints and detect explosives.\n\nLawmakers at home, meanwhile, have been working intensely on an airport security bill and an anti-terrorism bill. \nAs with any effort out of Washington, some argue lawmakers have gone too far, while others say they aren't going \nfar enough. For the most part, though, we're pleased to see the concerted bipartisan effort to provide the Bush \nadministration with the reasonable security tools this nation needs.\n\nExplaining the Senate anti-terrorism legislation, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nparaphrased Benjamin Franklin: \"He said that a people who trade their liberty for security deserve neither.\"\n\nThe senator can relax; happily, the Senate's \"Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act,\" which would enhance \ninvestigative and surveillance powers for law enforcement, is indeed balanced. It doesn't trade liberty for \nsecurity.\n\nIt's a practical measure that acknowledges that law enforcement must keep pace with these high-tech times of \ncellphones and the Internet. It would provide opportunities to get legal authorization to track e-mail and conduct \nroving wiretaps and expand agency sharing of information on suspected terrorists. And it provides for fighting \nmoney laundering, which lawmakers say is an important part of terrorist fund-raising.\n\nThe House legislation essentially mirrors the Senate's, but would add a \"sunset\" provision on the surveillance \naspect that we're comfortable accepting. We hope that House and Senate legislators are able to come together on \nthe proposed five-year limit. President Bush's warnings of a lengthy war notwithstanding, the legislation most likely \nwould benefit from improvement or review in five years.\n\n\nAs expected on the aviation security legislation, Senate lawmakers approved some excellent measures that would \ntighten airport and airline security. They voted to place sky marshals on planes, and gave airlines the option to arm \ntheir pilots. We'd prefer, of course that pilots were focused wholly on flying the plane and left the job of \napprehending hijackers to sky marshals.\n\nBut while we're a little concerned about that aspect, we're deeply troubled about the move to make government \nworkers out of the people who screen passengers and baggage at the nation's 142 largest airports.\n\nWhat possible reason could lawmakers have for adding 20,000 people to the federal payroll? More importantly, \nwhat need is there to federalize screeners? All that is necessary --- as the Bush administration is urging --- is \ntougher federal oversight of private contractors, as is the case in Europe. Federalization has never guaranteed a \nbetter-performing worker.\n\nPresident Bush has said he's reluctant to delay an aviation bill over the screener controversy. If this dramatic \noverreaching remains in the bill when it emerges from both houses of Congress, we wish he would.\n"}
