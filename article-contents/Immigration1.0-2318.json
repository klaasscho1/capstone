{"title": "SWEDISH ROYALS MAKE ELLIS ISLAND VISIT", "body": "\nSweden's royal couple arrived Tuesday in New York to visit the place that has funneled immigrants from their \ncountry into U.S. timberlands and farm country for 150 years.\n\nThe trip by Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia will take them to New York's Ellis Island, where \nimmigrants arrived and were processed, and to Minnesota and Illinois where many Swedes settled.\n\nThe immigration that began in 1846 and lasted into the 1920s brought 1.2 million people to the United States, \nmostly for economic reasons. Some also initially fled the Lutheran state for religious reasons.\n\nToday, the king is scheduled to attend a business forum, meet with U.N. General-Secretary Boutros Boutros Ghali \nand attend a banquet before heading Thursday to Minnesota for more 150-year jubilee festivities.\n"}
