{"title": "METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY;Judge Orders Release Of 23 Immigrants", "body": "\nMore than three months after they scrambled onto an Ocean County beach on a foggy night, 23 illegal Chinese \nimmigrants were ordered released from Federal custody yesterday, pending further immigration proceedings.\n\nAll 23 had been granted bail by immigration judges considering their requests for political asylum, but were then \ndetained by Federal prosecutors as witnesses to an alien-smuggling operation.\n\nTwo men have admitted roles in the botched smuggling, and three others face trial in United States District Court on \nNov. 16.\n\nFour of the Chinese gave depositions to prosecutors and were released earlier this month.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Carolyn A. Murray asked United States Magistrate Joel A. Pisano to let the \nremaining 19 go, saying that prosecutors would not depose them. He agreed. The 19 were then turned over to the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service for processing and released on the bonds set by immigration judges.\n"}
