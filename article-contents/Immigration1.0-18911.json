I'm \nnot. It's a good idea. It's legitimate--but it could really screw them up!

Not a chance.\n\nBy the end of the piece it's very hard not to think of the Bush administration's equally confident predictions about \nrebuilding Iraq. ... See also: Sen. Cornyn on the jam-up at DHS. ...\n\nKf Dobbsian take: Wouldn't it make sense to get an employment verification scheme up and running (for new hires) \nbefore we trigger another wave of illegals** by proclaiming a sweeping semi-amnesty? Simon makes it pretty clear \nthat as the bill stands the worksite system won't be ready by the time that new wave of undocumented jobseekers \nhits. \n\nAs I think I've said before, I'm not worried about the 12 million already here. I'm worried about the next 12 million. \nAnd the next. ...\n\n**--Which message do you think will be heard louder in impoverished Latin America: \n\na) \"Amnesty!

From alert emailer D.R.: \n\nWhat if the Democratic leadership allowed a couple of pro-Amnesty Senators (since they had a comfortable margin \non the first vote and could afford it) to vote 'No' on the first cloture vote on the understanding that they would switch \nback for the second, all-important cloture vote.Then net result of this would be to convince anti-amnesty forces that \nwe have a five vote deficit to make up when, in fact, we may need seven and misalign our efforts. ... \n\nRight. Maybe some of the \"no\" votes on today's first cloture motion were Kabuki too. That would apply to GOPs as \nwell as Dems--Askew speculates that Cochran was given permission by the leadership to avoid obloquy by voting \n\"no\" (perhaps on the condition that he'll vote \"yes\" next time if he's really needed). The upshot is that five switched \nvotes might not be enough.

Getting seven or eight to switch--if, say, Bayh or Hatch or Cochran were phony \"nos\" and switch back--\nwould be much tougher. ... 4:35 P.M. link\n\nKabuki  Kabuki The Senate has voted 64-35 to take up the immigration bill. There is a second, now-crucial, \ncloture vote to cut off debate later this week. Emailer J.S. makes a good point:\n\nI think the first cloture vote is now itself possibly becoming a sort of kabuki for some senators, like Burr and Bond, \nas they will vote to proceed today to impress the leadership and the Grand Bargainers, in hopes of keeping their \nrelationships decent with them for future favors.  These guys can afford, they calculate, to vote for cloture today, \nknowing they can still filibuster it on the second cloture vote.  (I think the message has been gotten by most that a \ntraditional kabuki move of voting for cloture and against the bill won't work anymore.) \n\nSo this raises an absolutely critical question: what will happen between a vote to proceed today and the next cloture \nvote?  The outrage and pressure, mainly from the right, will have to triple.  If people like Burr, Bond, McConnell, etc. \nvote to proceed today and then don't get absolutely swamped with constituent outrage, their reaction will be \"that \nwasn't so bad, I can do it again.\" [E.A.] \n\nThat seems right, although with some potential second-vote switchers--like Webb--it may be important to be extra-\npolite about and not get their back up. Cold, polite, implacable outrage! ... If a net five Senators switch between \ntoday and the second vote, the bill is (again) dead. That's a much more plausible scenario in this case than it \nusually is, given all the maneuvering and posturing and pressure. Burr is a potential switcher (if his amendment is \ndefeated) in addition to Webb. And Brownback, if he wants to do well in Iowa. ... The fate of various amendments \nwill give lots of Senators lots of excuses to switch. ... The pro-bill forces lost Hatch and Stabenow and Bayh on the \nfirst cloture vote, which may become significant.  10:09 A.M.            link\n\nLooks easy!

It's being added now to provide cover for \ntimid Republicans. But I think it's a sign of weakness that the bill's managers had to resort to this ruse--they'd rather \nnot have to do it.

In fact, it doesn't seem inconceivable that \nallowing in hundreds of thousands of low-wage \"guest workers\" could increase the demand for illegals and the \n\"pressure\" on the border.  At the least, the demand isn't fixed, once declining wages are factored in:\n\n[B]y creating a steady flow of temporary workers with no ability to stay in the country for more than a couple years, \nand no practical ability to fight for better wages, the number of jobs that \"Americans won't do\" will grow dramatically.\n\n10:44 A.M. \n\nVoters are still against the Senate immigration bill--50-22% in Rasmussen's survey.

Well, I've talked to US-VISIT. They haven't even been talked to \nabout it. Of course they can't meet 5 years. We're talking 10 years minimum.\n\nWhat are they debating over in the other body? When the American public looks at what's happening in the Capitol \nBuilding on the same day and we're passing an appropriations bill that has theoretically looking at a biometric exit \nmaybe in the next 5 years and the other body is acting like it's done, what's going on here?

P.S.: It doesn't seem impossible to me that the immigration bill could get the \n60 votes necessary for cloture and then fail to get the 50 needed to pass. If enough Senators pull a Kabuki Straddle \n(voting for cloture but against the bill) that's what might happen. But it's highly unlikely. Indeed, a paranoid could \nthink that saying the bill might not pass, as Gregg does, is a cunning way to encourage wavering Senators to \nsupport cloture in the hope the bill will still fail.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN]: This is a very complicated bill. It's seven titles. Most people don't know what's in this \nbill. Therefore, to just have one or two thing dramatized and taken out of context, such as the word amnesty--we \nhave a silent amnesty right now, but nobody goes into that. Nobody goes into the flaws of our broken system. \n\nThis bill fixes those flaws. Do I think there should be an opportunity on talk radio to present that point of view? Yes, \nI do, particularly about the critical issues of the day. \n\nCHRIS WALLACE: So you would revive the fairness doctrine?\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I'm looking into it. As a matter of fact, Chris, because I think there ought to be an opportunity to \npresent the other side. And unfortunately, talk radio is overwhelmingly one way.\n\n -- Fox News Sunday, June 24, 2007 [via Askew]\n\n1)  I don't think it helps supporters of the immigration bill to broaden the fight by adding a threat to regulate radio \nspeech;\n\n2) What will they do about Internet radio, which isn't \"scarce\" the way broadcast frequencies are (giving the \ngovernment no excuse to regulate it to ensure \"fairness\")? \n\n3) Fox News stages another no-holds-barred discussion between a supporter of comprehensive immigration \nreform (Feinstein) and ... a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform (Lott)! On Fox, anyway, a Fairness \nDoctrine would help the yahoos; \n\n4) Did the Fairness Doctrine encourage centrist solutions? When Congress failed to pass the SALT treaty in the \nCarter years--with the Fairness Doctrine in full force--weren't there similar complaints about the inability to get \nsensible moderate measures enacted? I remember Lloyd Cutler publishing a Foreign Affairs article or two. Then in \n1987 the Fairness Doctrine was abolished. That was followed shortly by an explosion of right-wing talk radio and \nthen the most successful bipartisan reform in recent history, the 1996 welfare reform.  Maybe the problem isn't the \nloss of the Fairness Doctrine and the inability of the enlightened bipartisan elite to present its nuanced, complex, \nand contextualized views. Maybe the problem is that this time the enlightened bipartisan elite is pushing a bad bill \n(not that it was all that enthusiastic about the GOP-drafted 1996 welfare bill either).\n\nP.S.: John Rosenberg notes that Feinstein went on to say that:\n\nI remember when there was a fairness doctrine, and I think there was much more serious correct reporting to \npeople.\n\n\"Correct reporting.\" Do not forget this highly mockable phrase!

Examples include giving gangbangers and repeat drunk \ndrivers amnesty eligibility. \n\nSo why not drive the point home to some of these congresscritters by going ahead and mashing up some sample \nnegative ads along the lines of \"Senator So-and-so voted to give illegal alien gangbangers and drunk-drivers \namnesty\" and make sure the congresscritter staffs get a copy, or at least Youtubing them? [E.A.]\n\nMight work! I don't have the skills to throw together a 30-second negative campaign ad, but I know there are people \nout there who do. If they can pull together a trailer for bloggingheads, they can do an ad pointing out that Senator \nLautenberg, say, voted for a legalization bill that didn't even require illegals to pay back taxes. For other wording \nclues, check            Questions 59-63 in the recent Carville-Greenberg poll. ...\n\nP.S.: I wouldn't create an ad attacking someone who's currently undecided--that might just make them mad.

Just a thought. To \nMorris, it's all about winning Hispanic voter allegiance:\n\n[T]he political stakes are largely in the symbolism of the bill. Whichever party is seen as supporting reform will gain \na huge vote share among Hispanics, and the opponents will lose accordingly.\n\nAnd remember, if it's all about the symbolism, then it's not enough for Lott and fellow Republicans like Lindsey \nGraham to push the semi-amnesty bill through. They have to push the bill through loudly, histrionically, while \ndenouncing the opposition as anti-Latino--to make sure Hispanics know that the GOPs were their champions in \n2007.  It would be a shame to suck up to Latinos and then have the Democrats get all the credit (as Dems got all \nthe credit with blacks after the Civil Rights Act of 1964--even though, Morris notes, \"Republicans backed the bill in \nfar greater numbers than Democrats did\"). I think this helps explain Lott and Graham's recent obnoxious put-downs \nof their opponents.

These are the Senators whose decisions will likely determine whether the amnesty passes or not: Bond (R-\nMo.), Bingaman (D-N.M.), Burr (R-N.C.), Boxer (D-Calif.), Cochran (R-Miss.), Conrad (D-N.D.), Ensign (R-Nev.), \nLevin (D-Mich.), Gregg (R-N.H.), Nelson (D-Neb.), Hatch (R-Utah), Webb (D-Va.).\n\nClose! And a bit more difficult than I'd thought--I wouldn't want to be in the position of relying on Barbara Boxer to \ntorpedo the bill. ... But don't forget Sherrod Brown. There may be hope for Sherrod Brown. ... And            what \nabout Norm Coleman? ... There's also the            mysterious Dr. Barrasso. [           Update]... P.S.: Isn't it also \npossible that, given the bill's unpopularity, some Senators who would vote for cloture in the crunch are \nnevertheless whispering in the leadership's ear that they wouldn't mind if this whole thing somehow went away? ... \n5:12 P.M.            link\n\nDrama we're not seeing:  U.S. News--\n\n\"This week will basically be the last chance to pass immigration reform in this administration,\" says one activist, \n\"and the administration is using every card they've got.\"\n\nSen.

P.S.: Between            Hawkins and            Askew, and            The \nCorner, you'll get better coverage of the ongoing immigration bill intrigue than in the big MSM dailies or even \nCapitol Hill specialist publications. (The Hill now seems to be falling down on the job.) ... \n\nUpshot: It looks as if \"comprehensive\" supporters ran into some difficulties--e.g., public opinon--but \nunfortunately those problems may not be insurmountable. Republicans are realizing that if Harry Reid can run the \nSenate like the House on this issue--with debate limited to the amendments the leadership wants discussed, and \nthat amendment-picking power used to obtain cloture--then he can run the Senate like the House on other issues \nas well. (Not that there's anything wrong with that! Except when the leadership is pushing a bad bill, as in this \ncase.)\n\nHawkins also offers this gratifying, but probably overoptimisitc paragraph:\n\nI talked to my source about the shots Trent Lott and Lindsey Graham have taken at people opposed to the bill. My \nsource replied that when this whole thing started, these guys were cocky and thought they'd get this bill through \nwith 70 votes, no problem. But now, because of the blogs and talk radio, they've lost the public debate on the issue \nand they know it.

The more you think about this amendment the better it \ngets. It screws up almost everyone's agenda but almost everyone will have a hard time voting against it.

Yet many big-contributing businesses--major corporations and individual \nentrepreneurs--might face large damages and years of lawsuits.

McCain professed surprise at this \ndevelopment, and introduced an amendment, which was adopted, that purported to stick the requirement back in. It \nnow turns out that McCain's restore-back-taxes amendment was itself a fraud. Mark Krikorian            reports:\n\nTake look at Loophole 18 in Sen. Sessions' list ; it turns out that McCain's amendment only requires that those \nlegalized illegals applying to trade up to regular, permanent immigrant status (a green card) show they've paid \ntaxes on income earned after they were amnestied, i.e., while they had probabtionary status and then the Z visa. \nThere's no back taxes requirement to get the Z visa and obviously none for the initial phase of the amnesty, which \nhas to be granted by the end of the next business day after applying for it. In other words, there is no requirement \nthat illegal aliens pay back taxes to receive amnesty. [E.A.]\n\nMeanwhile, McCain has returned to telling voters that under the bill illegals would have to \"pay back taxes.\"** ...  \nAgain, the larger point is you can't rely on anything the Grand Bargainers say. They're in full fool-the-yahoos mode. \nWhy shouldn't voters expect that they would carry out the difficult enforcement mandates in their bill, if it passes, in \nthe same disingenuous spirit? You can't trust them! [You're writing as badly as Andrew Sullivan--ed I know! I'm \nexcited!]\n\nP.S.: Sessions' list of 20 loopholes is extremely useful. Negative ad-makers: may want to pay special attention to \n#7. ... In practical terms, #12 seems significant. Will there be a rush on the border from those who want to pretend \nthey were here before the January 1 cutoff? ... \n\n**--It's not clear, from Sessions' account, if execrable draftsmanship or intentional deception was involved--the \namendment apparently refers to a statutory section that doesn't exist.

[Tks. to reader M.W.] 7:22 P.M.\n\nGreenberg and Carville Bury the Lede: At the end of the memo summarizing their latest Democracy Corps poll of \nswing-district voters, they note a striking lack of support for the Senate immigration bill.\n\nImmigration: Immigration reform is an area of great concern for voters in the battleground. Indeed, more than a \nquarter of voters mention immigration as one of their two most important concerns. Yet, proposals to address this \nissue garner more support when focused on border control more than legalization. In fact, voters are 22 points \nmore likely to support Congressional proposals focused on increasing border security and stopping illegal \nimmigrants from getting government benefits than one focused on legalization. \n\nWe do not find very much voter support for the comprehensive Senate bill. We asked without description (opposed \n28 to 47 percent) and with description (45 to 49 percent). After hearing a  description of the immigration reform \npassed by the Senate, a majority of independents and Republicans oppose the bill while Democrats are torn 47 to \n47 percent. [E.A.]\n\nThis is Democratic Greenberg and Carville, remember. Not just  Rasmussen!  ... \n\nBackfill: The actual details of the poll are grimmer for comprehensivists than the Greenberg-Carville summary \nimplies.\n\n--\"Illegal immigration\" is the #2 concern of these swing-district voters, behind Iraq but ahead of health care and the \neconomy.\n\n-- That \"description\" of the Senate bill was heavily front-loaded with enforcement language (it begins: \"Strengthen \nborder security first ...\"). Even so, when the \"path for citizenship\" (after \"paying a fine\") and guest-worker program \nare included, the bill loses 49-45.\n\n--By a 59-37 margin, voters actually disfavor the following statement, despite its enforcement-oriented preamble:\n\nOn immigration, we need to get control of the border and bar illegal employment but allow the illegal immigrants \nwho have been here working for a long time to get on a path to citizenship.\n\nVoters preferred a competing statement that would \"require illegal immigrants to re-enter the country legally\" and \nbar them from \"getting government benefits.\"\n\n--More than 60 percent of the voters said they'd have \"serious doubts\" about a Congressperson who voted:\n\n--for \"allowing illegal immigrants, who broke our laws, to stay and become citizens, giving them amnesty.\"\n\n--against \"declaring English the official language.\"\n\n--in favor of \"illegal immigrants being permanent residents, who can use our schools, health care system, and also \nget other benefits.\"\n\nhttp://democracycorps.com/reports/surveys/Democracy_Corps_June_10-14_2007_Battleground_Survey.pdf\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2168675/&#burylede\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2153271/\nhttp://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/215-Reid-s-Secret-Immigration-Deal\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/26-John-McCain-Website-Domain-Names-McCain-Com-NR_W0QQitemZ170121848086QQihZ007QQcategoryZ11153QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem\nhttp://democracycorps.com/reports/analyses/Democracy_Corps_June_19_2007_Memo.pdf\nhttp://democracycorps.com/reports/surveys/Democracy_Corps_June_10-14_2007_Battleground_Survey.pdf\n\n\nYou get the picture. The wording on some of these questions--especially the first--is loaded, but no more loaded \nthan the likely wording in a campaign TV commercial attacking a Congressman who opened himself up to the \ncharge.\n\n--After all these words and descriptions were floating around in voters' heads, the polltakers again asked about \"the \ncomprehensive immigration reform plan being considered by the U.S. Senate.\" This time it lost by a 22 point \nmargin--a bit more than when voters were asked about it cold.\n\nUpshot: If a swing-state Congressman could be sure of totally controlling the language used in the immigration \ndebate, he might succeed in rendering \"comprehensive immigration reform\" merely mildly unpopular. If he lost \ncontrol of the language--as might in a fight with a decently-funded challenger--he could confront a deadly tsunami of \nopposition on the issue! [Thanks to alert reader S.M.] 2:03 P.M. link\n\nDon't count on the House! Last night I ran into a veteran D.C.

I don't think the following statement by Sen. Kennedy--in the debate on Sen. Dorgan's \namendment to curtail the proposed \"guest worker\" program--has drawn enough attention:\n\n\"I would like the chicken pluckers to pay $10 or $15 an hour. They do not do it. They are not going to do it. Who are \nyou trying to kid? Who is the Senator from North Dakota trying to fool?\n\nThese are the realities, the economic realities. No one has fought for increasing the minimum wage more than I \nhave. But you have got realities that employers are not going to pay it.\" [E.A.]\n\nWeren't Democrats (especially liberal Democrats) the people who wanted chicken pluckers--and others doing lousy \njobs at the bottom of the pyramid--to be paid $10 an hour? Yet here we have the putative lion of liberalism declaring \nthis modest goal (less than $3/hour above the new scheduled minimum wage) to be impossible. Employers just \nwon't do it! They'll hire illegals instead. But what if the flow of illegals is curtailed--something Kennedy's \nimmigration bill promises to do. Why not see if a tight labor market can boost wages above the new $7.25 \nminimum--instead of caving and providing employers with cheap temporary \"guest workers\" from abroad? If chicken \npluckers organized and their union went on strike demanding $10 an hour, would Kennedy ask them who they were \n\"trying to kid\" (and support breaking the strike with \"temporary\" employees)? They told us in the '60s that Kennedy \nwas the tool of the bourgeoisie!\n\nMost of the vocal opposition to the immigration bill, so far, has come from the right. What's important, for the \ncoming debate on immigration, will be the strength of opposition on the left. Does anyone on the Left think the \nGrand Bargain will on average improve the earnings of those Americans now making $6, $7, $8 and $9 an hour? \nPaul Krugman doesn't seem to. A year ago            he wrote [$]:\n\n[W]hile immigration may have raised overall income slightly, many of the worst-off native-born Americans are hurt \nby immigration -- especially immigration from Mexico. Because Mexican immigrants have much less education \nthan the average U.S. worker, they increase the supply of less-skilled labor, driving down the wages of the worst-\npaid Americans. The most authoritative recent study of this effect, by George Borjas and Lawrence Katz of Harvard, \nestimates that U.S. high school dropouts would earn as much as 8 percent more if it weren't for Mexican \nimmigration.\n\nThat's why it's intellectually dishonest to say, as President Bush does, that immigrants do ''jobs that Americans will \nnot do.'' The willingness of Americans to do a job depends on how much that job pays -- and the reason some jobs \npay too little to attract native-born Americans is competition from poorly paid immigrants.\n\nAnybody else?\n\nP.S.: Yglesias suggests it's \"baffling\" that I oppose \"comprehensive\" reform on the grounds that it will increase \nincome inequality given that (in his characterization) I'm \"the author of            a book about why we shouldn't care \nabout income inequality.\" That's a reasonable challenge to raise--I'll defend my position on inequality later. But I'm \nnot talking about inequality here. I'm talking about wages at the bottom, and whether Democrats are going to \nendorse something that makes them significantly, measurably worse.\n\nUpdate: I Rest My Case! Kevin Drum sneers about my \"new role as champion of the common man,\" arguing that if, \nin fact, chicken pluckers unionized and struck demanding $10 an hour I'd \"denounce Democratic support for a strike \nlike this.\" I might! I think Wagner Act unions bring unnecessary inefficiencies, and wages (above the minimum) are \ngenerally best set by the market. If the market sets the wage at $7.50, the better way to boost the incomes of those \nworkers is through the Earned Income Tax Credit, which I've consistently supported. But when the market raises \nwages above $7.50--due to the sort of tight labor supply we had in the late 90s--I'm all for it. Kennedy isn't. \nConfronted with the possibility of a natural market increase in wages at the bottom, Kennedy reacts by attempting to \nprevent it by importing additional \"guest workers.\"  \n\nHow pathetic is it that, instead of defending the position of low-wage workers when they finally might have the \nmarket on their side, earnest leftish bloggers like Drum are suddenly more concerned with snarking at people like \nme! \n\nhttp://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2007_record&page=S6417&position=all\nhttp://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A11F93D540C768EDDAC0894DF404482\nhttp://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6071EFD3F540C748EDDAA0894DE404482\nhttp://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/huh_yourself.php\nhttp://www.amazon.com/End-Equality-Mickey-Kaus/dp/0465098290\nhttp://www.amazon.com/End-Equality-Mickey-Kaus/dp/0465098290\nhttp://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_06/011508.php\n\n\n(And here I thought it was Kinsleyesque neoliberals who hunted for hypocrisy while Rome burned.)\n\nOf course, Drum has written, we're only talking about \"high school dropouts.\"  And \n\nif we're really worried about high school dropouts, everyone agrees they have way bigger problems than \ncompetition from illegal immigration anyway.\n\nSo pluck 'em!\n\nP.P.S.: Drum notes that the Borjas/Katz study has (since Krugman wrote his 2006 column) cut its estimate of the \nnegative effect of Mexican immigration in half, to 3.6%. a) That's not chopped liver, especially since we are trying \nto get wages at the bottom to go up; b) Anecdotal evidence suggests worse--talk to dry wall installers in South \nCentral; c) Drum argues the Senate bill would raise low-wage workers' bargaining power by legalizing illegals. But \nthat assumes that there won't be a new wave of legalization-seeking illegals as there was after the 1986 \nlegalization; d) Krugman, for his part, doesn't seem to have shifted position since last year--he still argues (in the \nmore recent column linked above) that earlier waves of immigration \"depressed the wages of the less skilled,\" and \nthat the current bill isn't worth the \"price that must be paid.\" ...  2:42 A.M. \n\nSunday, June 17, 2007 \n\n**** Alert: Non-Immigration Item**** \n\nWhere's the Zip? My Slate colleague Daniel Gross writes a whole piece on how the Bush administration is blocking \nthe Whole Foods/Wild Oats merger \"to punish political opponents.\" But what political opponent? Is the target \n\"liberals,\" on the grounds that the clientele of both chains are probably 95% Democratic? That's a pretty diffuse \nmethod of punishment--\"Vote Republican or pay through the nose for sprouted wheat!\" At other times, Gross makes \nit sound as if Bush is punishing some more specific enemy--yet the only victim he identifies is Daniel Gross of \nSlate, whose Connecticut town might be deprived of a Whole Foods outlet. This is paranoid. Maybe the Bushies are \nclean on this one. ... I mean, it's not as if Wild Oats' biggest shareholder is Bill Clinton's business partner and \nbachelor buddy who's also busy trying to buy up seemingly every available media property in advance of Hillary's \n2008 run, right? ...

It seems that \nHarry Reid has figured out a way to run the place like the House. But it's not completely clear that there are 60 \nvotes for cloture, and room for public pressure to change swing Senators' minds--or at least their votes. ... P.S.: See \nalso Right Wing News'            insider report, which notes why the key vote will be cloture--because the final vote will \nbe familiar fool-the-yahoos Kabuki:\n\n[T]he cloture vote to end debate will be the \"real\" vote on the bill because if debate is closed off, the bill is sure to \npass. Then, what will happen is that the votes for the bill will be counted, and a few senators who are afraid that \ntheir election prospects will be jeopardized by a \"yes\" vote, will be allowed to vote against the bill. This enables \nthose senators to tell their constituents that they voted against the bill, but it will still allow them to collect campaign \ncontributions from lobbyists who have a better understanding of how things work, and know that the bill couldn't \nhave been passed without their support. [E.A.]\n\nI'm not sure this old trick works post-Web. Too many constituents are onto it. ... More Kabuki Check: Interestingly, \nHawkins' source still thinks Reid still \"would prefer to see this bill go away,\" and that \"a lot\" of Senators are voting \nfor \"a bad bill\" with the hope and expectation that the House will kill it. ... 12:37 P.M.\n\nFriday, June 15, 2007 \n\nhttp://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_04/008634.php\nhttp://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A11F93D540C768EDDAC0894DF404482\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2167984/\nhttp://biz.yahoo.com/rb/070522/wildoats_wholefoods.html?.v=2\nhttp://instapundit.com/archives2/006317.php\nhttp://ace.mu.nu/archives/230293.php\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmJiMzVmZTZjNjE2ZWM4MDhiMWYzYTI3NjQ1ZjU4NmE=\nhttp://www.rightwingnews.com/mt331/2007/06/the_inside_story_on_whats_happ_1.php\n\n\nSo you  have apples  in that basket!            On bloggingheads, I try to explain why Giuliani's            second-billed \n\"commitment\"--\n\nI will end illegal immigration, secure our borders, and identify every non-citizen in our nation\n\nis really code for \"I support legalization.\" ... 4:52 P.M.\n\nIt's not just Rasmussen:  First Read notes underpublicized results in the            latest WSJ-NBC poll indicating \npublic dissatisfaction with the immigration \"grand bargain\"--including disapproval of the very provisions many MSM \noutlets claim popular support for.\n\nThe latest NBC/Wall Street Journal has plenty of numbers suggesting that getting the immigration bill through the \nSenate -- and then the House -- won't be easy. In it, 46% believe immigration helps more than it hurts, while \nalmost the same amount (44%) think the opposite. In addition, majorities oppose some of the Senate immigration \nbill's legalization provisions: 64% are against allowing illegal workers to receive an automatic work visa if they pay \na fine, and 55% oppose allowing illegal workers apply for permanent residency if they return home to their counties \nand pay additional fines. [E.A.] \n\nOnly 20% called the bill an \"acceptable compromise.\" 41% said it \"makes too many concessions to illegal \nimmigrants by allowing them to remain in the United States.\" ** ...  \n\nP.S.: The stark conflict between the WSJ-NBC results on the legalization plank and the NYTand            LAT results \non the same plank demands a            Mystery Pollster explanation. I suspect it will conclude that the answers to \nthese questions (like the answers to welfare reform questions) are highly dependent on the way the queries are \nworded--words like \"automatic,\" however accurate, will be a turnoff, while words like \"start\" and \"path\" and \"apply\" \nwill be appealing. ... But the answer to the basic \"do you support the bill\" question does not seem sensitive to \nwording. If there's a single poll that's showed a majority supporting the actual overall bill, I haven't seen it. ... \nUpdate: Emailer R. says I haven't gone far enough:\n\nActually, can you find a single poll that shows a quarter of the population supporting it?\n\n**--Another 20% said \"it makes too many concessions to those who want illegal immigrants to have to return to their \nnative countries.\" Which it does! The bill's \"temporary\" worker program, requiring a return home every two years \nand permanent return after six, seems indefensibly harsh. I deny that this left-wing criticism of the bill translates into \nde facto support, or is incompatible with the right-wing criticism of the bill's legalization provisions. (You could want \nnew, legal guest workers to have a path to citizenship but existing illegal workers to be treated less generously.) \nThey're both criticisms of the bill. The NBC-WSJ question falsely makes respondents choose between them. ... \nN.B.: The first version of this post hideously misread the NBC-WSJ poll. I've cleaned it up. ... 1:49 P.M.            link\n\nNote: I am not single-mindedly obsessed with the immigration issue. This guy is single-mindedly obsessed with \nthe immigration issue. ... 1:03 P.M.\n\nOnly an angry minority supports the \"popular\" immigration bill? \n\nForty percent (40%) of American voters say that President Bush is doing a good or an excellent job on taxes. A \nRasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 39% say the same about his handling of the economy. \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, just 15% say he is doing a good or an excellent job on immigration.

Isn't this finding is flat incompatible with the idea that, \"A majority of \nAmericans support our proposal,\" as John McCain asserted this week, or that it is opposed only by a \"very intense \nminority\" of conservatives?

(Note also the Times' \nskillful use of gratuitous, comprehensivist-approved softening words \"start\" and \"path.\") ... Rasmussen's            \nargument against LAT-type questions is different, but not incompatible: he thinks the public is in fact willing to \naccept \"paths to citizenship\" as part of a compromise that would also secure the borders. But the public thinks the \nSenate bill won't secure the borders. ...

Here's a disturbing theory from one of Rich Lowry's readers:\n\nChertoff and Kyl both seem to have answered that question recently, Kyl in his Wall Street Journal interview and \nChertoff on Fox News yesterday: because businesses are starting to worry about efforts to enforce immigration \nlaws at the local level. One state in the vanguard of that effort is Kyl's (and McCain's) home state of Arizona, where \nthe legislature has passed numerous laws (usually vetoed) on the issue, and where the public voted for Prop 200 \nback in 2004.\n\nTo me that says something far more ominous than that Congress is being disingenuous or na\u00c3\u00afve on the matter. \nFar from simple being empty promises, this amnesty bill is actually a blatant attempt to head off any attempts at \nenforcement at all. \n\nIt also means the current immigration debate isn't as important as obsessive bloggers have been making it seem. \nIt's more important! And it's not important to the GOPs so much as the Dems--because it means business is acting \nnow to avoid what it perceives as a coming labor shortage in which it will have to substantially raise wages at the \nbottom, altering the economic contours of the economy in favor of unskilled workers and their families. You wouldn't \nthink that--whatever Republicans do--a Democrat like Harry Reid would really want to move a bill that \nwould prevent such a dramatic, progressive shift, would you? ...\n\nP.S.: You get paid less but you get a union card. Rep. Barney Frank acknowledges that the influx of immigrant \nworkers is \"bad for blue-collars,\" according to National Journal [via            Corner]. But, hey, Dems will compensate \nby increasing union power!\n\n[I]mmigrants can help elect Democratic majorities, and \"if [a Democratic Congress] were to significantly strengthen \nunions, then you would offset the negative effect on the income of workers,\" he said.\n\nI was going to write a post about how this illustrates a clear difference between neoliberals and paleoliberals--neolib \nClintonomists relying on tight labor markets to raise wages, paleolibs disdaining the market and relying on \ncumbersome inefficient union mechanisms to maybe, somehow replicate what the market could have achieved \nwithout them. But even the cumbersome inefficient unions of the AFL-CIO aren't buying Frank's rationalization. \n... 2:43 P.M.\n\nOpposition to the \"Grand Bargain\" from the left--not the liberal left, the left left, described at PoliticalAffairs.Net. ... \nThis is actually a highly-useful, detailed article on the lobbying push behind the bill. \n\nThe National Immigration Forum and the DC umbrella group it initiated, the Coalition for Comprehensive \nImmigration Reform, were key players in this strategy.

The new Bush \ncounterinsurgency strategy to reverse the course of the immigration debate seems to have two components: \n\n1) Exude confidence. \"We are winning\" ... sorry, that's what Bush said about the war in Iraq. Here's what his \nCommerce secretary said about the immigration Grand Bargain: \"This bill is alive and well .... I have no doubt. \nThis is going to go through ....\"\n\n 2) Stress all the enforcement provisions in the bill, while pretending you've gotten the message:\n\n\"I know some of you doubt that the Federal government will make good on the border security and enforcement \ncommitments in this bill ... [W]e are now committing more resources than ever before to border security, doubling \nthe number of Border Patrol agents, building hundreds of miles of fencing, and employing advanced technology, \nfrom infrared sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles. The bill builds on this progress by requiring that we meet border \nsecurity objectives before certain other provisions can take effect.\" \n\n--President Bush,  President's Radio Address  , June 8. [E.A.]\n\n\"Because I think a lot of people have concerns about security and our message is: 'We heard you. Take a look at \nwhat's going on with this bill.'\"   ... \n\n\"If you take a look at the bill, it is the largest investment ever in border security. ... This bill says ... harsh \npunishments for employers.\" ... \n\n\"And furthermore, we have a mechanism now for knowing who the illegals are, where they are, whether they're \nworking, whether they're breaking the law and if they're not working and they're not obeying the law, they get sent \nout.\"  \n\n--White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, on various Sunday shows. [E.A.]\n\nThis is all in keeping with the Peggy Noonan view that the White House really does think its own GOP base is \ncomposed of yahoos who can be fooled with a little talk of enforcement.\n\nkf Balking Points \n\n1. If all these enforcement measures are so wonderful, why not enact just them and drop the \nquestionable legalization part? Bush is holding the parts of the bill everyone says they want hostage to the parts he \nwants.\n\n2. If we tried the enforcement parts first, then we wouldn't have to trust the federal government. We could make \nsure the measures work before we go ahead with legalization (and attract a new wave of legalization-seeking \nillegals). \n\n3. The bill does require \"that we meet border security objectives before certain other provisions can take effect.\" \nUnfortunately, legalization is not one of those \"certain other provisions.\" Legalization is immediate under the bill.\n\n4. \"[I]f ... they're not obeying the law, they get sent out.\" Of course, most of them will be obeying the law ... because \nwhat was illegal will have been legalized! As for whether the government will actually get it together to send people \nhome if, say, they've come illegally after the January, 2007 cutoff--well, again, let's see whether that \"investment\" in \nenforcement pays off. \n\nBonus BP: \n\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2168226/&#kospos\nhttp://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usbush194557960dec19,0,7865602.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/06/20070608-8.html\nhttp://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110010148\n\n\n5.

Don't disillusion \nme.\n\nP.S.: RWN's source also explains why all those conservative amendments--the official sticking point in the \ndeliberations--aren't insignificant:\n\nThe \"Grand Compromise\" crowd didn't want a lot of these amendments to be voted on because either some of the \namendments would have been accepted and it would have killed the bill or alternately, they would have had to vote \nagainst common sense enforcement measures and made themselves look bad.\n\nI still hope Sen. DeMint hangs tough and refuses any agreement to whittle down the list of amendments and go \nforward.

Oh, wait. 1:58 A.M.\n\nFriday, June 8, 2007 \n\n\"Voters wanted an immigration deal\": A quick word on those polls MSM writers--e.g.            Dan Balz--are using to \nsuggest that the Senate thwarted the popular will in blocking \"comprehensive immigration reform.\" I'd been \npuzzled myself by the consistent polls showing that a) the comprehensive bill itself was            wildly \nunpopular,  yet b) --and these are the polls emphasized by the MSM--the controversial \"earned legalization\" planks, \nwhen they are described to voters,            win majority approval. \n\nBut Mystery Pollster cleared it up for me. The key is the            Gallup finding that only half of the public is \npaying much attention to the immigration debate. Those who are paying attention oppose the bill 30% to 11%, but \n58 % \"don't know enough to say.\"   On this basis, Gallup editor-in-chief            Frank Newport calls those who \noppose the bill a \"vociferous minority\"--apparently believing that if only more voters paid attention they'd endorse \nthe bill, because            when they're given the questions describing various paths to citizenship for illegals who \n\"have a job\" and \"pay back taxes,\" they mostly say yes. \n\nThe flaw in this \"scientific research,\" MP points out, is that by Newport's own admission these are mainly voters who \naren't paying attention and are hearing these terms for the first time, so \"their reactions may vary greatly along with \nthe text of the descriptions provided.\" If they react positively to loaded words like \"job\" and \"pay taxes\" when they \nfirst hear them, that's no guarantee that they'd endorse the Senate bill's provisions if they starting following them \nclosely (and began to hear other terms, like \"immediate legalization\" and \"sanctuary\"). \n\nWe simply don't know how the 58% would react if for some reason they started paying attention--though Gallup's \nown finding that those who are paying the most attention are the most lopsidedly (61% to 17%) opposed to the bill \nis hardly evidence that they'd support it. Indeed, when Gallup described to voters various alternatives, the most \npopular, at 42%, was \"to require illegal immigrants to leave, to but allow them to return if they meet certain \nrequirements over a period of time.\" That sounds a lot like--yikes--deportation, no?  Another 14% wanted flat \ndeportation with no possibility of eventual return. 42+14=56.\n\nUpdate:Matthew Yglesias talks about \"[t]he objective social conditions militating in favor of reform.\" Wow, that \nbrings back memories. ... 4:55 P.M.            link \n\nDon't calm down: The White House says Bush is going to keep pushing the \"grand bargain\" in a Capitol Hill \nmeeting next week. This could mean he's planning a surge-like effort, or it could just be part of the gradual let-\ndown-easy process in which he learns that it's not really about the amendments--the Senate is just not that into \nhim. ... \n\nP.S.: Sen. Salazar says the bill \"may return in July,\" according to the Denver Post. Why? Because \"'Failure on \nimmigration reform is not an option.'\"  ... \n\nP.P.S.: At some point, won't the President and others involved (McCain, Lindsey Graham, Lott, etc.) realize that as \nlong as they keep pushing the bill, even in the press, they keep the pain coming (even as they impress reporters \nwith their bipartisan statesmanship)?

But I could \nbe overinterpreting. ... \n\nMore: O'Beirne hears \"the Republican leadership continues to press the reluctant Senators\" for a deal that could \nenable cloture. ... 3:13 P.M. \n\nGeorge Borjas on what the Bush administration could have done to make progress on an immigration solution. ... \n[Hint: It's not \"comprehensive.\"] 4:15 A.M.\n\nShailagh Murray reports usefully on how four anti-comprehensive Republicans, including Sen. DeMint, switched \nvotes to back the Dorgan anti-guestworker amendment that may have helped kill the immigration bill. But her \nstory feeds two insidious memes that could propagate in the days ahead:\n\nBogus Meme #1: The vote-switchers were an obdurate minority frustrating the will of the majority through cynical \ntrickery. Here's Murray:\n\nBut that's the Senate, where tactical voting is par for the course, and where a single disgruntled lawmaker -- or, in \nthis case, four -- can run even the most artful compromise aground. [E.A.]\n\nFirst, Sen. Dorgan, a Democrat, knew full well that if his amendment won it would probably derail the \"grand \nbargain.\" Republicans had said that it would. Yet he pressed ahead, aided and abetted by Majority Leader Reid \nwho as the vote was being plotted \"tapped Dorgan on the back\" and said \"excellent,\" according to Politico's Carrie \nBudoff. This suggest that Dorgan, and maybe Reid, preferred \"no bill\" to the bill as grandly bargained. \n\nSecond, the bill did not fail after Dorgan's \"killer\" amendment. It failed on an ordinary cloture vote, in which all \nparties had been clearly warned by Reid that failure would mean withdrawal of the bill. Yet it couldn't even muster a \nmajority, let alone 60 senators. Why did a bipartisan majority effectively vote to bury the bill? The Hill s Manu Raju \noffers an explanation that's more sophisticated and plausible than Murray's Disgruntled Saboteur theory:\n\nSince the bill failed on a procedural motion, it gives both parties cover when trying to court the influential Latino \nvote in the 2008 elections.\n\nThat's how the Senate works, no? It excels in providing opportunities for lawmakers to engineer stalemates that kill \nlegislation a majority wants killed while diffusing responsibility for doing so (or allowing reporters to blame \n\"disgruntled\" loners). ...\n\nUpdate: But see K-Lo's anonymous Senate source, who says a) the cloture vote may have reflected majority \nsentiment less faithfully than I'm claiming; and b) it's not over. (Buried lede!) ...\n\nBogus Meme #2: Left and Right are totally strange bedfellows here. Sen. DeMint, reports Murray, dislikes the \n\"comprehensive\" bill because it includes \"a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.\" (That's not how DeMint \nwould describe it, probably.) And, says Murray, \n\nSen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) does not like the immigration bill, either, but for entirely different reasons.\n\nEntirely different reasons? Dorgan thinks the bill would \"depress wages and lead to foreigners taking good jobs.\" \nAnd DeMint, presumably, thinks a \"path to citizenship\" would encourage more illegal immigrants, who would ... \ndepress wages and lead to foreigners taking good jobs! They're both concerned about depressing wages. \n\nhttp://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/08/218779.aspx\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTMzZGE4ZWU3MjRjNjQxZTcxMDg4MWI4MGM3N2IyOTk=\nhttp://borjas.typepad.com/the_borjas_blog/2007/06/kill_bill.html\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702534_pf.html\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4182_Page2.html\nhttp://thehill.com/leading-the-news/immigration-bill-fails-key-cloture-vote-2007-06-07.html\nhttp://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWNhZDdjNjFmMWJkYWI5MWNjMTE2Y2Q2ZDFkMjVkMGM=\n\n\nBipartisanship!
