Consider the following ways in which you can accomplish this:\n\nUse Your Trade Show Exhibit Design to Highlight Food Bars At every NPEW, we all know that food bars are \nimportant to entice trade show attendees to stop by and sample your goods. Part of the way you do this is through \nyour trade show exhibit design. Have you considered a food bar in the front to display your products or to pour \ndrinks or display food items? Your trade show exhibit design is incredibly important at shows like this because you \nneed to allow people to see what it is you offer from down the aisle. If they can't see, smell, or hear the chatter \nabout your food bar, you may miss out on the chatter about popular exhibits and products.\n\nSource: Company Website\n\nOctober 01: Stay Ahead of the Emerging Trade Show Exhibit Trends\n\nTrade shows happen every month across the globe. No matter the industry, there are certain themes, certain \nelements, and certain technologies which are redefining trade show exhibit trends.

They offset \ncold elements of technology and make any trade show exhibit feel much warmer. A living wall is one of the most \nexciting trade show exhibit trends because it's unexpected in an environment full of aluminum, wood, and other \nmaterials.\n\nJoulon trade show exhibit Absolute Exhibits Trade Show Exhibit Trends with Movement Trade show exhibit \ntrends are often technology focused and interactive video walls are growing in popularity.

With an expansion comes more questions. Should you continue to rent your trade show display, or \nshould you purchase one? How do you know you're ready to make the leap from rental to purchase? You might be \nready to leave behind renting if the following applies to you:\n\nYOU'RE EXHIBITING AT MULTIPLE TRADE SHOWS\n\nIf you will be exhibiting at multiple trade shows, it may be in your best interest to purchase your trade show display \nrather than continue to rent one. Businesses with large volumes of trade shows often decide to purchase their \ndisplay so they can be nimble. They don't want to have to contact their exhibit house every month or two and try to \nrush a design through in time for the show. Owning their trade show display offers them the freedom to pick up new \ntrade shows within a short period of time. It also offers businesses branding consistency. This branding consistency \nwill help you to become a recognized brand at industry trade shows.\n\nYOU WANT A TRULY CUSTOM TRADE SHOW DISPLAY\n\nWhen you rent a trade show display, there's only so much customization that you can do to make it stand out. \nCustomized rentals are often hybrid designs, but they can't go too far out of the box because they're a rental. The \nreally unique displays- shaped like a barn, an apothecary, or a piece of technology are purchased. This is because \nthe details a business has envisioned simply couldn't be created with a rental. When your vision is grand, you \nshould consider purchasing your trade show display. Only then can you create something truly unique that will \nstand out in the exhibit hall. Consider how you want to establish yourself and if this can be accomplished with a \nrental or a purchased trade show display.\n\ntrade show display\n\nYOU'VE GOT A BUDGET TO PURCHASE WHAT YOU WANT\n\nOften, trade show budgets are constrained.\n\nSECTION 5 OTHER NEWS: 2018\n\nSeptember 25: Absolute Exhibits, Inc.: Design the Perfect CES Trade Show Booth\n\nIf you're involved in technology, computing, the internet of things, or anything with a technical slant, it's likely that \nyou're considering showing at CES.
