{"title": "Foreign Policy United-States", "body": "\nGeneral Relations\n\nThe terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, on the United States (U.S.) perhaps best embodied the increasing \nimpracticality of the isolationism established in 1776 by the country's founding fathers. At the inception of national \nindependence, United States leaders endorsed a policy of non-involvement in world affairs. Isolationism, while not \nwithout adherents, became an increasingly untenable policy in an industrialized world, knit ever more tightly \ntogether by faster communications and transportation and international business. \n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the United States was an acknowledged world power. After World War II, the United \nStates assumed major responsibility in creating the United Nations and initiated the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. In the post-World War II era, active engagement in international affairs, largely motivated by the \ndetermination to counter communist movements supported or inspired by the Soviet Union and China, did much to \ndefine United States identity. The dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world's sole definitive \nmilitary superpower, while the United States maintains its position as the world's largest economy.\n\nThe end of the Cold War forced a sweeping reorientation of United States foreign policy, the ultimate configuration \nof which is difficult to project in detail, aside from the observation that the present period is one of long-term \ntransition.\n\nToday, the United States seeks to ensure Russia and the other former Soviet republics experience a stable process \nof democratization and economic advancement; to expand trade ties around the world; to maintain warm relations \nwith European allies, which include new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe previously in the Soviet sphere \nof influence; and to guard against terrorist acts from splinter groups or extremist states. Stronger hemispheric \nrelations are also inevitable in a time when regional blocs are ever-increasing, as exemplified by economic free \ntrade as well as geopolitical policy-making.\n\nThe decision to go to war in 2003 with Iraq under the Bush doctrine of \"pre-emption,\" terribly strained relations with \nmuch of the global community.  It has also raised questions about the policy of unilateralism.  By 2005 and well into \n\n\n2006, revelations about possible Central Intelligence Agency clandestine prisons or \"black sites\" in Europe, the \npublication of graphic photographs depicting the alleged torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail in \nIraq, as well as ongoing controversies regarding the detainment,  treatment and rights of terror suspects, \nhave collectively served to strenuously strain United States relations with many countries across the globe.\n\nBarack Obama's election on November 4, 2008 as the 44th president of the United States augurs a sea change in \nforeign policy.\n\nTo that end, Obama has advocated a more integrationist and internationalist stance on foreign policy matters.  \nObama has also advocated engagement and dialogue with other nation states -- both friends and foes -- in the \ninterests of global stability.  As well, Obama has consistently said that his administration would end the war in Iraq \nand fortify efforts to stamp out al-Qaida in Afghanistan.  Importantly, Obama has championed a return to \ninternational jurisprudence, such as acting in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, and regaining America's \n\"moral stature\" on the international stage.\n\nSee below for more details about a new foreign policy under the Obama administration.  \n\nImportant Themes in United States Foreign Relations\n\nGlobal Interconnections\n\nA relentless rise in the world's interconnectedness will surely be a hallmark of the 21st century. Networks are \ngrowing through extension of business contacts, political movements toward self-determination that embrace or \nspurn democratic rule, increasing travel and instant communications and escalating impact on the natural \nenvironment and biospheric life-support system. Facing this change, the United States will likely be compelled in \nsome fashion to heighten its engagement with the developing nations of the \"global South,\" a term for the less-\ndeveloped, poorer countries of the world, predominantly though not exclusively in the southern part of the Northern \nHemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere. Such engagement could be prompted by many factors and a wide \nrange of concerns.\n\nInherent to the United States vision of globalization is the promotion of trade, in step with efforts to establish \ngenerally recognized trade norms. The challenge of international political relations spans a thorny cluster of issues, \nincluding prospects for democratization and political development in small, poor or conflict-ridden countries around \nthe world, calls for international peacekeeping forces to prevent or defuse regional conflicts and the need to devise \nappropriate and effective measures to reduce the threat of international terrorism. Also critical is the need for health \nmonitoring and improvement programs, including ones designed to curb the spread of AIDS and other pathogens \nboth within and across national boundaries. Finally, the coming century is certain to witness the emergence of \nunprecedented large-scale environmental problems, notably the projected difficulties associated with the effects of \nglobal warming and other aspects of climate change.  \n\nTransnational Policy on the Environment\n\nIn March 2001, the Bush administration announced it would not attempt to limit United States (U.S.) carbon dioxide \nemissions, a suspected cause of global warming, nor would it continue the efforts of the previous Clinton \nadministration to secure U.S. Senate ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement to \naddress the problem of global warming. The former Vice President under Clinton, Al Gore, had personally signed \non to the agreement during the tenure of the Clinton-Gore administration, and had been a vocal advocate for \nenvironmental responsibility and international cooperation on global warming.\n\n\n\nAt present, the current United States government's official position is to regard global warming as a potential \nproblem, with further research needed to verify its existence and seriousness. If measures to remediate it ultimately \nprove needed, the United States may seek rules and practices deemed less injurious to traditional energy \ngeneration and customary economic growth than those now proposed. Put simply, the Bush administration has \nbeen steadfast in its view that environmental policies, such as Kyoto, will harm American business, and are \nunnecessary in the first place, since in their view, global warming is yet to be determined as a real threat.  This \nposition has been regarded as irreconcilable with the stances taken by much of the global community.\n\nThe new Obama adminsitration embraces the science of global climate change as well as the need for strong \naction to combat its deleterious effects.  Policy changes are thusly anticipated.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nCultivation of international trade has characterized both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations in \nthe United States. The changeover from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, by most analyses, ushers in a continued \npriority with international trade. Recent pieces of legislation approved by the Bush administration, which are aimed \nat protecting certain local industries, however, have not been well-received by the international community.\n\nThe new Obama administration, beset by economic troubles at home, has tried to strike a balance between \nprotecting American workers and embracing the global economy.\n\nArms Proliferation and Associated Accords\n\nProliferation of nuclear armaments and other weapons of mass destruction and efforts to control it are an enduring \nconcern. However, the perspective on this issue has shifted considerably from a decades-long United States \n(U.S.)-Soviet bipolar confrontation to a multipolar array of contending or potentially contending nationalisms. \nCompounding the complexity of the situation is the possibility that weapons of mass destruction might be wielded \nnot by a nation-state but by small radical groups.\n\nDating back to the 1960s, the United States and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R. or Soviet \nUnion) regularly held arms control talks, which led to an initial breakthrough agreement with the Strategic Arms \nLimitation Treaty in 1972. Other accords followed, and the total number of nuclear warheads now possessed by the \nUnited States, Russia and other former Soviet republics is in fact lower than it was in 1980, although it still exceeds \n30,000. The United States and Russia have voiced their mutual intention to continue the arms negotiations begun \nduring the Soviet era. One working proposal, announced in 1993, was to hold a new round of strategic arms \nreductions talks aimed at achieving a further reduction in each side's nuclear arsenal to 3,500 warheads.\n\nHowever, as in the 1980s, when the U.S.S.R. strongly opposed a U.S.-proposed program called the Strategic \nDefense Initiative to develop a space-based anti-missile system, the current arms control climate is clouded by \nwidespread international objections to  U.S. consideration by the Bush administration of a limited anti-missile \nsystem termed National Missile Defense. Creating this system would effectively void the existing Anti-Ballistic \nMissile treaty currently in existence. Earlier, the U.S. Senate opted against ratification of the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty in October 1999.\n\nSince the time of the Bush administration, movement has been made to scrap the existing anti-ballistic missile \ntreaty in place with Russia. Relations with Russia have, at times, been strained as a result of this policy initiative.\n\n\n\nThe new Obama administration augurs a thawing of relations with Russia, marked by a decision for both countries \nto work together to reduce their nuclear arsenals and work cooperatively on global security.\n\nAmerican Military Deployments Across the Globe\n\nA period of disengagement followed the Vietnam War, which was actually never a formally declared war though it \ncomprised the longest-term deployment of U.S. troops in foreign combat. Eventually, the United States reasserted \nits prerogative to deploy conventional forces in locations around the world to forestall or stop acts by other \ngovernments deemed lawless and to advance U.S. national interests.\n\nActions were taken in Grenada and Panama in the 1980s, and in Somalia and Haiti (where U.S. forces served as \npeacekeepers, with no combat taking place) in the 1990s. Eclipsing these varied involvements, however, were the \n1990-1991 Persian Gulf mobilization to reverse Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, in which the United States mustered \nand led a multinational alliance of Middle Eastern and European nations, and major operations in the Balkan region \nof Europe conducted with U.N. authorization under NATO auspices.\n\nThe Balkans involvement began with air patrols and strikes against Bosnian Serb positions in 1993 and 1994, \nrespectively. The United States played a leading role in negotiating a truce in the Bosnian fighting, achieved by the \nDayton Accords of late 1995. American troops participated in the multinational peacekeeping force stationed in \nBosnia. In 1999, a U.N.-authorized, NATO-led alliance very similar to the one in Bosnia again exerted military force \nto halt Serbian reprisals against ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.\n\nThe United States has about 4,400 troops stationed in Bosnia, serving in a multinational mission to restore civil \norder, a functioning government, and normal public services in that country. The United States also has about 7,000 \nmilitary personnel in Kosovo, making its contingent the second-largest behind France in the K-For military presence \nthat has been maintained in that location since former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic relinquished his \nmilitary hold over the province in the face of NATO air strikes. Altogether, K-For numbers about 40,000 troops, with \nslightly over 35,000 from NATO countries and the remainder from other nations.\n\nAs an indication of the  Bush administration's shift to limit international peacekeeping, the United States announced \nin March 2001 that nearly 1,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia would not be replaced at the end of their rotation.  \nDeployments of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001 to the present have changed -- and in the opinions of \nsome experts, strained -- the country's military resources due to military efforts in both countries.\n\nThe Obama administration has announced a withdrawal timetable from Iraq and the ramping up of military efforts in \nAfghanistan.\n\nInternational Aid and Assistance\n\nThe United States (U.S.) remains involved in international aid and assistance programs, albeit to a limited degree. \nAlthough the United States, through programs such as the Agency for International Development and the Peace \nCorps, operates a large variety of humanitarian and technical assistance programs with nearly a global scope, \nforeign aid represents only a fraction of one percent of the national budget, compared to figures up to the range of a \nfew percent posted by European countries and Japan. Much of the U.S. effort to foster world economic \ndevelopment is made in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The creation of \nthese institutions was spearheaded by the United States, and the country is their main funder, although \ndevelopment monies disbursed to poor countries through the IMF and World Bank are contributed by all major \n\n\n\nindustrialized nations in close proportion to the size of their respective economies. In regard to proportionate \ncontributions, the United States is often criticized for not offering a greater amount of financial aid.\n\nTerrorism\n\nAs Americans joined in 2001 to rebound from the worst terrorist attack ever on United States (U.S.) soil, the \ngovernment immediately launched an investigation, and the central focus was notorious Osama bin Laden, leader \nof the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Qaida organization.\n\nBin Laden was born in 1957, the 17th of 52 children born to Muhammad Awad bin Laden, a Saudi construction \nmagnate and multimillionaire. Bin Laden's mother, one of his father's four wives, was either Syrian or Palestinian, \ndepending on which accounts one believes. The senior bin Laden had immigrated to Saudi Arabia from nearby \nYemen. When Osama was 10, his father died in a helicopter accident, leaving the boy a portion of the family's \nsignificant fortune. At 17, he married a cousin and began attending King Abdul Aziz University in Jidda, where he \nstudied under Abdullah Azzam, a Palestinian and devout Muslim.\n\nIn 1979, bin Laden headed to Afghanistan to help the resistance fighters, called the mujahedeen, combat the Soviet \ninvasion of the country. Azzam, bin Laden's former teacher, founded an organization to help finance the resistance; \nbin Laden became its chief financier. The rebel organization would eventually become Al-Qaida, \"the base\" in \nArabic. Ten years later, when the Soviets had been driven out of Afghanistan, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia to \nwork for his family's construction company. He continued to use Al-Qaida to raise funds for veterans of the Afghan \nwar.\n\nWhen the United States stationed troops in Saudi Arabia in 1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that \neventually led to the Gulf War, bin Laden became outraged his Islamic homeland would accept support from what \nhe considered heretics. He began writing manifestos against the Saudi government. Within a year, bin Laden was \nexpelled from Saudi Arabia for his anti-government protests. The country eventually revoked his citizenship, and his \nfamily disowned him as well. Bin Laden set up shop in Sudan..\n\nIn February 1993, a bomb exploded at the base of the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring hundreds. \nSix Muslim radicals - suspected by U.S. officials of being linked to bin Laden - were eventually convicted of the \nbombing. Later that year, in October, 18 American soldiers in Somalia on a humanitarian mission were killed in an \nambush. The U.S. quickly pulled troops out of Somalia, leading bin Laden to call the Americans \"paper tigers\" and \nadmit some of his group were involved in the killings.\n\nBy 1996, the United States convinced the Sudanese government to expel bin Laden. The murderous radical moved \nwith his three wives and 10 children to Afghanistan, where it is thought he added a fourth wife. Bin Laden declared \na holy war, or \"jihad,\" on the American government and people; the U.S. government indicted him on charges \nrelated to the 1993 ambush in Somalia.\n\nIn 1998, bin Laden told Muslims they should kill Americans, including civilians, wherever they can be found. On \nAugust 7, truck bombs exploded at two American embassies in Africa, killing 224 people. By November, the U.S. \ngovernment had enough information to indict bin Laden on the attacks. Then-President Bill Clinton ordered cruise \nmissile attacks against suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.\n\nPolice thwarted a plotted bomb attack on Los Angeles International Airport during millennium celebrations. Later in \n2000, Algerian Ahmed Ressam pleaded guilty and admitted he had been trained in urban warfare and explosives at \none of bin Laden's Afghanistan camps. Although bin Laden had been keeping a low profile, he surfaced in early \n\n\n\n2001 at his son's wedding in Khandahar, Afghanistan. Shortly thereafter, in May, four of his alleged associates were \nconvicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa. Bin had denied \ninvolvement in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, but an aide quoted him as saying the attacks were \"punishment \nfrom Allah\" on the United States.\n\nAl-Qaida is reported to have operatives in at least 34 countries, making the war against terrorism different from any \nother war the world has experienced. Bin Laden is estimated to have about $300 million in personal financial assets \nwith which he funds his network and as many as 3,000 Islamic militant operatives.\n\nTo understand the situation in Afghanistan, it is necessary to know about the two warring factions. The Northern \nAlliance is the military wing of Afghanistan's pre-Taliban government. It is still recognized by most countries and by \nthe United Nations; it is believed to receive financial support from Iran and Russia, both of which are opposed to the \nTaliban. The Alliance controls less than 10 percent of Afghanistan, mostly in the northern part, as the name \nsuggests. Its ranks are small - estimated between 10,000 and 12,000 troops - and its equipment ancient: Soviet-era \ntanks, fighter jets and helicopter gunships. The leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was \nassassinated Sept. 9, 2001, two days before the terrorist attacks on the United States. Massoud had been a \ncommander in the 10-year war against Soviet occupation. Following his death, Gen. Mohammed Fahim, \nintelligence chief for the Alliance, took over as temporary defense chief.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum is the Taliban, a group of Islamic fundamentalist extremists, the majority of whom \ncome from Afghanistan's Pashtun ethnic group. The Taliban, which in English means \"students of Islam,\" formed in \nthe early 1990s, shortly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. It recruited students from the Koranic schools \nwithin Afghanistan as well as from the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, the only country to recognize the Taliban \nas leaders. By 1997, the Taliban had gained control over most of Afghanistan.\n\nAmong the most extreme measures of the sect: Taliban leaders forbid educating women and frequently execute, \namputate or stone to death \"criminals\" in public. Although it is difficult for Westerners to understand how such a \nmilitant group came to power, it behooves one to remember that Afghanistan was in utter chaos after the Soviet \nwar; the Taliban, for all its faults, brought relative calm to the country. To some, it sounds like the justification of \nMussolini's behavior by saying he \"made the trains run on time.\" A common analogy is that the Taliban is to Islam \nwhat the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity - violently extremist. Although Osama bin Laden is not considered part of \nthe Taliban, the organization has been sheltering him since the U.S. investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks began - \nnot surprisingly, since the Taliban's creator and supreme or spiritual leader is bin Laden's son-in-law, Mullah \nMohammed Omar, who recently married one of bin Laden's daughters. Omar founded the Taliban with the goal of \ntransforming Afghanistan into the purest Islamic state in the world.\n\nOn September 13, the Taliban issued a statement saying they would hand over bin Laden as soon as the \nAmericans presented evidence he was behind the events of September 11. On Monday, September 17, a Pakistani \ndelegation delivered President Bush's response ordering the Taliban to turn over bin Laden or face a U.S.-led \nattack.\n\nThree days later, Afghanistan's Grand Islamic Council, comprised of about 600 clerics known as \"ulema\" issued the \nfollowing edict:\n\n\"The ulema of Afghanistan voice their sadness over deaths in America and hope that America does not attack \nAfghanistan, exerts complete patience and accuracy and investigates the issue in its totality. The ulema of \nAfghanistan demand of America that the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Conference investigate \nindependently and precisely the recent events to clarify the reality and prevent harassment of innocent people. The \nU.N. and the OIC deliberate over the utterances of America's president who has said that this war will be a crusade. \n\n\n\nThis news has hurt the feelings of Muslims and has posed a major threat to the world. In order to avoid the current \ntumult and also similar suspicion in the future, the high council of the honorable ulema recommends to the Islamic \nEmirate to persuade Osama bin Laden to leave Afghanistan whenever possible ... and chose another place for \nhimself. If in the light of the above-mentioned decisions, America does not agree and attacks Afghanistan, then, in \nthe light of the sacred Shariah [law] the following verdict is presented: All books of our religious persuasion say that \nif infidels attack the soil of a Muslim country, jihad (holy war) becomes an order for the Muslims of that country ... If \ninfidels invade an Islamic country and that country does not have the ability to defend itself, jihad becomes an \nobligation on all Muslims. If at the time of America's attack, any Muslim, whether an Afghan or non-Afghan, \ncooperates with infidels, becomes an accomplice or a spy, that person is also punishable with death like the foreign \ninvaders.\"\n\nThe same day, President Bush delivered a multipronged ultimatum to the Taliban: \"Deliver to U.S. authorities all the \nleaders of Al-Qaida that hide in your land. Release all foreign nationals including American citizens you have \nunjustly imprisoned. Protect all journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country. Close immediately and \npermanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and hand over every terrorist and every person in their \nsupport structure to appropriate authorities. Give the US full access to terrorist training camps so we make sure \nthey are no longer operating.\" These demands, he assured the Taliban and the world, were non-negotiable.\n\nBy the beginning of October, the United States and the United Kingdom were finalizing their evidence against bin \nLaden. President Bush had successfully arranged for the freezing of assets in 50 suspected terrorists' bank \naccounts, totaling $6 million. More than 400 people had been arrested and another 150 sought in 25 different \ncountries. Britain announced it had frozen $90 million in assets attached to the Taliban.\n\nOn Sunday, October 7, Bush announced attacks had begun on Al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. Forty \ncountries, most notably the United Kingdom, supported the attacks called Operation Enduring Freedom with \nvarying degrees of contributions. Bush reiterated the attacks were \"carefully targeted\" to \"cut the military capability \nof the Taliban regime.\" He added, \"by destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more \ndifficult for the terror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans.\"\n\nBush warned the attacks in Afghanistan were only phase one. \"Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is \nbroader. Every nation has a choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors \nthe outlaws and killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves ... And they will take \nthat lonely path at their own peril.\"\n\nTo confirm the allied attacks were against the Taliban and not against Islamic or Afghan people, the president \nrevealed that, simultaneously with the assaults, allied planes would be dropping food, medicine and supplies to the \nstarving people of Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough Afghanistan was freed from the Taliban and a new interim government installed, several strategic experts \nnote that as of 2005 and well into 2006, Afghanistan has fallen back into warlordism.  Violence has been on the rise \nand long-term stability has been highly compromised.  Extended United States' involvement in this country has \nbeen ongoing yet many say that the level of engagement is not sufficient to assure peace and security.\n\nIn August 2007, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was in the United States to meet with President George W. Bush.  \nThe meeting was regarded as a \"strategy session\" regarding the resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida in Aghanistan.  To \nthat end, the United States pledged $10 billion in funds aimed at strengthening Afghan security forces and also \ncompelling positive results.  But on the other side of the equation, the Afghan leader wanted to discuss the rising \n\n\n\nnumber of civilians dying as a result of military operations by coalition forces.  As well, Karzai was expected to ask \nBush to place pressure on Pakistan to intensify its efforts to curb cross-border extremist fighters.  In the background \nof these two sets of objectives has been the issue of Iran.  Whereas the United States has expressed anxiety about \nIran possible involvement in the supply of weapons to the Taliban, Afghanistan has cast Iraq as an ally in its \ncauses.  To that end, Karzai was reported to have characterized Iran as \"a supporter of Afghanistan, in the peace \nprocess that we have and the fight against terror.\"\n\nMeanwhile in 2006, former President Bill Clinton said on Fox News that he had done far more in his years in office \nto try to catch and kill Osama bin Laden -- the person at the core of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks --  as \ncompared with the Bush administration.\n\nThe Obama administration, which took office in 2009, has reconcentrated efforts against extremists in Afghanistan \nas well as the wider region including Pakistan.\n\n\"Axis of Evil\"\n\nOn the matter of the \"war on terrorism,\" in a national address, Bush identified Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an \n\"axis of evil\" that had to be dealt with. Although each of these three nations cited dispute any accusations \nsuggesting they are involved in terrorist activities, there was domestic support for an attack against Iraq and the \nremoval of Saddam Hussein from office.\n\nMost officials concurred, however, that war on two fronts -- both Afghanistan and Iraq -- was not feasible, while \ninternational allies cautioned against any aggression directed at Iraq. Iran and North Korea were rarely mentioned \nin foreign relations discussions, even though they were featured as parts of the evil triad. But since Iran has begun \na new nuclear program and North Korea restarted its nuclear reactor, these two countries have emerged on the \nglobal landscape.\n\nRecently, relations with those two countries have been driven by the matter of nuclear proliferation.  The United \nStates has for several years participated in multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear program, however, only in \n2006 has something been realized from those discussions.  Since then, however, efforst have largely stalled, as \ndiscussed elsewhere in this Country Review.\n\nThe United States' attempts to place sanctions on Iran for its nuclear work has also seen largely unsuccessful \nresults with most of the international community unwilling to take an immediate  hardline approach with another \nMiddle Eastern country so soon after Iraq. Please see below for further details.\n\nSome analysts have argued that the nuclear drive by Iran and North Korea, as well as the failed attempts to deal \nwith the nuclear programs in those countries, have been a direct result of their unfortunate inclusion in Bush's \"axis \nof evil.\" That said, the early period of the Obama administration has not seen an improvement in the climate of \nrelations, and nuclear development continues to be on the agenda for both countries, to the grave consternation of \nthe United States.\n\nWar in Iraq\n\n\n\nIn regard to Iraq, any movement on the matter was stalled due to complications regarding the Palestinian-Israeli \nconflict. Most Arab governments made it clear to the Bush administration that they would not support any \naggression against Iraq, or more particularly, its leadership, until the issue of Palestinian sovereignty was dealt with. \nMoreover, most European and Westernized countries, which support the general war on terrorism, were less \nenthused about aggression against Iraq. Although some voices in the United States advocated a \"go it alone\" \nattitude in the case of Iraq, other suggested that global cooperation would be a preferential path.\n\nNevertheless, the United States went to war with Iraq in 2003 without a new United Nations resolution, in a loose \ncoalition with a few other countries. Iraq is now under United States \"occupation\" and will remain as such for the \nforeseeable future. A new United Nations Security Council Resolution was passed to allow assistance from other \ncountries.\n\nThe failure to find the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction -- the primary impetus for invading Iraq -- \nas well as the policy of unilateral pre-emption have created divisions across the global spectrum.  Whereas the \nBush administration has insisted that action in Iraq was part of the global war on terrorism, and even as Vice \nPresident Cheney has expressly stated that there was a direct connection between the terrorist attacks in 2001 and \nthe Iraq regime, detractors have said that the two are unrelated. Indeed, a commission convened in regard to the \nevents of September 11, 2001 stated that there was no explicit relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaida \nand the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.  This finding has served only to further divisions leaving the issue of \nIraq, now under occupation by United States-led forces (even though nominal sovereignty exists), as one of the \nmost controversial in modern history.\n\nPlease see \"Political Conditions of Country Review: United States\" for more information about the Iraq War and the \nBush administration's policy on Iraq to date.  See below and the \"Political Conditions\" for policy shifts taken by \nthe Obama administration.\n\nThe Middle East Conflict\n\nA somewhat more distanced policy has emerged concerning the Middle East, a long-troubled region in which \nUnited States (U.S.) diplomatic involvement has been pervasive and in which deteriorating political conditions and \nescalating violence have been the pattern in late 2000 and early 2001. Bush administration spokespersons and the \npresident himself have implicitly criticized the marathon Israeli-Palestinian negotiating sessions repeatedly arranged \nby former President Clinton as overreaching attempts to impose a solution on the conflict. Such an attempted \nimposition, according to the current administration, paid too little heed to actual conditions. The U.S. government \nsignaled it would refrain from detailed participation in Middle East negotiations, since in the administration's view, \nthe parties in conflict can neither reach agreement at this time nor viably uphold any agreement.\n\nA significant shift occurred in the early months of 2002, however, as the conflict in the region exploded and \ndomestic and international pressure mounted for further U.S. involvement. Indeed, even domestically, criticism \nmounted in regard to the Bush administration's marked lack of involvement in resolving the crisis. In the face of \ncritical comments on the matter, the Bush administration has reluctantly found itself playing a more integral role, \nand trying to strike a difficult balance between Israeli and Palestinian interests and causes. As such, increased \nengagement has not been smooth or imbued by congruity. In fact, the Bush administration was also criticized for \nespousing a rather incoherent message to both Israel and Palestine.\n\nIn general, the perceived incoherence may well be attributable to opposed factions within Bush's own cabinet. It is \nwell-known that former Secretary of State Colin Powell takes a more integrative and engaged approach to global \nissues, preferring  coalitions and international consultancy. In contrast, former National Security Advisor and current \n\n\n\nSecretary of State  Condoleezza Rice, along with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and other individuals such \nas Paul Wolfowitz, are known for their more hawkish and \"go it alone\" stances to international matters. Some \nanalysts surmised that as the situation in the Middle East cooled, Bush and his foreign policy team would have \ntime to coordinate a more cohesive approach, not only in regard to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, \nbut also related regional matters, such as a possible attack on Iraq.  Such an outcome was not to come to pass.\n\nThe establishment of the \"roadmap to peace\" initiated by the Bush administration in 2003 started off with cautious \noptimism but by the latter part of 2003 was in dire jeopardy.  In 2005, the decision by Israel to withdraw from the \nWest Bank and Gaza contributed to a cooling of violence, however, it also has rendered United States participation \nin the peace process to be marginal, at best.  The 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah \ndemonstrated the profound lack of influence by the United States in this arena, while its attention remained focused \non Iraq.\n\nThe Obama administration, which took office in 2009, has made clear that it intends to work toward establishing \nsustainable peace in the Middle East.  To that end, the United States has expressed strong support for a two-state \nsolution, as discussed below.\n\nMeanwhile, United States support for Israel remains strong and the United States has repeatedly exercised its veto \npower in the United Nations Security Council to prevent passage of resolutions condemning Israel for impeding \nfreedom of movement for Palestinians and their economy. The United States is Israel's paramount military supplier \nand donor of military aid. Since the late 1970s, it has counterbalanced this flow by also supplying large amounts of \nmilitary aid to Egypt and by increasing arms sales to other allies in the Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait. Israel and Egypt are, respectively, the largest and second-largest recipients of United States foreign aid \nwhen both military and civilian sectors are included.\n\nIn July 2009, United States Vice-President Joe Biden said in an interview with ABC News that has  the Obama \nadministration would not stop  Israel from striking Iranian nuclear facilities.  Biden said that the United States would \nnot  \"dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do.\"  Biden also said  that President Barack \nObama's overture  of engagement with Iran remained on the table.  That offer for talks would end at the close of \n2009.  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that his country would deal with the \nnuclear threat posed by Iran, if the government in Tehran was unwilling to enter negotiations.  For its part, Iran has \nsaid that it would guarantee a strong response if its facilities were attacked by Israel.\n\nRegional Relations\n\nCanada\n\nThe United States' relationship with Canada, its neighbor to the north, is perhaps the closest and most extensive \nbetween any two countries. More than $US1 billion in daily trade crosses the countries' shared border, the longest \nopen border in the world. Movement of people between the United States and Canada is at the rate of about 100 \nmillion individual crossings each year. The two countries are also each other's principal foreign investors.\n\nSince the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, entered into force in 1994, merchandise trade among \nthe United States, Canada and Mexico has approximately doubled. The majority of U.S.-Canada trade takes place \nperfectly smoothly, though bilateral trade disputes, mainly over agricultural goods and forest products, sporadically \narise. Usually, these issues are resolved through bilateral consultative forums or referral to the World Trade \nOrganization or NAFTA dispute-resolution panels. The highest-value entry in the U.S.-Canada trade ledger is for \nvehicles and parts. Energy products - oil and, increasingly, natural gas - represent another important category of \n\n\n\nCanadian exports to the United States. In fact, the United States purchases more energy from Canada than from \nany other single nation, including more than two trillion cubic feet of natural gas yearly, 12 percent of its natural gas \nrequirement.\n\nFear of possible disruptions of 2000 millennium celebrations, underscored by the December 1999 arrest of an \nAlgerian national found with explosives in Washington state after crossing the border from Canada, heightened \nconcerns about cross-border security and anti-terrorism cooperation. The United States and Canada have since \nlaunched a cooperative endeavor called the Border Vision Initiative to scrutinize trans-border movement more \nclosely. The program authorized U.S. customs agents to pre-clear U.S.-bound passengers from Canadian airports \nand also launched a so-called smart card pilot project in which Canadians who regularly travel to the United States \nfor employment or commerce are to be issued special passes with a magnetized electronic strip resembling a credit \ncard. The cards will facilitate more convenient passage for their holders but also enable officials to monitor \ncrossings exactly. Despite this emphasis on tighter security, the U.S.-Canada border is far more a link than a \nbarrier, bearing witness to a long history of friendship and openness between the two countries.\n\nThe United States maintains more detailed and far-reaching defense arrangements with Canada than with any \nother country. The Permanent Joint Board on Defense, established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on \ndefense matters. The United States and Canada share NATO mutual security commitments. In addition, Canadian \nand U.S. military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within the framework of the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command. Although Canada views its relationship with the its southern neighbor as \ncrucial to a wide range of interests, it also occasionally pursues policies at odds with the United States. This is \nparticularly true of Canada's refusal to endorse the U.S. embargo on trade, travel and investment in Cuba.\n\nCanada and the United States signed an upgraded aviation agreement in 1995, and air traffic between the two \ncountries has since increased substantially. They jointly operate the St. Lawrence Seaway, connecting the Great \nLakes to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe two countries also work closely to resolve cross-border environmental issues, an area of increasing importance \nin the bilateral relationship. A principal instrument of this cooperation is the International Joint Commission, or IJC, \nestablished under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972 marked \nanother milestone in the joint effort to control cross-border water pollution. The two governments consult \nsemiannually on trans-boundary air pollution. Under steps resulting from the 1991 Air Quality Agreement, both \ncountries have significantly remediated acid rain levels.\n\nCanada and the United States also have resolved several major issues involving fisheries. By common agreement, \nthe two countries submitted a Gulf of Maine boundary dispute to the International Court of Justice in 1981 and both \naccepted the court's 1984 ruling demarcating the territorial sea boundary. In 1990, the United States and Canada \nsigned a bilateral Fisheries Enforcement Agreement that has served to deter illegal fishing activity and reduce the \nrisk of injury during fisheries enforcement incidents. The successful signing of the Pacific Salmon Treaty in 1985, \nhowever, has been tempered by difficulties in negotiating multiyear extensions of its constituent fisheries regimes.\n\nWhile Canada supported United States military efforts in Afghanistan following the terrorist attacks of 2001, \nCanada was an opponent of the United States' decision to invade Iraq.  In 2005, the Liberal government of \nCanada's policy was maintained as regards Iraq.  In 2006, the election of the Conservative government in Canada \nwas expected to result in a more cooperative relationship between the two countries.  That Conservative \ngovernment was re-elected in 2008 only a month ahead of Barack Obama's election as the new president of the \nUnited States.  It was yet to be seen if the incoming Obama administration would signal a shift of foreign policy as \nregards Canada.\n\nMexico\n\n\n\nMexico emerged from more than seven decades of one-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, when \nVicente Fox of the National Action Party was elected president in July 2000. Observers universally lauded the vote \nas the freest and fairest in the nation's history. When Fox was inaugurated at the beginning of December, the \noutcome of the United States' controversial presidential election was still being disputed. Thus, in an odd twist, the \nneighboring countries' new chief executives entered office in a sort of role reversal with regard to their respective \nelectoral groundings. President Fox was a personal friend of incoming United States (U.S.) President George W. \nBush, who as Texas governor administered the state with the longest boundary adjoining Mexico and who declined \nto endorse anti-immigrant positions taken by other political leaders in the Republican Party.\n\nMexico, along with Canada and the United States, joined NAFTA at its 1994 inception. It has experienced a \nbumpier integration into the free trade regime, though, than the two other countries. A 1994-1995 financial crisis \nnecessitated a severe devaluation of the Mexican peso, and the Mexican populace have not yet fully recovered \ntheir previous buying power. NAFTA-related disputes crop up recurrently in regard to cross-border environmental \nissues, mostly connected to factories called \"maquiladoras\" that have opened along the Mexican side of the U.S.-\nMexico border. These plants, in many cases U.S.-owned, generally import and assemble components and re-export \nfinished consumer goods, for instance, portable radios and other light electronics. The presence of the factories has \nencouraged the explosive growth of semi-improvised communities of laborers from the maquiladora plants that lack \nproper infrastructure and are blamed for pollution such as raw sewage that affects both sides of the border.\n\nIn addition, the factories themselves are cited by environmentalists for failing to comply with Mexico's comparatively \nlenient limits on air pollutants and toxic waste. The degree to which international trade programs can or should \nmove countries closer to generalized standards of environmental regulation and labor practices stands as one of \nthe most hotly debated issues of the new century. Although workers in the border-town Mexican maquilas often \nearn as little as the equivalent of $10 per day, this sum is more than double the prevalent daily wage in rural \nsouthern Mexico - on the days when scarce paid work is even available.\n\nOne of the more heated current controversies related to NAFTA involves attempts by U.S. truck drivers to keep \nMexican trucks from traveling freely across the United States. At present, regulations require Mexican truckers to \ntransfer their loads to domestic carriers within a circumscribed area just across the border, on its face a violation of \nthe free-trade agreement, which ostensibly regards production and commerce originating in any of the three NAFTA \ncountries as fully equivalent to the analogous production and commerce from either of the other two. In this dispute, \nthe Teamsters Union and U.S.-based independent owner-operators oppose open entry for the Mexican trucks, \nciting concerns these vehicles may not meet U.S. safety standards. Another consideration is apprehension that \nopen access for considerably lower-paid Mexican drivers could dampen the pay scale for U.S. truckers and perhaps \neliminate a portion of U.S.-based hauling jobs outright. U.S. trucking firms, as distinguished from truck drivers, are \nmore amenable to opening U.S. roads to Mexican trucks, in part because the mandated load transfers generate \nsubstantial congestion and delays.\n\nWhen President Fox met with President Bush on Feb. 16, 2001, he noted Mexico's desire for its trucks to be \nadmitted throughout the United States and said the issue should be straightforward to resolve in Mexico's favor \nunder terms of NAFTA. President Fox said only trucks meeting U.S. safety standards should be admitted and such \nan agreement would also open new opportunities for U.S.-based trucks hauling to Mexico.\n\nSince 1981, management of a broad array of issues between the two countries has been formalized in the U.S.-\nMexico Bi-National Commission, composed of selected U.S. Cabinet members and their Mexican counterparts. The \ncommission holds annual plenary meetings, and subgroups meet at other times to discuss numerous subjects, \nincluding trade and investment opportunities, financial cooperation, consular issues and migration, legal affairs and \nanti-narcotics cooperation, cultural relations, education, energy, border affairs, environmental and natural \nresources, labor, agriculture, health, housing and urban development, transportation, fisheries, tourism, science and \ntechnology.\n\n\n\nThe overriding strains on the generally friendly relationship between the United States and Mexico arise from flows \nof illegal immigrants and illicit drugs. Mexico points out that demand for both the low-cost labor that the immigrants \nprovide and for the drugs originates in the United States. President Fox, during his brief tenure in office so far, has \nemphasized he considers the people from Mexico or of Mexican heritage living in the United States, whether legally \nor illegally, an asset for both countries that merits respect. He has said he would like to see border policy \ntransformed into an open system in which Mexicans can seek work in the United States without loss of citizenship \nstatus and without fear of deportation. This utopian prospect is not realizable in the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, some easing of border restrictions may eventually happen, perhaps in the form of an ample quota of work \npermits for Mexicans seeking employment in the United States or possibly through another amnesty program \nsimilar to one implemented in 1986, when illegal Mexican immigrants who could show they had lived and worked for \nseveral years continuously in the United States were allowed to become legal U.S. residents.\n\nIn 1996, the United States and Mexico established a High-Level Contact Group on narcotics control. Other \nagreements and policy statements on U.S.-Mexico counter-narcotics cooperation followed. The U.S. Congress has \ncodified a practice requiring annual certification of a country's compliance with U.S. standards in its actions against \ndrug trafficking for it to continue normal business dealings with the United States and to be eligible for U.S. aid. \nMexico regards the certification process as a debasing infringement of sovereignty, as do other Latin American \ncountries affected by the policy. The only time decertification with its stipulated sanctions was ever used was \nagainst Colombia in 1996. While members of the U.S. Congress have criticized Mexico quite vociferously for \nmaking insufficient progress in stemming the narcotics trade, the decertification mechanism has not been invoked in \nits case, a demurral probably based on the observation that drug runners benefited at l east as much as anyone \nelse the one time such a move was tried. President Fox, like his predecessors, has pledged Mexico's full resolve to \ninvestigate and prosecute those trafficking in illicit drugs but acknowledged lack of resources and corruption making \nthe effort difficult.\n\nCooperation between the United States and Mexico along their 2,000-mile common border includes state and local \nproblem-solving mechanisms, transportation planning and institutions to address resource and environmental \nissues. In 1993, the Border Liaison Mechanism, or BLM, was established. Eight BLMs, chaired by U.S. and \nMexican consuls, now operate in border-pair cities, each with subgroups on economic and social development, \nmigration and border crossing facilitation and border public safety. In addition, the multi-agency U.S.-Mexico Bi-\nNational Group on Bridges and Border Crossings meets twice yearly to improve the efficiency of existing crossings \nand coordinate planning for new ones.\n\nVarious channels exist for bilateral cooperation on environmental and natural resource issues. Agreements forming \nthe framework in which the two countries work in this area include the 1889 convention that established the \nInternational Boundary Commission, reconstituted by the Water Treaty of 1944 as the International Boundary and \nWater Commission, the 1983 La Paz Agreement and the 1993 North American Agreement on Environmental \nCooperation, which created a trinational U.S.-Mexico-Canada commission to address environmental issues under \nNAFTA auspices.\n\nMany difficult boundary and water issues have been dealt with through the International Boundary and Water \nCommission, which has an authoritative role in regulating and allocating the water of the Rio Grande River, a much-\ndemanded, indeed oversubscribed resource in a dry region. After border infrastructure and pollution problems came \nto the fore in the wake of economic activity spurred by NAFTA, joint programs utilizing U.S. financing and \nsometimes directing U.S. grants to improve wastewater treatment plants, drinking water systems and solid waste \ndisposal facilities on the Mexican side have taken shape. Other environmental pacts signed by Mexico and the \nUnited States cover wildlife and migratory birds, national parks, forests and marine and atmospheric resources.\n\n\n\nThe United States and Mexico maintain full diplomatic and official contact as well as extensive commercial, cultural \nand educational ties. Annual legal crossings from Mexico to the United States number nearly 290 million. More than \n500,000 American citizens live in Mexico, including both professionals and many retirees taking advantage of the \nfavorable cost differential south of the border that enables them to live very comfortably on modest Social Security \nstipends. More than 2,600 U.S. companies have operations in Mexico, a figure projected to rise steadily. The United \nStates accounts for 60 percent of all foreign direct investment in Mexico. Moreover, as the recently released 2000 \nU.S. Census demonstrates, Hispanics - though many are not of Mexican heritage - are the fastest-growing ethnic \ngroup in the United States. Surely this foretells increasingly close Mexican-U.S. engagement.\n\nIn 2005, one of the most contentious issues related to bilateral relations concerns the illegal immigration of \nMexicans across the border into the United States. It has continued to be a politically-charged issue.  In 2006, the \nimmigration issue was also a significant concern with many conservative politicians in the United States \nforegrounding the matter in the mid-term elections.  In 2007, the issue continued to occur in the political purview.  \nIronically, Republican President Bush and the Democrats shared some common ideas for  carving legislation that \nwould include both enforcement of the border, as well as a guest worker program, and the possibility of offering \nundocumented foreign workers a path to legal status.  Such a plan was in direct contravention to Republicans' \npreference for a strong enforcement regime, which would criminalize undocumented workers.\n\nBush and the Democrats never made any progress on the issue of immigration reform in the final year of the \nRepublican president's administration.\n\nBy 2008, Barack Obama had been elected the new president of the United States and made clear that immigration \nreform that embraced both border control and humane treatment of illegal immigrants would be part of the policy \nchanges to be implemented.\n\nIn  2009, United States (U.S.) and Mexican officials agreed to work together to fight the drug cartels said to be \nresponsible for a spate of brutal violence in Mexico close to the border with the United States. That brutal violence \nwas taking on crisis proportions. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier acknowledged that her \ncountry was providing the market for the illegal sale of drugs, as well as the weapons used to carry out the violence \nby rival drug cartels. Since then, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and U.S. Attorney General \nEric Holder met with their counterparts, Interior Minister Fernando Gomez-Mont, Mexican Attorney General \nEduardo Medina-Mora, as well as Public Safety Secretary Genaro Garcia Luna. The officials said they would soon \nname a group to develop strategies for stopping the cross-border flow of weapons and drugs. The two sides also \nhoped to advance an agreement that could potentially be signed when U.S. President Barack Obama visits \nMexican President Felipe Calderon at the end of April 2009.\n\nCuba\n\nThe United States' most antagonistic hemispheric relationship is with the communist government of Cuba led by \nFidel Castro. The history of tensions between the two countries has been highlighted by episodes including: the Bay \nof Pigs invasion in April 1961, an abortive attempt to oust Castro; the October 1962 confrontation with the Soviet \nUnion over nuclear missiles based in Cuba; United States (U.S.) displeasure at Cuba's use of its military forces, \nsometimes in large numbers, to assist leftist revolutions in Africa and Latin America; and, in response to one such \nCuban venture on the small Caribbean island of Grenada, a U.S. invasion in 1983 to remove a Cuban-backed junta. \nAfter property in Cuba owned by U.S. citizens was expropriated after the revolution, the United States began \nimposing economic sanctions. It severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961, and the comprehensive \neconomic embargo still in place dates from 1962. In the mid-1970s, however, the United States and Cuba agreed \n\n\n\nto resume diplomatic contact at the sub-ambassadorial level. The United States and Cuba maintain interest \nsections under the auspices of Switzerland's embassies in Havana and Washington, respectively.\n\nIn October 1992, the United States enacted the Cuban Democracy Act (CDA), codifying portions of the embargo \nwhile counterbalancing these with certain provisions stated to extend support of the Cuban people, including \nimproved telecommunications and the sale of medicines. The CDA bars most U.S. corporations, their subsidiaries, \nand U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations from trade with Cuba and excludes an y vessel that stops in Cuba \nfrom entering U.S. ports for 180 days, while providing for humanitarian donations by U.S. non-governmental \norganizations to Cuba.\n\nMigration from Cuba to the United States, encouraged by the large Cuban exile community in south Florida and \nintermittently tacitly promoted by U.S. policy, is another source of tension between the two nations. The so-called \nMariel boatlift in April 1980 resulted in about 125,000 Cubans reaching U.S. shores. Since the early 1990s and \nformally codified when the President Clinton signed the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1996, U.S. policy on \nunauthorized emigration from Cuba is to admit those who succeed in reaching the United States but to intercept \nCubans trying to reach the United States when detected at sea and return them to Cuba. Cuba agrees not to take \npunitive action against such returnees, a commitment verified through the U.S. interest section in Havana. Persons \npicked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard who can demonstrate they would face political prosecution if repatriated \nto Cuba are resettled in a third country. Moreover, the United States and Cuba have established a yearly quota of \nabout 20,000 for legal immigration from the island. This number is such a small fraction of the Cubans who wish to \nemigrate that there is a years-long waiting list of applications.\n\nIn 1994, regular immigration talks were initiated between the United States and Cuba, prompted by another mass \nexodus of Cubans that summer. The two governments agreed in September 1994 to direct Cuban migration into \nsafe, legal, and orderly channels. Under a May 1995 agreement, the United States began returning Cubans \ninterdicted at sea or entering the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nU.S.-Cuban relations worsened in 1996, occasioned by Cuban suppression of an umbrella human rights group on \nthe island called \"Concilio Cubano,\" followed by the shooting down of two civilian aircraft in international airspace \nnear Cuba. The planes were operated by the Miami-based Cuban exile organization Brothers to the Rescue. Four \nmembers of the group-three U.S. citizens and one legal permanent resident-were killed in this attack by Cuban MiG \nfighter jets. Directly after this incident, President Clinton ordered punitive measures against Cuba, including \nsuspension of charter flights. He announced that he sought to reach agreement with the U.S. Congress on already-\npending legislation that would codify a harder anti-Castro policy. On March 12, 1996, President Clinton signed this \nlegislation, an enactment generally call ed the Helms-Burton Act and formally entitled the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity (or \"Libertad\") Act. Its main provisions are:\n\nTitle I codifies and tightens enforcement of the U.S. embargo.\n\nTitle II states U.S. policy toward a transition or democratic government in Cuba-a legislative elaboration of the \npolicy position frequently expressed by the U.S. that the United States is fully committed to support of the Cuban \npeople, as distinguished from the Cuban government.\n\nTitle III creates a cause of action and authorizes U.S. nationals with claims to confiscated property in Cuba to file \nsuit in U.S. courts against people \"trafficking\" in such property. However, President Clinton later suspended this \nprovision's authorization of lawsuits.\n\n\n\nTitle IV requires the Executive Branch to deny visas to, and exclude from the United States, foreign nationals \ndetermined to have confiscated or \"trafficked\" in confiscated property claimed by an U.S. national. This is the most \ncontroversial clause in Helms-Burton, since non-U.S.-based firms are penalized by the U.S. for doing business with \nCuba that is perfectly legal under the laws of their own country. The European Union and other nations and \ninternational organizations have repeatedly voiced protests against the reach of this measure.\n\nOn March 20, 1998, President Clinton announced measures intended to respond to the historic visit of Pope John \nPaul II to Cuba in January of that year. The measures included: resuming direct humanitarian charter cargo and \npassenger flights to Cuba; allowing legal remittances by Cuban-Americans and Cuban families living in the United \nStates to their close relatives in Cuba at the level of $300 per quarter (such remittances were suspended in August \n1994 in response to the migration crisis); and simplifying and expedi ting the issuance of licenses for the sale of \nmedicines and medical supplies to Cuba. Clinton also said he would work with Congress to develop bipartisan \nlegislation on the transfer of food and expansion of humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people.\n\nIn the wake of the Elian Gonzalez custody matter (the Cuban child whose mother died while trying to migrate to the \nUnited States and whose father in Cuba wanted the child returned to his custody), speculation abounded regarding \na shift in policy between Cuba and the United States. Various legislative bills seeking to end or soften the \neconomic embargo and sanctions were drafted, and the pace of lobbying by a number of groups pressing for \nchanges in United States political and economic policy toward Cuba picked up. In late 2000, the U.S. Congress \npassed a bill that formally ended the embargo with respect to sales of food and medicine/medical supplies to Cuba. \nHowever, the absence of a financing mechanism whereby the Cuban government can obtain credit for such \ntransactions means that the legislative change has very little practical consequence.\n\nThe aftermath of Cuba's downing of the two Brothers to the Rescue aircraft had recent repercussions stemming \nfrom a wrongful death lawsuit against Cuba, filed in the United States court system by relatives of the men killed \nand initially ruled on in 1997, with a decision in favor of the plaintiffs. In October 2000 the United States Congress \nenacted a measure allowing part of the US$187.7 million settlement awarded in this case to be drawn from US$121 \nmillion in Cuban assets previously frozen in the United States. In response, Cuba announced a 10 percent \nsurcharge on incoming telephone calls from the United States, and after United States telecommunications carriers \nrefused to comply, citing lack of authorization, direct long-distance phone service between Cuba and the United \nStates was suspended. On President Clinton's last full day in office in January 2001, he issued an executive order \nreleasing a payment of US$96.7 million from the frozen Cuban funds to the Miami relatives.\n\nIn May 2002, former United States President Jimmy Carter traveled to Cuba for a trip scheduled to last for five \ndays. Carter was the first U.S. President to visit the communist Caribbean island since 1959 when Washington cut \nties with Havana. Upon his arrival, Carter promised that during his visit, he would focus on issues concerning \npeace, democracy, human rights and the allevation of suffering. Indeed, he was scheduled to meet two key Cuban \ndissidents on the issue of human rights in this regard.\n\nIn the midst of accusations by the U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton that Cuba would like to develop \nbiological weapons, Castro adamantly denied the claims and permitted full and complete access for Carter at \nCuba's biotechnology sites, noting that they have been used to produce only medicine and vaccines. Various \nvoices from within the U.S. governmen t and the Bush administration, however, contend that such facilities are \nthreats to U.S. national security. During his trip, Carter also delivered a historic speech in the form of a live televised \naddress to the people of Cuba via the national (state-controlled) media. Carter's address is unprecedented in the \nrecent history of relations between the U.S. and Cuba since the revolution.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Carter has charted a far different approach to U.S.-Cuban relations than other U.S.. presidents. \nSpecifically, he has been forthright in his opposition against U.S. sanctions on Cuba. During his time in office, he \nactively pursued a policy of rapprochement between the two countries, overseeing the re-establishment of \ndiplomatic relations, negotiating the release of thousands of political prisoners, and relaxing a ban on travel by US \ncitizens to Cuba.\n\nIn contrast, the Bush administration intended to further tighten the economic embargo -- in place since 1961 -- and \nit also added Cuba to the list of states it accuses of supporting terrorism.\n\nThe 2008 election of Barack Obama in the United States as president augured the policy of relaxed restrictions \nregarding Cuba.\n\nTo that end, in  April 2009, the Obama administration in the United States decided to ease restrictions on Cuban \nAmericans traveling to or sending remittances to relatives in Cuba.  Under the previous Bush administration, Cuba \nAmericans were permitted to travel to Cuba only once every three years and there were strict restrictions on how \nmuch money they could spend or send to relatives in Cuba.  Since the average salary in Cuba is $20USD a month, \nsuch remittances provide much-needed income for many Cubans.\n\nAnother policy adjustment involved allowing telecommunications companies to do business in Cuba.  Such access \ncould include fiber-optic cables, which would impact Internet access.  It was yet to be seen if the Cuban government \nwould allow United States companies to procure licenses to operate in Cuba.  However, were such a change to \ntake place, the exchange of information could have manifold effects.\n\nWith these changes afoot, members of Congress were now looking toward legislation that would life the travel ban \non all Americans traveling to Cuba.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that her country's policy toward Cuba -- based on \nthe notion of isolation -- has failed.  To that end, some analysts suggested that the Obama administration's stance \nof engagement (vis a vis isolation) was being applied across the board, and was also being applied to Cuba.  \nUnited States President Barack Obama explained that the policy shift was ultimately aimed at bringing greater \nfreedom to Cuba.  He said., \"There are no better ambassadors for freedom than Cuban Americans.\"  But both  \nPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton  noted that Cuba must make steps toward democracy and improving \nhuman rights.  Such steps would include freeing political prisoners and cutting fees on remittances sent from Cuban \nAmericans in the United States.\n\nThe Obama administration's  announcement on Cuban policy was made ahead of the Summit of the Americas in \nTrinidad.  There, at the opening ceremony of the summit,  President Obama addressed the United States-Cuban \nrelations saying, \"The United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba.\"  It was the most significant opening for \nbilateral relations in decades.\n\nCuba, which has been suspended from the Organization of Americans States (OAS) for decades due to its non-\ndemocratic status, became the dominant issue at the summit.  Most OAS member states support Cuba's return to \nthe body, regarding its exile from the body to be a throwback to the Cold War era.  United States policy toward \nCuba has been an enduring sticking point.\n\n\n\nCuban President Raul Castro, who has advanced  limited reforms since succeeding Fidel Castro, indicated \nopenness to discussions with the United States, saying that all issues -- including political prisoners and human \nrights -- were on the table for debate.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, United States President Barack Obama extended the 47-year-long trade embargo on \nCuba for one year. He said, \"I hereby determine that the continuation for one year of the exercise of those \nauthorities with respect to Cuba is in the national interest of the United States.\"  This move to extend the 1917 \nTrading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) with regard to Cuba was undertaken despite an earlier vow to seek a new \nbeginning in the United States-Cuba relations.\n\nAs noted above,  at the Fifth Summit of the Americas, held in Trinidad and Tobago earlier in the year, President \nObama said that he hoped bilateral relations could move in \"a new direction.\" The extension of the embargo was \nviewed by some as a contradiction of this promise.  That said, President Obama has directed his administration to \nease restrictions on travel as well as the transfer of money by Cuban-Americans to Cuba.  President Obama also \nauthorized American companies to enter into limited Cuban commercial arenas, such as the telecommunication and \nsatellite television markets.  He explained that such a move would held advance freedom and self-determination in \nCuba, which would -- by extension -- be in the national  interest of the United States.\n\nVenezuela\n\nUnited States (U.S.) relations with Venezuela have traditionally been close, with a strong mutual commitment to \ndemocracy. Venezuela has been a major supplier of foreign oil to the U.S. market.  Key U.S. interests in Venezuela \ninclude promotion of U.S. exports and protection of U.S. investment; continuation of the economic reform program; \npreservation of Venezuela's constitutional democracy; closer counter narcotics cooperation; and continued access \nto a leading source of petroleum.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of this bilateral relationship, President Clinton's October 1997 visit launched a \n\"Partnership for the 21st Century\" to promote common solutions for energy development, trade and investment, and \nprotection of the environment, as well as a strategic alliance against crime and drug trafficking.\n\nThe United States is Venezuela's most important trading partner, representing approximately half of both imports \nand exports. In turn, Venezuela is the United States' third-largest export market in Latin America, purchasing U.S. \nmachinery, transportation equipment, agricultural commodities and auto parts. Venezuela's opening of its petroleum \nsector to foreign investment in 1996 created extensive trade and investment opportunities for U.S. companies.\n\nNew legislation is expected to open up investment opportunities in natural gas and mining. The Department of State \nis committed to promoting the interests of U.S. companies in overseas markets.\n\nVenezuela is a minor source country for opium poppy and coca but a major transit country for cocaine and heroin. \nMoney laundering and judicial corruption are major concerns. The United States is working with Venezuela to \ncombat drug trafficking. In 2000, the United States gave $700,000 for counter narcotics assistance and about \n$400,000 for Venezuelan participants in the International Military Education and Training Program. There is no \nUSAID or Peace Corps mission in Venezuela.\n\n\n\nApproximately 23,000 U.S. citizens living in Venezuela have registered with the U.S. Embassy, an estimated three-\nquarters of them residing in the Caracas area. An estimated 12,000 U.S. tourists visit Venezuela annually. About \n500 U.S. companies are represented in the country, however, some U.S. companies removed some of their U.S. \nnationals working in Venezuela after Chavez won election, and again following the 2002 quasi coup d'etat.\n\nSince coming to power,  the Bush administration has opposed  the close ties shared between the leaders of Cuba \nand Venezuela. In this regard, the quasi-coup d'etat against Chavez that occurred in the spring of 2002 was \nrumored to have been sanctioned by the U.S. While there is no conclusive evidence to prove this allegation, its \nexistence suggests that there have been  real tensions between the two countries.  Indeed, tensions between the \nBush-led United States and Chavez' government in Venezuela continue to date.  Chavez' left-leaning political \nstances, as well as his close relationship with Fidel Castro in Cuba (as noted above), are not viewed positively by \nthe Bush administration.  Meanwhile,  Chavez government does not share the same outlook as the Bush \nadministration on several policy matters.\n\nIn the backdrop of this tense situation has been the fact that the United States seems determined to isolate left-\nleaning Venezuela.  Indeed, United States Secretary of State-designate Condoleezza Rice described the \nVenezuelan government as being a \"negative influence\" on the western hemisphere. In April 2005, Secretary Rice \ncalled for the sale of arms to Venezuela to be monitored.  An unidentified Venezuelan official responded by noting \nthat her statement was an untoward intrusion of Venezuelan sovereignty. For his part, Venezuelan President Hugo \nChavez has described the Bush administration in the United States as having imperialist inclinations.  He has \nalso claimed periodically that the United States has plotted to oust him.  Moreover, he has threatened to stop selling \noil to the United States if that country's interference intensifies.\n\nIn July 2005, Venezuelan prosecutors convened an investigation into the activities of the United States Drug \nEnforcement Administration (DEA). By August 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had accused the DEA of \nusing its agents for purposed of spying. The Venezuela leader said, \"The DEA was using the fight against drug \ntrafficking as a mask, to support drug trafficking, to carry out intelligence in Venezuela against the government.\" In \nresponse, Chavez said that Venezuela would discontinue its agreement to work with the DEA to deal with narcotics \ntrafficking. However, he said that Venezuela would continue to work with other international groups on the matter.\n\nIn August 2005, already-strained relations between Venezuela and the United States were further damaged when \nreligious evangelist, Pat Robertson,  called for the assassination of President Hugo Chavez on his religious \ntelevision broadcast of the \"700 Club.\"  Robertson, a Christian fundamentalist and strong supporter of the Bush \nadministration, said, \"We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that \nability.\"\n\nThe United States  Department of State distanced itself from Robertson's  call for the death of the Venezuelan \nleader by characterizing his comments as \"inappropriate.\"  The department also noted that Roberts' words did not \nreflect the policy of the United States.  Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary of the United States said that \nRobertson's words were that of a private citizen. United States President George W. Bush offered no comment.\n\nOf course, critics of the Bush administration charged that even though Robertson might be a private citizen,  he is \none with a public forum, and one known to be a close ally of the American president. As such, they have said that a \nclear response from the administration is necessitated at a time when bilateral relations have suffered.  In fact, \nthese sentiments were echoed by the Venezuelan government as well. In an address, Bernardo Alvarez, \nVenezuela's Ambassador to the United States said, \"Mr Robertson has been one of this president's staunchest \nallies. His statement demands the strongest condemnation by the White House.\"\n\n\n\nOnly days prior to the conflagration involving Robertson, a Republican Senator of the United States and the \nChairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, sent a letter to the Department of Defense requesting \nimproved relations with Venezuela, for the purpose of working cooperatively to deal with narcotics trafficking.  \nThe Venezuelan government had ceased cooperation with the United States DEA on this issue a month earlier.  In \nhis letter, Specter noted, \"It may well be helpful to, at least, have a moratorium on adverse comments on \nVenezuela.\"\n\nRobertson's  remarks served only to reinforce the perception by the Venezuelan government that it is the target of \nan ongoing campaign of political aggression by Washington, and that it is intended to destabilize the country and \nultimately remove Chavez from office.\n\nIn response, Chavez' government said it was exploring all possible legal options available.  For his part,  President \nChavez said he did not \"even know who that person is\"  when he was informed about Robertson's remarks.  But \nVenezuelan  Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel framed Robertson's words as a \"criminal statement\" and \nchallenged Washington's  response saying that it would  put United States anti-terrorism policy to the test.  In this \nregard Rangel said,  \"It's huge hypocrisy to maintain this discourse against terrorism and at the same time, in the \nheart of that country there are entirely terrorist statements like those.\"\n\nAs the fiasco continued to dominate the media, Robertson responded first by saying  that his remarks were taken \nout of context.  He also claimed he had never called for the actual assassination of Chavez but simply his ousting \nfrom office.  Presumably confronted with the record clearly stating that he had indeed used the word assassination \nin his remarks about Chavez, he subsequently apologized.\n\nThe lack of response from the United States White House, however, prompted the Venezuelan government to say \nthat it was still going to seek legal recourse. On Aug. 29, 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said that if \nWashington failed to take legal measures against Robertson's \"terrorist\" proposal (i.e. calling for the assassination \nof a head of state), then he would take the case to the United Nations and the Organization of American States. \nChavez also said Venezuela would not rule out calling for Robertson's extradition to Venezuela to face charges.\n\nA day later, however, the Venezuelan leader took a different approach and said he would welcome improved \nbilateral ties with the United States.  Standing with American civil rights leader, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Chavez said \nthat he sought to improve relations between the two countries and offered inexpensive heating fuel -- at a 40 \npercent discount --  to impoverished United States residents in anticipation of winter. Chavez also offered food, \npotable water, fuel, and humanitarian aid to the devastated Gulf Coast residents in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina.  After being asked by Jackson to resume work with the DEA on narcotics trafficking, Chavez said he would \nconsider it.\n\nFor  his part, Jackson said the political rhetoric had to stop and noted there was no evidence that Venezuela was a \n\"destabilizing force\" in the hemisphere, as suggested by the Bush administration. Earlier, Jackson, a religious \npastor himself,  condemned Pat Robertson's words.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2005,  addressed the United Nations General Assembly.  In that address, the Venezuelan leader \ncondemned the neo-imperialism, militarism and  unbridled capitalism of the Bush administration in the United \nStates.  He also assailed the United States government for failing to protect the impoverished citizens of New \nOrleans from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As well, he accused the United States of taking a contradictory \n\n\n\nstance on terrorism by failing to condemn the aforementioned calls by Robertson, for Chavez' own assassination. \nOn this issue, Chavez said, \"The only place where a person can ask for another head of state to be assassinated is \nthe United States, which is what happened recently with the Reverend Pat Robertson, a very close friend of the \nWhite House. He publicly asked for my assassination and he's still walking the streets.\"\n\nAfter going past the five-minute limit placed on speakers, he was asked to quickly finish his statement.  In response, \nhe turned to Jan Eliasson of Sweden, the president of the General Assembly, and said, \"I think the president of the \nUnited States spoke for twenty minutes here yesterday. I would ask your indulgence to let me finish my statement.\"\n\nAt the end of his address, he was given the loudest applause of any world leader addressing the summit.\n\nSome observers said that his words apparently captured the collective global resentment toward the policies of the \nUnited States under the Bush administration.  Others explained Chavez' popularity at the summit by noting that \nUnited Nations members tend to rally around certain members when they are faced with attacks.  For example, \nwhen conservative lawmakers in the United States called for the resignation of general Secretary Kofi \nAnnan, Annan was given a standing ovation as a gesture of support.  When United States President Bill Clinton \nwas facing attacks by the Republican opposition over the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky, he also received a \nstanding ovation from the General Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, in May 2005, Venezuela called for a Cuban-born militant and possible assassin, Luis Posada Carriles, \nto be extradited from the United States, where he was in custody, to Venezuela. Born in Cuba, Posada Carriles \nbecame a naturalized citizen of  Venezuela and has been linked with several bloody political plots. The Venezuelan \ngovernment wanted Carriles to stand trial for the bombing of an Air Cubana airliner traveling from Barbados to \nCuba in 1976, which left all 76 people on board dead.\n\nBut the United States said it would not deport Carriles to a third country, which might very well hand him over to \nPresident Fidel Castro in Cuba. In response, President Hugo Chavez  assured the United States authorities he \nwould not hand Carriles over to Castro.  Still, he warned that if the United States continued its path of intransigence \non the matter, diplomatic ties between Caracas and Washington D.C. would have to be reconsidered.\n\nBy the close of May 2005, United States officials rejected Venezuela's request to detain and extradite Carriles.  The \nUnited States Department of State was holding Posada Carriles on suspected immigration violations; it said there \nwas insufficient evidence to arrest and extradite him in accordance with Venezuela's wishes.\n\nIn response to the decision by the United States, tens of thousands of Venezuelans demonstrated in the streets of \nthe capital city of Caracas. The protest rally was largely peaceful with demonstrators dancing in the streets, blowing \nwhistles and shouting anti-American slogans. Many Venezuelans believe that the United States' position is rife with \ndouble standards, and some accuse United President George W. Bush of hypocrisy for allowing a possible terrorist \ninto its jurisdiction even while he wages a \"war on terror.\"\n\nThe case of Posada Carriles has contributed to the devolution of already-strained relations between Venezuela and \nthe United States. The current diplomatic imbroglio over Posada Carriles has not helped the situation. In fact, a new \nproblem emerged to exacerbate the situation when the United States canceled the tourist visa of Venezuelan \nSupreme Court  President, Omar Mora.  In response, Venezuela warned it would halt visits by American officials. \nThe United States said an administrative error precipitated the cancellation of Oman Mora's visa.  It also noted that \nthe cancellation was not political and that the Venezuelan Supreme Court President could re-apply for a new visa.  \n\n\n\nThe Venezuelan government, however, was not assuaged.  Venezuelan Vice-President Jose Vicente Rangel \ncharacterized the incident as a \"slight to Venezuela's dignity.\" Other Venezuelan officials, including Omar Mora \nhimself, suggested that the cancellation of the visa was linked to Venezuela's calls or the United States to extradite \nLuis Posada Carriles.\n\nPosada Carriles' immigration hearing was set for June 13th, 2005.  There, he renewed his request for  political \nasylum in the United States, and also requested that he be transfered from Texas to custody in Florida, where his \nfamily and attorneys were based.  On June 21, 2005, the  judge refuses Posada Carriles' request  to be transferred \nto Florida and set a date for an immigration hearing  before a Homeland Security judge in Texas. In that regard,  \nPosada Carriles was expected to face a Homeland Security judge in the United States on August \n29, 2005.  Following that hearing, the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security judge ruled that he could not be deported due to a possible threat of torture in \nVenezuela, if was, indeed, sent back to there.\n\nIt was reported in the Cuban media that on March 22, 2006, United States Immigration and Custorms Enforcement \n(ICE) decided that Posada Carriles would continue to be detained because he continued \"to present a danger to the \ncommunity and a flight risk. \" The ICE also acknowledged that he had \"a history of engaging in criminal activity, \nassociating with individuals involved in criminal activity, and participating in violent acts that indicate a disregard for \nthe safety of the general public.\"\n\nIt was the first major admission on the part of the United States government  regarding the potential criminal \nactivities of Posada Carriles.  Nevertheless, on April 27, 2006, the New York Times reported that Posada Carriles \nhas applied to become a United Statescitizen.\n\nIn 2006,  already-bad bilateral relations with the United States sunk to a new low after both countries expelled one \nanother's diplomats after Caracas accused Washington D.C. of spying. Venezuela also warned that if Washington \nsevered diplomatic ties with Caracas, it would respond by closing all Venezuelan refineries in the United States, \neffectively disrupting oil supplies, and potential leading to further price increases.\n\nOn April 7, 2006, a convoy carrying  United States Ambassador William Brownfield was  pelted  with tomatoes and \neggs in the Venezuelan capital city of Caracas.  Reports also stated that individuals on motorcycles \nchased Brownfield's car.  Police escorting the convoy did not intervene.  It was believed that supporters of \nPresident Hugo Chavez may have been responsible.\n\nIn September 2006, Chavez addressed the United Nations General Assembly.  In his speech he assailed the \n\"imperialist\" and hegemonic power of the United States, quoting famed American linguist Noam Chomsky in so \ndoing.  His reference to Chomsky apparently sparked renewed interest in the famed linguist's writings and \nphilosophical stances. He also jokingly referred to United States President Bush, who had earlier addressed the \nassembly, as \"the devil.\"  The Bush administration characterized Chavez' statements before the United Nations as \n\"unstatesmanlike.\"  But in an interview with Time magazine, Chavez noted that Bush had also used  vitriolic \nlanguage against him.  To this end, Chavez said, \"Bush has called me worse things \u2014 tyrant, populist dictator, drug \ntrafficker, to name a few. I'm not attacking Bush; I'm simply counter-attacking.\"\n\nThe scenario highlighted continued poor bilateral relations between the two respective administrations.\n\n\n\nThe situation was not helped by the fact that only days later, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Madura was \ndetained at New York's John F. Kennedy airport for 90 minutes.  Maduro was in the United States to attend the  \naforementioned United Nations General Assembly meeting but was stopped as he was trying to leave the country. \nAccording to various reports, after being detained, Maduro was questioned about his role in an attempted coup \nd'etat led by Chavez in 1992 by regular airport security.  Diplomatic security then entered the fray, presumably to \nresolve the matter.\n\nAccording to Maduro, however, the situation was not a simple one and entailed treatment disallowed under \ninternational law. Indeed, Maduro asserted that he was both strip-searched and subjected to verbal abuse.  \nIn remarks to the media, Maduro said, \"We were detained during an hour and a half, threatened by police with \nbeing beaten. We hold the United States government responsible.\" Venezuelan President Chavez observed that \nMaduro's detention was a provocation of sorts. Officially, Venezuela responded to the incident by filing a formal \ncomplaint to both United States authorities and the United Nations.\n\nFor its part, United States authorities denied that Maduro had been detained, saying instead that he had simply \nbeen asked to comply with a second security screening.  However, the United States Department of State later \nacknowledged the incident and subsequently issued an apology to the Venezuelan foreign minister.  A \nspokesperson for the State Department said, \"The state department regrets this incident. The United States \ngovernment apologized to Foreign Minister Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\" Regardless, the apology did \nnot alleviate the tensions between the two countries, with Foreign Minister Maduro saying that it was not enough.\n\nThe 2008 election of Barack Obama as president of the United States augured the possibility of a shift in policy \ntowards various countries in Latin America, including Venezuela.  To that end, the prospects of dialogue loomed \nlarge after the 2009 Summit of the Americas in Trinidad where Obama and Chavez exchanged handshakes. \nChavez also informed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he would re-establish diplomatic representation in the \ninterests of improved bilateral relations.\n\nThat said, it was yet to be seen if such overtures would yield actual results in the long run.\n\nIn June 2009, it was announced that the United States and Venezuela were set to restore diplomatic envoys \nrespectively.  Venezuelan Foreign Minister\n\nNicolas Maduro said that his country would sent its ambassador back to Washington, several months after the \nenvoy was withdrawn in the midst of  a diplomatic imbroglio involving an alleged United States plot against Bolivian \nPresident Evo Morales. At the time, Venezuela expelled the United States envoy from Caracas in a move intended \nto show solidarity with Bolivia.  The United States reacted by expelling the Venezuelan ambassador from \nWashington. Now, with bilateral relations between the two countries far less heated, in some measure as a result of \na new Obama administration in the United States,  Maduro also noted that \"fluid communication\"  between the two \nsides was set to resume.  Both Maduro and a United States official confirmed that the United States would send its \nown ambassador back to Caracas.\n\nOrganization of American States (OAS)\n\nSpecial Report: Summit of the Organisation of American States (OAS) in 2005: --\n\nThe leaders of 34 nations from across the Americas convened in the Argentine resort town of Mar del Plata from \nNov. 3 and 4, 2005, to discuss consolidating free trade across the hemisphere. The talks, however, failed to reach \n\n\n\nany significant resolution on the matter of creating The United Stated-backed proposal for a  regional free trade \nzone.  The United States was faced with strong opposition from five  Latin American countries -- Brazil, Argentina, \nVenezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay - who said that the free trade zone plan could damage their economies. They also \ncautioned that they wanted to see how various trade-related issues transpired at the upcoming World Trade \nOrganization meeting in Hong Kong.  The twenty-nine remaining  countries said they would resume talks on a Free \nTrade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2006.\n\nFor United States President George W. Bush, the summit was sometimes a rather discomforting event. At one \npoint, he  had to listen to his host, Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, publicly attribute his country's economic \nwoes to  American-backed economic policies of structural adjustment. In addition to that, he was faced with \nopposition from Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, who said Latin America was \"standing like a rock\" against the \nidea of the free trade area.  Chavez also led a peaceful anti-Bush rally of about 40,000 people at a football stadium \nin the resort town. During the rally, Chavez characterized as Bush's foreign policy agenda as a neo-imperialist \ncreation. Argentine soccer legend, Diego Maradona, also participated in the rally at the  start of the summit.  A \ndemonstration by far-left activists later in the day resulted in violent riots.  Still, Bush responded with good humor to \nhis less than warm reception.  At one point, he noted, \"It's not easy to host all these countries. It's particularly not \neasy to host - perhaps - me.\"\n\nAfter leaving Argentina, President Bush traveled to Brazil.  There, he  promised his Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \nLula Da Silva that he would work on eliminating agricultural subsidies -- a key measure needed in the movement \ntowards free trade around the world. He cautioned, however, that such an effort would also rest upon European \nwillingness to do the same.  While in Brazil, Bush took a retaliatory swipe at his nemesis, Chavez, by accusing \nsome nations of trying to roll back 20 years of democratic progress.  In Brazil, Bush was met once again by \nprotesters screaming insults and burning his effigy.\n\nThe final stop on Bush's Latin American trip was Panama.  There, he was scheduled to meet with President Martin \nTorrijos on matters related to regional trade and democracy.\n\nSee below for report on the 2009 Summit of the Americas with Obama at the helm of the United States.\n\nOther Significant Relations\n\nInternationally, the United States (U.S.) works through the United Nations and its affiliated agencies to further \npolitical stability and social development, and it seeks to promote economic growth and prosperity in conjunction \nwith the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. It is a member of the World Trade Organization, through \nwhich it engages in efforts to regularize and liberalize flows of trade on a global scale.\n\nRegionally, the United States attempts to achieve a broad multilateral consensus on hemispheric issues through \nparticipation in the Organization of American States (discussed above), though the great majority of member \ncountries have decided to depart from preferred U.S. policy and open normal diplomatic and trade relations with \nCuba. Regional trade integration has taken place through the North American Free Trade Agreement and the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, signed in 2000, expands the U.S. commitment \nto reducing trade barriers to encompass many countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe United States maintains about 800 overseas military bases. In fiscal 2000, military personnel stationed outside \nU.S. borders numbered some 258,000. The largest troop concentrations are in Germany with 69,000, though this \nlevel has declined by more than 150,000 in the last decade; the rest of Europe with 44,000, including about 11,400 \n\n\n\nserving as international peacekeepers in the Balkans; Japan with 40,000; South Korea with 37,000; and Guam and \nelsewhere in the Pacific, 24,000. Since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, the United States and its ally Great Britain \nhave patrolled the air space over Iraq, enforcing \"no-fly zones\" in the northern and southern sections of that country \nand occasionally attacking Iraqi installations that threaten the air patrols or Iraqi aircraft that violate the no-fly \nzones. Most of these armed encounters have taken place over the parts of Iraq to which the flight proscription \napplies, but on Feb. 16, 2001, U.S. and British jets struck at installations on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, \nBaghdad.\n\nTwo other focus areas of U.S. foreign policy engagement having key significance merit further discussion. One is \nthe nuanced and evolving American relation to Europe, where the United States has some of its oldest and \nstrongest allies. But the political dynamics of the European continent are in flux after the Cold War, while the \neconomic integration of European nations, propelled by the creation of a large single-currency zone, highlights the \nfact that in the world of business and finance, the United States and Europe are competitors. The other key focus \narea, at the opposite end of the Eurasian land mass, is a former and potential adversary, a trade partner of rapidly \nascendant importance and an emerging economic giant: the world's most populous country, China.\n\nEurope\n\nBoth the United States (U.S.) military alliance with Western Europe, which since 1999 extends into Central Europe, \nand the manifold, somewhat fractious economic and trade dealings between the world's two largest industrialized \nnodes are pivot points for the course of future events. The United States initiated the formation of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, or NATO, in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after the U.S.S.R had absorbed East-\nCentral Europe into its sphere of influence following World War II. In 1999, NATO expanded to include three former \nWarsaw Pact countries - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. This move had potentially unsettling \nimplications for European and American relations with Russia as it put states that were formerly in the Soviet orbit \ninto the Western alliance explicitly created to oppose the Soviet Union. Moreover, support by U.S. officials and \nothers exists for a future expansion of NATO to add the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, countries \nthat were not just in the Soviet sphere of influence but part of the Soviet Union itself. Others in NATO, notably some \nmembers of the German government, have voiced opposition or at least ambivalence in regard to this proposal.\n\nIn a grand strategic sense, NATO's security mission, originally plainly defined in terms of a military counterweight to \nthe Russian-led Soviet Union, must somehow be refined to accommodate the new Russia. Yet, to the geopolitical \nconstruct broadly referred to as the West, just what character this \"new Russia\" will assume in coming years \nremains inscrutable. At the same time, how politically stable, economically strong industrial democracies engage \nRussia can hardly fail to have some effect on what sort of Russia emerges. Potential shades of this engagement fall \nalong a spectrum from inimical treatment to aloofness to an as-yet fictional premise that Russia is essentially no \ndifferent from the nations engaging it.\n\nHowever, the war-torn condition of the Balkans driven by still-unresolved conflicts that broke out in the early 1990s \nwhen the old Yugoslavia disintegrated in a sense supplants the question of long-term NATO policy on Russia with \na more immediate, ongoing challenge. After a period of international passivity while fighting raged in Croatia and \nthen Bosnia, the United States took the lead in gaining a European consensus to use force to choke off vicious \nethnic reprisals. The intervention did not meet textbook criteria of effectiveness: The worst massacre, in Srebrenica, \nBosnia, in 1995, took place practically under the noses of international troops in a declared safe haven, and leading \nindicted war criminals are still at large. International action, nonetheless, almost certainly forestalled an even worse \noutcome.\n\nThe Balkan situation reflects a European manifestation of a pattern of political fragmentation that is widely and \nincreasingly encountered in many regions of the world. If this observation dovetails into an argument on behalf of \nthe responsibility for \"nation-building,\" that argument is one that policymakers in the United States and other \n\n\n\nWestern powers, more typically than not, seem loath to hear. History offers scant instances, if any, when an entity's \nacquisition of the accoutrements and recognition of nationhood proceeded smoothly and efficaciously.\n\nPolitical developments through several recent decades include recurrent instances of attempted nation-building - \nvarious U.S. leaders persisted in describing their country's Vietnam involvement in these terms, for example - but \nthe attempts failed. (The successful transformation of former Soviet satellites into modern European countries \nmarks the rebirth of nations with a millennium or so of cultural identity and some form of political one.) This \ndiscouraging record leaves theorists and thoughtful policy professionals groping, utterly without consensus, for an \nexplanation. Do the repeated failures reflect lack of political will, insufficiently sustained effort and commitment of \nresources at a level sorely inadequate to the task? Or is any mission of so-called nation-building inherently a \nwindmill-tilting effort to accomplish the impossible?\n\nU.S. commercial relations with Europe are also at a crossroads. In January 1999, 11 of the 15 member countries of \nthe European Union, or EU, launched the euro-denominated single-currency zone, comprising an economic area \nwith a slightly greater population than that of the United States and a combined gross domestic product of more \nthan three-quarters of American GDP. The currency changeover is designed both to reduce transaction costs and \ndelays within the European economic bloc and to offer international investors another option, besides the U.S. \ndollar and Japanese yen, to hold as a trusted reserve currency.\n\nBoth the euro zone and the EU as a whole are further engaged in dismantling trade, financial and regulatory \nbarriers so as to streamline and invigorate their internal economic performance and to challenge the pre-eminent \nU.S. position on international markets. While the United States and European countries have a long history of \nsporadic trade disputes, they have shown a tendency lately toward increasing disagreement on trade practices. \nTwo of the most acrimonious issues now on the table concern European subsidies to former Caribbean and African \ncolonies that negate the price advantage that Central American bananas grown by U.S. corporations would \notherwise have; and European refusal to purchase beef from hormone-treated cattle raised in the United States. In \nthe beef case, the World Trade Organization upheld the U.S. position that the refusal constituted an unfair trade \npractice and authorized the imposition of rotating retaliatory tariffs on European luxury goods,  including fancy \ncheeses and chocolates, imported into the United States. For its part, the EU has submitted complaints to the WTO \nconcerning alleged American subsidization of various industries, among them farm products, metals and aircraft.\n\nSince September 11, 2001, the United States' relationship with various European countries, most notably, the \nUnited Kingdom, has been strong, presumably due to shared interests in fighting terrorism and preserving global \nsecurity. After the war with Iraq in 2003, however, relations with several European countries -- traditional allies such \nas France and Germany -- have been strained due to those countries' objections to the war.\n\nIn late 2005, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Europe  for meetings with leaders and her \ncounterparts in countries including Germany, Romania, Ukraine and Belgium.  Secretary Rice first arrived in the \nGerman city of Berlin for talks with newly-installed German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The original intent of the trip \nto Europe was oriented toward improving bilateral ties, which were largely strained as a result of the invasion of Iraq \nand the subsequent ongoing war. Although the new German Chancellor had a similar objective in mind, Merkel also \nexpressed concern about the conduct of the war on terror.\n\nPartially driving Merkel's agenda were the media reports about a German citizen, Khaled el-Masri, who was \ndetained in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then transported to a prison in Afghanistan where he \nwas jailed for several months. According to media reports, el-Masri had been detained on the suspicion that he had \na false passport and because he had the same name as a known militant extremist. The United States government \nsaid the passport turned out to be genuine and that el-Masri was released from the Afghan prison when \nWashington decided that it no longer had reason to keep him in detention.  A senior Bush administration official \nrefused to answer a question posed by a journalist about whether or not Washington ever had evidence to hold el-\n\n\n\nMasri in the first place.  The situation was not helped by revelations in the media that the United States had asked \nGermany to keep the matter quiet.\n\nIn Germany, Chancellor Merkel said in a joint press conference with Rice that the United States admitted it had \nmade a mistake in the case Khaled el-Masri.  In this regard, Merkel said, \"I'm pleased to say that we spoke about \nthe individual case, which was accepted by the United States as a mistake.\"  But later as Rice traveled from \nGermany to her next European stop in Romania, senior United States officials denied that Rice had admitted a \nUnited States mistake over el-Masri.  Instead, the aforementioned senior administration official said the United \nStates government had simply informed Germany about el-Masri's detainment and subsequent release.  Indeed, \nthe official went so far as to refer to Merkel in saying, \"We are not quite sure what was in her head.\"\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that on Dec. 6, 2005, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) filed a \nlawsuit on el-Masri's behalf against various Bush administration officials, including former Central Intelligence \nAgency director George Tenet on the basis of supposed wrongful imprisonment.  The lawsuit text depicted el-\nMasri's treatment as \"constituting prolonged arbitrary detention, torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment.\" The lawsuit also alleged that the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) released him several \nmonths  later by unceremoniously  dumping him in Albania.  From Germany, el-Masri said in a translated statement, \n\"I want to know why they did this to me and how it ever came about. I don't think that I am (the) human being, the \nman I used to be.\"\n\nThe talks in Germany between Rice and Merkel were also dominated by reports that the CIA  transported terror \nsuspects via German territory.  Germany said that it had a list of 400 flights that had traversed across its territorial \nairspace and it required an explanation on the transport activity.  There were suspicions that some of these trips \nmight have been associated with the controversial practice of taking terror suspects to clandestine prisons outside \nthe United States for interrogation.\n\nIndeed, international attention was focused on the matter after the Washington Post reported that Europe was \nhome to some of the United States CIA's \"black sites\" -- these secret camps used by the United States intelligence \nagency to  interrogate terror suspects. A subsequent report by Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Watch \nidentified the two specific host countries as Romania and Poland, however, both countries denied the charges.\n\nBefore her trip to Europe, Rice acknowledged that terror suspects had been flown to other countries for \ninterrogation but she also said that the Bush administration did not condone the torture of terror suspects.  Rice \nclaimed that terror suspects were  transported by aircraft to other counties as part of a process called \"rendition\" \nand that such action was \"a lawful weapon.\" Still, Rice refused to address charges that the CIA has operated \nclandestine prisons  where terror suspects have been interrogated without regard for international law.  Indeed, \nTom Malinowski, an official with Human Rights Watch, responded to Secretary Rice's silence on the allegations of \nsecret prisons  saying, \"Condi Rice can't deny that secret prisons exist because they do. But she can't say where \nthey are because that would embarrass the United States and put the host countries in an impossible position.\" He \nalso accused Rice of mischaracterizing the actual nature of rendition.  To this end, he said, \"Secretary Rice made \nextra-legal rendition sound like just another form of extradition. In fact, it's a form of kidnapping and 'disappearing' \nsomeone entirely outside the law.\"\n\nOfficials of the  European Commission announced in November 2005 that there would be a comprehensive \ninvestigation on this matter.  The investigation was to determine the veracity of the charges by the Red Cross and \nHuman Rights Watch  since such \"black sites\" would be a violation of  the European convention on human rights \nand the international convention against torture. If the sites are found, the European Commission has warned that \nany country hosting them in Europe could be in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty of Nice, which calls on all member \n\n\n\nstates to uphold basic human rights.  The voting rights of guilty member states would be duly suspended as a \nresult.\n\nQuestions about the United States' conduct of the war on terror, as well as challenges to the lawfulness of its \nstrategies and tactics, were expected to dominate the entirety of Secretary Rice's trip to Europe.  Rice has \nexplained United States tactics saying, \"If you don't get to them before they commit their crimes, they will commit \nmass murder. We have an obligation to defend our people and we will use every lawful means to do so.\"  \nNevertheless, the international community made it clear that it wanted answers about United States policy on \nrendition, interrogation of suspects, the treatment of prisoners and its overall stance as regards torture.  Indeed, \neven the United States' key ally in its invasion of Iraq, the United Kingdom, asked for \"clarification\" on the these \nissues.\n\nThe decision by President George W. Bush to veto anti-torture legislation authored by fellow Republican Senator \nJohn McCain, while simultaneously asserting that the United States \"does not torture,\"  only served to muddy the \nwaters about what exactly constitutes the Bush administration's policy.  Indeed, a plethora of challenges have been \nlevied about the Bush administration's adherence to the conventions and protocols of international jurisprudence, \nsuch as the Geneva Convention.  See \"Political Conditions of Country Review: United States\" for further details as \nregards the Bush adminsitration, torture, the treatment of detainees and the application of prevailing international \nlaw.\n\nThe year 2007 saw new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hold official talks with his American counterpart, \nUnited States President George W. Bush, for the first time since succeeding Tony Blair.  The two heads of \ngovernment  met at Camp David in the United States. At issue was the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship, given \nTony Blair's exit from the office of the prime minister, and Brown's entry into that role.  Brown signaled goodwill by \nnoting that the world owed the United States a debt of gratitude for its leadership in the global war on terror.\n\nThe election in 2008 of Barack Obama in the United States was reported to have been well-received by many \nheads of state in Europe.  There was anticipation that an Obama administration would augur more close-knit \ncooperation with Europe on resolving pressing geopolitical issues of the day.\n\nChina\n\nAn adversarial relationship between the United States (U.S.) and China began when the Chinese Communist Party, \nled by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, completed their conquest of mainland China in 1949, driving the pro-American \nNationalist government headed by Chiang Kai-shek to the island of Taiwan. Taiwan continued to receive U.S. \nrecognition as the sole Chinese polity until 1979. Fighting between U.S. and Chinese communist forces in the 1950-\n1953 Korean conflict and mainland China's development of atomic weapons further obstructed prospects for the \ntwo countries to normalize relations. However, between 1954 and 1970, the United States and China held 136 \nambassadorial-level meetings, and in the late 1960s, trade restrictions and other impediments to bilateral contact \nwere relaxed to a very limited degree.\n\nA dramatic breakthrough in U.S.-Chinese relations came in the early 1970s during the administration of President \nRichard Nixon. First, in July 1971, Nixon revealed that his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, had secretly \ntraveled to Beijing to initiate direct contact with the Chinese leadership. Then, in February 1972, President Nixon \nhimself made a trip to China. The two countries announced they held improved bilateral relations to be in their \nmutual interest and intended to work toward establishing full diplomatic relations. U.S. President Gerald Ford visited \nChina in 1975 and Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited Washington, D.C., at the beginning of 1979; Deng's \n\n\n\ntrip coincided with full normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. On March 1, 1979, the United \nStates and China formally established embassies in their reciprocal capitals. Later that year, outstanding private \nclaims were resolved, and a bilateral trade agreement was concluded . Vice President Walter Mondale reciprocated \nVice Premier Deng's visit by traveling to China in August 1979. The next year, the two countries signed agreements \non maritime affairs, civil aviation and the textile industry as well as a bilateral consular convention.\n\nU.S. recognition of the Chinese government entailed the withdrawal of official government-to-government contacts \nwith Taiwan and the transfer of all official U.S. relations with China from Taipei to the People's Republic of China \nand its capital, Beijing. The United States thereby affirmed a position first articulated on the occasion of President \nNixon's visit, characterized as the \"one-China policy.\" Although Beijing acknowledges the American people will \nmaintain commercial, cultural and other unofficial contacts with the people of Taiwan, the United States accepts the \nview of the mainland government that Taiwan is a part of China and not a separate country. The Taiwan issue \ncontinues to be a source of U.S.-China tensions, however.\n\nIn the decade after they normalized relations in 1979, the United States and China participated in hundreds of joint \nresearch projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, the \nlargest bilateral program. High-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980 broadened U.S.-China dialogue to \ncover a wide range of issues encompassing global and regional strategic problems and politico-military questions, \nincluding arms control, U.N. and other multilateral organization activity and international narcotics control. Additional \nbilateral agreements were concluded, notably in the fields of scientific, technological and cultural interchange. Trade \nbetween the two nations accelerated.\n\nThe expanding relationship that followed normalization was threatened in 1981 by Chinese objections to the level of \nU.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Secretary of State Alexander Haig visited China in an effort to resolve Chinese \nquestions about the United States' unofficial relations with Taiwan. Eight months of negotiations produced a joint \ncommuniqu\u00e9 in which the United States stated an intention to gradually reduce the level of arms sales to Taiwan; \nfor its part, China stated that the effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question was a fundamental \nnational policy.\n\nHigh-level exchanges continued during the 1980s. Vice President Bush visited China in May 1982, and President \nReagan and Premier Zhao Ziyang made reciprocal visits in 1984. In July 1985, President Li Xiannian traveled to the \nUnited States, the first such visit by a Chinese head of state. Vice President Bush again visited China in October \n1985 and opened a consulate in Chengdu, the United States' fourth consular post in China in addition to the U.S. \nEmbassy in Beijing. There were also further exchanges of cabinet-level officials, capped by President Bush's visit to \nBeijing in February 1989.\n\nThe year 1989 was a highly significant one in Chinese political developments as well as in the U.S. relationship with \nChina. By this time, a large and growing number of cultural, educational and professional exchange activities at all \nlevels gave the American and Chinese people broad exposure to each other's value systems, cultural and artistic \nproclivities, popular styles and modes of entertainment. The vibrancy of this interchange most likely helped to \nencourage the formation of a student-led pro-democracy movement.\n\nBy mid-May, the ferment had grown to the point that an estimated 150,000 students and workers occupied \nTiananmen Square in central Beijing; major demonstrations also took place in other parts of China. The Chinese \ngovernment declared martial law and deployed the military with the intent of breaking up the shows of dissent \nmushrooming across Beijing, but further spontaneous protests initially induced most of the military convoys to hold \npassive positions in outlying areas and not move into the central city. However, on June 3 and June 4, the armed \nforces moved into Tiananmen Square in a violent crackdown. A few thousand protesters were likely killed in the \nsquare and elsewhere in Beijing. Reprisals occurred in other regions as well.\n\n\n\nThe events of Tiananmen disrupted U.S.-China relations, and trade and investment dropped dramatically, although \ncultural and other exchanges continued to some extent. The U.S. and other governments enacted a number of \nmeasures meant to indicate displeasure at the Chinese authorities' suppression of the demonstrators. The U.S. \nsuspended high-level official exchanges and weapons exports and imposed a series of economic sanctions. Chilly \nrelations remained the rule into 1990, when at the G-7 summit in Houston, Texas, Western nations called for \nrenewed political and economic reforms in China, particularly in the area of human rights.\n\nNonetheless, a pattern of gradual easing ensued. In 1991 and 1992, the Bush administration vetoed \ncongressionally imposed conditions on normal trade status renewal for China, which had been routinely granted on \nan annual basis prior to Tiananmen. The administration stressed the importance of the U.S. relationship with China \nand the belief that withholding normal trade status was not the correct way to exert pressure on China and would \nonly result in isolating it. In a similar vein, in 1994 President Clinton decided to de-link the annual trade status \nreview process from China's human rights record. The president noted that human rights concerns remained an \nessential part of the U.S. engagement with China but within a broader context. While moving toward a fully open \ntrade relationship with China, the United States would continue to urge the Chinese government to foster the rule of \nlaw and to allow a more open civil society.\n\nDisagreements stemming from the U.S. relationship with Taiwan continued to intermittently heat up. In 1996, China \nconducted military exercises, widely considered provocative or intimidating, in waters close to Taiwan. The United \nStates dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region, signaling it would not passively acquiesce should \nthe mainland Chinese attempt to incorporate Taiwan into their system by force. The tense period related to this \nincident was relatively brief, and U.S.-China relations improved to the point that Chinese President Jiang Zemin \nvisited the United States in the fall of 1997. Returning Jiang's gesture, President Clinton visited China in June 1998, \ntraveling extensively through the country and directly interacting with the Chinese people via live speeches and a \nradio show.\n\nYet the two countries still eye each other warily. The military action in Yugoslavia, which China opposed, seriously \ndisrupted relations when NATO jets mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three and injuring \ndozens of others. At nearly the same time, in mid-1999, the U.S. Congress and American news media devoted \nconsiderable attention to allegations, never substantiated, of Chinese espionage at the nuclear weapons laboratory \nin Los Alamos, N.M. The United States has voiced great misgivings in regard to recent and planned Chinese sales \nof nuclear reactor and missile technology to Pakistan and Iran. China has protested a pending U.S. sale of new \nhigh-tech weapons systems to Taiwan and, along with Russia and several European nations, has strongly opposed \nthe United States' proposed National Missile Defense initiative.\n\nOn the trade front, China has pursued membership in the World Trade Organization since 1986 and has intensified \nand made greater progress in this effort in recent years. China has, however, frequently been cited for failing to \nenforce intellectual property laws and for tolerating or encouraging the production and sale of pirated videos, music \nand software. China has also been slow to mitigate or eliminate trade barriers that include high tariffs and \ncumbersome bureaucratic requirements for exporters who seek access to its markets. Another issue that has \nperiodically arisen is the allegation that China uses forced prison labor to make some of its export products. \nNotwithstanding these concerns, U.S. exporters and investors have been making great inroads into the Chinese \nmarket. U.S. direct investment in China covers a wide range of manufacturing sectors, several large hotel projects \nand offshore oil and gas development in the South China Sea. U.S. companies have establish ed more than 20,000 \nequity joint ventures, contractual joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China. More than 100 U.S.-\nbased multinationals have projects, some with multiple investments. The biggest single U.S. export deal to China, \nannounced in October 1997, was the sale of 50 Boeing aircraft valued at about $3 billion.\n\nChina's economy has expanded to more than 22 times its size in 1978, although with more than quadruple the U.S. \npopulation, China's gross domestic product is still not quite half that of the United States. Still, the growth dynamic \nfavors a rapidly narrowing gap. The U.S. trade deficit with China was $US49.7 billion in 1997, rising to an estimated \n$US85 billion in 2000. China now accounts for a larger portion of the record United States trade deficit than any \n\n\n\nother country, a result both of soaring Chinese exports to the United States and the comparatively weak recent \neconomic performance of Japan, which previously had the biggest trade surplus with the United States.\n\nIn September 2000, the United States and China reached agreement on China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization. The U.S. Congress passed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations, which would \nend the requirement that China secure annual approval to conduct normal trade with United States. However, the \ntransition to permanent trade status is conditional on China meeting the full range of conditions for WTO \nmembership. China must still reach agreement with the WTO on various matters, including tariffs, intellectual \nproperty protection and labor practices.\n\nIn the first few months of 2001, China-U.S. relations went through some difficult times. After President Bush took \noffice in January, he made it clear that he regarded China as a strategic competitor rather than a partner. The Bush \nadministration's China position has been reflected by several China policy concerns by both the executive branch \nand the U.S. Congress. Some high-ranking officials as well as Congress members have suggested a tougher \nstance towards China in matters such as human rights issues and arms sales to Taiwan. Among them, the central \nissue was arms sale to Taiwan by the United States. Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. policy is to \nprovide Taiwan with adequate defense needs. With China's increasing deployment of missiles allegedly targeted at \nTaiwan, Taiwan has demanded the United States to sell them sophisticated new weapons including warships \nequipped with the Aegis battle-management radar system. The Bush administration must decide whether to sell \nsuch weapons to Taiwan as it has made it clear to continue to help defend Taiwan in face of China's threat to the \nisland. The U.S. has decided to go ahead with the National Missile Defense (NMD) system or missile defense \nshield which China regards itself as a target. China has warned the United States not to sell the Aegis to Taiwan \nwhich can be linked to the shield. It was out of this concern that Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen came to the \nUnited States in March to meet President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n\nIt was at this sensitive time of delicate China-U.S. relations that another incident took place in early April as a U.S. \nEP-3 surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet and made an emergency landing on southern Chinese \nisland of Hainan. The collision caused the death of the Chinese pilot and the loss of the fighter jet, and the U.S. spy \nplane was seriously damaged. After 11 days of political and diplomatic wrangling between the two governments, the \n24 U.S. spy plane crew members were released from the Chinese custody. On April 18, a team of U.S. military and \ndiplomatic officials went to Beijing for negotiations with the Chinese on the release of the crippled EP-3 as well as \non future flights of the U.S. surveillance planes off the Chinese coast. China demanded that the United States end \nits spy missions along the Chinese coastline. China rejected the U.S. requests to let the EP-3 be repaired and flown \nback to the United States. China also refused to let a U.S. Navy ship bring back the plane. After months of \nnegotiations, EP-3 was disassembled and returned to the United States on two Russian cargo planes in early July.\n\nAlthough the spy plane incident was over, it did result in certain negative feelings on both sides. For the Chinese, \nthe incident reminded them of the 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. On the other side, \nsome U.S. Congress members urged sanctions against China over the incident and opposed further free-trade \nagreements with China. Nevertheless, the governments of the two countries seem to have adopted a more \npragmatic approach, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a good relationship. On April 23, President Bush \ndecided not to sell to Taiwan the Arleigh Burke destroyers equipped with Aegis radar system, but approved a \npackage of weapons including four Kidd-class destroyers, submarines and anti-submarine planes. The Bush \nadministration said that the package of the arms sale to Taiwan would address in a \"measured\" way a regional \nmilitary balance that had tilted in the People's Republic of China's favor, and that there was nothing for China to fear \nin this package. Opposing any arms sale to Taiwan, China expressed serious concern in a measured way over the \nreport of the U.S. arms package to Taiwan, but at the same time felt relieved that the package did not include the \nsophisticated destroyers with the Aegis radar system.\n\nIn early July, U.S. President Bush called Chinese President Jiang Zemin to discuss areas of cooperation and \ndisagreement. Bush's call represented the final chapter of the standoff between the two countries by the spy plane \nincident. In late July, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited China. One of his primary reasons for going was \n\n\n\nto arrange the visit by President Bush in October for the APEC summit. Powell also wanted to smooth over Sino-\nU.S. ties, which were strained from virtually the beginning of the Bush administration.\n\nWhile U.S.-China relations grew warmer after the spy plane incident, the September 11 terrorist attacks on the \nUnited States further united the countries as they worked to fight international terrorism. In October, President Bush \nwent to Shanghai as planned to attend the APEC summit meeting. During the meeting, President Bush and \nPresident Jiang had a very friendly talk. Both leaders said that the two countries had a common understanding of \nthe threat posed by international terrorists. President Jiang said that China was willing to work to develop a \nconstructive relationship with the United States. The United States expressed its satisfaction with China's \ncooperation against terrorism by showing its support at the United Nations and its decision to close its border with \nAfghanistan.\n\nPresident Bush visited China again in February 2002 after a rather tense situation: One month before his visit, \nChinese intelligence officials disclosed to journalists from the Financial Times and the Washington Post that at least \n27 spying devices were discovered hidden in a Boeing 767 airliner built in the United States for President Jiang \nZemin. Despite the discovery, China publicly stated that diplomatic relations between the two countries would \nremain friendly and the summit continued as planned.\n\nRelations between China and the United States were strained over the United Nations Security Council voting \nregarding Iraq from 2002 to 2003.\n\nRelations were challenged over Taiwan in 2004 over the sale of arms by the United States to Taiwan.\n\nIn 2005, relations between mainland China and the United States were again challenged over the issue of Taiwan.  \nChallenges arose in the aftermath of China's announcement about its \"anti-seccession\" law.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, amidst geopolitical challenges stemming from North Korea to the Middle East, relations between \nChina and the United States have been more collaborative as both work to establish stability.  China has been a \nparticularly important figure within the multilateral process involving North Korea.\n\nThe year 2006 also marked a visit by Chinese President Hu Jintao to the United States.  The Chinese leader's first \nvisit was not with the American head of state but with Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.\n\nThe incoming Obama administration in the United States augured a potential change  for relations with China.\n\nPresident Obama met with Chinese Premier Hu Jintao at the G-20 summit in London in April 2009 and accepted \nthe Chinese leader's invitation to visit China.\n\nRussia\n\nThe United States remains committed to maintaining a constructive relationship with Russia in which we seek to \nexpand areas of cooperation and effectively work through differences. The United States continues to support \nRussia's political and economic transformation and its integration into major international organizations. These \nsteps, in conjunction with achievements in considerably reducing nuclear weapons, have greatly enhanced the \nsecurity of the United States.\n\n\n\nThe intensity and frequency of contacts between President Yeltsin and President Clinton, most recently the Moscow \nSummit in August 1998, are indicative of the strong commitment to working together on a broad range of issues. \nThese include European security, reducing the threat to our countries posed by weapons of mass destruction, and \neconomic cooperation, especially American investment in Russia.\n\nRelations between Putin and the new Bush administration started off to a promising start despite grave differences \non issues, such as missile defense. They were strengthened when Russia pledged to join the global war on terror \nfollowing the terrorist attacks on the United States on 2001.\n\nRelations were increasingly strained in the lead up to  the war in Iraq in 2003 and then in the immediate aftermath.\n\nRelations with the United States took center stage again in  2005 when United States Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice visited Russia.  During her visit, however, she took time to criticize  President Vladimir \nPutin's political weight by suggesting that he had too much personal power.  In this regard, Rice expressed concern \nover the lack of  an independent media in Russia, and she also repudiated the accumulation of political power that \nPutin had gathered since taking office.\n\nPerhaps most important to the Bush administration in the United States, however, was the matter of foreign \ninvestors' rights.  In this regard, the Bush administration would apparently be watching closely the fraud and tax \nevasion trial of the founder of the Yukos oil company,  Mikhail Khodorkovsky.  Some, perhaps even including those \nwithin the Bush administration, have been of the mind that the case against Khodorkovsky was manufactured \npurely to punish him for his political ambitions.  Naturally, those in the Kremlin have viewed the situation quite \ndifferently.  In May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and an associate were  found guilty of six charges, including tax \nevasion, and was sentenced to nine years in prison. The verdict was  watched closely by Washington.  Indeed, \nit  was interpreted symbolically as Russia's approach to foreign investment.\n\nA year later in May 2006, on the heels of sharp criticism by United States Vice President Dick Cheney of Russia's \nhuman rights record, the Kommersant business newspaper said that the matter augured the start of a new Cold \nWar.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered no comment on the content of Cheney's position, however, \nhe criticized the forum in Lithuania where Cheney spoke.  He noted that such meetings were convened for the \npurpose of uniting a cadre of interest groups against someone.  Meanwhile, former Soviet President Mikhail \nGorbachev said that Cheney's speech appeared to be \"a provocation and interference in Russia's internal affairs in \nterms of its content, form and place.\"\n\nThe matter preceded a scheduled meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President \nGeorge W. Bush at a key industrial summit to be convened in St. Petersburg.  At that meeting in July 2006, during a \njoint press address by Putin and Bush, the American president called on Russia to democratize, and said that he \nhoped that the country would enjoy the kind of freedom now being enjoyed by Iraq. Putin responded to this \nstatement by asserting that the example of Iraq -- now embroiled in what some were calling a civil war -- was not \none he thought Russia should emulate.\n\nIn April 2007, Russia responded negatively to plans by the Bush administration in the United States (U.S.) to \ndevelop a missile defense system in eastern Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin decried the notion, \nindicating that he viewed such a missile system as being more that simply a defense plan.  To this end, he said, \n\"This is not just a defense system, this is part of the U.S.  nuclear weapons system.\"  President  Putin went so far \nas to warn the U.S. that its plans in this regard would run the risk of mutual destruction, saying, \"The threat of \n\n\n\ncausing mutual damage and even destruction increases many times.\" Making clear its hard-line opposition to the \nnotion of a U.S. missile defense system, President Putin also threatened to withdraw participation in a treaty limiting \nconventional weaponry in Europe.                                      \n\nNATO responded to Russia's threat to suspend its membership in the 1990  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) \nwith its own concern.  Indeed, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer made it clear that the treaty was a \nkeystone of security and stability in Europe.\n\nRussia's opposition to the U.S. plan was not shared by other Eastern European countries, such as Poland and the \nCzech Republic, both of which were eager to offer the U.S. permission to construct missile bases and radars within \ntheir borders.                                    \n\nWith the United States planning to construct missile defense facilities in Europe, Russia had already expressed its \nopposition to such a plan.  But in early June 2007, ahead of the G-8 summit of key world leaders, Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin warned that his country could be forced to point weapons at Europe for the first time since \nthe end of the Cold War.  Russia also announced that it had tested an RS-24 ballistic missile a week prior. \n\nBoth moves appeared oriented toward the maintenance of \"strategic balance\" in the region. To this end, Putin \npointed to the fact that the United States had already altered the strategic balance by withdrawing from the anti-\nballistic missile treaty in 2002.  In an interview published in the Italian newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, he made the \nRussian position clear by asserting, \"If the American nuclear potential grows in European territory, we have to give \nourselves new targets in Europe.\"\n\nThe climate of bilateral relations thawed somewhat at the summit when United States President Bush said,  \n\"They're [Russians] not a military threat.\"  He also called for the United States to work with Russia in dealing \ncooperatively on the issue.\n\nThen, Russian President Putin proposed an alternate solution to the missile defense issue when he suggested that \nboth countries utilize the radar system at Gabala in Azerbaijan to develop a shield that would cover Europe.  In this \nplan, incoming missiles from hostile countries could be detected.   Putin noted that \"This work should be multi-\nfaceted with the engagement of the states concerned in Europe.\"  He also added that if his country and this United \nStates worked together in an open manner to develop missile defense capabilities, \"then we will have no \nproblems.\"  \n\nBush responded to the proposal by saying that it was an interesting option and noted that he and Putin would \nengage on a \"strategic dialogue\" on the subject in a forthcoming visit of his Russian counterpart to the United \nStates.  Bush' senior advisor on national security, Stephen Hadley's characterization of the Russian proposal as \"a \npositive development\" augured a possible productive resolution to the matter.                               \n\nOn Oct. 12, 2007, missile talks between the United States (U.S.) and Russia ended in failure with no resolution was \nin sight.  U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the bilateral talks with Russia saying, \"We discussed \na range of proposals we hope they will accept.\" Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said that the proposals \nrequired study and in the interim, the U.S. should not work on the missile defense system.  But the U.S. rejected \nRussia's request to put an end to the plan, with Rice asserting that discussions with Poland and the Czech Republic \non the deployment of system would go on as anticipated.  Responding to the U.S. position, Putin  said, \"One day \nyou and I may decide that missile defense systems can be deployed on the Moon, but before we get there the \npossibility of reaching an agreement may be lost because you will have implemented your own plans.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates argued that that the missile defense system  was not directed at \nRussia but at rogue states including Iran and North Korea.  However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said \nthat the very idea of the missile defense shield system was based on the false assumption that Iran presented a \nnuclear threat.  Lavrov also criticized the U.S. for hinting at the use of force against Iran, saying that  such  an \napproach contravenes against the notion of a negotiated solution to the Iranian problem.  Russia also reiterated its \n\n\n\nposition that  its own early warning radar systems  in Azerbaijan could easily be used by the U.S.  But Gates \nresponded that radar was incapable of guiding interceptor missiles.\n\nU.S. intransigence on the matter thus paved the way for Russia to make good on its earlier threat to withdraw its \nparticipation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which was aimed at limiting conventional \nweaponry in Europe.  Russia also warned that it could withdraw its participation in the 20-year old Intermediate \nRange Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which limits both U.S. and Russian short and medium range missiles, and \nresulted in the elimination of thousands of missiles in both countries.                              \n\nThe 2008 election of Barack Obama in the United States was cautiously viewed as an entry point toward improved \nbilateral relations.  Indeed, in a speech delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States capital of \nWashington D.C., Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed hopes that his country would enjoy improved \nrelations with the United States under an Obama administration   Russian President Medvedev said that United \nStates President-Elect Barack Obama had the potential to rebuild \"necessary mutual trust\" that had waned during \nthe Bush years.  The Russian president also hinted at possible compromise with the United States over the \ncontroversial plan for a United States missile shield in Europe.  He said, \"We have a chance to solve the problem \nthrough either agreeing on a global system or, as a minimum, to find a solution on the existing programs, which \nwould suit the Russian Federation.\"                              \n\nAs  discussed below, U.S.-Russian relations were in the process of being re-set in 2009 when President Obama \nmet with President Medvedev in Moscow, and a number of joint agreements were forged.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe Perry Report, prepared by the United States (U.S.) special advisor on North Korea, was released in September \n1999 and outlined a new approach to foreign policy regarding North Korea. The report called for the normalization \nof ties with North Korea and a cessation of attempts to depose the government. Perry recommended a reduction of \nsanctions in order to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear weapons program. Moreover, the United \nStates sought to disarm North Korea's nuclear program by helping to provide fuel aid to North Korea to help prevent \nthe processing of nuclear fuel that can be turned into atomic weapons. For several years following the end of the \nCold War, North Korea had focused its diplomatic activities on relations with the United States in its belief that \nimproved relations with Washington, D.C. was crucial for the survival of the regime. The United States has been the \nlargest grain donor to North Korea. But North Korea had complained that the United States had often ignored its \ndesire to improve relations, believing that it paid attention to North Korea only when it launched provocative steps \nby resorting to nuclear weapons or missile development programs.\n\nFor years, North Korea tried to reach around South Korean leaders to strike a deal with the United States (U.S.), \nand the U.S. government insisted that direct dialogue between North and South Korea must come first. The U.S. \ngoal had been to induce impoverished North Korea to drop its weapons of mass destruction program and fully turn \nfrom supporting terrorism. Then in June 2000, only a few days after the historic summit between the leaders of both \nKoreas, the United States made a decision to ease wide-ranging sanctions imposed on North Korea. This move has \ncleared the way for financial transactions and trade in all but the most sensitive goods between the two countries. In \naddition, it was intended to permit new air and shipping service between North Korea and the United States.\n\nIn October 2000, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a two-day visit to North Korea, being the \nmost senior American official ever to go to the country. Albright's visit was seen as groundbreaking as well as \nopening a new chapter in U.S.-North Korea relations. During the visit, Albright and the North Korean leader Kim \nJong il held several talks covering a full range of issues including terrorism, human rights and concrete steps for \ntension reduction on the Korean Peninsula. One week after Albright's visit, North Korea and the United States held \n\n\n\ndiscussions in Malaysia on the development of ballistic missiles by North Korea, but it was ended without reaching \nan agreement. The missile talks between the two countries focused on two key issues: North Korea's domestic \nlong-range missile program and its export of missile technology to countries such as Pakistan and Iran. The United \nStates claimed that North Korea was the world's top exporter of missile equipment and technology to those \ncountries. As for the missile program, the United States was exploring the idea of exchanging launches of North \nKorea's satellites for serious missile restraint by North Korea.\n\nThe momentum towards normalization of relations between North Korea and the outside world was slowed with the \nelection of President George Bush in the United States (U.S.). Early in his administration President Bush ordered a \nreview of U.S. policy towards North Korea and the Bush Administration has made it clear that improved relations \nwith the US depended on progress across a broad range of security issues including force deployments, nuclear \nweapons and missiles.\n\nThe U.S.-North Korea relationship was dealt a blow with the terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, \n2001. The backlash by the United States against the terrorists responsible for the attack and the labeling of North \nKorea as a member of the \"axis of evil\" along with Iran and Iraq resulted in a retrenchment by North Korea and \nsaber rattling by both sides. This created an awkward tension between South Korea and the U.S. because of the \ndesire by the South Korea for eventual reunification in accordance with the sunshine policy of President Kim Dee \nJung of South Korea while at the same time looking to maintain a good relationship with the U.S.\n\nThe branding of North Korea as part of an \"axis of evil\" by the United States in 2002 appeared to have spurred \n(according to some, but not all,  sources)  the restarting of a nuclear program in the country, which reached a \ndisturbing apex in 2006 when a nuclear weapon was tested. Despite assurances from the Chinese government in \n2005 that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, negotiations remained stalled.\n\nIn 2006, North Korea test-fired a number of short-range missiles and one Taepodong-2 long-range missile. The \nsituation sparked international condemnation and threats of punitive measures by some countries, including \nsanctions.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council said that it would convene an emergency meeting later in the day  to consider \nthe missile tests.  The closed session meeting was requested by Kenzo Oshima,  Japan's ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe condemned the move by North Korea  and announced \nthat Japan  was prohibiting  the entry of officials, chartered flights and ferries from North Korea. Also, Japan's \nForeign Minister Taro Aso warned that Tokyo was now considering the imposition of economic sanctions on North \nKorea.\n\nIn South Korea, the government in Seoul convened an emergency cabinet meeting and placed its military on high \nalert.\n\nChina expressed strong concern about North Korea's actions and called on the international community to stay \ncalm.\n\nThe United States Department of State reacted to the situation by characterizing the launch of the Taepodon-2 as a \n\"provocative\" and attention-seeking act.  White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said that President George W. \nBush was consulting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and \n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the matter.  Secretary Rice called on North Korea to return to the \nmultilateral discussion table.\n\nFor its part, North Korea said  that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korea also warned that it would \nreact strongly to punitive pressures from the international community, and it threatened to carry out an \"annihilating\" \nnuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States.\n\nIn October 2006, in  the aftermath of North Korea's claims that it carried out a nuclear test, the United Nations \nSecurity Council was debating what type of response it should undertake.  A draft document by the United States \nhad undergone revisions to accommodate the reservations of China and Russia.  Those two countries had stated \nthat they would not support the military enforcement of financial and security sanctions against North Korea.  With \nadjustments made, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 1718 on October 14, \n2006.  The resolution called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a \nban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on \nthe transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution \n1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via \nmilitary force.\n\nThe 2006  missile tests, in conjunction with the nuclear weapon test, have intensified the widely-held view that \nNorth Korea is a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served to further \nisolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community.\n\nDecember 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  \nNorth Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating \ntable after a year-long hiatus. The re-opening of dialogue came a few months after North Korea caused global \nanxiety when it tested a nuclear weapon.  That incident resulted in international condemnation, and ultimately \nprompted the imposition of sanctions against North Korea by the United Nations.\n\nWhile the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of \ncaution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. \nIndeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a \nnuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two \nabsolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.\n\nIn preliminary talks with his Chinese and South Korean cohorts in the Chinese capital of Beijing, United States \nEnvoy Christopher Hill expressly stated that he believed Pyonyang had a clear choice to make.  To this end, he \nsaid, \"We can either go forward on a diplomatic track or you have to go to a much more difficult track. That is a \ntrack that involves sanctions and I think ultimately will really be very harmful to the economy.\"                                   \n\nThis view from Washington, however, was not likely to resonate particularly well with Pyongyang.  First, North \nKorean Envoy Kim Kye-gwan made it clear that his country required nuclear weaponry for deterrent purposes.  \nSecond, he expressed the view that the problem was not rooted in North Korea's nuclear program itself, but rather, \nit stemmed from the hostile stance of the United States toward North Korea.  He said, \"The biggest problem is that \nthe United States needs to change its hostile policy against North Korea. When they change their policy from a \nhostile stance to one of peaceful co-existence, the problem can be resolved.\"                                   \n\nThe clear disconnection between the two perspectives on the eve of the resumption of multilateral talks augured \ngrave difficulties during the negotiating process. In fact, it suggested that concurrence was not likely to be found \neasily.  Nevertheless, the return of all parties to the table for dialogue presented a new opportunity to find creative \n\n\n\nsolutions.  For example, despite the hardline positions referenced above,  there have been some suggestions  that \nthe United States might be willing to consider easing the financial component of the existing sanctions.  Such a \nmove could pave the way for decreased intransigence by North Korea.  As well, there were hopes that an earlier \noffer by the United States of a security guarantee could be used as the foundation for forthcoming negotiations.  \nThat arrangement offered North Korea a security guarantee in exchange for the cessation of its nuclear program.  \nIn actuality, the December 2006 talks ended inconclusively.                                  \n\nA month later in January 2007, it was announced that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program would \nresume.\n\nThere were prevailing hopes that North Korea might abandon its nuclear ambitions and rejoin the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty in exchange for economic aid and security guarantees.  But the situation was made more \ncomplex as a result of a financial dispute involving North Korea and the United States (U.S).\n\nBy February 2007, the multilateral discussions commenced in China between all six parties -- North Korea, South \nKorea, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia.  Progress was quickly made during the six-party talks in \nBeijing when North Korea agreed to move closer toward the position of disarmament.  Of particular interest was an \nagreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the \nensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United Statesand South Korea.  The draft \nagreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North \nKorea.\n\nNo concurrence was yet forged days after talks began. Nevertheless, spokespersons from the United States and \nNorth Korea refrained from harsh rhetoric, and instead commented on the work yet to be accomplished. Notably, \nUnited States delegate, Christopher Hill, struck a note of cautious optimism saying in an interview with Agence \nFrance Presse, \"I think we have managed to get through what we thought were tough issues but nothing is agreed \nuntil everything is agreed so we must be very cautious.\"  Along a similar vein, North Korean delegate, Kim Kye-\ngwan, said \"There are still differences on a series of issues in the overall talks, so we will try to work them out.\"\n\nThe shift in tone on the parts of both the United States and North Korea demonstrated a sharp contrast to \ndynamics of the previous several years.  The United States demonstrated greater willingness for dialogue during \nmeetings in Berlin, which preceded the Beijing multilateral talks. Meanwhile, North Korea has been facing a \nmassive food crisis in the winter months -- a scenario  that may have also contributed to the more productive \ndynamics in 2007.                                 \n\nBy February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached thanks to a Chinese-brokered \ninitiative.  As noted above, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in \nexchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent \nreceived after further disarmament steps are taken.\n\nAs well, both Japan and the United States agreed to discuss the possibility of normalizing ties with North Korea -- \nsomething that Pyongyang has been seeking for some time.\n\nThe United States also said that it would work with North Korea to resolve the banking dispute discussed above, \nand it would consider the prospects of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nUnited States President George W. Bush said that the deal represented \"the best opportunity to use diplomacy to \naddress North Korea's nuclear programs.\"  In his official statement, he also stated that the agreement was \nemblematic of \"the common commitment of the participants to a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\n\nYet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North \nKorea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.  For example, the state news agency of North Korea \nissued a report referring to the \"temporary\" suspension of nuclear activities, rather than enduring disarmament.  \nUnited States negotiator, Christopher Hill, warned that the resumption of nuclear activities in the future would be a \nclear violation of the agreement.\n\nIn the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, \nthen, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, \nIAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from \nthat country in 2002.\n\nThese announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (as noted above), in \nwhich the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by \nother countries (noted below) participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.   The total amount of fuel \noil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year \nunder the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in \nthe deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of aforementioned financial dispute.   With the deal \nnow moving forward, North Korea said that it would begin the process of shutting down operations at Yongbyon \nwithin weeks, pending receipt of the frozen funds. Russia, which worked to facilitate the complex transfer, said that \nthe money was in the process of being delivered.\n\nNorth Korea characterized talks with United States nuclear envoy, Christopher Hill, on these matter as being both  \n\"comprehensive and productive.\"  Hill responded to the developments positively but noted that the closure of the \nreactor at Yongbyon was only the start of an ongoing process, and would not solve all the problems at hand. Hill \nalso said that a new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, \nJapan, Russia and the United States, would commence in July 2007.                                \n\nOctober 2008  saw the United States move to remove North Korea from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism.  The \ndevelopment came after multilateral talks between North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Russia and \nJapan and appeared to end some dissonance that had  been brewing in recent months, despite multilateral \nconcurrence on North Korean disarmament.\n\nPyongyang had  finally handed over the details  relating to its nuclear program in July 2008 and destroyed its main \ncooling tower as a sign of its commitment to the \"disarmament for aid\" deal.  Pyongyang then expected that North \nKorea would be dropped from the United States' terrorism \"black list.\"  However, lack of progress on that front led to \nPyongyang's belief that the United States has not fulfilled a key component of the \"disarmament for aid\" agreement, \nhence its threat to restart nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  For its part, the United States  said that North Korea would \nremain on its list of state sponsors of terrorism until North Korea's disarmament process was fully verified.\n\nThe United States' decision to move in the direction of removing North Korea from the \"black list\" suggested that \nprogress had been made on the verification process.  Indeed, a spokesperson for North Korea's foreign ministry \nconfirmed that Pyongyang would now resume disabling its nuclear facilities and allow international monitors access \nin order for the verification process to take place. The spokesperson was reported to have said:  \"We welcome the \nUnited States' implementation of its duty to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism. We have decided \nto resume the disabling of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and to allow United States and International Atomic Energy \nAgency monitors to carry out their work again.\"                               \n\nThe 2008 election of Barack Obama in the United States was expected to affect nuclear negotiations with North \nKorea in the future.  But as discussed below, North Korea's increasingly provocative actions and bellicose \nstatements have ensured that bilateral ties remained strained, with the nuclear issue a prevailing sticking point.                                 \n\nIran\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students occupied the American embassy in Tehran with the support of Ayatollah \nKhomeini. For 444 days, 52 Americans were held hostage. On April 7, 1980, the United States (U.S.) broke \ndiplomatic relations with Iran, and on April 24, 1981, the Swiss government assumed representation of U.S. \ninterests in Tehran.\n\nThe Pakistani government represented Iranian interests in the United States. In accordance with the Algiers \ndeclaration of Jan. 20, 1981, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal (located in The Hague, Netherlands) was established for \nthe purpose of handling claims of U.S. nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the United States. \nU.S. contact with Iran through The Hague covers only legal matters.\n\nIn 1996 the U.S. Congress passed the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. The act gives the U.S. president discretionary \npower to impose sanctions on any individual or company anywhere in the world that invests more than $20 million \nor more in an Iranian or Libyan oil or gas project.\n\nCommercial relations between Iran and the United States consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food and \nmanufactured products. In 1999 the U.S. allowed import of Iranian caviar, pistachios and carpets. The U.S. \ngovernment prohibits the export of military and dual-use items to Iran as well as items forbidden under anti-\nterrorism legislation; it prohibits all imports from Iran. In August 2000 Iranian and American legislators met for the \nfirst time in what was the highest level meeting between the two countries since 1979.\n\nIranian officials expressed optimism regarding the new Republican administration, due to its close ties to the oil \nindustry. Iranian leaders hoped for a reversal of U.S. policies towards the country and stated that they were willing \nto adjust their policy towards the U.S. in return. Iran is in need of foreign investment, and would welcome \nAmerican, as well as other foreign businesses. While it was widely expected that the Bush administration would \nease the sanctions on Iran, this has not happened. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Congress voted to extend ILSA for a \nsecond five-year period. The vote reflected continued skepticism toward Iran based on the country's continued \nsupport of terrorism (the U.S. State Department labeled Iran as the world's \"most active state-sponsor of terrorism \nin 2000\"), Iran's presumed capability to develop weapons of mass destruction, its vocal opposition to the current \nform of the Middle East peace process, and support for the latest Palestinian Intifada.\n\nIran strongly condemned the attacks on New York and Washington D.C. on Sept. 11, 2001, but has not joined the \nU.S.-led coalition against terrorism. Iran strongly criticized the bombing of Afghanistan, and in an interview with \nCNN on November 12, President Khatami said that the \"roots of terrorism must be examined before it can be \nstopped,\" and urged the U.S to examine its policies.\n\nAfter President Bush's declaration of Iran as part of an \"Axis of Evil\" in January 2002, it appears highly unlikely that \ndiplomatic relations will improve under the Bush administration. Bush's accusation not only shocked and offended \nIran, it shocked much of the world, and many countries involved in the fight against terrorism do not support the \nUnited States' claims.\n\nWhile the U.S. has verbally extended an invitation for diplomatic talks between the two countries, Iran has officially \nexpressed strong resistance to the idea. While there are some in the reformist camps who would still welcome a \nbreakthrough in diplomatic dialogue, Iranian hardliners are adamant in their position. In May 2002, the Iranian \nJustice Department went as far as to declare it illegal for newspapers to print articles supporting the idea of U.S.-\n\n\n\nIranian talks. In that same month, the U.S. Department of State accused Iran as being the world's most active \nsponsor of terrorism.\n\nBy September 2003, the U.S. declared that Iran had clearly violated its United Nations nuclear safeguards \nobligations. However, the U.S. did say it was willing \"to give Iran a last chance to stop its evasions.\" Iran continued \nto deny its uranium enrichment activities are part of an illegal weapons program. Meanwhile, the United Nations' \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was considering setting an October deadline for Iran to fully comply with \nits obilgations under the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT.)\n\nBy late 2005 and into 2007, the nuclear issue had found no resolution.  Indeed, United States Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice applied harsh words toward Iran's nuclear development while Iranian officials continued to \ndefend Iran's right to develop nuclear power for peaceful -- and if necessary -- defensive purposes.\n\nIn early 2007, as noted above Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Kazemi Qumi, delineated the details of a plan to \nstrongly expand his country's economic and military ties with Iraq.  The Iranian ambassador also addressed the \ndetainment of Iranians by United States forces in Iraq, acknowledging that they were, indeed, security officials.\n\nQumi explained that the Iranian security officials were in Iraq to meet with counterparts in the context of a bilateral \nagreement to resolve security.  As such, he argued that the Iranians should never have been detained in the first \nplace.  Additionally, Qumi dismissed United States' claims that Iranians were involved in the orchestration of \nattacks against Iraqi and American forces.\n\nFor its part, however, the United States has maintained the view that there is a mountain of evidence pointing \ntoward Iran's support for militants inside Iraq, even providing bombs and weaponry.  United States President \nGeorge W. Bush warned that his country's forces  would \"respond firmly\" in response to Iran's alleged activities in \nIraq.  Bush also said, \"It makes sense that if somebody is trying to harm our troops or stop us from achieving our \ngoal, or killing innocent citizens in Iraq, that we will stop them,\"  His words appeared to be evidence  of the growing \nand very public standoff between Washington and Tehran.  Bush additionally responded to the Iranian \nambassador's plan to expand ties with Iraq with skepticism.\n\nTo date, the government of Iraq has expressed dismay that it has been caught in the metaphoric cross-fire of \nhostilities between Iran and the United States.  As such, Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki called on both parties to deal \nwith their hostilities outside of Iraq.  To this end, he said, \"We have told the Iranians and the Americans, 'We know \nthat you have a problem with each other, but we are asking you, please solve your problems outside Iraq.' \"                                 \n\nSeptember 23, 2007 saw Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrive in the United States to attend the \nmeeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and also to speak at a forum at Columbia University.\n\nAhmadinejad's visit was met with protests, most especially by opponents of his speaking engagement at Columbia \nUniversity.  He had originally intended to lay a wreath at the site of the September 11, 2001 terror attack in New \nYork, however, police cited security concerns in denying that request.\n\nIn a television interview on the American network CBS for the show, \"60 Minutes,\" the Iranian president took a \nmeasured tone  and said that his country was not building nuclear weaponry.  To that end, President Ahmadinejad \nsaid, \"Well, you have to appreciate we don't need a nuclear bomb. We don't need that. What need do we have for a \nbomb?\" He continued,  \"In political relations right now, the nuclear bomb is of no use. If it was useful it would have \nprevented the downfall of the Soviet Union.\"  President Ahmadinejad also noted that Iran was not embarking on a \n\n\n\npath to war with the United States, saying,  \"It's wrong to think that Iran and the U.S. are walking toward war. Who \nsays so? Why should we go to war? There is no war in the offing.\"\n\nThese assertions were a departure from President Ahmadinejad's announcement several days prior in which he \nharshly issued a warning to any countries considering military  attacks against Iran.   Indeed, an Iranian air force \nofficial noted that if, in a worse case scenario, Iran was attacked by Israel, it had the capacity to respond with air \nand missile raids.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the Bush administration in the United States repeatedly noted that although it \nintended to deal with Iran diplomatically, all possible options remained on the proverbial table.  Meanwhile, the head \nof United States Central Command, Admiral William Fallon, observed that the emotional rhetoric was not \nproductive.  In an interview with al-Jazeera television, he said, \"This constant drum beat of conflict is what strikes \nme, which is not helpful and not useful.\"\n\nIran and the United States have enjoyed poor relations over the years, and bilateral relations were at an all-time low \nover the United States' opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions.  Adding to the tensions were the accusations by the \nUnited States that Iran was assisting Shi'ite militias in Iraq.  These allegations were disputed by the Iranian \ngovernment, which assured its Iraqi counterpart that no such actions were ongoing.                              \n\nIn December 2007, the latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in the United States concluded that Iran halted its \nweapons program in 2003. The NIE, which coalesces information  from the United States' 16 intelligence agencies, \nasserted \"high confidence\" that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 \"in response to international \npressure.\"  The NIE also expressed \"moderate confidence\" in its view that the nuclear weapons program has not \nsince been restarted.  Still, the NIE assessment noted that although Iran appears \"less determined\" to develop \nnuclear weapons, the Middle Eastern country has continued to enrich uranium.  Indeed, the report stated that Iran \nhad successfully installed centrifuges used for the enrichment of uranium but that \"significant technical problems\" \nprevented the operation of new equipment, and deemed the country unable to have actually manufacture a nuclear \nbomb until the 2010-2015 time period.  Accordingly, the NIE reflected similar findings by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA).  Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the nuclear watchdog agency, said, \"The report gives \nme a sigh of relief because it is consistent with our assessment.\"\n\nWhile enriched uranium is, indeed, used to manufacture nuclear weapons, Iran has maintained throughout that its \nnuclear ambitions are peaceful and not oriented toward the proliferation of nuclear bombs.  This latest NIE \nassessment appeared to bolster Iran's claims about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program  -- a point noted \nby IAEA chief ElBaradei who said that  Iran had been \"somewhat vindicated.\"  To that end, Iran's Foreign Minister \nManouchehr Mottaki welcomed the report and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that the NIE findings \nconstituted  \"great victory\" in favor of his country's  stance.  In a speech televised to the country, the Iranian \npresident said that the report was a \"fatal blow\" to those who had stirred the fears and tensions surrounding the \nthreat of nuclear weapons development.\n\nNevertheless, the United States and other Western countries continued to characterize Iran's nuclear development \nas threatening.  With Iran currently subject to both United Nations (U.N.) Security Council sanctions, as well as \nunilateral United States sanctions, there was speculation about how, or if, the sanctions regime would be affected \nby the new information.\n\nUnited States (U.S.) National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley responded to the report by saying that it confirmed \nhis country's concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and asserted that President George W. Bush had crafted  \n\"the right strategy\" on Iran.  In fact, he called on the international community to \"turn up the pressure on Iran,\" and \nencouraged the use of tactics such as sanctions and  diplomatic isolation against Iran. For his part, U.S. President \nBush said that the report did not alter either his view or his policy on Iran. Bush said that in spite of the new \nintelligence, Iran was still a threat to the world.  In fact, he said that the report proved that Iran was still trying to \nenrich uranium, and that it was a \"warning signal\" that Iran could very well restart its weapons program.  Confirming \nHadley's statement, Bush said that the NIE was \"an opportunity for us to rally the international community.\"\n\n\n\nSome of the countries in the West appeared to respond to the U.S. President's rallying call.  French President \nNicolas Sarkozy said that Iran remained a threat and noted that he supported the notion of further sanctions.  \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stopped short of calling or new sanctions against Iran, but agreed that Iran \ncontinued to pose a threat.  She appeared to support the ongoing path saying, \"We and our partners would like to \ncontinue with the U.N. process.\"  Merkel also appeared to call for talks and diplomatic negotiations saying, \"I think \nwe and our partners need to continue to seek dialogue with Iran.\"\n\nYet even with support from France and Germany, the problem for the U.S. was that its very position [that Iran poses \na dire danger to the world] was now mitigated by the NIE findings.  That is to say, the NIE evoked grave skepticism \nabout the very essence of U.S. President Bush's claim only a month prior that action against Iran was needed to \nprevent World War III.  Indeed, the tone from the White House in using the hyperbolic language of \"World War III\" \nwas now very likely to be decried as both alarmist and spurious.  Seizing upon this view, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, a \nspokesperson from the Iranian foreign ministry said, \"This report proves Bush's statements - which always speak of \nthe serious threat of Iran's nuclear program - are unreliable and fictitious.\"\n\nIn fact, the most immediate outcome of the NIE has been the collapse of the argument in favor of military action \nagainst Iran.  As noted just above, the NIE findings undercut the notion of an imminent threat posed by Iran's \nnuclear capacity.  While dissonance on the international stage was expected to continue to smolder over the fact \nthat Iran has continued to abrogate U.N. Security Council edicts that it stop its enrichment of uranium, the \ntemperature of the conflict was expected to decrease. \n\nMeanwhile, U.N. Security Council members, Russia and China, were now less likely to support the notion of \nstrongly intensifying sanctions against Iran.  Both countries were expected to argue that the NIE proved that the \nnuclear threat posed by Iran was now contained.  Indeed, in light of the NIE findings, Russian President Vladimir \nPutin's view on the matter appeared quite prescient.  Putin said that there was no \"concrete evidence\" that Iran was \nbuilding a bomb.\n\nAs such, many analysts concluded that the NIE report very likely served to reinvigorare the diplomatic path.  To that \nend, IAEA head, ElBaradei said, \"I see this report as a window of opportunity. It's a window of opportunity because \nit gives diplomacy a new chance.\"                       \n\nThe United States (U.S.) Pentagon said on January 7, 2008 that five Iranian boats threatened five  U.S. navy ships \nin the Strait of Hormuz, which has functioned as a major oil transportation route. The Pentagon said that the Iranian \nvessels approached and threatened to blow up the U.S. ships in what the U.S. said were international waters.  \nWhen those U.S. ships prepared to open fire, the Iranian vessels -- believed to belong to the Revolutionary Guard -- \nwithdrew.  The U.S. authorities said that Iran's  \"provocative actions\"  could  very well \"lead to a dangerous incident \nin the future.\"  For its part, Iran dismissed the incident as routine saying that the matter was resolved once both \nsides were able to identify one another.  In 2007, a similar incident resulted in the detainment of 15 British sailors \nfor two weeks.\n\nIn May 2008, the United Nations nuclear watchdog group, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) , said that \nIran was withholding some information about its nuclear program.  The IAEA said in a report that Iran was not \nproviding enough information about its nuclear activities despite agreeing to clarity prevailing questions about the \ncountry's  nuclear development program.\n\nAt issue for the IAEA was the fact that Iran has been operating 3,500 centrifuges  in  Natanz.  The IAEA said that \nIran had to provide substantially more details about its nuclear development regime.  For its part, Iran insisted that it \nhad \"left no question unanswered\" and vowed to continue to enrich uranium.\n\nJune 2008 saw  international negotiators put forth a new package, laden with attractive incentives, to Iran aimed at \nhalting that country's nuclear enrichment activities.  The deal was reached after extensive consultations between \n\n\n\nEuropean Union policy chief, Javier Solana, and  Iranian representatives.  The talks were  aimed at resolving many \nof the contentious issues that had, to date, left the nuclear issue in Iran unresolved.\n\nJavier Solana described the new incentive package for Iran as  \"full of opportunities.\"  Solana said the five members \nof the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom,  \nChina, Russia, France) as well as Germany were willing to both recognize Iran's right to have a civilian nuclear \nenergy program, and to assist in its development for peaceful purposes.  To that end, Solana said, \"We are ready to \ncooperate with Iran in the development of a modern nuclear energy program based on the most modern generation \nof light water reactors.\"  He went on to state, \"We can offer Iran legally binding fuel supply guarantees. We are \noffering the construction of nuclear power plants.\" Solana also noted the deal would also include trade benefits for \nIran.\n\nFor its part, Iran has repeatedly warned it would  not accept demands that it  halt its nuclear enrichment activities.   \nNevertheless,  Iran said it would study the proposal.  United States President George W. Bush was quick to suggest \nthat Iran had already dismissed the deal out of hand.  However, Solana pointed out that, in fact, Iran had agreed to \nconsider the deal.\n\nTwo days after the aforementioned incentives package was put forward, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United \nKingdom and President George W. Bush of the United States warned Iran that it should accept their \"offers of \npartnership\" or deal with harsh sanctions as well as increased international isolation.  Brown particularly noted that \nif Iran chose not to respect United Nations resolutions, then it would face a more difficult sanctions regime, including \nthe freezing of overseas assets at Iran's predominant bank and the imposition of energy sanctions.                     \n\nYears after deeming Iran to be part of the \"axis of evil,\" the (United States)  Bush administration in July 2008 offered \nno denial of reports that it would establish a diplomatic presence in Iran.  According to the British newspaper, the \nGuardian, the United States was set to open an interests section in the Iranian capital of  Tehran.\n\nSince the hostage crisis of 1979, the United Sates has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran.\n\nThe United States Department of State released a statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, which noted  \nthat while the United States was not changing its policy in regard to the Iranian government, it was interested in \noutreach to ordinary Iranians. \n\nThat said, the United States was slated to convene talks with Iran in Geneva.  It would be the first time in three \ndecades that a high ranking American diplomat would be involved in such a meeting with Iranian counterparts.   At \nthat meeting, the United  States reinforced its position on Iran's nuclear program, noting that Iranian obstinacy on \nthe matter would lead to a heightened sanctions regime.\n\nThe two developments appeared to indicate a marked departure from the adamant hard line approach taken by the \nBush administration toward Iran to date.  Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, did not shift his more \nhard line stance on Iran.  McCain's rival,  Democratic  presidential nominee, Barack Obama, has consistently been \na strong advocate of involved and engaged negotiations with the Iranians for some time.     Obama's election as \npresident of the United States in 2008, therefore, augured a possible shift in the dynamic with Iran.  While there \nwere possible indications of such a shift, the post-election crisis and crackdown that ensued in Iran in the spring of \n2009 have prevented any progress from taking shape, although President Obama has said that Iran has until the \nend of the year to move to the negotiating table. See below for details.                   \n\nSyria                   \n\nSyria is not an official partner in the campaign on terrorism launched by the United States after the Sept. 11, \n2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Syria has called for a United Nations-led campaign on terrorism. The \ninternational climate after the 2001 attacks seems to have been of benefit to Syria, despite its label as 'sponsor of \nterrorism.' Syria was viewed as being  part of a loose security alliance that cooperated with American authorities. \n\n\n\nSyria was particularly important as a source for intelligence information as well as for its policy of cracking down on \nSyrian Islamists both at home and abroad.                   \n\nHowever, Syria's hosting of Palestinian opposition groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine-General Command that claimed responsibility for killing the Israeli minister of tourism on Oct. 17, \n2001, has been a source of concern to the United States.  Among some experts, it is believed that as long as Syria \nis able to relatively contain these groups and the Lebanese Hezbollah, and as long as no direct links to bin Laden's \nnetwork can be traced to Syria, the United States would not wish  to meddle.\n\nAn indication of indirect United States support for Syria was its tactic approval of Syria's membership as a non-\npermanent member of the United Nations security council in October 2001. These gestures, it was hoped,  might \ncreate the ground for renewed Israeli-Syrian negotiations. In return for its cooperation with the security alliance with \nWashington, Syria hoped to reactivate the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations. While in early 2002, Syria and Israel \ndiscussed a willingness to resume peace talks, none were scheduled in the near future and talks were expected to \nstall as the crisis in the Middle East continued.\n\nIn the last years, since the United States-led war in Iraq, relations between Syria and the United States have not \ntravelled down the most productive path.  Quite contrary to the earlier view that Syria might be instrumental in \nfighting the war on terrorism, the United States began to view Syria as an impediment to its objectives and policies.\n\nRelations between the two countries devolved following Syria's adamant outcry against the United States-led \ninvasion of Iraq in 2003.  In May 2004, steadily-deteriorating relations between Syria and the United States met a \nnew low when the United States decided to impose economic sanctions on Syria because of its alleged support for \nterrorism.\n\nSince that time, well into 2007, the United States has repeatedly accused Syria of secretly  supporting terrorism and \nallowing radicals and militants to cross the border from Syria into Iraq.  The failure to control the border with Iraq \nhas thus, according to the United States, contributed to the ongoing violence in that country, since the overthrow of \nSaddam Hussein. For its part, however, Syrian officials have accused the United States of destabilizing the entire \nMiddle East region by its actions in Iraq.  In this regard, Syria joined Jordan in calling for a withdrawal of \n\"occupation forces\" from Iraq in mid-2004.\n\nThe two situations contributed to deteriorating relations between the two countries, made worse by the United \nStates' decision to close off high-level talks with Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian authorities thwarted an attempted terrorist attack against the United States embassy in \nDamascus on Sept. 12, 2006.  While a Syrian security guard was shot by the attackers, there were no other \ncasualties. Syrian authorities then shot those responsible for the attempted terrorist attack. The scenario could \neasily have ended tragically since it was revealed that a car packed with explosives was found in close proximity to \nthe embassy but was never detonated.  United States Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice thanked Syrian \nauthorities for their efforts in handling the situation.  Whether or not this scenario would advance poor bilateral \nrelations was unknown.\n\nIn May 2007, the United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, held landmark talks with her Syrian \ncounterpart, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, at a summit in Egypt.  It was the first  high level meeting between \nWashington D.C. and Damascus in several years, and came at a time when bilateral relations between the two \n\n\n\ncountries had badly-devolved.  The United States has accused Syria of trying to influence the political scene in \nboth  Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nIt was difficult to determine whether the talks, which were held during a summit aimed at advancing stability and \neconomic relief in Iraq, would yield positive long-term benefits.  Until this point, the Bush administration in the \nUnited States had eschewed such high-level contact with Syria, and even railed against Democratic House Speaker \nNancy Pelosi for meeting with the Syrians only weeks earlier.\n\nThe 2008 election that brought Barack Obama to power in the United States augured the possibility of further \nengagement with Syria.  To that end, bilateral talks in 2009 were reported to have been \"productive.\"\n\nNote on Iraq\n\nSee  above section titled \"War in Iraq\" for foreign policy issues and developments related to Iraq.\n\nSpecial Report:  Indications of Post-Bush Era Foreign Policy \n\nDespite frequent  assertions by the Bush administration in the United States that there be no fixed  timeline for the \nwithdrawal of troops from Iraq, the United States and Iraq agreed in July 2008  to establish a \"time horizon\" for the \nreduction of United States troops in Iraq.  The agreement was part of the formal Status of Forces Agreement forged \nbetween   President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which would allow a continued \npresence of United States forces in Iraq after the expiration of the existing United Nations mandate at the close of \n2008.  The agreement  came a week after the Iraqi leader said he wanted a timetable for the United States troop \nwithdrawal -- something the Bush administration has not endorsed.\n\nFor its part, the United States has been reluctant to advance such a timetable out of fear that security gains could \nbe erased.  President Bush has said that a fixed timetable would embolden violent insurgents. That said,   the \ncurrent \"time horizon\" offering appeared to be a compromise in the security deal being negotiated.  While the actual \ndistinction between a timetable and a time horizon would inevitably provide fodder for debate, the Bush \nadministration was nonchalant about the idea that it was reversing its previous hard line position on the matter. \nInstead, the White House said that troop reductions in the future  would be \"based on continued improving \nconditions on the ground and not an arbitrary date for withdrawal.\"                   \n\nAfter the news broke about a \"time horizon\" for the withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq,  Prime Minister al-\nMaliki expressed support for the troop withdrawal plans proposed by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, \nBarack Obama, during an interview with Der Spiegel.\n\nIn reference to Obama's 16-month withdrawal timetable (barring complications), Maliki said,  \"That, we think, would \nbe the right timeframe for a withdrawal, with the possibility of changes.\" The Iraqi prime minister did not expressly \nendorse presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's candidacy, saying instead, \"who they [Americans] choose \nas their president is the Americans' business.\" He then continued, \"But it's the business of Iraqis to say what they \nwant.\"  Nevertheless,  Maliki's views on the notion of a timeline appeared to be in line with Obama's stance on the \nissue.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iraq government  somewhat backtracked from these remarks, suggesting that Der Speigel \nhad \"misunderstood and mistranslated\" the Iraqi prime minister.  The spokesperson did not, however, specify how \nprecisely this  misunderstanding or mistranslation might have occurred. Regardless, the German publication, Der \nSpeigel,  issued a strong assertion stating it \"stands by its version of the conversation.\"\n\n\n\nSoon thereafter, Der Speigel provided an audio recording of the Maliki interview to the New York Times, which \nappeared to bear out the fact that Maliki found Obama's 16-month withdrawal timetable to be illustrative of the \nDemocratic contender's understanding of the situation on the ground in Iraq.\n\nIn the direct translation from Arabic, as published by the New York Times, Maliki said: \"Obama's remarks that \u2014 if \nhe takes office \u2014 in 16 months he would withdraw the forces, we think that this period could increase or decrease a \nlittle, but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in Iraq.\"  He continued: \"Who wants to exit in a \nquicker way has a better assessment of the situation in Iraq.\"                \n\nThis synergy could well help shore up support for Obama's foreign policy credentials, particularly in regard to the \ndifficult question of how to (if possible) disengage from Iraq.   Obama had consistently said he would end the war in \nIraq and withdraw United States troops from that country in a careful manner.  He has called for a 16-month phased \nwithdrawal timetable pending given conditions on the ground.  (Note: Obama was also helped by the fact that \nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown also expressed concurrence for the notion of a 16-month timetable.)\n\nBy contrast, Maliki's suggestion that Obama had \"a better assessment of the situation in Iraq\" was not expected to \nhelp the presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain.  For his part, McCain has opposed a withdrawal timeline \nand  has said that he expects United States troops to be in Iraq for a long time, assuming that the Iraqi government \nsanctions the American presence in that country.  McCain's presidential hopes have largely rested on his own \nheroic military experience and perceived understanding of foreign policy, both of which have strong resonance at \nhome in the United States.               \n\nBenefiting from apparent support from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for Barack Obama's 16-month phased \nwithdrawal timetable from Iraq, the Democratic contender for the American presidency urged greater focus on \nAfghanistan.\n\nThe Obama campaign quickly responded to Maliki's  favorable stance on their proposed withdrawal timetable by \ndirecting attention to Afghanistan.  Obama's top foreign policy adviser, Dr. Susan Rice, said: \"Senator Obama \nwelcomes Prime Minister Maliki's support for a 16-month timeline for the redeployment of US combat brigades. This \npresents an important opportunity to transition to Iraqi responsibility, while restoring our military and increasing our \ncommitment to finish the fight in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThese developments came at a time when Obama was launching an international tour, intended to shore up his \nforeign policy credentials.  Not surprisingly, the Democratic contender commenced his trip in the country he has \nconsistently said requires priority attention: Afghanistan.\n\nDuring a visit to Kabul,  Obama  characterized the increasingly volatile landscape  in Afghanistan as \"precarious \nand urgent.\" As such, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said that Afghanistan should be the main \nfocus of the \"war on terror.\"   In his meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, he promised to continue the fight \nagainst terrorism \"with vigor.\"  Additionally, Obama discussed the illicit narcotics trade and bilateral ties with Karzai.\n\nSpeaking from across Afghanistan, Obama was interviewed for the CBS program \"Face the Nation.\" In that \ninterview he noted that the Bush administration had been distracted by a \"war of choice\" in Iraq rather than fighting \nthose who were responsible for the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States.  He asserted that the time had \ncome to correct to correct the mistakes made by the Bush administration. Obama also  called for more troops to be \ndeployed to Afghanistan to fight resurgent Taliban, al-Qaida, and other extremist Islamic elements.\n\nObama's priority on Afghanistan was backed by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who expressed concurrence \nwith the Democratic presidential contender on this matter.  Brown  has also expressed support for Obama's \nproposed withdrawal timetable from Iraq.           \n\nNote on Obama's international tour:\n\n\n\nBarack Obama's international tour began in Afghanistan but also included Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France \nand Britain. Obama was accompanied on this international trip by his Senate colleagues --  Republican Senator \nChuck Hagel and Democrat Senator Jack Reed.\n\nObama's rival for the American presidency, John McCain, had criticized him for espousing policies before traveling \nto the Middle East to assess the situation.  Nevertheless, Obama's policies were receiving unexpected sanction \nfrom key global players, as noted above.\n\nEditor's Note:         \n\nObama's election on November 4, 2008 augured a sea change in foreign policy for the United States as discussed \nbelow --         \n\nPresident-Elect Obama on Future Policy:         \n\nIn his first television interview since winning office on November 4, 2008, President-Elect Barack Obama painted a \nportrait of his incoming administration on the CBS show, 60 Minutes.  Signaling a sharp change on the foreign \npolicy front, President-Elect Obama said that he intended to withdraw United States troops from Iraq and \nstrengthen the military effort against al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\n\nOn the first matter, President-Elect Obama said that upon taking office, he would call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand  national security apparatus to  execute a phased troop withdrawal  plan  from Iraq.  On the second matter, he \nnoted that with a worsening security situation in  Afghanistan, there was a need to \"shore up those efforts.\" The \nincoming United States president also asserted that a top priority for his administration  would be \"to stamp out al-\nQaida once and for all,\" including the capture or killing of Osama Bin Laden.\n\nPresident-Elect Obama also said that he intended to repair the United States'  moral standing on the world stage.  \nIn a move both symbolically and concretely focused on such an end, the incoming president of the United States \nsaid that he would close Guantanamo Bay -- the prison camp that has been at the center of  controversy and  legal \ndebate.  Moreover, President-Elect Obama  made clear that his administration would  act in accordance with the \nGeneva Conventions.  He said, \"I'm going to  make sure that we don't torture.\"   Those two measures, said \nPresident-Elect Obama, \"are part and parcel of an effort to regain America's moral stature in the world.\"\n\nGuantanamo to be closed and torture banned; rule of law to be paramount:\n\nIn the first days of his presidency at the start of 2009, Obama  fulfilled a campaign promise by ordering the closure \nof the Guantanamo Bay prison camp within one year. The deadline appeared to be an acknowledgement of the fact \nthat it would take time to finalize arrangements for suspects currently being held at Guantanamo.  The president \nalso ordered the closure of overseas detention centers, sometimes referred to as \"black sites,\" where terror \nsuspects were taken using a controversial practice known as \"extraordinary rendition.\"  In addition, President \nObama ordered a review of military trials for terror suspects and expressly prohibited the use of torture.\n\nAs before, these executive orders signified a clear break -- and indeed, a rebuke -- of the policies of George W. \nBush. Repeating the stance uttered in his inauguration address, President Obama said that the United States would \ncontinue its fight against terrorism, but without relinquishing constitutionally-enshrined precepts and core American \nethics.  \"The United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle against violence and terrorism,\" said \nPresident Obama. \"We are going to do so vigilantly, we are going to do so effectively, and we are going to do so in \na manner that is consistent with our values and our ideals.\"\n\n\"Vigorous Diplomacy\"\n\n\n\nEarlier, in a clear indication of his geopolitical priorities, it was reported that upon becoming the official head of \nstates, President Obama's first calls to foreign leaders included Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah.  This particular cast \nof characters indicated that an Obama administration intended to be quickly engaged  and intensely committed to \nthe Middle East peace process.\n\nTo that end, President Obama  named a high profile envoy to the Middle East.  George Mitchell, who chaired the \nGood Friday Agreement talks in Northern Ireland during the Clinton administration, was asked to revitalize the \nMiddle East peace process.  President Obama, at the same time, named another high profile envoy to Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. Veteran diplomat, Richard Holbrooke, was asked to forge \"a sustainable approach \"to dealing with \nthe volatile Afghan-Pak region.\n\nThis new diplomatic front was on full display when President Obama, Vice-President Biden, and newly-confirmed \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the State Department and emphasized the dual emphasis on vigorous \ndiplomacy and global development.\n\nClinton arrived earlier at the State Department and was greeted like a celebrity with resounding cheers and non-\nstop applause from State Department staffers.  Making it clear that an Obama administration augured a new era for \nAmerican foreign policy, she said, \"President Obama set the tone with his inaugural address, and the work of the \nObama-Biden administration is committed to advancing America's national security, furthering America's interests, \nand respecting and exemplifying America's values around the world.\"\n\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden were set to meet with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, National \nSecurity Advisor James Jones, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, Central Command head in \nIraq, David Petraeus,  Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, and the head  of the Multi-National Force in Iraq, General \nRay Odierno, to discuss the redeployment of United States troops from Iraq.  In this way, Obama was making good \non a campaign promise to quickly convene such a meeting, aimed at bringing the official Iraq war to an end.\n\nSecretary of State Clinton Signals Shift in Foreign Policy --\n\nIn mid-February 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton embarked on her first overseas trip as \nAmerica's leading diplomat in Asia. Her Asian trip included stops in Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China. Not \nsince the 1960s has Asia had the distinction of being the first destination for a United States Secretary of State. \nWorking on behalf of the Obama administration, Secretary of State Clinton indicated that she would focus on a \nrange of issues ranging from climate change and clean energy to the global financial crisis.\n\nOn her first stop in Asia, Clinton assured Japan that the United States intended to maintain strong ties with that \ncountry. Clinton aimed to assuage Tokyo of its primacy, given Tokyo's concern about the possibility of increasing \nrapport between Washington and Beijing.\n\nIn China, the antagonistic dynamic that was cast during the Bush years was on its way out. Instead, Clinton \nsuggested that she, on behalf of the Obama administration, would strive to cultivate a more cooperative relationship \nbetween Washington and Beijing. This stance was not unexpected since Clinton has often emphasized the \nimportance of improving Sino-American relations. Clinton did receive some criticism because human rights issues \nwere left off the agenda in her meetings in Beijing. For her part, Secretary of State Clinton noted that while she did, \nindeed, hope to press China on issues including the status of Tibet and human rights, her immediate focus involved \nthe global economic crisis. To that end, she said, \"Our pressing on those issues can't interfere on the global \neconomic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis.\"\n\nOverall, Secretary of State Clinton emphasized the significance of Asian-American ties. Striking a clearly \ncollaborative tone, and making it apparent that Asia would factor as highly as Europe, the United States Secretary \nof State said during an address to the Asia Society, \"I hope to signal that we need strong partners across the \nPacific, just as we need strong partners across the Atlantic.\" She continued, \"We are, after all, both a trans-Atlantic \n\n\n\nand trans-Pacific power.\" Upon arriving in Asia, Clinton said, \"I have come to Asia on my first trip as secretary of \nstate to convey that America's relationships across the Pacific are indispensable to addressing the challenges and \nseizing the opportunities of the 21st century.\"\n\nIn this way, Clinton was foregrounding an emphasis on regional alliances from east to west. At the philosophical \nlevel, Clinton was also indicating a return to the integrationist model of international relations. It was an ostensible \ndeparture from the hegemonic mode of neoconservative policy, which was made famous under the Bush-Cheney \nadministration.\n\nBefore arriving in Asia on her first overseas trip, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned North \nKorea against any \"provocative action and unhelpful rhetoric.\" En route to Asia, Clinton said that North Korea had to \nadhere to its commitments to dismantle its nuclear programs. She said, \"The North Koreans have already agreed to \ndismantling...We expect them to fulfill the obligations that they entered into.\"\n\nBut the United States' top diplomat was also critical of the Bush administration for abandoning the 1994 agreement \nwith North Korea, which was forged during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The 1994 framework, which called for \nNorth Korea to give up its weapons program, collapsed when the Bush administration accused Pyongyang of \nmaintaining a parallel (secondary) enriched uranium program. Clinton suggested that Pyongyang's decision to \nrestart its nuclear program may have been partially due to the Bush administration's intemperate accusations of \nNorth Korea.\n\nClinton was confronted with a significant challenge on the trip to Asia, and particularly, the Korean peninsula. \nAmidst devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, North Korea was hinting that it was preparing to test-fire \nthe long-range Taepodong-2 missile. As well, North Korea was declaring its right to launch a \"space program.\" \nSince North Korea has, in the past, characterized rocket launches in similar terms, it was believed that the term \n\"space program\" or satellite launch was associated with the anticipated missile launch. Accordingly, Clinton was \ntasked with taking a strong positions on, first, the missile test, and second, on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, \nwhile also working to reinvigorate the diplomatic process in the region and improving relations between Pyongyang \nand Washington.\n\nTo these ends, Clinton warned that relations between her country and North Korea were unlikely to improve unless \nPyongyang was willing to engage in dialogue with Seoul. Clinton, who was speaking in the South Korean capital, \ntook a sharp tone as she called on North Korea to bring an end to its nuclear ambitions, consistent with the \nprovisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. She also characterized the notion of a missile test \nas \"provocative.\" Nevertheless, Clinton made clear that diplomacy was the central focus of her objectives by \nannouncing a special envoy to North Korea. Clinton named former Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, who served in \nSouth Korea from 1997 to 2000, to that role.\n\nRelations between the United States and North Korea were likely to be quickly tested.  At issue was the \naforementioned satellite launch by North Korea.\n\nIn fact, by March 2009, North Korea was threatening to go to war with any entity that tried to shoot down the \nsatellite it intended to launch. A statement by the North Korean military read, \"We will retaliate any act of \nintercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter-strikes by the most powerful military means.\"  It \nalso included the following assertion: \"Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war.\" \n\nIn a presumed effort to augment its warning, North Korea said its military was placed on full combat alert.  This \nwarning came  at a time when scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were \nabout to commence.\n\nMeanwhile, the newly-appointed United States envoy to North Korea, , Stephen Bosworth, who was in Asia to \nrevitalize six-party denuclearization talks, noted that a launch by North Korea would be \"ill advised.\"\n\n\n\nIn early April 2009, North Korea said that its attempt to launch a satellite into orbit ended in failure with parts of the \nrocket landing in the Pacific Ocean. But such an end did little to quell the international outcry. Throughout, the \nUnited States and South Korea have said that North Korea's claim of launching a satellite in space was just a cover \nfor an actual missile test of the Taepodong-2. Accordingly, they have urged the United Nations Security Council to \nissue a strong response at an impending emergency session, which was called by Japan. The United States, South \nKorea and Japan regard the launch to be an abrogation of United Nations Security Resolution 1718, which in 2006 \nbanned North Korea from ballistic missile activity. On the other side of the equation, China and Russia have \nadvocated a restrained and measured response.\n\nRelations between the United States and China were quickly put to the test in March 2009. The United States \nPentagon said that five Chinese ships  manoeuvred in close proximity to an unarmed United States navy vessel -- \nthe USNS Impeccable --  in the South China Sea.  United States authorities said that one Chinese navy intelligence \nship and four other Chinese vessels were acting in an \"increasingly aggressive\" manner over the course of days \nleading up to this incident.  They described the incident as the ships moving dangerously close to the USNS \nImpeccable, which was conducting routine ocean surveillance in international waters.  They described the moves by \nthe Chinese ships as  \"unprofessional manoeuvres\"  and \"harrassment.\"  Accordingly, United States authorities \nindicated they would be launching a protest, pointing to the violation of international law that calls for respectful and \nresponsible regard  for the rights and safety of other vessels on the sea.  There was no  response from the Chinese \ngovernment at the time of writing. \n\nMeanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was scheduled to travel to the Middle East at the start of \nMarch 2009. On the agenda at a meeting of international donors at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh was the \nreconstruction of Gaza in the aftermath of the Israeli military operation into that Palestinian territory. Clinton, on \nbehalf of the United States, was expected to pledge $900 million to the cause of reconstruction, which was only to \nbe distributed if the Palestinians met certain key conditions, as dictated by the Quartet of Middle East mediators \n(the Quartet is composed of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations). Ahead of the \nmeeting in Egypt, Clinton said, \"I will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package. But it will only be \nspent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted.\" Clinton was also \nscheduled to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders during her trip to the region.\n\nThe Matter of Iran's Nuclear Program --\n\nAs of early 2009, it was yet to be seen how the nuclear issue and the broader matter of foreign relations between \nIran and other country would be handled given the new balance of power in the United States.  United States \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the top diplomat for the new Obama administration, has signaled the possibility \nof  talks with Iran.\n\nThat said, on February 20, 2009, a new report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog entity, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), asserted that Iran was understating how much uranium it had enriched, and that it \nhad built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel.  According to reports by Reuters, the discrepancy in the amount of uranium \nbelieved to have been enriched and the amount enriched in actuality was not due to subterfuge by Iran, but rather, \na result of a technical mistake.\n\nThe Obama administration in the United States expressed concern over these revelations and called on the \ninternational community to address the matter with urgency. White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs said, \"The \nreport represents another lost opportunity for Iran as it continues to renege on its international obligations.\"\n\nOn March 1, 2009, the United States senior military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, said that Iran had enough \nnuclear material to manufacture a bomb. In an interview on the cable network CNN, the chairman of the United \nStates Joint Chiefs of Staff said, \"We think they do, quite frankly. And Iran having a nuclear weapon, I've believed \nfor a long time, is a very, very bad outcome for the region and for the world.\" This assertion by Mullen came two \n\n\n\nweeks after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in report that Tehran had increased its stockpile of \nfissile nuclear material.\n\nThere were some analysts, such as David Albright, president of Washington-based  Institute for Science and \nInternational Security, have said that the Iranian stockpile was enough to be converted into enriched uranium \nsufficient for building one bomb (reported by Agence France Presse). But that view was not shared by United \nStates Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who said on an interview on the NBC news show, Meet the Press, \"I \nthink that there has been a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons \nprogram? They're not close to a stockpile. They're not close to a weapon at this point.\"\n\nAmidst the rising tide of anxiety over Iran's nuclear ambitions, there were questions of how Israel -- a sworn enemy \nof Iran -- would respond. According to a report published by the Daily Telegraph of London, Israel has launched \ncovert operations against Iran, which include plans to assassinate nuclear scientists.\n\nDrawing upon both United States and other Western intelligence sources, the report in the Daily Telegraph of \nLondon noted that Israel was using \"hit men,\" \"double agents\" and \"front companies,\" in targeted efforts to \nsabotage Iran's nuclear program by eliminating \"key human assets.\" The report made mention of the death of an \nIranian scientist at the Isfahan uranium plant. It reported of rumors linking the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, \nwith the gas poisoning death of Ardeshire Hassanpour in 2007.\n\nPresident Barack Obama offers \"new beginning\" and possibility of engagement with Iran --\n\nMaking good on a campaign promise, United States President Barack Obama offered the possibility of diplomatic \nengagement with Iran. In a videotaped message in the third week of March 2009, President Obama said, \"My \nadministration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us.\"\n\nPresident Obama made a point of using the official name of the country when he said that he wanted \"to speak \ndirectly to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" President Obama also indicated that his \nadministration was committed \"to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international \ncommunity.\"\n\nPresident Obama's message was broadcast at the same time as the Iranian festival of Nowruz. The timing may \nhave been orchestrated for its symbolic value since Nowruz is a significant celebration on the Iranian calendar \nmarking the start of spring. Making clear that a new era of diplomacy was ahead, President Obama said, \"With the \ncoming of a new season, we're reminded of this precious humanity that we all share. And we can once again call \nupon this spirit as we seek the promise of a new beginning.\"\n\nBut President Obama also struck a warning when he noted, \"This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek \ninstead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect.\" He continued, \"The United States wants the \nIslamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right - but it comes with \nreal responsibilities.\"\n\nIn response, an advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cautiously welcomed the United States \nPresident Obama's message but called for a fundamental shift in American foreign policy. Of particular concern to \nIran was the United States' support for Israel, according to Ahmadinejad's advisor, Ali Akbar Javafekr, who also \nsaid that the sanctions against Iran had to end. He continued, \"By fundamentally changing its behavior, America \ncan offer us a friendly hand.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a less diplomatic reaction, \ninstead demanding that the United States radically change its policies.\n\nTense relations between the Washington D.C. and Tehran have been ongoing for decades but took a particularly \nnegative turn when President Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, referred to Iran as part of the \"axis of evil.\" \nBilateral relations devolved further when Iran decided to pursue its controversial nuclear program.\n\n\n\nTo date, the United States and many other countries have expressed anxieties about Iran's nuclear ambitions, \nwhich the Iranian government has maintained is for peaceful purposes and not intended to build atomic weaponry. \nThe United States, first under the Bush administration, and now under the Obama administration, wants Iran to \nabandon its nuclear enrichment activities. That said, analysts surmise that in advancing this overture, President \nObama has signaled interest in building a more constructive relationship with Tehran before directly confronting the \nnuclear issue.\n\nIndeed, Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, characterized Obama's overture as \"very \nconstructive\" and called on Iran to heed the United States' president's core message. Whether or not Iran's \ngovernment was willing to do so was yet to be determined. Other Middle Eastern players were nevertheless \napplauding President Obama's gesture. Khaled Meshaal, the exiled political leader of Hamas, gave credit to the \nAmerican president for using \"a new language\" for the Middle East.\n\nWith that said, the contested election in Iran in 2009, followed by a brutal crackdown on the opposition by the hard \nliners in that country, have only served to return bilateral relations to a strained state. \n\nAs noted elsewhere in this Country Review, United States Vice-President Joe Biden said in a July 2009 interview \nwith ABC News that has  the Obama administration would not stop  Israel from striking Iranian nuclear facilities.  \nBiden said that the United States would not  \"dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do.\"  \nBiden also said  that President Barack Obama's overture  of engagement with Iran remained on the table.  That \noffer for talks would end at the close of 2009.  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \nsuggested that his country would deal with the nuclear threat posed by Iran, if the government in Tehran was \nunwilling to enter negotiations.  For its part, Iran has said that it would guarantee a strong response if its facilities \nwere attacked by Israel. \n\nExit strategy for Afghanistan also on the agenda --\n\nAlso on the agenda with regard to United States foreign policy was the matter of Afghanistan.  The Obama \nadministration was expected to unveil a new strategy for dealing with Afghanistan.  To that end, even as the \nadministration deployed more troops to that country to deal with the resurgence of the Taliban and the devolving \nsecurity situation there, President Obama noted during an interview on CBS television show 60 Minutes that there \nmust be an \"exit strategy\" with regard to the United States policy in Afghanistan.  He said, \"There's got to be a \nsense that this is not a perpetual drift\"  and emphasized that the cemtral mission was to ensure that al-Qaida was \nnot able to carry attacks against the United States.\n\nGiving a glimpse of the new strategy for Afghanistan,  Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy to \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, said that the  United States would no longer treat the two countries separately.  He said, \n\"In the past, the United States government stove-piped it, they had an Afghan policy and a Pakistan policy. We \nhave to integrate the two and I hope the rest of the world will join us in that effort.\"\n\nHolbrooke also indicated that there would be no further neglect of the region, suggesting  more attention in terms of \ntroop strength and resources would be in the works.\n\nIn May 2009, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced the replacement of General David \nMcKiernan --the commander of United States-led forces in the field in Afghanistan. Secretary Gates explained the \ndecision had been made because the fight against the Taliban required \"new thinking.\"  To that apparent end, \nSecretary Gates said the new commander would be General Stanley McChrystal, whose background as a specialist \nin counter-insurgency would apparently yield necessary insight and leadership in the fight against the Taliban.\n\nThe move was part of a strategic shift by the Obama administration to not only strengthen armed forces on the \nground, but also to use non-military methods to fight the Taliban. In fact, Secretary Gates' announcement came at a \ntime when the United States was set to increase its military combat presence by 21,000 in Afghanistan (the existing \n\n\n\nforce numbered 38,000).  That move, however, was sure to be met with resistance in Afghanistan where Afghan \nPresident Hamid Karzai was under pressure to decrease combat operations in his country in the aftermath of a \nUnited States airstrike that left 150 people dead.\n\nLeaders forge $1 trillion deal at G-20 summit in London --\n\nLeaders of the world's largest economies, known as the \"G-20,\" met in London in April 2009  to explore possible \nresponses to the global financial crisis. To that end, they forged a deal valued at more than one trillion dollars \n(USD).\n\nCentral to the agreement was an infusion of $750 billion to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was aimed \nat helping troubled economies. Up to $100 billion of that amount was earmarked to assist the world's very poorest \ncountries -- an amount far greater than had been expected. In many senses, the infusion of funding to the IMF \nmarked a strengthening of that body unseen since the 1980s.\n\nIn addition, the G-20 leaders settled on a $250 billion increase in global trade. The world's poorest countries would \nalso benefit from the availability of $250 billion of trade credit.\n\nAfter some debate, the G-20 leaders decided to levy sanctions against clandestine tax havens and to institute strict \nfinancial regulations. Such regulations included tougher controls on banking professionals' salaries and bonuses, \nand increased oversight of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. A Financial Stability Board was to be \nestablished that would work in concert with the IMF to facilitate cross-border cooperation, and also to provide early \nwarnings regarding the financial system.\n\nAside from these measures, the G-20 countries were already implementing their own economic stimulus measures \nat home, aimed at reversing the global recession. Together, these economic stimulus packages would inject \napproximately $5 trillion by the end of 2010.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown played host at the meeting, which most concurred went off \nsuccessfully, despite the presence of anti-globalization and anarchist protestors. Prime Minister Brown warned that \nthere was \"no quick fix\" for the economic woes facing the international community, but he drew attention to the \nconsensus that had been forged in the interest of the common good. He said, \"This is the day that the world came \ntogether to fight back against the global recession, not with words, but with a plan for global recovery and for reform \nand with a clear timetable for its delivery.\"\n\nAll eyes were on United States President Barack Obama, who characterized the G-20 summit as \"a turning point\" in \nthe effort towards global economic recovery. He also hailed the advances agreed upon to reform the failed \nregulatory regime that contributed to the financial crisis that has gripped many of the economies across the globe. \nThusly, President Obama declared the London summit to be historic saying, \"It was historic because of the size and \nthe scope of the challenges that we face and because of the timeliness and the magnitude of our response.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, there were reports of a growing rift between the respective duos of France and Germany -- \nand -- the United States and the United Kingdom. While France and Germany were emphasizing stricter financial \nregulations, the United States and the United Kingdom were advocating public spending to deal with the economic \ncrisis. Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy had threatened to bolt the meeting if his priority issues were not \naddressed. But such an end did not occur, although tensions were existent.\n\nTo that end, President Obama was hailed for his diplomatic skills after he brokered an agreement between France \nand China on tax havens. The American president played the role of peacemaker between French President \nSarkozy and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao, paving the way for a meeting of the minds on the matter of tax havens.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the concurrence reached at the G-20 summit were \"more than we could \nhave hoped for.\" President Sarkozy also credited President Obama for the American president's leadership at the \nsummit, effusively stating: \"President Obama really found the consensus. He didn't focus exclusively on stimulus ... \n\n\n\nIn fact it was he who managed to help me persuade [Chinese] President Hu Jintao to agree to the reference to the \n... publication of a list of tax havens, and I wish to thank him for that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also expressed positive feedback about the success of the summit \nnoting that the new measures would give the international arena a \"clearer financial market architecture.\" She noted \nthat the agreement reached was \"a very, very good, almost historic compromise.\" Finally, Chancellor Merkel had \nwarm words of praise for President Obama. \"The American president also put his hand into this,\" said Merkel.\n\nNote: The G-20 leaders agreed to meet again in September 2009 in New York to assess the progress of their \nagenda.\n\nNATO meeting --\n\nOn the heels of the G-20 summit in London, leaders of NATO member states met in the French city of Strasbourg \namidst fierce --and sometimes violent --protests. The NATO meeting was being jointly hosted by the German city of \nKehl although it was France that garnered more attention.\n\nAt the NATO meetings, United States President Barack Obama emphasized the need to repairing his country's ties \nwith Europe in the wake of the Bush era, when unilateralism was the dominating philosophy. President Obama \ncalled for both greater responsibility and increased cooperation for the purpose of advancing global peace and \nsecurity.\n\nPresident Obama calls for nuclear weapons-free world and cooperative action on global security --\n\nAhead of a meeting with European Union leaders in the Czech Republic in April 2009, United States President \nBarack Obama called for a world free of nuclear weaponry and cooperative action on global security.\n\nIn a speech to a receptive audience of 20,000 at a castle in Prague, President Obama expressed hopes of forging \nnew agreements aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, including an end to the production of fissile \nmaterials used to create such weapons. He also said that his administration would work to bring the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force in order to end nuclear testing. To date, the CTBT has not been \nratified by either the United States or China, and it has not been signed by either India or Pakistan.\n\nPresident Obama referenced North Korea's rocket launch, characterizing it as \"provocative,\" and emphasizing that \nit illustrated the crucial need for action. He said, \"North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will \nnever come through threats and illegal weapons.\" President Obama also noted that Iran posed a potential nuclear \nthreat and, as such, the United States would move forward with its missile defense system in Eastern Europe. The \nAmerican leader warned of al-Qaida's desire to acquire a nuclear bomb and the immediate threat to global security \nsaying, \"One terrorist with a nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.\"\n\nThat said, President Obama said that his administration was committed to ultimately reducing the United States' \nnuclear arsenal, noting that the very existence of thousands of nuclear weapons was \"the most dangerous legacy of \nthe Cold War.\" He recounted a recent meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at the G-20 summit in \nLondon where the two leaders agreed to restart negotiations aimed at reducing nuclear warheads.\n\nAcknowledging that a nuclear weapons-free world was unlikely to be realized in his lifetime, President Obama made \nclear that he intended to work toward that outcome.\n\nU.S. president makes surprise visit to Baghdad --\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama made a surprise trip to Baghdad in early April 2009. He arrived in Iraq \nduring his return trip from Europe where he attended the G-20, NATO and European Union summits. In an address \nto cheering United States troops serving in Iraq, he reiterated his 2010 intended timetable to withdraw most United \nStates troops from Iraq, and he noted that the time had come for Iraqis \"to take responsibility for their country.\"\n\n\n\nHours before President Obama's arrival in Iraq, a series of coordinated car bombings in Baghdad left at least 34 \npeople dead. A few days later, another Baghdad bombing killed nine people. Then, on April 9, 2009, a bomb \nexploded at a shopping area in a predominantly Shi'ite Kadhamiya part of Baghdad. Seven people were reported to \nhave died and more than 20 others were injured as a result of the blast. The location of the attack was in proximity \nto the tomb of Imam Mousa al-Kazim -- a significant Shi'a shrine -- thus suggesting a sectarian motive. While the \nlevel of violence has generally declined over the course of the last year -- indeed to the lowest levels since the post-\ninvasion insurgency began -- the spate of recent attacks has raised some degree of anxiety about increasing \nsectarian hostilities and concomitant violence.\n\nCIA shuts down its secret prisons --\n\nIn April 2009,  the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Leon Panetta, announced an end to the global \nnetwork of clandestine prisons that had been used to detain terrorism suspects. The prisons, also known as \"black \nsites,\" gained notoriety for being the venue of harsh interrogation techniques, indeed torture, used on terrorism \nsuspects. Shortly after his inauguration to office, President Barack Obama vowed to close down these facilities. \nMaking good on that promise, Panetta wrote in a letter to staff, \"CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black \nsites.\"\n\nSpecial Coverage: President Obama orders dramatic rescue of ship captain from pirates --\n\nIn April 2009, Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean. The vessel was destined to dock at \nMombassa in Kenya and was carrying food aid destined for Somalia, Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nThe Somali pirates, armed with guns, moved into proximity of the Maersk Alabama via a small boat. They used \nropes and hooks to climb aboard the vessel and then began demonstrating their gunfire. Captain Richard Phillips \nordered his crew to lock themselves in a secure cabin and gave himself over to captors.\n\nWhile the crew was able to regain control of the vessel and eventually reach its destination, Captain Phillips was \ntaken hostage and placed on a small lifeboat under the control of the pirates. He made one unsuccessful attempt to \nescape by diving into the water but was pulled back aboard by his captors.\n\nUnited States warships and a helicopter quickly moved from other locations in the region to the site of the incident, \nbut there was no immediate attempt to rescue Captain Phillips. Negotiators from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation were then deployed in an effort to secure the captain's release. Those hostage negotiations with the \nSomali pirates, however, soon devolved with no agreement being forged. Some reports suggested that the sticking \npoint in the negotiations was the United States' insistence that the the pirates be arrested and brought to justice.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House was tight-lipped about the situation until the dramatic rescue was complete. To that \nend, President Obama twice gave orders to use force to secure Captain Phillips' release.\n\nAccording to reports, United States snipers were perched on the navy warship. From their vantage point, they saw \na pirate direct a weapon toward Captain Phillips, thus prompting the need for immediate action. The snipers opened \nfire, killing three of the pirates. The fourth pirate surrendered to the navy forces. With the pirates no longer a threat, \nnavy personnel boarded the lifeboat and discovered Captain Phillips unharmed but bound by ropes.\n\nAt a Pentagon briefing in Bahrain, Vice Admiral William Gortney, the head of the United States Naval Central \nCommand explained the need to use force in the rescue saying, \"The on-scene [navy] commander determined that \nthe captain was in imminent danger.\" He continued, \"He had a weapon aimed at him - that would be my \ninterpretation of imminent danger.\"\n\nUnited States authorities acknowledge that the dramatic rescue could well motivate the targeting of Western \nvessels in region. To date, such hijackings have been relatively bloodless and aimed at procuring hefty ransoms. \n\n\n\nBut this strong response by the United States, coming on the heels of a similarly dramatic rescue by French military \nof four French citizens just days before, could well raise the proverbial stakes.\n\nSpeaking to this issue, Vice Admiral Gortney warned, \" This could escalate violence in this part of the world, no \nquestion about it.\" On the other side of the equation, various media reports indicated that self-identified pirates on \nthe Somali coastal town of Eyl were now identifying the United States navy as their prime enemy target.\n\nNevertheless, President Obama expressed satisfaction that Captain Phillips had been rescued and hailed the ship's \ncaptain for his courage, noting that it was \"model for all Americans.\" President Obama also noted that he intended \nto directly confront the growing threat of piracy in the unsafe waters off the eastern coast of Africa.\n\nFollowing his rescue, Captain Phillip was released and was said to be resting on the United States warship, the \nUSS Bainbridge. He was then transferred to the USS Boxer where he was to have a medical examination. Captain \nPhillips was in contact with his family in his home state of Vermont and anticipated a reunion with them within days.\n\nA spokesperson for the Maersk shipping line read a statement on behalf of the Phillips family expressing their relief \nthat the ordeal was over. For his part, Captain Phillips was reported to have dismissed praise of his own courage, \ninstead saying, \"I'm just the byline, the heroes are the Navy seals who brought me home.\"\n\nSummit of Americas in Trinidad:\n\nU.S. President Obama calls for \"new beginning\" with Cuba, shares handshake with Chavez, and explains doctrine \nof engagement --\n\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) convened the Summit of the Americas on April 17, 2009 for two days in \nTrinidad and Tobago and involved participation of by the heads of state of 34 democratic countries in the Western \nHemisphere. The OAS has noted that Trinidad and Tobago would be distinguished as the first Caribbean country to \nhost the summit. The meeting was set to take place at the Trinidad Hyatt in the country's capital city of Port of \nSpain. Typically, the Summit of the Americas has focused on issues including poverty alleviation, fighting narcotics \ntrafficking, anti-terrorism measures, as well as strengthening democratic governance.\n\nAhead of the summit, on February 26, 2009, the OAS Secretary General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza announced that that \nthe economic crisis  would be addressed during the meetings of the 34 leaders of OAS member nation states in \nApril 2009.\n\nSpeaking at an Ordinary Session of 2009 of the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG), which brought \ntogether the member states' negotiators to consider the Draft Declaration of Commitment of Port-of Spain, Insluza \nexplained that the main focus would be upon the global financial and economic crisis on the region.  He said, \"We \nwould like to have a declaration soon, so that the Heads of State and Government can read and examine it before \nattending the Summit; especially as there will be necessary modifications, after the G20 meeting ( that will be held \nin London on April 2nd), on the big topic about the economic crisis.\"\n\nBut by April 2009, while the financial and economic challenges continued to dominate the public purview, the focus \nof the summit appeared to be evolving.  Indeed, relations with and policies regarding Cuba began to command \nattention.  At issue were ties between the United States-Cuba and the prevailing policy of the United States to \nCuba.  These matters bubbled to the surface when the Obama administration in the United States decided to \nreverse restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba.  See above for details.\n\nAt the broader level, other member states of the OAS were expected to place pressure on the United States to \nallow Cuba to re-enter its hemispheric body after decades of being suspended from participation.  Cuba's \nsuspension in 1962 has rested on the fact that it is governed by the personalist regime of the Castro brothers and \nnot a democratically-elected government.  The OAS resolution cast Cuba's communist system as incompatible with \nthe democratic principles of the regional grouping.\n\n\n\nIn an opinion editorial published in the Trinidad and Tobago Express on April 16, 2009, United States President \nBarack Obama signaled the spirit of change in hemispheric relations.  He wrote, \"We can overcome our shared \nchallenges with a sense of common purpose, or we can stay mired in the old debates of the past. For the sake of all \nour people, we must choose the future.\"\n\nStaying on the theme of past versus the future, President Obama said that the United State-Cuba relationship was \noften \"dragged back to the 20th century\" and eschewed the usual communism versus capitalism debate.  Instead, \nthe United States leader called for \"pragmatic and responsible action\"  aimed at advancing \"common prosperity.\"  \nHe likewise urged \"practical cooperation\" in the areas of security, energy and economic recovery.\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged that the United States had not always maintained engagement in the region, \nnoting, \"We have been too easily distracted by other priorities, and have failed to see that our own progress is tied \ndirectly to progress throughout the Americas.\"  He continued, \"My administration is committed to renewing and \nsustaining a broader partnership between the United States and the hemisphere on behalf of our common \nprosperity and our common security.\" To that end, the president outlined a regional effort to confront the economic \nand financial crisis, while propelling forward renewable and sustainable energy, which would itself address the \nthreat of climate change manifest by the diminishing glaciers of the Andes and the rise of sea level in the \nCaribbean.\n\nPresident Obama emphasized that the OAS member states have had their own paths but that they must be \"joined \ntogether\" in the pursuit of \"liberty, equality and human rights.\"  With a nod to Cuba, President Obama expressed \nthe hope that all OAS countries might one day sit at the table.  President Obama suggested that even as his \ncountry extended its hand to Cuba -- in the form of the new policy changes -- the following move would have to \ncome from Havana.  In essence, the United States leader was noting that Havana should reciprocate the \nadministration's decision to change its policy by allowing travel and remittances to Cuba.\n\nWithin 24 hours, Cuban President Raul Castro responded by making clear that Cuba would welcome talks with the \nUnited States; he also signaled that  all topics would be open for discussion.  Such a position has stood in contrast \nto previous stances by Havana, upon which matters such as human rights  and political prisoners were not \nwelcomed subjects of discourse.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was traveling in the Caribbean en route to Trinidad,  \ncharacterized Raul Castro's comments as a \"very welcome gesture.\"\n\nShe said, \"We welcome his comments, the overture they represent and we are taking a very serious look at how we \nintend to respond.\"\n\nIn the background of these developments, the OAS head, Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza, indicated that he \ncould call on member states to  re-admit Cuba 47 years after the communist country was suspended from the \nhemispheric body via the 1962 resolution.  Such a decision was not soon to come but would likely be addressed at \nthe OAS general assembly at the end of May 2009.\n\nMost of the OAS countries that ended bilateral ties with Cuba at that time have subsequently restored relations, \nwith the clear exception of the United States.  Accordingly, most OAS states have been sympathetic to the notion of \nending Cuba's exclusion.  Moreover, Havana's rapid response to Washington's policy changes has likely fueled \nthe energy surrounding the Cuba issue.\n\nAt the opening ceremony of the Summit of Americas at the Hyatt in Port of Spain, President Obama reiterated his \nadministration's desire to accentuate engagement with other countries in the Western Hemisphere and to work \ncooperatively on the economic, political, energy-related, and security-oriented issues.  The details of such efforts \nnotwithstanding, it was Obama's emphasis on international engagement that took center stage.  He said, \"There is \nno senior partner and junior partner in our relations; there is simply engagement based on mutual respect, common \ninterests and shared values.\"  This lexicon marks a broader transformation from the United States on foreign policy \nfrom a more hegemonic positioning to one of practical cooperation.\n\n\n\nBut all attention was focused on whether or not the United States president would overtly address Cuba.  Indeed, at \nthe close of his speech on opening day at the summit, President Obama made a history-making assertion when he \nexpressly said, \"The United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba.\"  He acknowledged that such an endeavor \nwould entail a \" longer journey to be traveled to overcome decades of mistrust.\"\n\nNevertheless, he emphasized that there were \"critical steps\" that could be taken \"toward a new day.\" In a tacit \nacknowledgment of Raul Castro's offer of open discussion, President Obama warned that he was \"not interested in \ntalking for sake of talking,\" but he made it clear  that he looked  forward to a new era in bilateral relation with Cuba.  \nPresident Obama ended by auguring the spirit of change between Washington and Havana.  He said, \"I do believe \nwe can move U.S.-Cuban relations in a new direction.\"\n\nOther developments at the summit involved a convivial handshake between President Obama and Venezuelan \nPresident Hugo Chavez.  The Venezuelan leader, known for his anti-American rhetoric, reportedly offered \nfriendship to President Obama and also gave him a book as a gift, albeit one that detailed perceived ills of \nAmerican hegemony.\n\nNevertheless, President Chavez approached Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to tell her that he was restoring \ndiplomatic representation in Washington.  He also expressed hopes for improved bilateral relations on state \ntelevision saying , \"We ratify our willingness to begin what has started: cementing new relations.  We have the very \nstrong willingness to work together.\"\n\nFacing criticism at home by Republicans who did not look kindly on these encounters between President Obama \nand President Chavez, the United States leader said, \"It's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or \nhaving a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States.\"\n\nAddressing his policy of international engagement, President Barack Obama said on the closing day of the summit  \nthat it \"strengthens our hand\" by reaching out to enemies of the United States.  At an outdoor news conference in \nTrinidad, the American president said that the United States should be a leader and not a lecturer of democracy.  \nExplaining the Obama doctrine of engagement, he said, \"We're not simply going to lecture you, but we're rather \ngoing to show through how we operate the benefits of these values and ideals.\" \n\nSpecial Entry: North Korea conducts nuclear test sparking international action -- \n\nIn April 2009, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from multilateral disarmament talks and restarting its \noperations at the Yongbyon nuclear plant. This decision to withdraw from the negotiating table and resume \nreprocessing spent fuel rods came after the United Nations (UN) Security Council decided to impose sanctions on \nthree North Korean companies.  That decision by the UN Security Council was reached in the aftermath of a \ncontroversial missile launch.  North Korea maintained that it had simply launched a satellite in space and so \ncharacterized the international reaction as\n\n\"a wanton violation of the UN charter.\" In the face of North Korean defiance, the United States Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton has called on North Korea to return to its previous agreement to end its nuclear program on the \nKorean peninsula. \n\nOn May 25, 2009, North Korea said that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  North Korea \nsaid that this test contained more explosive power than an earlier nuclear test conducted in 2006.  Several \nindependent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered,  resulting in the conclusion that it \nwas caused by the nuclear test.  Indeed, the United States Geological Survey said that a 4.7 magnitude seismic \ntremor was detected underground and indicated a nuclear explosion of some kind.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly \nconfrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply \nwith international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid \npackage and the United States was to remove North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors.\n\nLater, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from \nmonitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThere was some speculation that after a woeful harvest, with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in \ndesperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme, Pyongyang may have been trying to divert \nattention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted \nan internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred this action by hard-liner within the regime.\n\nFor its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which \nasserted that the underground nuclear testing had been \"successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance \nthe Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.\"  The statement went on to note that the test was \nintended to \"contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.\"  Pyongyang also \noffered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.\n\nInternational news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired \ntwo short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability \nof United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.\n\nThe international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  \njust a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United \nStates.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama said that the action by North Korea was a threat to international peace and \nstability.  He warned, \"The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international \ncommunity.\"  The American president observed that North Korea was \"not only deepening its own isolation it's also \ninviting stronger international pressure.\"\n\nRussia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations \n(UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718.\n\nIn fact, the Russian Foreign Ministry categorically rebuked North Korea's actions in a statement that read: \"We \ncannot describe the North Korean move other than as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which \nprohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.\"  The statement continued, \"The North Korean nuclear test has \na serious impact on international efforts aiming to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and breaches the \ninternational regime provided by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\"\n\nIndeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and \ncompels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security \nResolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.\n\nNot surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering \nNorth Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at \ndenuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply  with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  \nThe UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger \nmeasures, was in the offing.\n\nUnited States Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more \nstringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, \"The US thinks that this is a grave violation of \ninternational law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will \nseek a strong resolution with strong measures.\"\n\n\n\nOn May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced that it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to \nKorean War.\n\nThe North Korean military said that this action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate \nin  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United \nStates-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a \"declaration of war\" and \npromised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media \nreported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign \nindicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nIn the first week of June 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Korea could well be \nreinstated on her country's list of countries viewed as sponsors of terrorism.  With some politicians in the United \nStates calling for such a response, the country's top diplomat said, \"Well, we're going to look at it. There's a process \nfor it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.\"\n\nNorth Korea was removed from the terror list in October 2008 when it was compliant with a denuclearization \nagreement brokered via multilateral talks.  But North Korea's recent decisions to pursue nuclear activities, manifest \nmost blatantly in an underground nuclear test, as well as a volley of short-range missile tests, have rendered that \nagreement functionally void.\n\nSecretary of State Clinton observed, \"Obviously they were taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is \nbeing thwarted by their actions.\"\n\nSecretary of State Clinton also warned that North Korea was likely to face harsh consequences from the United \nNations, as the international body contemplated a new resolution against North Korea.  To that end, Clinton said, \"  \nWe think we're going to come out of this with a very strong resolution with teeth that will have consequences for the \nNorth Korean regime.\"  She continued, \"If we do not take significant and effective action against the North Koreans \nnow, we'll spark an arms race in North-East Asia.\"\n\nIn the second week of June 2009, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, said in an \naddress to the Korea Society in New York that his government was considering stronger responses to the \nchallenges posed by North Korea's recent missile activities.  He said, \"North Korea's recent actions to develop a \nnuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses.\"  \nHe continued, \"However, the North Korean claim to be responding to a 'threat' or a 'hostile policy' by the United \nStates is simply groundless. Quite to the contrary, we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime \nthrough force, and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly.\"\n\nAmong the possible responses being considered by the United States were financial sanctions, as well as tougher \ninspections of shipping vessels in waters surrounding North Korea.  Related to these possible moves was the \nunanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in \nresponse to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected \nprovision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by \nair, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. \nThe new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of \nheavy and small arms by North Korea.\n\nRosemary DiCarlo, the United States deputy ambassador at the United Nations said: \"North Korea chose a path of \nprovocation. This resolution will give us new tools to impair North Korea's ability to proliferate, and to threaten \ninternational stability.\" For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its \nstocks of plutonium.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that this threat by Pyongyang was both \n\n\n\n\"provocative\" and \"deeply regrettable.\"  She warned that the move would serve only to isolate North Korea even \nfurther from the wider international community.\n\nMeanwhile, a political confrontation between the United States and North Korea could become more likely after \nreports emerged that a North Korea court convicted two American journalists of  \"hostile acts\" and illegal entry into \nthe communist state.  Despite international protests and the two journalists' insistence of innocence, Laura Ling and \nEuna Lee were sentenced them to 12 years in a labor prison. The  families of the two journalists have urged that \nthey not be part of the burgeoning political challenge over North Korea's nuclear activities.\n\nBy the third week of June 2009,  as reports emerged about a long range missile launch by North Korea -- quite \npossibly in the direction of Hawaii -- United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates noted that his country was \"in a \ngood position\" to protect itself.  Secretary Gates said, \"We do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile \nto the west in the direction of Hawaii.\" But he made it clear that the United States had approved the deployment of \nboth radar and missiles \"provide support,\" should the American state of Hawaii face attack.  United States \nPresident Barack Obama later echoed these assurances in an interview with CBS News.  President Obama said,  \n\"This administration - and our military - is fully prepared for any contingencies.\"\n\nThe American president dismissed the notion that it was warning of a military response against North Korea.  But \nhe also said, \"I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.  But I do want to give assurances to the American people \nthat the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted.\"\n\nIn other developments, United States President Barack Obama  renewed its sanctions -- separate from the United \nNations sanctions -- against North Korea.  President Obama explained that North Korea's nuclear development \ncombined with threats posed a national security risk to the United States and destabilized the region of eastern \nAsia. The American president also said his administration would end the cycle of responding to North Korean \nnuclear threats by granting concessions and incentives to Pyongyang.  \n\nOn July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News \nAgency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  \nfrom Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the \"East Sea.\"  The \nmissile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal \nwaters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-\ntype missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the \nEast Sea.\n\nThe timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, \n2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined \nby Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and \nsaid all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense \nsituation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official \nsaid the volley of missile tests were \"not helpful\" and said that North Korea should not \"aggravate tensions\" but \ninstead \"focus on denuclearization talks.\"  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by \nsaying that tensions on t he Korean peninsula should remain \"at manageable levels,\" Japan and South Korea \nstruck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an \"act of provocation.\"\n\nSpecial Entry: President Obama calls for \"a new beginning\" with the Muslim world from Cairo University\n\nSummary:\n\nOn June 3, 2009, United States President Barack Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia on his first stop on a trip to the \nMiddle East.  On June 4, 2009, President Obama traveled onto Egypt where he addressed the Muslim world from  \nCairo University. The trip was aimed at strengthening United States' engagement in the region of the Middle East \nand the broader Islamic world.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised that he would travel to an Arab country to address the \nIslamic world, with an eye on improving America's image in that part of the globe. Obama aimed to regain global \ngoodwill that was abundant after the terror attacks in the United States in 2001, but which he and other Democrats \nhave said was squandered and lost as a result of the previous Bush administration's decision to launch a war in \nIraq. To these ends, President Obama was making good on that promise by traveling from Saudi Arabia to Egypt, \nwhere he was scheduled to offer an address at Cairo University.\n\nAnother rationale for President Obama's trip was a meeting with King Abdullah while in Saudi Arabia. Describing \nthat meeting, President Obama said, \"I thought it was very important to come to the place where Islam began and \nto seek his majesty's counsel and to discuss with him many of the issues that we confront here in the Middle East.\" \nHe continued, \"I am confident that working together, the United States and Saudi Arabia can make progress on a \nwhole host of issues of mutual interest.\"\n\nIndeed, the meeting at the Saudi king's ranch involved dialogue on Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The \nSaudi monarch has long been considered a key player in regional stability, and his sanctioning of any given peace \npath could well advance such an end. It should be noted that some years earlier, the Saudi government advanced \nits own \"land for peace\" deal.\n\nThe Peace Process:\n\nThe trip came on the heels of meetings between the American president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas respectively. President Obama made emphatically clear his \ncommitment to the two-state solution as the ultimate end to the Middle East peace process. President Obama said \nhe believed Israel would see that the two-state solution would help that country achieve sustainable peace and \nsecurity. President Obama also said that all Arab countries would be expected to support and respect the two-state \nsolution, which would essentially require recognition of the legitimacy of the Jewish state.\n\nTo date, the fate of the Palestinian people and the security of Israel have been flashpoints in the quest for peace. \nThe Arab world, with the exception of Egypt and Jordan, have refused to recognize Israel and have used the issue \nof Palestinian sovereign status as a rallying call for anti-American sentiment. Meanwhile, the status of the \nPalestinian people has remained unresolved as various players and interest groups  argue over who is to blame for \nthe situation, and how it might be resolved. For his part, President Obama was to become one more American \nleader in a line of predecessors trying to solve this problem.\n\nAl-Qaida Emerges\n\nMiddle East peace notwithstanding, it was Pakistan that emerged on the landscape as a new rallying call for Islamic \nextremism. As President Obama arrived in the region, there was a message from al-Qaida leader, Osama Bin \nLaden, transmitted on the Arabic television station al-Jazeera. In that message, Bin Laden accused the American \npresident of being behind the ongoing crackdown on militants in Taliban strongholds of Pakistan. The terrorist \nleader warned that Obama had \"sown new seeds to increase hatred and revenge on America.\" Bin Laden's deputy, \nAyman al-Zawahiri, also urged his listeners not to heed the \"polished words\" of the internationally-popular President \nObama. These statements coincided with an al-Qaida statement vowing to attack President Obama's convoy in \nRiyadh.\n\nThe White House in Washington dismissed these messages, noting that Bin Laden and his ilk wanted to distract \nattention from Obama's much-anticipated speech to the Islamic world. White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, \nsaid to reporters: \"I don't think it's surprising that al-Qaida would want to shift attention away from the president's \nhistoric and continued efforts to have an open dialogue with the Muslim world.\" Meanwhile, United States special \nenvoy to the Afghan-Pak region, Richard Holbrooke, made clear that the only sources of the chaos in Pakistan were \nal-Qaida and the Taliban. He also announced a fresh aid package aimed at helping the displaced populations in \nPakistan suffering from the cross-fire of the violence there.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical analysts surmised that back-to-back messages from the al-Qaida leadership indicated that it might well \nbe threatened by the Obama administration's overtures to - and influence of -- the Islamic world.\n\nThe Speech:\n\nIn his address to the Muslim world, President Barack Obama said, \"I have come here to seek a new beginning \nbetween the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.\" \nSpeaking before a crowd of 4,000 Egyptians in the Grand Hall of Cairo University, President Obama noted that the \ncenturies-long relationship between Islam and the West has involved both co-existence and cooperation, but that it \nhas also been marked by conflict and religious wars. He acknowledged that the \"years of distrust\" would require \nboth sides to make a \"sustained effort... to respect one another and seek common ground.\"\n\nPresident Obama succinctly explained some of the cause of the tensions between the West and the Islamic world \nwhen he said, \"The sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West \nas hostile to the traditions of Islam\" and then observed that \"violent extremists have exploited these tensions.\" He \nthen went on to call for a new relationship based on common hopes and aspirations saying, \"So long as our \nrelationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who \npromote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. This cycle \nof suspicion and discord must end.\"\n\nPresident Obama went on to describe the historical contributions of Islam to the world, referencing the development \nof Algebra, the invention of the magnetic compass and other tools of navigation, as well as cultural contributions in \nthe realm of the arts. While not directly germane to geopolitics, these references served to show respect to the \nIslamic world, which has often been juxtaposed competitively against Western civilization.\n\nSwitching to the theme of Muslims in America, President Obama acknowledged that Islam has \"always been a part \nof America's story\" and noting that the country's first diplomatic relations were forged with Morocco. Conjuring up \nthat history, he reminded people that during the signing of the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, President John Adams \nwrote, \"The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Muslims.\"\n\nPresident Obama said that it was his responsibility as to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam, but also to \nadvocate on behalf of his own country. To that end he said, \"America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested \nempire. The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. We \nwere born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we \nhave shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words - within our borders, and around the \nworld. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E \npluribus unum: Out of many, one.\"\n\nOn foreign policy, President Obama explained that United States action in Afghanistan was not an act of war \nagainst Islam, but an imperative -- indeed, a necessity -- given the security threat posed by al-Qaida, which was \nresponsible for the traumatic 2001 terror attacks in the United States. To that end, President Obama said: \"But let \nus be clear: al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men, women and children \nfrom America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet al-Qaida chose to ruthlessly \nmurder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive \nscale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be \ndebated; these are facts to be dealt with.\" He went on to assert, \"We would gladly bring every single one of our \ntroops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan determined \nto kill as many Americans as they possibly can. But that is not yet the case.\"\n\nPresident Obama distinguished Iraq from Afghanistan by described the war in Iraq as optional. He also indicated \nthat the war in Iraq had functioned as a cautionary tale within America, reminding everyone of the need to deploy \ndiplomacy and forge international consensus to solve difficult global challenges, if at all possible. The American \npresident also made clear that his country had no desire to establish permanent bases in Iraq.\n\n\n\nMoving to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, President Obama emphasized the United States' special relationship with \nIsrael, describing the bond as \"unbreakable\" and the existence of the Jewish state was rooted in an undeniable \nhistory of tragedy, including the horrors of the holocaust. He excoriated those who would deny the holocaust, saying \nvociferously: \"Six million Jews were killed - more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact \nis baseless, ignorant, and hateful. Threatening Israel with destruction - or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews - is \ndeeply wrong, and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the \npeace that the people of this region deserve.\"\n\nPresident Obama also demanded that Palestinians abandon violent means of resistance. Contrasting the \nPalestinian struggle with that of African slaves, he said: \"Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does \nnot succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of \nsegregation. But it was not violence that won full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence \nupon the ideals at the center of America's founding.\" As if to underline his condemnation of violent resistance, \nPresident Obama said, \"It's a story with a simple truth: that violence is a dead end. It is a sign of neither courage \nnor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus. That is not how moral authority \nis claimed; that is how it is surrendered.\"\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that the dislocation of Palestinians has been painful saying that the \"situation \nfor the Palestinian people is intolerable.\" As before, he emphasized the two-state solution and the right of Palestine \nto exist alongside Israel. \"Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can \nPalestine's,\" Obama said.\n\nIt should be noted that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement following \nPresident Obama's speech that expressed the hope the American president's address would \"lead to a new era of \nreconciliation between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel.\" On the other side of the equation, Palestinian \nPresident Mahmoud Abbas applauded the speech, saying that it was \"a good start\" to a reinvigorated peace \nprocess.\n\nOn the issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions, President Obama appeared to strike a pragmatic tone when he said, \"No \nsingle nation should pick and choose which nations hold nuclear weapons.\" But he also said that there should be \nno nuclear arms race in the Middle East -- a clear reference to the generally-held belief that Iran desires to build \nnuclear weapons. The American president also called for United States' relations with Iran to move forward saying, \n\"The question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.\" But Iran's supreme leader, \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered his own speech in which he offered no signal of progress, preferring instead to \npromote a negative stance in his pronouncement that that the United States remained \"deeply hated\" in the Middle \nEast.\n\nPresident Obama moved on to address the broad subject of democracy. President Obama said unambiguously, \n\"No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other.\" But he went on to note that his \npolicy was founded on the notion that government should reflect the will of the people. President Obama stated: \"I \ndo have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in \nhow you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is \ntransparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. Those are not just American \nideas, they are human rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere.\"\n\nPresident Obama also disabused his listeners of the notion that elections were not the equivalent of democracy. He \nsaid, \"No matter where it [change of government] takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a \nsingle standard for all who hold power: you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must \nrespect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the \ninterests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Without these \ningredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.\"\n\nOn the issue of women's rights, President Obama struck a culturally sensitive tone as he said, \"I do not believe that \nwomen must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live \n\n\n\ntheir lives in traditional roles. But it should be their choice.\" He continued by saying, \"I reject the view of some in the \nWest that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do believe that a woman who is \ndenied an education is denied equality. And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well-educated are \nfar more likely to be prosperous.\"\n\nPresident Obama ended his historic address by noting that the path toward peace an understanding would be a \ndifficult one, but that it must nonetheless be charted together for the sake of common purpose.  He asserted: \"The \nissues that I have described will not be easy to address. But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of \nthe world we seek - a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American troops have come \nhome; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used \nfor peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's children are \nrespected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieve it together.\"\n\nIn closing, President Obama cited all three Abrahamic religions in a call for international peace as follows --\n\nThe Holy Koran tells us, \"O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations \nand tribes so that you may know one another.\" The Talmud tells us: \"The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of \npromoting peace.\" The Holy Bible tells us, \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\"\n\nThroughout his speech, President Obama was interrupted 30 times by applause.  At one point, a man in the \naudience called out \"We love you.\"  At the close of his speech, the American president received a standing ovation.\n\nGlobal Reaction:\n\nAttention turned to how the address resonated with the Muslim world. Mina al-Oraibi, a columnist with the London-\nbased Asharq Al-Awsat, emphasized the fact that \"Obama mentioned the word peace 29 times and never \nmentioned terrorism.\" She said that his peace agenda would made him \"the radicals' worst nightmare.  In an \ninterview with Egyptian media, famed Middle Eastern television personality Emad el-Din Adib, said, \"President \nObama's charisma is unquestionable, but it's the substance and depth of his speech that made the hall roar.\"\n\nIn Pakistan, Sherry Rehman, former information minister and parliamentarian for the ruling Pakistan People's Party, \nsaid that Pakistanis  should welcome the speech; she also hailed his respectful tone.  Moreover, Rehman said \"It's \nnot a strategic shift, but more a welcome step in the right direction.\"  But retired Pakistani General Talat Masood \nsaid that the speech \"went right to the heart of the issues that bedevil U.S.-Muslim relations.\"\n\nNot all those who heard the speech had positive words for President Obama.  On CBS television in the United \nStates, former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer disapproved of President Obama's speech in Cairo.  Fleischer \nsaid, \"Bottom line -- the speech was balanced and that was what was wrong with it. American policy should not be \nbalanced. It should side with those who fight terror.\"  This view was reflected by the Republican Jewish Coalition \n(RJC), which charged that \"Obama struck a balanced tone with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that's \nwhat was wrong with this speech.\"  The RJC continued saying, \"American policy should not be balanced in regard \nto... those [Palestinians] who either engage in [terror] or are too weak to prevent it.\"\n\nFollowing along those lines, there was a consensus complaint from neo-conservatives that President Obama had \nnot used the word \"terrorism\" during his address, preferring instead to deploy the phrase \"violent extremists.\" \nAnalysts observed that President Obama may well have made a conscious effort to adopt a new lexicon reflective \nof his policy of engagement.  In so doing, he expunged the Bush administration's term, \"global war on terror,\" \nwhich may unwillingly connote notions of a ceaseless clash of civilizations.\n\nOther critics of President Obama argued that a well-delivered speech was no substitute for action.  But the \npresident himself acknowledged that \"no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust.\"  That said, he made clear \nthat the objectives of a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic world could only be started with \ndialogue.  Indeed, as media pundit and Newsweek columnist, Howard Fineman, noted:  \"In this case, words  \nmatter.\"  For its part, the White House said that President Obama's address was intended to start a process to \"re-\nenergize the dialogue with the Muslim world.\"\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nDuring his trip, President Obama also met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Following his address, \nPresident Obama visited the pyramids at Giza  before leaving for Germany and France. After leaving Egypt, \nPresident Obama was scheduled to travel to Germany where he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and visited \nboth the Dresden and Buchenwald concentration camps there. Following, he traveled to France to meet with \nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy and attend D-Day ceremonies in Normandy.\n\nPost-script on Middle East relations:\n\nIn July 2009, United States Vice-President Joe Biden said in an interview with ABC News that has  the Obama \nadministration would not stop  Israel from striking Iranian nuclear facilities.  Biden said that the United States would \nnot  \"dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do.\"  Biden also said  that President Barack \nObama's overture  of engagement with Iran remained on the table.  That offer for talks would end at the close of \n2009.  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that his country would deal with the \nnuclear threat posed by Iran, if the government in Tehran was unwilling to enter negotiations.  For its part, Iran has \nsaid that it would guarantee a strong response if its facilities were attacked by Israel.\n\nU.S. and Russia forge agreement to cut stockpiles of  nuclear weapons as Obama and Medvedev set new tone for \nbilateral relations --\n\nOn July 6, 2009, United States President Barack Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry \nMedvedev, for talks on their countries' respective nuclear arsenals.  Following three hours of discussion,  the two \nworld leaders signed  an outline agreement aimed at reducing their countries' stockpiles of nuclear weapons.  The \n\"joint understanding\" was signed in a public ceremony in Moscow and would cut deployed nuclear warheads to \nunder 1,700 on both sides  within seven years of a forging new accord.  That new accord would stand in \nreplacement of the  1991 Start I treaty, which was set to expire at the close of 2009.\n\nA statement from the White House explained that the new treaty would \"include effective verification measures\" and \n\"enhance the security of both the US and Russia, as well as provide predictability and stability in strategic offensive \nforces.\"\n\nWhile the terms of the new concord would still leave both countries with enough weaponry to destroy one another, \nthe move was intended to stop the diplomatic \"drift\" away from cooperation on shared interests, which  had \noccurred in recent times.\n\nTo that end, President Obama said the United States and Russia were both \"committed to leaving behind the \nsuspicion and the rivalry of the past.\" He also noted that the new agreement was part of an initiative \"to reset U.S,-\nRussian relations so that we can co-operate more effectively in areas of common interest.\"\n\nFor his part, President Medvedev said that the talks had been \"very frank and very sincere\" and were\n\n\"without any doubt, the meeting we had been waiting for in Russia and the United States.\" The Russian leader went \non to state, \"I would like particularly to stress that our country would like to reach a level of cooperation with the \nUnited States that would really be worthy of the 21st Century, and which would ensure international peace and \nsecurity.\"\n\nIn addition to reduced levels of nuclear warheads and delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, \nthere were also provisions for submarine-launched missiles and bombers.\n\nIn a separate agreement, Russia said it would allow the United States military to  transport troops and weaponry \nacross its territory to Afghanistan, where  the  war against resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida was ongoing.  This use of \n\n\n\nRussian territory to move troops and equipment into the conflict zone would foreclose the use of  routes through \nPakistan, which have been  the target of  attacks by militants on a frequent and increasing basis.\n\nIn another development, Russia and the United States agreed to establish  a joint commission, which would \nfacilitate greater cooperation on energy, fighting terrorism and dealing with narcotics trafficking.\n\nIn a particularly significant move, the two countries agreed to resume military cooperation, which was suspended in \n2008 as a result of the  conflict between Russia and Georgia.\n\nYet unresoved was the prevailing source of controversy on both sides -- the  United States' plan to develop a \nmissile defence shield system in Eastern Europe.  This proposal has been strenuously resisted by Russia, which \neschews  greater American domination in its own backyard.\n\nIn a move aimed at gradually moving the two countries toward consensus on the issue, both Obama and Medvedev \nsaid that they backed a joint study on the threat of ballistic missiles and the institution of a data exchange center.\n\nPresident Obama, who characterized former President Vladimir Putin as having \"one foot in the old ways of doing \nbusiness and one foot in the new,\" was set to meet with the prime minister  of Russia on July 7, 2009.\n\nSee below for further developments related to United States-Russia relations.\n\nIraqi politicians laud withdrawal of U.S. troops  --\n\nUnited States troops withdrew from Iraq's cities, towns and military bases on June 30, 2009, in keeping with a \nprevailing bilateral agreement.  Iraqi security forces were now charged with keeping the peace.\n\nIraqi politicians of various ethno-sectarian backgrounds lauded the move as a sign of progress is the path of \nsovereignty.  Hashim al-Taie of the Accordance Front said, \"The pullout is a very good step on the path to \nindependence and sovereignty and Iraqis are glad of that.\" Mahmoud Othman, from the main Kurdish alliance in \nparliament, said, \"We have concerns. Some towns still have trouble -- mixed areas -- but those concerns should not \nprevent the withdrawal.\"\n\nFor his part, United States President noted that \"Sovereignty Day\"  was a significant milestone for Iraq, but warned \nthat Iraq would yet be faced with \"difficult days\" in the future.  Indeed, there were some anxieties that the withdrawal \nof United States troops could well act as a trigger for increasing ethno-sectarian violence across the country. \n\nAfghanistan Policy: U.S. president says immediate mission is to see Afghanistan through elections ---\n\nWith casualties mounting amidst troops from the United States and the United Kingdom fighting the Taliban in \nAfghanistan, there have been increasing anxieties about Western efforts in that country to crush Islamic militants.  \nIndeed, recent times have seen resurgent Taliban become increasingly violent and brutal in their attacks while \nWestern forces have seen ever-increasing casualty lists. In July 2009, the United Kingdom and the United States \nhad lost several soldiers as a result of attacks by resurgent Taliban. Indeed, as many as 15 British troops died in \nthe space of days while four United States marines died in two separate roadside bombings. \n\nGiven this climate, United States President Barack Obama sought to quell anxieties by staking out a clear set of \nobjectives for United States and allied troops trying to repel the Taliban in Afghanistan.  To this end, President \nObama characterized the war effort in Afghanistan as a \"serious fight\" against terrorism, and the crucial need to \nestablish  regional stability.  President Obama said that United States and allied troops had enjoyed some success \nbut were immediately tasked with the mission of seeing Afghanistan through the forthcoming presidential election \nset for August 2009.\n\n\n\nAcross the Atlantic in the United Kingdom, British Prime Minister was compelled to justify his country's continuing \neffort in Afghanistan by explaining that there was a vital interest to his country in fighting terrorism. President \nObama had also emphasized the fact that the effort against the Taliban was as much in the interests of Europe as it \nwas for the United States.  He said, \"The mission in Afghanistan is one that the Europeans have as much if not \nmore of a stake in than we do. The likelihood of a terrorist attack in London is at least as high, if not higher, than it \nis in the United States.\" \n\nUnited States offers limited legal rights to prisoners at Bagram --- \n\nOn September 12, 2009, it was announced that more than 600 prisoners held by the United States military at the \nBagram air base in Afghanistan would be given new legal rights to challenge their detention.  The new  legal \nguidelines would include the right of each detainee to be represented by a United States military official, and the \nright to present evidence before a military board, which would determine whether or not continued detention was in \norder.  The new legal guidelines presented the first significant shift in overseas detention policies since the Bush \nadministration was in power.  To date, human rights groups have condemned the practice of holding detainees as \n\"enemy combatants\" indefinitely at Bagram, with many of them not knowing the reasons for their imprisonment. \nSahr Muhammed Ally of the  Human Rights First cautiously welcomed  the news saying,  \"Any reform in U.S. \ndetentions in Afghanistan is an improvement, but it remains to be seen whether the new procedures will cure the ills \nof arbitrary and indefinite detention that have been the hallmark of detentions in Bagram.\" \n\nBin Laden Emerges -- \n\nOn September 13, 2009, an audio message, believed to have been recorded by al-Qaida terrorist leader, Osama \nBin Laden, was released on an Islamic website.  The message was titled \"a statement to the American people\" and \nin it, the taped voice argued that the United States President Barack Obama was \"powerless\" to stop the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan.  The taped voice -- believed to be Bin Laden -- accused the new United States president of \nfailing to significantly change its foreign policy, as evidenced by the decision to retain officials from the previous \nBush administration, such as Defense Secretary Robert Gates.  The timing of the release of the message was \nsignificant, given that it occurred two days after the eighth anniversary of the tragic 2001 terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States.  Indeed, the taped voice  said that one motivating factor behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on \nNew York and Washington was the United States foreign policy towards Israel. To date, Bin Laden is believed to \nbe alive and living in the mountainous Afghan-Pak border region. \n\nHead of Taliban in Pakistan likely killed by missile attack; some Taliban sources dispute claim by Pakistani \ngovernment --\n\nIn the early hours of  August 6, 2009, Pakistani and United States officials said they were examining reports that  \nthe leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, Baitullah Mehsud, may have been killed in a missile attack orchestrated by \nthe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the day before.\n\nAt the time, a United States official said that there was  \"reason to believe reports of his death may be true, but it \ncannot be confirmed.\"  As well, Robert Gibbs, the spokesperson for United States President Barack Obama, \nacknowledged that the administration was yet to receive absolute confirmation but nonetheless said, \"There seems \nto be a growing consensus among credible observers that he is indeed dead.\"  Soon thereafter, a militant \ncommander from the Taliban made clear that Mehsud died in the strike by a United States drone on a relative's \nhouse  in South Waziristan.\n\nDuring an interview with the Associated Press, Kafayat Ullah -- an aide to Mehsud -- said: \"I confirm that Baitullah \nMehsud and his wife died in the American missile attack in South Waziristan.\"\n\n\n\nDays later, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik added to the assertions by the Pakistani authorities regarding \nthe death of the Taliban leader when he said in an interview with BBC News, \"All the credible intelligence I have \nfrom that area does finally confirm [ Baitalluh Mehsud's death].\"\n\nWith news abounding about Mehsud's likely death, attention had fixed on possible successors to the leadership of \nPakistan's Taliban.  In fact, there were reports that the Taliban as holding a \"shura\" council in South Waziristan  to \nselect Mehsud's successor,\n\nAmong the possible contenders for this role were Hakimullah Mehsud, Maulana Azmatullah and Wali-ur-Rehman.\n\nBut even the succession battle became one tinged with controversy when reports emerged that Hakimullah Mehsud \nmay have been  killed in a gun battle involving his main rival for the Taliban top spot, Wali-ur-Rehman.  The \nsituation became more complicated when a BBC interview was published with the man himself claiming to be alive.  \nIndeed, Hakimullah Mehsud was quoted as denying reports of his own death; he also said that Baitullah Mehsud \nwas not dead either.  The Associated Press likewise reported that Hakimullah Mehsud and two other Taliban \nfigures asserted on the record that Baitullah Mehsud was still alive.\n\nFor its part, the Pakistani government said that although it was inclined to believe veracity of the reports \nsurrounding  Baitullah Mehsud's  death, it  did not have available forensic evidence to make an irrefutable \nconfirmation.  As such, the government would have to send investigators into the field and final confirmation could \ntake some time. The Pakistani government subsequently added that it would  provide conclusive proof of  Baitullah \nMehsud's death, such as DNA evidence.\n\nShould the apparent death of Pakistan's Taliban chief prove to be true, it would serve as evidence of the success of \njoint Pakistani-American efforts to stave off the advance of Islamic extremists in this nuclear-armed country.  In fact, \nunder pressure from the United States, Pakistan launched an intense military  offensive into the areas bordering \nAfghanistan, where Islamic militants have held sway.  The mission was aimed at destroying the Taliban and its \nnetwork with other Islamic extremists, and re-establishing control over the region, which included the restive Swat \nvalley.  The Pakistani military said that it was nearing the successful completion of this mission in mid-2009, \nalthough close to two million  were displaced as they fled the cross-fire of the violence in that region of the country.\n\nWhile Mehsud's stronghold was in a part of South Waziristan that  does not directly border Afghanistan, the Taliban \nchief has had strong  ties with other commanders on the frontier and was known to have crossed into Afghanistan \nto help Islamic extremist insurgents there.\n\nAccordingly, Mehsud's apparent -- but unconfirmed -- death could deal a significant severe blow to  the Islamic \nextremist movement, which has been undermining the stability of Pakistan by carrying out brutal and violent \nattacks from  the Afghan-Pak border region.\n\nKnown as Pakistan's most wanted man and the foremost threat to national security, Mehsud was also broadly \nregarded as a co-conspirator of  the terror network of al-Qaida.  Mehsud has been blamed for the assassination of  \nformer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi in December 2007.  Although he denied having a role in \nBhutto's murder, the Taliban has nonetheless plainly taken responsibility for a long list of bloody suicide bombings \nand violent clashes that have left thousands dead since 2007.  In fact,  the siege of  radical mosque in Islamabad by \ngovernment forces involved a conflict with Mehsud's loyalists inside the compound.\n\nMeanwhile, United States officials -- unlike their Pakistani counterparts -- have not been  not as fixated on \neliminating Mehsud, and have instead viewed\n\nthe Pakistani Taliban as posing an internal threat.  Nevertheless, as Mehsud's power and influence increased, and \nas some of Mehsud's militants were linked with attacks on supply convoys for NATO and United States troops, \nthere were escalating anxieties that Mehsud's Taliban could pose a strategic threat to nuclear-armed Pakistan and \n\n\n\nthe wider region.  As such, by the start of 2009, United States drones commenced sustained strikes in Mehsud's \nstronghold of  South Waziristan.\n\nClinton promises assistance for Somalia and threatens action against Eritrea --\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held talks with Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in \nKenya's capital, Nairobi, during an African tour in August 2009.  The United States' chief diplomat said that her \ncountry was interested in a stable Somalia. She also blamed Eritrea for backing Islamist rebels, known as al-\nShabab, which has the expressed objective of overthrowing the government of Somalia.  To these ends, Secretary \nof State Clinton said: \" Certainly if al-Shabab were to obtain a haven in Somalia which could then attract al-Qaida \nand other terrorist actions, it would be a threat to the United States.\" She continued, \"It is long past time for Eritrea \nto cease and desist its support of al-Shabab and to start being a productive rather than a destabilizing neighbor.  \nAccordingly, Secretary of State Clinton warned that the United States would take action against Eritrea if it did not \ncease its support for the extremist Islamist militants in Somalia. She said: \"We are making it very clear that their \nactions are unacceptable. We intend to take action if they do not cease.\"\n\nOf course, such action would not include the deployment of United States forces to Somalia to fight the militant \ninsurgents there.  However, Agence France Presse reported that the United States would double its supply of arms \nand ammunition to Somalia. In this way, the United States was effectively admitting that it has supplied pro-\ngovernment forces in Somalia with weaponry in recent times.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Eritrea has denied supporting Somalia's al-Shabab militants, and characterized \nthe United States' accusations as a \"fabrication.\"\n\nNevertheless, there was evidence that several Somali militant Islamist groups carried out their operations from \ninside Eritrean territory after they were driven by joint government and Ethiopian troops from the Somali capital of \nMogadishu in 2006.  The history of animosity between Ethiopia and Eritrea indicates that the two countries may \nhave been carrying out a proxy war on Somali territory.  While Ethiopia has been reluctant to re-enter the fray as of \n2009, Clinton's accusations suggest that the United States believes Eritrea  to be playing a continuing role in the \nchaos that has bedeviled Somalia.\n\nFormer President Clinton brings back detained journalists from North Korea --\n\nFormer United States President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang in the North Korea to try to press for the release \nof two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had been arrested and sentenced to prison for crossing \nthe border into North Korea.  Former President Clinton -- the husband of the United States Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton -- arrived in Pyongyang in the early hours of August 4, 2009 and was warmly met by a North Korean \ndelegation that included a nuclear negotiator.\n\nThe landmark visit by the former United States leader came at a time of increasing tensions between Pyongyang \nand the West over its nuclear program.\n\nThe official North Korean News Agency (KCNA) said that former President Clinton convened a meeting with the \nNorth Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and his closest aides, where the involved parties  had an \"exhaustive \nconversation.\" The KCNA News Agency also reported that \"a wide-ranging exchange of views on matters of \ncommon concern\" were discussed at the negotiating table.\n\nABC News cited an anonymous government source in reporting that former President Clinton also had a \"very \nemotional\" meeting with the two female journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee.  Soon thereafter, it was announced \nthat Ling and Lee had been granted a special pardon.  Indeed, the official North Korean News Agency (KCNA) \nasserted in a statement: \"Kim Jong-il issued an order... granting a special pardon to the two American journalists \nwho had been sentenced to hard labor.\" Subsequently, Reuters News Agency reported that the special pardon set \nthe stage for the two journalists to be released from imprisonment.\n\n\n\nThe two journalists, Ling and Lee, had been working for former Vice President Al Gore's Current-TV network, when \nthey traveled to eastern Asia to work on a documentary. They were arrested in March 2009 when they entered \nNorth Korean terrain and accused of \"hostile acts.\"  Ling and Lee argued that their presence in North Korean \nterritory was accidental.  Nevertheless, in June 2009,  Ling and Lee were sentenced by North Korea highest court  \nto 12 years of hard labor camp for crossing the border illegally.\n\nThe Obama administration has been trying to secure the release of the two female journalists since that time.\n\nIndeed, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on North Korea to grant Ling and Lee amnesty, characterizing the \ntwo journalists as being remorseful.  But the situation was not helped by the fact that Washington D.C. and \nPyongyang do not share diplomatic relations.  That said, according to Daniel Snieder, the associate director of \nresearch Stanford University's Shorenstein Asia Pacific Research Center, negotiations were ongoing between the \nNorth Korean mission to the United Nations and the United States Department of State.\n\nThat quiet diplomacy appeared to have seen results and the Obama administration  considered sending a high level \nenvoy to North Korea to bring the negotiations to a positive conclusion, according to the Washington Post. In that \nreport, Asian expert, Chris Nelson, said that Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, New Mexico Governor Bill \nRichardson -- a seasoned negotiator with the North Koreans -- and former Vice President Al Gore, were all named \nas possible emissaries.  Ultimately, it was the high profile and internationally popular  former President Bill Clinton  \nwho was asked to take on the difficult task, which clearly was on track to end successfully.\n\nFor its part, the White House has declined to comment at length on Clinton's visit to North Korea or the status of \nLing and Lee.  Instead, the Obama administration has limited it statements on the matter to simply describing \nformer President Clinton's trip to Pyongyang  as a \"solely private\" mission, intended to secure the release of Ling \nand Lee.  It also denied a claim by North Korea's KCNA News Agency, which asserted that Clinton dispatched a \nmessage to North Korea from United States President Barack Obama.  Norah O'Donnell of MSNBC News said that \nthe White House was reluctant to speak on the record until the former United State president and the two journalists \nwere safely en route home to the United States.  Indeed, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, \"We do \nnot want to jeopardize the success of former President Clinton's mission.\"\n\nThe characterization of Clinton's visit to North Korea as a \"private\" endeavor was also likely intended to draw a line \nin the sand between the former president's role as negotiator in this specific case, and that of his wife, Secretary of \nState Clinton, as the United States' chief diplomat.  Certainly, Secretary of State Clinton would still have to  contend \nwith a nuclear North Korea.  To these end, President Obama's advisor, David Axelrod, said in an interview with \nMSNBC News that Clinton was on a \"private humanitarian mission\" quite separate from the prevailing issue of \nNorth Korea's reconstituted nuclear program.  Axelrod said, \"I don't think it's related to other issues.\"\n\nThe news of the pardon and likely release of Ling and Lee was met generally with positive acclaim. Clearly \n\"overjoyed\" by the news of the pardon.  The families of Ling and Lee issued a joint statement that read:  \"We are so \ngrateful to our government: President Obama, Secretary Clinton and the U.S. State Department for their dedication \nto and hard work on behalf of American citizens.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission \nand Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , the executive head of the state that Ling and Lee call home, said that \nhe and his wife, Maria Shriver, joined all Californians in celebrating the likely release of Ling and Lee. He wished \nthem a safe return home.  Bob Dietz, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said:  \n\"This is welcome news and we are pleased to see movement in this case.\"\n\nBy contrast, however, critics said that Clinton's visit to North Korea was tantamount to rewarding Pyongyang for bad \nbehavior. Notably, John Bolton, who temporarily served as Ambassador to the United Nations under the Bush \nadministration, said that Clinton's efforts in North Korea came precariously close to negotiating with terrorists.\n\n\n\nEvidently, engagement of any kind  with North Korea, even as regards this \"solely private\" mission, would be fodder \nfor much debate over the appropriateness of direct talks with a dictator, such as Kim Jong-il.  Of course, on the \nother side of the equation, internationalists may well argue that Clinton's trip to Pyongyang was proof that vigorous \ndiplomacy can yield positive results.\n\nWhether or not this particular success would extend to an overall thaw in relations between Pyongyang and \nWashington D.C. was yet to be seen.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is the highest ranking American to visit North Korea since his own Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-il in 2000. \n\nNorth Korea send envoys to meet with Clinton era diplomat --\n\nNorth Korea deployed envoys to the United States to meet with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.  The \nseasoned diplomat, Richardson,  served as United Nations ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton \nadministration in the 1990s, and was responsible for helping to broker an agreement with the North Koreans that \nbrought a temporary end to its nuclear development.\n\nFollowing his meeting with the North Koreans, Governor Richardson, a Democrat who endorsed Barack Obama for \npresident, said that believed that Pyongyang had issued \"good signals\" that pointed toward the restarting of \ndialogue with Washington.  Indeed, multilateral talks on North Korea's controversial nuclear program had stalled in \nrecent times, and relations became increasingly strained after North Korea went forward with an underground \nnuclear, followed by a succession of missile tests.  Now, however, in the aftermath of a successful but unofficial trip \nby former President Bill Clinton to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists, Governor \nRichardson said that he believed the climate had improved.  Indeed, Governor Richardson said that he indicated a \n\"thaw\" in relations and believed that North Korea was \"ready for a new dialogue with the United States regarding \nthe nuclear issue.\"\n\nThat said, an actual diplomatic breakthrough was still in the offing. According to Governor Richardson, North Korea \nremained intransigent on the issue of returning to six-party talks. Instead,  Pyongyang believed that it had earned \nsome goodwill and wanted to pursue direct bilateral talks with the United States.  To this end, Governor Richardson \nsaid that Pyongyang had \"obviously used the journalists as a bargaining chip\" and was looking for a reciprocal  a \n\"gesture\" from Washington.\n\nThe Obama administration has indicated that while it was willing to return to the negotiating table with North Korea \nwithin the multilateral framework, with an eye on irreversible denuclearization, it would not soon engage in direct \ntalks.  State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said:  \"Our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \nAnd, of course, we want to see progress toward that.\"\n\nThe White House also made clear that it had not orchestrated the meeting between the North Korean envoys and \nthe New Mexico governor. As well, Governor Richardson expressly noted that he was not acting as an emissary on \nbehalf of President Obama.\n\nAfter the meeting between the Governor Richardson and the North Korean envoys, North Korea invited the United \nStates envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, for direct negotiations on its nuclear program.  South Korea media \nreported that there were rumblings about the White House giving serious consideration to the idea of actually \nsending Bosworth to North Korea. But on the record, the United States embassy in Seoul would offer no comment \non the matter.\n\nIran issues nuclear proposal; United States and Russia react --\n\n\n\nIn September 2009, the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program returned to the fore.  A report by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran's Natanz nuclear plant registered a reduction in the \nnumber of centrifuges used to actively enrich uranium.  Nonetheless, the IAEA also charged that Iran was not \ncooperating in an investigation of allegations that Iran was on the path toward weaponization of uranium.\n\nTo that end, the United States envoy to the IAEA, Glyn Davies, asserted that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium \nin defiance of the United Nations Security Council and could already have garnered sufficient enriched uranium to \neventually produce a nuclear bomb.  At a meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Davies said, \"We have serious concerns \nthat Iran is deliberately attempting, at a minimum, to preserve a nuclear weapons option.\"In response, Iran's envoy \nto the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, argued that there had been false accusations about Iran's nuclear program  from \nthe United States before.  He said, \"The world is observing curiously whether or not this [American] administration \nfollows the same trend as the Bush administration - pursuing hostile political confrontation, using fabricated \nbaseless allegations.\"  Iran has maintained that its nuclear program has only a civilian energy purpose and that its \nrocket building activities would be oriented toward satellites alone.\n\nBut analysts warned that Iran's vociferous defense of its nuclear program could be a strategy intended to stall \nfurther international action that might be in the offing. Indeed, United States President Barack Obama has warned \nIran that its friendly overtures toward engagement with Tehran would expire by the end of September 2009. At that \ntime, the United States president was prepared to pursue new sanctions  against Iran.  Mohamed El Baradei, the \nhead of the IAEA, urged Iran to accept the United States' offer of dialogue. Ahead of the IAEA meeting in Vienna, \nhe said, \"The U.S. is making an offer without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respect.\" He continued, \"The \noffer by the U.S. is an offer that should not be refused, that cannot be refused, because it has no conditions \nattached to it. And I hope [the] response will be positive.\"\n\nSuch hopes of dialogue were somewhat complicated after Iran put forth its package of proposals to the five  \npermanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany.  According to the independent United States-\nbased entity, ProPublica, the five-page proposal, Iran called for  \"comprehensive, all-encompassing and \nconstructive\" negotiations on a range of security issues, including global nuclear disarmament.  However, the \ndocument detailing Iran's latest proposals on its nuclear ambitions conspicuously failed to mention Iran's own \nnuclear program.\n\nThe United States reacted by registering dissatisfaction with the proposal package.  Philip Crowley, the United \nStates Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said that the proposed mesaures failed to address the status \nof Iran's nuclear program.  He said, \"Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core \nissue of the international community and the core concern, which is Iran's nuclear ambitions.\" Conversely, Russia \nreacted by suggesting that the Iranian proposals signaled positive progress. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei \nLavrov said, \"Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers my impression is there is something there to use.\"  \nLavrov also indicated that there would be no  oil sanctions against Iran. \"Some of the sanctions under discussion, \nincluding oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to co-operate, they are a step to a full-blown \nblockade and I do not think they would be supported at the UN Security Council.\"\n\nThe American and Russian responses showed divergent approaches to the Iranian nuclear issue, and suggested \nthat consensus on the matter would  not be easily achieved.\n\nPresident Obama reverses Bush-era missile defense system for Europe; Russia responds favorably --\n\nOn September 17, 2009, United States President Barack Obama  announced that his administration was \nabandoning the Bush-era missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe, which caused the grave consternation \nof Russia.  In its place, President Obama unveiled a \"phased, adaptive approach\" for missile defense on the \nEuropean continent.  At a news conference in the White House, President Obama said, \"This new approach will \nprovide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack \nthan the 2007 European missile defense program.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Obama explained that he made the decision based on an assessment of Iran's missile threat and the \nPentagon's  \"phased and adaptive\" approach, which would ensure the American homeland defense. While \nPresident Obama acknowledged the threat posed by Iran, and although he insisted that he was committed to \n\"deploying strong missile defense systems which are adaptable to the threats of the 21st century,\" he also wanted \nto institute a plan that would be be appropriate and effective in responding to the current intelligence assessment of \nIran's missile programs.  To that end, recent intelligence appeared to indicate that Iran's capacity to attach \nwarheads to long-range missiles would not pose an immediate strategic threat to the United States and its allies. \nIndeed, Iran was more likely to pursue short-range and medium-range missile development.\n\nPresident Obama noted, \"The best way to responsibly advance our security and the security of our allies is to \ndeploy a missile defense system that best responds to the threats that we face and that utilizes technology that is \nboth proven and cost-effective.\"  He explained that the  new missile defense architecture would provide \"stronger, \nsmarter and swifter defenses. \"\n\nThe plan would essentially nullify former President George W. Bush's plan to deploy 10 missile interceptors in \nPoland and a radar system in the Czech Republic as part of its European missile shield, charged with preventing \nEuropean allies from missile threats by \"rogue states,\" such as Iran.  Bush's plan had been criticized by some as \nbeing impractical to implement.  Perhaps more significantly, Russia strongly opposed the missile defense shield \nconcept and argued that it posed a security threat to the region.  The matter caused a devolution in positive \nrelations between the United States and Russia at the time, with Russia warning of retaliatory moves.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Russia was now lauding the decision by the Obama administration to dispense with the \nBush missile defense shield system.  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed the shift as \"positive\" and \nmade clear that there were now \"good conditions\" for United States-Russia talks on dealing with missile \nproliferation. It was apparent that the \"reset button\" on bilateral relations between the two countries had, indeed, \nbeen pressed.\n\nAt home in the United States, Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell decried the move as \n\"short-sighted\" and \"harmful.\"  Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, who was defeated by President \nObama in 2008,  called the decision \"seriously misguided.\" Other conservatives also accused the Obama \nadministration of appeasing Moscow and getting nothing in return.  On the other side of the equation,  Democratic \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the decision by the Obama administration was \"brilliant\" and had been forged \nfrom an accurate assessment of the current threats. As well, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates  -- a \nRepublican who also served in the Bush administration -- penned an article in the New York Times, which \nexplained the pragmatic value of President Obama's  proposed changes.  He also excoriated those whom he \ndescribed as a \"devoted following\" to missile defense plans that were \"unworkable, prohibitively expensive and \ncould never be practically deployed.\"\n\nRussia quickly announced that it would now scrap its own controversial plans to deploy missiles close to Poland.  \nThat proposal had been advanced in response to the Bush missile shield plan.\n\nBut now, as noted by Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Popovkin during an radio interview in Moscow, \"Naturally, \nwe will cancel the measures that Russia planned to take in response to the deployment of U.S. missile defense \nsystems.\"  He continued,  \"Common sense has finally prevailed over ambitions.\"\n\nFor his part, President Obama said on an interview with CBS on September 20, 2009, that his decision was not \ndictated by Russian opposition.  He said, \"The Russians don't make determinations about what our defense posture \nis.\" He continued, \"If the by-product of it is that the Russians feel a little less paranoid... then that's a bonus.\" \nPresident Obama also noted that one of the bonus effects could be that the Russians might be more willing to work \nwith the United States in dealing with ballistic missiles from Iran or nuclear development in Iran.\n\nMiddle East Peace Push --\n\n\n\nSeptember 2009 was marked by developments on the peace process front. United States envoy, George Mitchell,  \nhas met with Israeli leaders to discuss the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  The issue of \ncontinued expansion of Jewish settlements has been an obstacle in the peace process, and one that the Obama \nadministration in the United States  has taken a key role in resolving. On the other side of the equation, Mitchell was \nalso pushing Arab nation states to officially recognize the Jewish state of Israel.  The dual moves were part of an \neffort by the Obama administration in the United States to finalize the terms of fresh peace negotiations between \nIsrael and Palestinians.  Following a meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres, Mitchell said \"While we have not \nyet reached agreement on many outstanding issues, we are working hard to do so.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama was set to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on September 22, 2009, with an eye \non revitalizing the peace process.  President Obama was expected to hold separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas before convening a joint meeting. This \nannouncement came in the aftermath of a visit by United States Middle East envoy, George Mitchell to the region, \nwith an eye on trying to find some common ground ahead of the meeting in the United States. Mitchell  returned \nhome without consensus and with both sides blaming one another for the inability to find  common ground.  \nNevertheless, Mitchell, said that President Obama's willingness to engage directly at this stage with the two \nprincipal players showed his \"deep commitment to comprehensive peace.\" \n\nMore than a month later, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the Middle East to pursue peace \ntalks between Israel and Arab states over the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nArab leaders were reported to have been disappointed that the United States' top diplomat  did not pressure the \nNetanyahu government in Israel more over its settlement activity.  But Secretary of State Clinton explained the \nUnited States' position saying, \"The Israelis have responded to the call of the U.S., the Palestinians and the Arab \nworld to stop settlement activity by expressing a willingness to restrain settlement activity. This offer falls far short of \nwhat our preference would be but if it is acted upon it will be an unprecedented restriction on settlements and would \nhave a significant and meaningful effect on restraining their growth.\"\n\nSecretary of  State Clinton also acknowledged that the Palestinian leadership of Mahmoud Abbas for taking  \n\"positive steps\"  to improve security in the West Bank.\n\nIn early November 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the Middle East to pursue peace \ntalks between Israel and Arab states over the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nArab leaders were reported to have been disappointed that the United States' top diplomat  did not pressure the \nNetanyahu government in Israel more over its settlement activity.  But Secretary of State Clinton explained the \nUnited States' position saying, \"The Israelis have responded to the call of the U.S., the Palestinians and the Arab \nworld to stop settlement activity by expressing a willingness to restrain settlement activity. This offer falls far short of \nwhat our preference would be but if it is acted upon it will be an unprecedented restriction on settlements and would \nhave a significant and meaningful effect on restraining their growth.\"\n\nSecretary of  State Clinton also acknowledged that the Palestinian leadership of Mahmoud Abbas for taking  \n\"positive steps\"  to improve security in the West Bank.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama calls for global unity and joint action in first U.N. address --\n\nIn his first address to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly, United States President Barack Obama called \nfor global unity and joint action in tackling the complex challenges facing the international community.  Expounding \non a litany of global problems, such as nuclear proliferation and disarmament, war and conflict, global warming and \nclimate change, as well as financial instability  and economic crisis, President Obama called on all nation states to \nmeet their responsibilities  in dealing with these challenges.  President Obama also acknowledged that foreign \n\n\n\npolicy in the previous years had not advanced global goodwill to his country saying that when he took office, \"many \naround the world had come to view America with skepticism and mistrust.\"  But President Obama also heralded a \nnew day dawning marked by international cooperation and team effort.  In a reference to the purpose of the United \nNations, he said, \"We must build new coalitions that bridge old divides... All nations have rights and responsibilities \n- that's the bargain that makes this work.\"  President Obama additionally noted that just as America should not exert \nits military might while alienating the global community, it was concomitantly unfair to expect America to act on its \nown to resolve problems facing the countries of the world.  To this end, he said, \"Those who used to chastise \nAmerica for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems \nalone.\"\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama issues call for nuclear disarmament --\n\nOne day after giving his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, United States President Barack \nObama issued a call for nuclear disarmament. Ironically, this call came at a time when the attention of the \ninternational community was focused on Iran's nuclear development program and amidst increasing fears that Iran's \nnuclear ambitions might include weaponization. That said, in a session of the United Nations Security Council that \nwas chaired by President Obama, member states unanimously adopted a resolution calling for nuclear \ndisarmament, advancing efforts to halt the proliferation of nuclear arms, and boosting endeavors aimed at \ndecreasing the risk of nuclear terrorism. After the resolution was adopted, President Obama said, \"The historic \nresolution we just adopted enshrines our shared commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.\"  \nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hailed the newly-adopted resolution as \"a fresh start toward a new \nfuture.\" The occasion was distinguished as being the first time an American president had chaired a United Nations \nSecurity Council summit.\n\nUnited States accelerates withdrawal of troops from Iraq --\n\nThe United States has accelerated its military withdrawal from Iraq and will redeploy 4,000 troops within a month. \nAccordingly, the number of United States troops in Iraq was expected to go from 124,000 to 120,000 by the close of \nOctober 2009. The top American commander in Iraq, Army General Ray Odierno, explained that it was the latest \nmove aimed at ending the  United States' engagement in that country.  In an eight-page  statement intended to be \ndelivered at a Congressional committee, he said, \"We have already begun deliberately drawing down our forces - \nwithout sacrificing security.\"  Odierno continued, \"As we go forward, we will thin our lines across Iraq in order to \nreduce the risk and sustain stability through a deliberate transition of responsibilities to the Iraqi security forces.\"\n\nOdierno expressed tentative optimism about the prospects of a stable Iraq in the future, while acknowledging the \nreality of continued violence, as evidenced by the August 19, 2009 bombings at two Iraqi government ministries.  \nHe also noted that ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions continued to plague the country.  He observed that \nunresolved tensions between the Arab and Kurdish populations promised to present problems in the 2010 \nparliamentary elections, with various groups seeking control over regional oil wealth.  That said, Odierno suggested \nthat most Iraqis sought peace and security, while opposing militancy and violence.  He said, \"The overwhelming \nmajority of the Iraqi people have rejected extremism,\" Odierno said. \"We see no indications of a return to the \nsectarian violence that plagued Iraq in 2006-2007.\"\n\nNote: Odierno's congressional testimony was obtained by the Associated Press and the plan to reduce the number \nof brigades in Iraq was confirmed by the Defense Department.\n\nOn October 19, 2009, United States defense officials said that they would cancel the expected deployment of 3,500 \nsoldiers to Iraq as a result of the improving security situation in that country. Those soldiers were set to deploy to \nIraq at the start of 2010 but, based on the assessment by General Raymond Odierno, the Pentagon said that Iraqi \nsecurity forces should be able to protect their citizens and institutions without the addition of the United States \ntroops.\n\n\n\nIronically, this announcement came a week before suicide bombings in Baghdad left more than 150 people dead \nand another 500 people wounded. The rising tide of violence was also linked with the anticipated withdrawal of \nUnited States combat troops from Iraq in 2010, with a full withdrawal in 2012. \n\nPresident Obama makes commitment to Pakistan --\n\nIn October 2009, as the Pakistani military was carrying out an offensive operations against Islamic militants, its was \nclear that there would be some degree of an impact on the extremists living in the tribal region of South Waziristan.  \nOne of the core implications of the offensive operation would  be the substantial displacement of militants, as they \nflee the air strikes and ground offensive.  Strategic experts have said that the militants who are flushed out of the \ncombat zones would likely take refuge in nearby areas, also characterized by lawlessness and difficult terrain, such \nas tribal Balochistan  and North-West Frontier Province. Still other experts warn that some militants will relocate to \nareas further away, essentially guaranteeing that the problem of extremist Islamists will have a wider, regional \neffect, ultimately requiring a broader response from policy makers not only in Pakistan but internationally.\n\nTo that end, Hakeemullah Mehsud, a top commander in the Pakistani Taliban, issued an ultimatum to Pakistani \nforces.  He said that the Taliban in Pakistan would halt its attacks if the Pakistani military would cease cooperating \nwith the United States.  Clearly, the Taliban in Pakistan was responding to pressure by United States drone attacks \non its strongholds -- some of which have resulted in the deaths of high value militant targets, not the least of which \nwas the strike on Baitalluh Mehsud. This call by Hakeemullah Mehsud  also highlighted a shift on the geopolitical \nterrain. Specifically, in a shift from the past in which the Pakistani intelligence units were often complicit in attacks \nby militants, now the Pakistani authorities were actively cooperating with the United States in the fight against \nIslamic militants.\n\nThe new strategic partnership between the United States and Pakistan was brought into sharp relief when United \nStates President Barack Obama signed into law \"The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs, said that the bill was \"a tangible manifestation of broad support for \nPakistan in the U.S., as evidenced by its bipartisan, bicameral, unanimous passage in Congress.\" Gibbs said that \nthe bill formalized a partnership whereby the United States was committed to improving living conditions in Pakistan \nvia  economic development, strengthened democracy, and combating extremists.\n\nShifting Relations with China --\n\nAfter leaving the 2009 Asia-Pacific summit in Singapore, President Barack Obama traveled to China for a three-\nday  visit to that country, beginning in Shanghai. The two countries have sought to strengthen ties in recent times, \nand the United States and China were expected to continue to work together on international issues ranging from \nclimate change to nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran. Despite a desire to work cooperatively, Washington \nand Beijing have nonetheless had to balance significant differences on these issues. Washington and Beijing must \ndeal with the chasm in their targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  As well, Washington has taken \na harsher approach than Beijing in dealing with the uranium enrichment activities of North Korea and Iran -- a \nscenario that will eventually have to be reconciled.  In the background of these global challenges -- where both \ncountries have played leading roles -- there is the reality that China holds much of the United States' debt, the fact \nthat a trade imbalance exists largely due to the undervalued Chinese currency, as well as the prevailing objections \nheld by the United States to China's human rights record, and its anxieties about the build-up of the Chinese \nmilitary.\n\nIt has been precisely this complicated relationship that has led the Obama administration toward a highly diplomatic \ntone in which there has been less focus on these contentious issues, and, instead, on the gradually improved \nbilateral ties.  To this end, President Obama addressed a large gathering of the bilateral delegations in Shanghai \nsaying, \"Both of the countries have benefited greatly from the progress we have made over the last two decades.\" \n\n\n\nThis diplomatic tone, which eschews the negative elements and emphasizes the common ground, was not likely to \ngain President Obama support from hardliners at home. Nevertheless, analysts have noted that President Obama \nhas been cognizant of the fact that ascendant China -- with one of the world's largest economies -- cannot be easily \nsubordinated.\n\nWhile in Shanghai, President Obama attended a town-hall style meeting attended by university students who had \nbeen selected by the Chinese authorities.  There, President Obama said his country did not seek to impose its will \nor system of government upon other nation states; however, he expressly noted that principles of freedom were not \nunique to only the United States. To this end, President Obama said,  \"These freedoms of expression, and worship, \nof access to information and political participation - we believe they are universal rights.\"  President Obama also \nemphasized the importance of  unfettered access to information in the information age, including the freedom of \npeople to criticize  his own policies.  His statement held particular poignance,  given the fact that the town hall was \nscrubbed from Internet access -- a manifestation of what has been called  the \"Great Firewall of China.\" President \nObama was scheduled to travel on to Beijing for a state visit, which was to be hosted by Chinese President Hu \nJintao.\n\nPolicy on Burma (Myanmar) --\n\nAt the start of November 2009, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Kurt Campbell, met \nwith the democratically-elected winner of Burma (Myanmar), Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been kept under house \narrest by the ruling military junta of that country.  The government of Burma (Myanmar) arranged for the meeting to \ntake place at the Inya Lake Hotel and marked the highest level visit by an American official to Suu Kyi since August \n2009 when Senator Jim Webb,  Chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the United States \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, was in Burma (Myanmar).  Earlier, Assistant Secretary Campbell met with the \ncountry's Prime Minister General Thein Sein, as well as a number of other government officials.  These moves \nappeared to be consistent with a potential foreign policy shift indicated by the United States towards Burma \n(Myanmar).  To that end, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  said that while the United States intended to keep \nsanctions in place against Burma (Myanmar) for the immediate future, it was exploring increased engagement.\n\nDuring his trip to Asia, United States President Obama waded into stormy geopolitical waters by attending a \nmeeting of the 10-country bloc  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which was also attended by one of \nthe leaders of the military junta ruling Burma (Myanmar).  It was a move aimed at pressing Burma (Myanmar) \ntowards a return to democracy.  While some hardliners at home were expected to rail against President Obama for \nattending such a meeting, it appeared to be consistent the Obama administration's policy of  \"pragmatic \nengagement.\"  In the past, leaders from the United States have not attended meetings with Asean  when the \nmilitary leadership of Burma (Myanmar) was present.\n\nIn something of a policy shift, it was hoped that increased engagement would yield more productive results on the \npath towards democratic change in Burma (Myanmar).  Still, such engagement,  would not include the removal of \nsanctions until democratic progress has been tracked.\n\nDuring this notable meeting attended by Burma's (Myanmar's) General Thein Sein, President Obama demanded \nthe release of pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held under house arrest for much of the last \ntwo decades.  As well, a joint statement by the United States and Asean called for \"free, fair, inclusive and \ntransparent\" elections in Burma (Myanmar) in 2010.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nUnited States (U.S.) Policy and Strategy  on Afghanistan\n\nSummary:\n\n\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama was expected to unveil his administration's much anticipated policy for \nAfghanistan.  At issue was the question of whether or not President Obama would grant the request of General \nStanley McChrystal, the chief United States and NATO commander in Afghanistan, for an increase of more than \n40,000 troops in that country to combat the threat of resurgent Taliban and other extremist Islamic elements, or if he \nwould opt for a more modest deployment.  Sources at the White House indicated there was almost no chance there \nwould be a withdrawal or de-escalation of the effort in Afghanistan.  Accordingly, speculation rested on (1) the \nnumber of United States troops to be deployed in a spring offensive, (2) the strategy behind United States efforts in \nAfghanistan [was it quelling al-Qaida and the Taliban? ] and (3) the exit strategy.\n\nTo these ends, President Obama addressed the American people from Westpoint on December 1, 2009. In that \nspeech, the president ordered another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan on an accelerated timetable starting in late \n2009 and reaching an apex in mid-2010.  The troops would be tasked with fighting extremist Islamic elements as \nwell as the training of Afghan security forces, with an eye on turning over the security apparatus to locals.  \nPresident Obama called on other countries to contribute troops for the NATO war effort in Afghanistan.  The \ngovernments of Afghanistan  and Pakistan also factored highly in the president's speech, with increased emphasis \nbeing placed on their responsibilities for  advancing stable governance free of corrution and  fighting terrorism \nrespectively. At the same time, the president outlined a clear exit strategy with redeployment expected to \ncommence within a year and ending in mid-2011, pending favorable circumstances on the ground.  President \nObama cast this war plan for Afghanistan as being a matter of necessity and not choice -- a view consistent with his \ncampaign position on the topic.\n\nBackground:\n\nOn Sept. 21, 2009,  it was reported in the Washington Post that General Stanley McChrystal, the chief United \nStates and NATO commander in Afghanistan was calling for more troops on the ground. McChrystal agued that the \nUnited States risked failure in the war in Afghanistan without such a commitment.\n\nIn a Pentagon report that was  sent to United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates, McChrystal  wrote, \n\"Resources will not win this war, but under-resourcing could lose it.\"  He continued, \"Although considerable effort \nand sacrifice have resulted in some progress, many indicators suggest the overall effort is deteriorating.\" Indeed, \nMcChrystal  warned that the United States had to reverse the momentum of the resurgent Taliban. The commander \nalso indicated that beyond military tactics, there was a need to revise overall strategy in Afghanistan.  To this end, \nhe wrote: \"We run the risk of strategic defeat by pursuing tactical wins that cause civilian casualties or unnecessary \ncollateral damage. The insurgents cannot defeat us militarily; but we can defeat ourselves.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's decision to release the document to the Washington Post gave rise to speculation  that some were \nattempting to force President Obama's hand on action in Afghanistan at a time when the American public's support \nfor that military effort was waning.\n\nIn October 2009, the commander of United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, \nofficially submitted a set of possible  options to policymakers, aimed at curbing the advance of resurgent Taliban.  \nAmong the proposals given to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen and NATO's Supreme Allied \nCommander Europe, Admiral James Stavridi, was an option to deploy between  30,000 to 40,000 additional combat \ntroops and trainers to Afghanistan. This option was said to be strongly favored by McChrystal, although there were \nother options, such as a more modest increase of troop strength by 10,000, as well as another plan calling for a \nsurge of  60,000 troops to be sent to Afghanistan, and an option for maintaining current troop strength. While the \nactual content of the proposal has remained confidential, McChrystal has himself said that more troops were \nneeded to help support the Afghan security forces who were preparing to take full control over the country's security \nin 2013.  Moreover,  McChrystal -- who was backed by NATO leadership -- was calling for  a broad counter-\ninsurgency strategy.\n\nStrategic Overview\n\nGeneral McChrystal's report  was being reviewed by President Barack Obama who had said earlier-- on Sept. 20, \n2009, during an interview on CNN -- that he would assess the findings from his commander on the ground, before \n\n\n\nmaking a decision as to the possible deployment of troops to an increasingly unpopular conflict.  President Obama  \nnoted,  \"I don't want to put the resource question before the strategy question.\"  He then continued, \"But right now, \nthe question is, the first question is, are we doing the right thing? Are we pursuing the right strategy?\" The president \nacknowledged that the original mission to hunt those responsible for 9/11 could be subject to what is known as \n\"mission creep.\"\n\nBefore considering McChrystal's request for more combat troops in Afghanistan, the White House in the United \nStates said it wanted to undergo an overall strategic review of its policy in the Afghan-Pak region. At issue for the \nObama administration was the question of whether to  remain on track with the existing mission, and perhaps with \nan extended nation-building imperative, aimed at securing the cooperation of the Afghan populace.  Alternatively, \nthere was the question as to if the mission should be recalibrated, perhaps with reduced military operations, and a \nconcentration purely on striking al-Qaida terrorists in the Afghan-Pak border area.\n\nBy the end of October 2009, media reports emerged that the Obama administration would make their Afghanistan \nstrategy known after that country's contested presidential election was decided, given the  rising clamor for the \nestablishment of a credible government in Afghanistan. Indeed, the Obama administration noted there would be no \naction pending the establishment of a legitimate government in Afghanistan.  In an interview with CNN, White \nHouse Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said it would be \"reckless\" to make such a decision without  thoroughly \ndetermining whether or not the government at the helm of Afghanistan held democratic authority.  That rationale \nwas not helped by the fact that the election was marred by allegations of fraud, and the fact that the main opposition \ncandidate withdrew from the second round, effectively allowing President Karzai to hold onto to power by default.\n\nAround that period, there were intimations that President Obama was prepared to accept that Afghanistan's political \nfuture might well include the Taliban's involvement, given the Islamist movement's ingrained influence on Afghan \nculture.  However, the Obama administration was not willing to go so far as allowing the Taliban to regain control \nover Afghanistan, and thus be able to give sanctuary to al-Qaida, as was the case in the period leading up to the \nSeptember 2001 terror attacks. This approach could gain steam at home in the United States where the citizenry \nwas war-weary,  consumed with domestic challenges, and hostile to the idea of a surge in Afghanistan. Indeed, \npolling data showed ever-devolving public support for the war itself in Afghanistan.  While Democrats in Congress \nwere not keen to endorse the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, Republicans argued that without \nsuch an escalation, the war effort could end in failure. Also at play was the fact that the United States military forces \nwere severely strained after eight years of war.\n\nThe focus on the dwindling number of al-Qaida in Afghanistan was derived from  President Obama's repeated \nquestion of \"Who is our adversary?\" during strategy meetings. Clearly, the United States military has been involved \nin a fight primarily against resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan -- a distinct entity from al-Qaida.  While the Taliban has \ngiven safe haven to al-Qaida in the past, and even though the two groups have reportedly worked together, the \nTaliban's objective has typically been local and territorial, while the terrorist network, al-Qaida, has global jihadist \naspirations.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs conveyed the Obama administration's stance on the distinction \nbetween the two entities saying, \"They're not the same type of group. It's certainly not backed up by any of the \nintelligence.\" Following this trajectory, in an interview with the BBC, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized \nthis objective saying that the United States' goal in Afghanistan was to defeat al-Qaida.  Secretary of Clinton also \nindicated that the White House's forthcoming strategy would involve \"a much more careful analysis of who actually \nis allied with al-Qaida.\"  Accordingly, the escalation of United States forces in Afghanistan could only be justified \nwith a modified mission.\n\nAt the same time, the reality was that as of 2009, while al-Qaida saw dwindling numbers in Afghanistan, its terrorist \nobjectives were now being carried out by an emboldened Taliban, and were illustrative of shifting alliances and \npower dynamic in the region. Of course, that region is not limited only to Afghanistan, and active factions of both al-\nQaida and the Taliban have been waging violent attacks in neighboring Pakistan.  Accordingly, President Obama \nwas expected to be considering a strategy that addressed the Afghan-Pak region.\n\n\n\nWhatever strategy was ultimately selected, it was apparent that Vice President Joe Biden's preference for targeted \nstrikes in the wider Afghan-Pak region, coupled with downgraded emphasis on the Taliban, was having an influence \non the decision-making process. In an article in Newsweek by Holly Bailey and Evan Thomas, there was a \ndescription of an insider strategy meeting that included the president and his top advisors.  It read as follows:\n\n\"Joe Biden had a question. During a long Sunday meeting with President Obama and top national-security advisers \non Sept. 13, the VP interjected, 'Can I just clarify a factual point? How much will we spend this year on \nAfghanistan?' Someone provided the figure: $65 billion. 'And how much will we spend on Pakistan?' Another figure \nwas supplied: $2.25 billion. 'Well, by my calculations that's a 30-to-1 ratio in favor of Afghanistan. So I have a \nquestion. Al Qaida is almost all in Pakistan, and Pakistan has nuclear weapons. And yet for every dollar we're \nspending in Pakistan, we're spending $30 in Afghanistan. Does that make strategic sense?'\"\n\nIn this way, Vice President Biden was not only emphasizing the concentration on al-Qaida -- the identified primary \nenemy of the United States, as noted above -- but, he was also illuminating the reality of the threat, which had to be \naddressed at the broader regional -- Afghan-Pak -- level.  Furthermore, he was questioning the strategic value of \nUnited States' expenditures in a country where there were only a few hundred al-Qaida vis a vis nuclear Pakistan \nwhere al-Qaida has been a far more dominant force.\n\nAugmenting the Biden approach has been the fact that the Pakistani government has been willing to carry out \naggressive offensive operations against militant Islamic extremists within its own borders.  Until recently, courting \nPakistani cooperation has been a difficult task, as certain factions of Pakistani society eschew close ties with the \nUnited States.\n\nDecision-Making Process\n\nBy the close of October 2009,  there was no decision forthcoming from the president who was, in fact, requesting \nstatus reports from across Afghanistan to assess specific conditions on the ground.  At home in the United States, \nthere was a clear division among those -- disproportionately from the neoconservative wing of the Republican \nParty -- who wanted the president to quickly assent to McChrystal's wishes, and the liberal base of the Democratic \nParty, which has demanded that President Obama bring an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n\nOpponents of the president from the Republican Party have also accused him of taking too long to make the \ncrucial decision on the war strategy for Afghanistan.  Former Vice President Dick Cheney has gone so far as to \ncharacterize President Obama as \"dithering\" over this key decision to be made.  However, military experts have \nnoted that any offensive operation would not begin until the spring of 2010. Other voices have said that when one \nconsiders the criticisms of the Bush administration's decision-making with regard to war, Cheney holds no credibility \non the matter.  They pointed to the fact that the rationale behind the Iraq war was flawed, and Republicans now \nclamoring for intensified efforts in Afghanistan held no such priority while the Iraq war was in full swing.  Allies of \nPresident Obama have said that he is functioning true to form, by acquiring as much information as possible and \nacting in a deliberative manner on the important issues of the day.\n\nAt the close of October 2009, President Obama flew to a military air base in Dover, Del.. to witness the return of 18 \nAmericans who had died in Afghanistan.  President Obama noted that the experience was a \"a sobering reminder\" \nof the human toll exacted by war.  His predecessor, George W. Bush, never met the return of American servicemen \nand servicewomen returning from war at Dover.  In fact, the Bush administration barred such events from being \npublicized.\n\nBy the first part of  November 2009, it was reported that President Barack Obama  had, in fact, rejected all four of \nthe options for Afghanistan, which had been presented by security advisers.  He asserted that they did not satisfy \nhis concerns over a clear exit strategy.  This position was confirmed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs \nwho said in an interview on Air Force One, \"An exit strategy is as important as ramping up troops. It's important to \nfully examine not just how we're going to get folks in but how we're going to get folks out.\"\n\nIn a related development, the United States  ambassador to Afghanistan was reported to have sent two classified \ncable to Washington expressing concern over the deployment of further troops to Afghanistan, at a time when the \n\n\n\nKarzai government in Kabul was re-elected amidst allegations of vote fraud -- the latest manifestation of corruption \nand mismanagement at the core of governance.  Indeed, it was the very climate of corruption and mismanagement \nthat facilitated the resurgence of the Taliban in the first place. Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry -- who served as the \nUnited States military commander in Afghanistan in 2006 and 2007 before retiring from the military and taking on a \ndiplomatic role in April 2009 -- apparently characterized Afghan President Hamid Karzai as  erratic, excoriated \nsenior Afghan government officials for their rampant  corruption,  and criticized the installation of warlords and drug \nsmugglers in influential positions on the Afghan governing landscape.  Eikenberry reportedly concluded that the \nAfghan leadership was incapable of being an effective -- or appropriate -- partner, and accordingly, advised \nPresident Obama against escalating troop strength in Afghanistan.\n\nNo actual decision on the Afghan-Pak strategy was expected until later in November 2009 when President Obama \nwas expected to return from a trip to Asia.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs defended the protracted \nprocess of decision-making saying, \"This has been a very rigorous and deliberative process ... to get the best \ndecision possible.\"  He continued, \"The president outlined the way we would go about making this decision, and \nthat's what he's stuck to. He understands that the key is getting this decision right. \"\n\nLatest Developments\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama was expected to unveil his administration's much anticipated policy for \nAfghanistan on Dec. 1, 2009.  At issue was the question of whether or not President Obama would grant the \nrequest of General Stanley McChrystal, the chief United States and NATO commander in Afghanistan, for an \nincrease of more than 40,000 troops in that country to combat the threat of resurgent Taliban and other extremist \nIslamic elements, as discussed above.  Alternatively, would the American president would opt for a more modest \ndeployment?  Reports from sources at the White House indicated that there was almost no chance that there would \nbe a withdrawal or de-escalation of the effort in Afghanistan.  Accordingly, speculation rested on the following -- (1) \nthe number of United States troops to be deployed in a spring offensive, (2) the strategy behind United States \nefforts in Afghanistan [was it quelling al-Qaida and the Taliban?], (3) the exit strategy. To these ends, President \nObama was expected to convey his plans to the American people in an national address from the United States \nMilitary Academy at Westpoint.\n\nIn a rare twist, Republicans were expected to applaud action pointing toward additional troops being deployed to \nAfghanistan whereas Democrats were expected to denounce such a course.  That being said, in his presidential \ncampaign before being elected, Barack Obama never suggested that he would withdrew troops from Afghanistan.  \nWhile he was an early vocal opponent of the Iraq war, characterizing it as \"the wrong war,\" Barack Obama \nsimultaneously asserted that the United States was not paying attention to the deteriorating situation in \nAfghanistan.  He had steadfastly stated that the United States' military objectives should focus on the hunt for those \nresponsible for the 2001 terror attacks at home -- al-Qaida and Osama Bin Laden in the mountainous region \nspanning Afghanistan and Pakistan.  As such, President Obama's continuing concentration on Afghanistan appears \nto be consistent with his expressed campaign promises and stated foreign policy stances.\n\nThe Speech\n\nDuring his adress to the nation from Westpoint, President Barack Obama ordered another 30,000 troops to \nAfghanistan on an accelerated timetable starting in late 2009 and reaching an apex in mid-2010.  The president \nexplained that the mission at hand would focus on \"disrupting,  dismantling, and defeating\"  al-Qaida in Afghanistan, \nand denying them any further safehaven in Afghanistan under Taliban auspices.\n\nAs such, a concomitant aspect of the mission would include reversing recent Taliban momentum.\n\nThe troops would also be tasked with the training of Afghan security forces, with an eye on turning over the security \napparatus to locals.  To that end,  President Obama  noted that the another central component of the mission was \nto stabilize Afghanistan so that the Afghan people would soon be able to take responsibility for their own security. \nAhead of the speech, there were reports that one \"brigade-sized element\"  of between 3,000 to 5,000 troops would \nbe solely tasked with training of Afghan troops. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, the president noted that the redeployment of United States forces was expected to commence \nwithin a year and end in mid-2011, pending favorable circumstances on the ground.\n\nIn this way, a timeline ending theoretically in 2011 appeared to be a core aspect of the exit strategy.  To that end, \nthe president emphasized that  he was ordering the fastest possible deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, \nin order to facilitate the conditions for a responsible a exit from that country.  Ultimately, the president said that the \nobjective was to \"come together to end the war successfully... for common security.\" \n\nPresident Obama called on  the international community to continue to work with the United States to deal with the \nglobal threat posed by militant Islamic extremists,  noting that  \"this burden is not ours alone to bear.\"  According to \nmedia reports ahead of the speech, the president had already conducted  talks with the leaders of several key \ncountries, including Denmark, France, Germany,  the United Kingdom, Russia, China and India, and had called for \nother countries to contribute up to 10,000 troops for the NATO war effort in Afghanistan.\n\nThe governments of Afghanistan  and Pakistan also factored highly in the president's speech, with increased \nemphasis being placed on their responsibilities for advancing stable governance free of corruption and fighting \nterrorism respectively.  He additionally addressed the Afghan people in saying that the United States did not seek to \noccupy their country, and sought to be a partner in the process toward stability, rather than a patron.  On Pakistan, \nhe particularly emphasized the nuclear capacity of that country and the heightened geopolitical stakes therein.\n\nFor his part, President Obama  cast this war plan for Afghanistan as being a matter of necessity and not choice -- a \nview consistent with his campaign position on the topic.  In his speech, however, he made clear that his decision \nwas not made easily, saying: \"I do not make this decision lightly.\"\n\nThe president's philosophical stance on the matter was made clear when he said that he had opposed the Iraq war \nbecause he believe in restraint when it comes to the use of military force.  But at the same time, the president \nacknowledged that he believed the current course  of remaining in Afghanistan at current levels and without an exit \nstrategy  was \"unsustainable.\"  To this end, President Obama said that \"the status quo of muddling through\" would \nonly be a costly option that served to prolong the current farrago, ultimately never generating the conditions in \nwhich United States forces could leave Afghanistan.\n\nThe president went on to state that the decision was made in the interests of national security, noting that the \ndangers emanating from the Afghan-Pak region were \"no idle danger\" and \"no theoretical threat.\"\n\nPresident Obama addressed the fact that he inherited two costly wars amidst an economic crisis  in saying: \"In the \nface of the current economic crisis, we simply cannot afford to ignore the price of these wars...All told, by the time I \ntook office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars.\"  He thusly specified a current \nprice tag of $30 billion for the year, while also noting, \"I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as \nwe work to bring down our deficit.\"\n\nObama connected his aforementioned exit strategy with former President Eisenhower's call for balancing domestic \nand foreign interests by saying:  \"Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It \nunderwrites our diplomacy. ... That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because \nthe nation that I am most interested in building is our own.\"  Fundamentally, the president made clear he was not \ninterested in an endless war in Afghanistan precisely because American interests at home and abroad were at \nstake.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nWhile the president did not go into great detail about the Afghan-Pak strategy in his speech, his administration's \npolicy was illuminated in a separate interview with United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, which was conducted \nby MSNBC  News.  Dr. Rice explained that while many  al-Qaida members had crossed the porous border from \nAfghanistan to Pakistan after the Taliban lost power, they were still moving across the border regions, and could re-\n\n\n\nestablish safehaven in Afghanistan if resurgent Taliban in that country regained control over broad swaths of \nAfghan territory.  She explained the symbiotic relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaida by characterizing \nAfghanistan under Taliban rule as the \"tissue\" within which \"the cancer of al-Qaida\" develops.  In effect, resurgent \nTaliban can facilitate the ascendancy of al-Qaida.  While the United States and NATO forces were actively dealing \nwith this threat on the Afghan side of the border, there was pressure on the Pakistanis to continue their efforts to the \nto same on their side of the border.  Dr. Rice also emphasized the fact that although al-Qaida members could be \nfound in various countries across the world, the mountainous Afghan-Pak region was the very location of terror \ntraining camps -- a venue for far more ambitious terrorist planning than single cell terror operations.  Moreover, she \nechoed the president's own words when she said that there was a \"proximate threat to national security emanating \nfrom Afghan- Pak border.\" \n\nNATO says 25 countries have pledged thousands of troops to support U.S.-led war effort in Afghanistan -- \n\nA week after United States President Barack Obama ordered another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of  the \nnew strategy (discussed above), NATO announced that 25 countries had pledged a total of around 7,000 more \ntroops to support the United States-led war effort in Afghanistan. At a news conference following talks with NATO \nforeign ministers, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: \"Nations are backing up their words with \ndeeds.\"  He continued, \"At least 25 countries will send more forces to the mission in 2010. They have offered \naround 7,000 new forces with more to come ... That is solidarity in action and it will have a powerful effect on the \nground.\"  Rasmussen also remarked on the new road map for operations, noting that the new NATO mission would \ninclude amplified aid and training of Afghan security forces, consistent with the strategy outlined by President \nObama.  He also emphasized that another core objective remained the same -- to prevent Afghanistan from falling \ninto the clutches of militant extremist Islamists.\n\nFor its part, the Afghan Taliban said that the plans outlined by President Obama and echoed by Secretary-General \nRasmussen would serve only to strengthen their resolve.  Nevertheless, the battlefield commander, General \nStanley McChrystal, lauded the new war plan for Afghanistan, by emphasizing the benefits of more troops in the \nfield and conjuring up  Winston Churchill in a videophone speech as he declared \"the end of the beginning\" of the \nwar.\n\nSenate report indicates that Bin Laden was \"within grasp\" in late 2001 --\n\nA report by the United States Senate indicated that United States military forces had al-Qaida leader Osama Bin \nLaden \"within their grasp\" in Afghanistan in late 2001.  The report, which was prepared by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee staff, stated that calls for reinforcements of United States troops were dismissed, effectively allowing the \nworld's most well-known terrorist mastermind to \"walk unmolested\" into Pakistan's tribal regions.  The report stated \nthat United States commanders in the field \"chose to rely on air strikes and untrained Afghan militias\" to pursue Bin \nLaden in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, while at the same time keeping most of America's military power \"on \nthe sidelines.\"  In many senses, it was an argument articulated by former Democratic presidential contender \nSenator John Kerry, who was now serving as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThe report placed blame on officials in the administration of former United States President George W. Bush.  \nNotably, there was a sense that former United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld objected to an \nescalation of troop strength in Afghanistan because it could present a backlash of sorts, and also because he did \nnot believe the evidence about Bin Laden's location was conclusively accurate. The report excoriated this claim as \nfollows: \"The review of existing literature, unclassified government records and interviews with central participants \nunderlying this report removes any lingering doubts and makes it clear that Osama Bin Laden was within our grasp \nat Tora Bora.\"\n\nWhile the report acknowledged that eliminating  Bin Laden would not have removed the global threat from Islamist \nterrorists, his escape and survival served elevate the al-Qaida leader into being a \"potent symbolic figure\" among \nIslamic extremists. The report also argued that the failure to kill or capture Bin Laden has had long-term deleterious \neffects, while also contributing to the ongoing and protracted conflict in Afghanistan, marked by the efforts of \n\n\n\nresurgent Taliban. To that end, the report stated that the \"failure to finish the job\" laid the groundwork for the current \ninsurgency in Afghanistan, and inflamed the \"internal strife now endangering Pakistan.\"\n\nThe release of the report has coincided with an anticipated announcement by United States President Barack \nObama on a strategy for Afghanistan going forward.  For his part, President Obama was an early vocal opponent of \nthe Iraq war, characterizing it as \"the wrong war.\"  President Obama simultaneously asserted that the United States \nwas not paying attention to the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.  He had steadfastly stated that the United \nStates' military objectives should focus on the hunt for those responsible for the 2001 terror attacks at home -- al-\nQaida and Osama Bin Laden in the mountainous region spanning Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nSuicide bomber kills seven CIA agents in Afghanistan; may have been courted as possible informant --\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2009, seven Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officers were killed by a suicide bomber in the Afghan \narea of Khost -- a known hotbed of Taliban militant activity. It was the worst attack against United States \nintelligence agents since the American embassy was bombed in Beirut in 1983. United States intelligence officials \nlater said that CIA agents may have been trying to recruit the suicide bomber as a possible informant, not knowing \nthat he would turn out to be a \"double agent\" of sorts.  It was possible that this background may have accounted for \nthe fact that he had not undergone a full body search before entering the military base at Khost and was, therefore, \nable to move inside the base with the explosives belt undetected. The Taliban claimed responsibility saying that one \nof its members carried out the attack.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nUnited States and Russia announce replacement treaty aimed at reducing nuclear arms should be ready by year's \nend --\n\nSummary:\n\nThe United States and the Russian Federation announced they would present a new treaty, aimed at replacing the  \n1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) -- the prevailing nuclear arms agreement between the two \ncountries that was  set to expire in December 2009.  The announcement came at the close of a summit of Asia-\nPacific leaders in Singapore, and occurred following discussions between United States President Barack Obama \nand Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.  According to United Stated officials, the leaders of the United States and \nRussia agreed on the broad outline a new treaty, which could be signed in December 2009 when President Obama \nwas expected to travel to Europe to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.  Both the United States and Russia \ncharacterized the bilateral negotiations as positive, pragmatic and cooperative.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn April 2009, United States President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev agreed to forge a \nnew nuclear arms reduction pact, which would not only replace  START --the treaty signed by former United States \nPresident George H. W. Bush and former Soviet President Michel Gorbachev  -- but also expand upon its \nparameters, with an eye on increased disarmament.\n\nThen, in July 2009, at a summit in Moscow, President Obama and President Medvedev agreed to cut the number of \nnuclear warheads in the possession each country  to between 1,500 and 1,675 over the course of the next seven \nyears.  Russian President Medvedev described this particular objective  as \"reasonable.\" The agreement was \nexpected to set the foundation for a later treaty to be forged, which  would replace START as noted above. \nSpeaking from the Kremlin in Moscow, President Obama explained that he intended to move toward nuclear arms \nreduction and greater bilateral engagement saying, \"We must lead by example, and that's what we are doing here \ntoday.\"  He continued, \"We resolve to reset U.S.-Russian relations so that we can cooperate more effectively in \nareas of common interest.\"\n\n\n\nIn October 2009, United States officials were in Russia  for missile defense negotiations with Russian counterparts.  \nThe Russian were led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov while Undersecretary of State for Arms Control \nand International Security, Ellen Tauscher, was to head the United States delegation. After the groundwork has \nbeen established, further talks were set to take place later in the week between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei \nLavrov and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the negotiations, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the United States and Russia must \nadvance strategic arms reduction.  In an interview with Russia's Channel Once, President Medvedev said, \"While \ndealing with non-proliferation, we must simultaneously deal with the limitation and reduction of strategic offensive \npotentials -- both carriers and nuclear warheads.\" Medvedev continued, \"Today we have the chance to advance this \nprocess. We will be dealing with this. And I call on our American partners to do the same.\"\n\nWith the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty set to expire on Dec. 5, 2009, President Medvedev said he believed \nRussia and the United States could reach a new strategic arms reduction accord.\n\nHe observed, \"There is definitely a chance for the agreement, since the new U.S. administration has demonstrated \ninterest in this issue.\"  Medvedev also said he did not support the expansion of nuclear weapons states recognized \nby the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Striking a tone harmonious with his American counterpart, President \nBarack Obama, President Medvedev said, \"We are against the extension of the nuclear club. Otherwise the \nsituation will get out of control. The world without nuclear weapons is an ideal which should be on our agenda.\"\n\nPresident  Medvedev also reiterated his appreciation for President Obama's decision to scrap the Bush-era missile \ndefense shield plan, calling President Obama's new missile shield plans \"sensible.\"  He additionally noted that \nRussia was eager to extend missile defense cooperation with the United States and Europe.\n\nOn this very issue, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has struck a similar chord. On Oct. 13, 2009, \nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Moscow to meet  with Russian President Dmitry \nMedvedev and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lvov. In addition to the issues related to a new successor treaty \naimed at strategic arms reduction, the two diplomats also discussed the matter of missile defense. In an interview \nwith the Newsweek's Russian edition, which was  published in the  German daily, Die Welt, and translated by \nReuters,\n\nSecretary Clinton addressed the Obama administration's plan to scrap the Bush-era missile defense system in \nEastern Europe saying, \"On the question of the missile shield, we are very open to cooperation with the Russians. \nWe have made this clear to them. We believe that a joint missile defense would make sense.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Newsweek's Russian edition, which was  published in the  German daily, Die Welt, and \ntranslated by Reuters,  Secretary Clinton said that her country and Russia found broad agreement on the issue of \nIran's controversial nuclear program.  While there was no specific promise from Moscow to impose harsh santions \non Iran if diplomacy failed, Secretary Clinton said, \"We have agreed to make diplomacy the priority with Iran. But if \nwe are not successful, we will consider other steps.\" She described her talks with Russian leaders as \"very \nconstructive\" and noted that the United States and Russia  were in \"full agreement\" on the path before them.  The \nUnited States' top diplomat also lauded Russia for not following through  with plans to deliver high-grade S300 air \ndefense missiles to Iran. \n\nNegotiations and Bilateral Relations\n\nIn November 2009, nuclear arms reductions negotiations were on the agenda at a meeting between the leaders of \nthe United States and the Russian Federation.  At issue was the crafting of a new agreement that would replace the \n1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) -- the prevailing nuclear arms agreement between the two \ncountries -- which was  set to expire in December 2009.\n\n\n\nAhead of negotiations with Russian President Medvedev, during a news conference in Japan with Prime Minister \nYukio Hatoyama, United States President Obama signaled his country's readiness to move forward on the issue of \njoint disarmament saying,  \"We are already taking steps to bring down our nuclear stockpiles in cooperation with the \nRussian government.\"\n\nAs noted above, days later, the United States and the Russian Federation  announced they would present a new \ntreaty, aimed at replacing START. The announcement came at the close of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in \nSingapore, and occurred following discussions between United States President Barack Obama and Russian \nPresident Dmitry Medvedev.  According to United Stated officials, the leaders of the United States and Russia \nfound concurrence on the broad outline a new treaty, which could be signed in December 2009 when President \nObama was expected to travel to Europe to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAs reported in the Associated Press, President Obama said that he and his Russian counterpart had made \n\"excellent progress\" on the new treaty negotiations. President Medvedev said his objective was to \"finalize the text \nof the document by December.\" While acknowledging that technical details were yet to be worked through, \nPresident Obama said, \"I'm confident that if we work hard and with a sense of urgency, we'll be able to get that \ndone.\"\n\nWith such a tight timeline in the offing,  Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said \nhe did not anticipate any significant obstacles that foresee could not be resolved before December 2009. According \nto the Associated Press, he described the urgency motivating both American and Russian negotiations saying, \n\"Neither side wants to go without a new agreement for very long.\"\n\nThe news agency, Itar-Tass, cited Russian presidential aide Sergei Prikhodko, who described the timeline on the \nagreement as follows: \"We are working in order to prepare the treaty within the timeframe about which the \npresidents spoke.\"\n\nPrikhodko also lauded the spirit of engagement from the Obama administration in the United States saying, \"We are \nsatisfied at present with the nature of the open, pragmatic and future-oriented dialogue that is developing with the \nnew administration: it allows us to hope for the continuation of the joint work on issues where solutions have not \nbeen found yet.\"  He continued, \"Each meeting of President Medvedev with Barack Obama give a considerable \nimpulse to the interaction in bilateral affairs, contributes to confidence building, understanding on key issues.\" \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the current climate of bilateral relations as follows: \"The two \npresidents absolutely agree that we should overcome the stagnation in relations between Moscow and Washington \nthat was observed during the Bush administration when good personal relations did not transform in any way into \nsomething really partnership-like.\"\n\nThe White House has not denied the existence of disagreements between the United States and Russia on certain \nelements of the proposed agreement to replace START.  As noted by Itar-Tass, a spokesman for the White \nHouse's National Security Council, Mike Hammer, explained that both countries were working to resolve the \nexisting disagreements. Echoing some of the sentiment expressed by Prikhodko and Lavrov, Hammer \ncharacterized relations with the Russians as constructive, and he noted that both the United States and Russia \nwere committed to the  December 2009 deadline, given the imperative of increasing global security and advancing \nthe objective of global non-proliferation.\n\nIndeed, President Obama's call for nuclear disarmament was one of the key rationales behind the  Nobel \nCommittee's decision to award him the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.  At the time of its announcement, the Nobel \nCommittee said that it \"attached special importance to President Obama's vision of and work for a world without \nnuclear weapons.\"  To that end,  the committee noted that Obama's vision and work related to a nuclear weapons-\nfree world has \"powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations.\"\n\nOn Dec. 21, 2009, Russia and the United States were reported to have made good progress on negotiations on a \nnew strategic arms agreement.  In an off-side meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, United States \nPresident Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and expressed confidence that a new \n\n\n\ntreaty would soon be signed. At issue was the impending expiration of the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \nand the need to forge a new agreement.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nThe 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was forged between  the United States of America and the \nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. START  \nprohibited its two signatories from deploying more than 6,000 nuclear warheads on a total of 1,600 intercontinental \nballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers. START has been regarded as the most \ncomplex and substantial  arms control treaty in history. It was signed just months before the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion on July 31, 1991, and its entry-into-force was delayed as a result.  An annex was crafted,  which enforced the \nterms of the treaty upon the newly-independent states of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, and called for \nthe transposition of nuclear arms from  Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to Russia for disposal.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nBarack Obama wins Nobel Peace Prize\n\nThe Nobel Committee in Oslo (Norway) announced on October 9, 2009, that United States President Barack \nObama won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for his  \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and \ncooperation between peoples.\"  For his part, President Barack Obama  said that he was \"surprised and deeply \nhumbled\" to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize less than 10 months into his presidency.  He said that the award \nwas a \"call to action\" and urged  international action in facing the global challenges that \"cannot be met by one \nperson or by one nation alone.\"\n\nBarack Obama joins three American presidents and one vice president in a select club of peace prize laureates. \nTheodore Roosevelt was the prize laureate in 1906 for negotiating an end to the war between Russia and Japan.  \nIn 1919, Woodrow Wilson earned the Peace Prize for his work towards the  formation of the League of Nations. \nJimmy Carter garnered the 2002 Peace Prize after he left office for his work in advancing peace and democracy in \ncountries across the world.  In 2007, former Vice President Al Gore earned the Peace Prize for his work on climate \nchange after he left office.\n\nThe announcement was regarded as something of a surprise with detractors claiming that President Obama had \nonly been in power for a few months and, therefore, had not necessarily accomplished anything of substance.  \nOther critics of the award going to Obama have said that he received the award while two acting as Commander in \nChief over two wars.  But it should be noted that the Nobel Peace Prize is not necessarily awarded to pacifists or on \nthe basis of accomplishments. It is also not a humanitarian reward. Indeed, it is a political award, oriented to \nachieving certain broadly-defined liberal and democratic outcomes.\n\nTo these ends, the  Nobel Committee has made a point of awarding some recipients who are \"in process\" in their \npursuits, essentially encouraging the peace process along.  For example, Aung San Suu Kyi's plight to free Burma \nfrom the rule by military junta has yet to be realized, yet her distinction as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate has only \naugmented her influence.  Likewise for the case of Iranian dissident, Shirin Abadi. As noted by Kristian Berg \nHarpviken of the International Peace Institute in Oslo in regard the selection of Obama - \"They want the prize to \nhave an impact on things that are about to happen and want to affect events.\" Accordingly, this is part of the \nrevitalized activist thrust of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee.\n\nNevertheless, the Nobel Committee was quick to point out that it had chosen Obama precisely for his significant \naccomplishment in shifting the climate of international relations to one of diplomacy and engagement reliant on \ninternational instruments of peace and stability, and away from muscular militarism and hegemony. To that end, the \nNobel Committee said that Barack Obama \"created a new climate in international politics. Multilateral diplomacy \nhas regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions \ncan play.\"\n\n\n\nThe Nobel Committee also said that it \"attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world \nwithout nuclear weapons.\"  To that end,  the committee noted that Obama's vision and work related to a nuclear \nweapons-free world has \"powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations.\"\n\nThe Nobel Committee appeared to issue a tacit rebuke against the previous Bush administration -- sustained by a \nnod to the new Obama administration --  in regard to environmental policy.  The committee noted that Obama's \ninitiatives were responsible for the fact that United States was now  playing a \"more constructive role\" in meeting \nclimate change challenges.\n\nBut in addition to these accomplishments, the Nobel Committee explained its central reason for choosing Barack \nObama as its 2009 Peace Prize recipient. It said, \"Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama \ncaptured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future.\" It continued, \"His diplomacy is founded \nin the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared \nby the majority of the world's population.\" Perhaps most importantly, the Nobel Committee underlined its core \nrationale for selecting Barack Obama as the 2009 Peace Prize recipient when it said, \"For 108 years, the \nNorwegian Nobel Committee has sought to stimulate precisely that international policy and those attitudes for \nwhich Obama is now the world's leading spokesman.\"  In this way, the Nobel Committee was suggesting that \nObama was leading global consensus on how to address and resolve global conflicts and challenges, and he was \nleading this charge while embodying the Nobel Peace Prize ethos.\n\nRound up of world reaction --\n\nUN SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON\n\nWe are entering an era of renewed multilateralism, a new era where the challenges facing humankind demand \nglobal common cause and uncommon global effort. President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialogue and \nengagement on the world's biggest problems: climate change, nuclear disarmament and a wide range of peace and \nsecurity challenges.\n\nFRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY\n\nIt confirms, finally, America's return to the hearts of the people of the world... you can count on my resolute support \nand that of France.\n\nANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR\n\nIn a short time he has established a new tone, creating a willingness for dialogue and I think we all should support \nhim to make peace in this world possible. There is a lot do but a window of opportunity has been opened. His \nadvocacy of a world free of nuclear arms is an aim we all need to make real in the next few years.\n\nYUKIO HATOYAMA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER\n\nI am really pleased. I want to congratulate him from my heart. I've seen the world changing since President Obama \ntook office. It was outstanding when he made the speech in Prague calling for a nuclear-free world.\n\nNATO SECRETARY GENERAL ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN\n\nPresident Obama has made extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between \npeoples.  He has also demonstrated his strong commitment to help build peace and defend fundamental human \nrights, including through the Atlantic alliance. This honor is well deserved.\n\nMOHAMED ELBARADEI, HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY AND NOBEL PEACE \nPRIZE WINNER\n\nThere is nobody today in my view who is more deserving of that peace prize than Barack Obama. In less than a \nyear he brought a radical change in the way we look at ourselves, in the way we look at our world. He is restoring \nthe basic core values that every one of us should live by - dialogue, respect, democracy, due process, human \nrights, a security system that does not depend on nuclear weapons. His dedication to these values rekindles hope \nthat, finally, we could have a world at peace with itself.\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 10, 2009,  United States President Barack Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway .  \nPresident Obama acknowledged the irony of receiving the lauded peace prize at a time when he had ordered more \ntroops to fight the ongoing war against militant terrorists in Afghanistan.  By way of explanation, he attempted to \nthread together the notion of a just war with the tragic realities of conflict.  He explained: \"A non-violent movement \ncould not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince al-Qaida's leaders to lay down their arms.\" He \nthen said, \"To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism -- it is a recognition of history.\"  At the \nsame time, President Obama noted that this understanding had to go hand in hand with the realization that  \"no \nmatter how justified, war promises human tragedy.\"\n\nPresident Obama also linked the war in Afghanistan with the matter of religious extremism  by railing against the \nuse of religion \"to justify the murder of innocents.\"  He went onto note, \"Such a warped view of religion is not just \nincompatible with the concept of peace but the purpose of faith -- for the one rule that lies at the heart of every \nmajor religion is that we do unto others what we would have them do unto us.\"\n\nPresident Obama additionally addressed one of the themes that won him the Nobel Peace Prize in the first place -- \nnuclear disarmament by mentioning the security conflicts posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Obama in the first year of his presidency has been a matter of \nconsternation, with some critics alleging that the United States president had not been in office long enough to \ndeserve the honor.  At the ceremony in Oslo, the head of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, Thorbjoern Jagland, \nsaid, \"Many have argued that the prize comes too early, but history can tell us a great deal about lost opportunities. \nIt is now, today, that we have the opportunity to support President Obama's ideas. This year's prize is indeed a call \nto action for all of us.\"\n\nSpecial Report\n\nAttempted Terror Attack on U.S. Airliner\n\nSummary:\n\nYemen's al-Qaida connection has become the focus of geopolitical anxiety in the aftermath of an attempted \nbombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day.  A Nigerian national charged with attempting to bomb the aircraft said \nhe received explosives and training  from al-Qaida in Yemen.  Fears of terrorist attacks emanating from that \ncountry have led to increased anti-terrorism support for Yemen.\n\nThe Foiled Attack:\n\nOn Dec. 25, 2009, a Nigerian national on a flight from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit in the United States \nattempted to carry out a bomb attack.  The Christmas Day incident occurred when Northwest Airlines Flight 253, \ncarrying 278 passengers and 11 crew, was less than half an hour from arriving at its destination.\n\nThe incident ensued when the suspect, identified as 23-year old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to ignite an \nincendiary device, and burnt his leg in so doing. No one else was hurt in what United States officials described as a \nfailed terrorist attack.  Passengers on the aircraft described a scene of panic in the cabin after they  detected \nsmoke and flames.  There were some suggestions that the attempted bomb attack was thwarted when one \npassenger, Dutch tourist Jasper Schuringa, jumped across several rows of seats to tackle the suspect, and other \npassengers then helped to fully subdue him.  Water, blankets and a fire extinguisher were used to put out the fire.  \nA report by the Associated Press noted that the lives of the passengers and crew about Flight 253 were actually \nsaved because the explosive device failed to detonate due to an apparent malfunction.  Nonetheless, Schuringa \nwas hailed as a hero for his quick reaction to the unfolding crisis aboard the flight.\n\n\n\nThe aircraft was soon cleared for emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport where Abdulmutallab was taken \ninto official custody and treated for the aforementioned burns at the  University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann \nArbor. While there, United States District Judge Paul Borman officially charged Abdulmutallab  with placing a \ndestructive device on an aircraft, and attempting to destroy a passenger jet by detonating a bomb. According to the \nAssociated Press, Abdulmutallab was asked in English if he understood the charges being brought against him and \nresponded, \"Yes, I do.\"  Abdulmutallab's lawyer later said he had been transferred to a federal prison in Milan, \nMichigan.\n\nAbdulmutallab reportedly told United States authorities that he  was acting on behalf of the notorious terrorist \nenclave, al-Qaida.  Indeed, ABC news reported that Abdulmutallab told authorities that he spent one month being \ntrained by al-Qaida in Yemen. Abdulmutallab also apparently explained that he acquired the explosive powder from \nal-Qaida operatives in Yemen, which he attached to his leg and  mixed in a concoction with liquid chemicals, with \nthe intent of causing an explosion.  Subsequent media reports indicated that the highly explosive substance was  \npentaerythritol (PETN) -- the same substance used by the failed show bomber, Richard Reid, exactly eight years \nearlier in December 2001, when he attempted to bring down a flight from France to the United States.  CNN \nreported that the amount of PETN in this 2009 case was certainly enough to destroy the aircraft, presumably killing \nall those on board.\n\nCounter-terrorism authorities in the Netherlands confirmed that Abdulmutallab first boarded a KLM  flight in Lagos, \nNigeria, bound for Amsterdam.  It was not known at the time of writing if Abdulmutallab had the explosives attached \nto his body when his originating flight departed from Nigeria at the very start of the journey. In fact, the logistical \ndetails were complicated by the revelation that Abdulmutallab actually flew from Ghana to Nigeria on a one-way \nticket.\n\nNevertheless, once Abdulmutallab arrived  in the Netherlands, he transferred to the Northwest flight headed to the \nUnited States. According to the Justice Department in the United States,  Abdulmutallab at that point had \"a device \nattached to his body\" when he boarded the flight in Amsterdam bound for Detroit.  He presumably was allowed to \nboard that flight because he had a valid United States visa.\n\nThere were serious questions being raised regarding the ease with which the transportation of explosives was able \nto elude detection. It was possible that security conditions in Nigeria helped in this regard.  That is to say, the Lagos \nairport has long held the dubious distinction of being one of the least efficient travel centers in the world, where lax \nsecurity runs rampant, largely as a result of widespread corruption.  On the other hand, later evidence showing the \nexplosives had been carried in a specially-made pouch within the alleged bombers undergarments would suggest \nthat detection would be almost impossible using a regular magnetometers, and would require more intrusive body \nscanning techniques. \n\nAccordingly, security at airports worldwide was expected to increase.  For his part, United States President Barack \nObama ordered that air travel be subject to heightened security measures. Homeland Security and the \nTransportation Security Administration in the United States warned that additional screening procedures would be \nimplemented, however, they declined to specify particulars, suggesting that the intent was to preserve the element \nof surprise for obvious security reasons.  Certain international aircraft carriers, though, such as Air Canada and \nBritish Airways, noted on their websites that passengers on international flights would be subject to much more \nintense security, and would be prevented from accessing carry-on luggage or getting up from their seats at certain \npoints during flights. Delays, particularly on trans-Atlantic flights, were being anticipated.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Robert Gibbs announced that a review of air safety was underway.  On one front, there \nwould be an investigation into the systems in place for detecting explosives before passengers board flights.  On \nanother front, there would be an examination of the terrorist identification protocols, in light of the revelation that  \nAbdulmutallab was already listed in a broad terrorist database and yet allowed to board a flight.  Homeland Security \nSecretary Janet Napolitano  explained in an interview with CNN that despite the fact that Abdulmutallab's own \nfather had warned the United States' embassy in Nigeria that his son might have jihadist inclinations, it was not \nsufficient actionable information to have moved him to the terrorism \"no fly\" list.  The actual criteria for inclusion in \nthese various databases -- some overseen by the Director of National Intelligence and some by the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation -- was not made known to the public.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the fact that Abdulmutallab's own father -- a well-known Nigerian banker -- had gone to such lengths \nto  notify United States officials of his suspicions, along with revelations that Abdulmutallab had purchased a ticket \nfrom Ghana using cash and was carrying only one carry-on piece of luggage, were matters expected to be subjects \nof grave critique in the coming weeks.  Typically, such actions would be flagged as suspicious and indicative of a \npossible terrorist threat and so Secretary Napolitano's assurances that flying was still \"very, very safe\" were unlikely \nto go unchallenged.  However, despite the perception of breaches in the air transport security system, preliminary \nexaminations in the Netherlands -- where Flight 253 originated -- found that existing security procedures were \ncorrectly followed.  The obvious conclusion, therefore, has been that current security technology does not facilitate \nthe easy detection of explosive devices and substances.  Indeed, as indicated above, most passengers in airports \nhave to pass through only magnetometers, which detect metal and not explosives.  Accordingly, there was likely to \nbe intensified focus in the future on equipping  airports with \"puffer\" machines that detect explosive powder residue, \nmanual hand swabs to the same end, bomb-sniffing dogs, as well as body scanners.\n\nMeanwhile, attention was on Abdulmutallab himself, who was born into a life of relative privilege. He once studied \nengineering at a prestigious school in the United Kingdom, but his Islamic views had caught the attention of his own \nfamily, including his father, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab. Indeed, media reports suggested that he was estranged from his \nfamily, actually  losing touch with them in the months he may have been living in Yemen. The official Saba News \nAgency in Yemen subsequently reported that Abdulmutallab had, in fact, been living in that country from August \n2009 to the start of December 2009 while he attended the Sanaa Institute for the Arabic Language (SIAL). Nigerian \nauthorities suggested that Abdulmutallab used surreptitious means to re-enter Nigeria before departing on the trip \nthat would span three continents.\n\nYemen and al-Qaida:\n\nThe United States government has been reticent about drawing conclusions about a global terrorist plot in this \ncase. Nevertheless, this attempt to carry out an in-flight bombing on Christmas Day appeared to be in keeping with \nal-Qaida's latest terrorist directives.  The NEFA Foundation  published an October 2009 al-Qaida article calling for \noperatives to use \"small explosives\" to kill \"apostates\" and Westerners at airports and in aircrafts. Moreover, \nAbdulmutallab -- the man at the center of the Christmas Day attempted terror attack -- has expressly conjured up \nal-Qaida in his interrogations with authorities.  Finally, a Yemen-based branch of the network removed some \nprevailing doubts about the orchestration of the failed terrorist attack  by claiming responsibility.\n\nIt should be noted that al-Qaida was not the only meaningful reference point offered by Abdulmutallab to the \nauthorities during initial interrogations.  Also of significance was his mentioning of Yemen as being the place he \ngarnered the PETN, as well as the venue of his Islamic militant training. Yemen -- the ancestral home of Osama Bin \nLaden  -- is strategically located at the end of the Arabian peninsula and stretches from the Red Sea to the Gulf of \nAden.  It is also located in close proximity to another emerging al-Qaida haven -- Somalia.  Accordingly, Yemen has \nincreasingly factored into the discussions of global terrorism.\n\nAl-Qaida's satellite base in Yemen may be attempting to gain ascendancy at a time when global attention is on the \nAfghan-Pak region. To this end,  Anwar Eshki, the head of the Middle East Center for Strategic and Legal Studies, \nhas argued that  al-Qaida in Yemen \"is stronger than it was a year ago\" and intent on turning that country into a \nmajor base of operations against the West.  Part of that strength may be derived from the fact that Saudi and \nYemeni elements of al-Qaida have joined forces to form the merged entity, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  The \nSaudi authorities, who have carried out a crackdown on its elements, have suggested that many Saudi operatives \nhave fled to Yemen.  The Saudi authorities have sometimes accused Yemen of not doing enough to round up its \nown bastions of extremism.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed terror plot aboard the airliner discussed above, the government of Yemen indicated \nthat while it had the will to deal with al-Qaida, it was hampered by a lack of support. Nonetheless, the Yemeni \nauthorities insisted that they have been working with regional and Western powers to crush militancy within its \nborders, noting that such action was in the country's own best interests since Islamic extremists pose a grave \nnational security threat.  It should also be noted that in the latter part of 2009, faced with the threat that Yemen was \n\n\n\nbecoming a stronghold for Islamic extremists, United States intelligence was credited with helping Yemeni forces \ncarry out military offensives against major al-Qaida bases in that country, much to the consternation of al-Qaida \nitself.  But the Yemeni authorities have to contend with not only the al-Qaida threat, but also a secessionist \nmovement in the south and a Shi'a Zaidi rebellion in the north.  This complex political terrain has left large isolated \nswaths of land vulnerable for use by extremists of many stripes in Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, Evan Kohlmann, a senior investigator for the NEFA Foundation, warned that rivalry among al-Qaida's \nbranches could be a driving force behind the uptick in Yemen-based al-Qaida activities.  He said, \"There's now a \ncompetition in the world of al-Qaida between various al-Qaida factions, with each trying to prove themselves and \nprove their worth.\"  There could therefore be an attempt by Yemen-based al-Qaida to distinguish itself as an active \nbase of anti-Western and Jihadist militancy.\n\nThis threat was amplified when, a week after the aforementioned attempted terrorist attack, the Yemeni authorities \nwarned that hundreds of al-Qaida operatives were present in Yemen and could be plotting further terrorist attacks. \nThis claim appeared to coincide with warnings made by Abdulmutallab -- the man behind the attempted Christmas \nDay attack -- who said that there were other al-Qaida operatives who stood ready to strike with fresh attacks.\n\nSome of those al-Qaida operatives could well be among the hundreds already present in Yemen, as noted by the \nYemeni authorities.  But Yemen's location close to Somalia might  also be a factor. The militant extremist Islamist \ngroup, al-Shabab, which has held sway in portions of Somalia, has warned it would send its fighters to assist fellow \nIslamic militants in Yemen.  Sheikh Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansour of al-Shabab reportedly said: \"We tell our Muslim \nbrothers in Yemen that we will cross the water between us and reach your place to assist you fight the enemy of \nAllah.\"\n\nWith attention now focused on the Islamic extremist threat emanating from Yemen, British Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown called for a summit to be convened in London at the end of January 2010 simultaneously with a pre-\nscheduled conference on the future of Afghanistan. The objective of the summit on Yemen would be identify \nYemen's counter-terrorism requirements and to determine ways of dealing with the thrust towards extremism via aid \nand reform. Prime Minister Brown also urged all key international partners to be involved in this endeavor saying, \n\"The international community must not deny Yemen the support it needs to tackle extremism.\"  He also announced \nthat the United Kingdom would commit 100 million British pounds and intelligence support to Yemen -- the most \nsignificant outlay by any global power to that Middle eastern country.\n\nMeanwhile, General David Petraeus, head of United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, \nvisited the president of Yemen,  Ali Abdallah Saleh, to pledge American support in the fight against al-Qaida.  One \nday earlier, Petraeus announced that the United States would double its counter-terrorism aid to Yemen in 2010.\n\nAcross the globe, clearly there was increasing anxiety about Yemen becoming a failed state -- the very environment \nwithin which violent extremist groups often find safe haven. To that end, Mark Pritchard, a British parliamentarian \nand the vice chairman of the Parliamentary Yemen Group, said: \"If Yemen does become a failed State it will \nprovide a safe haven for terrorists with close proximity to important shipping routes and neighboring oil-producing \nSaudi Arabia. The stakes for the region and the West are very high indeed.\"\n\nFor its part, the government of Yemen appeared to give tacit sanction for greater  assistance from  the Western \npowers with the Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi saying in an interview with the BBC, \"We need more \ntraining. We have to expand our counter terrorism units and this means providing them with the necessary training, \nmilitary equipment, ways of transportation - we are very short of helicopters. The United States can do a lot, Britain \ncan do a lot, the European Union can do a lot in that regard.\"\n\nSuch help would be of paramount importance given the reports in the early days of 2010 that al-Qaida was planning \nan attack on the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. In an interview with ABC News, John Brennan, the top counter-terrorism \nadviser to United States President Obama,  said, \"We know that they [al-Qaida operatives] have been targeting our \nembassy, our embassy personnel.\" Because of this threat, Brennan announced that the United States  was \ntemporarily closing its embassy in Sanaa.  The British and French governments reportedly moved to do the same.  \n\n\n\nBrennan's claims were consistent with a call from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula encouraging Muslims to assist \nin \"killing every crusader who works at their embassies or other places.\"\n\nLatest Developments:\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2010, it was reported that Yemeni security forces killed several suspected al-Qaida militants as part of its \nongoing effort to crush al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  According to reports, the Yemeni forces ambushed a \ncadre of militants in the Arhab district --  about 40 miles north of the Yemeni capital -- effectively igniting a violent \nclash with the militants, ultimately yielding the aforementioned deaths.\n\nBut even as this offensive operation was taking place, the Yemeni president was signaling that it was interested in \nengaging with al-Qaida in an effort to end the violence in his country.  President Ali Abdullah Saleh suggested he \nwould grant leniency to members of al-Qaida who were willing to enter talks with his government and renounce \nviolence. In an interview that was broadcast on Abu Dhabi TV, he said: \"Dialogue is the best way ... even with al-\nQaida, if they set aside their weapons and return to reason.\"  The move was essentially an extension of the Yemeni \npresident's previous stance in dealing with al-Qaida.  Accordingly, it was expected to be met with grave disapproval \nfrom Western powers who have viewed it as a failed strategy, given the terrorist threat emanating from Yemen.\n\nYemen is the base of both foreign and local al-Qaida fighters.  The local fighters are often aided by relatives, \ntypically as a result of tribal loyalty more than ideology.  However, when these fighters are killed or arrested by \ngovernment forces, these heavily-armed tribes often are emotionally driven to increase support of the militants.  \nMeanwhile, Yemen has also been home to thousands of Islamic militants who are veterans of several \"holy wars\" in \nother countries and regions, including Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya.  While most of these Islamic militant \nveterans are no longer active, they nonetheless maintain their extremist views in keeping with al-Qaida ideology. As \nnoted by Ali Saif Hassan, the manager of a Yemeni group that mediates between the government and opposition: \n\"It is difficult to draw the line between who is a fundamentalist and who is al-Qaida. It's a spectrum.\" As constituents \nof the country, these elements form part of the broader anti-American and anti-Western base of the country, over \nwhich President Saleh has only fragile control.\n\nIt is this matter of fragile control that informs President Saleh's stance.  With a rebellion in the north, a secessionist \nmovement in the south, extremists in other parts of the country, and actual control over only Sanaa, Yemeni \nPresident Saleh has moved cautiously in the fight against al-Qaida.  This wary and cagey positioning has been \nlargely due to President Saleh's concern that working closely with the United States and the West on anti-terrorism \nefforts could spark a backlash.\n\nIn fact, the Yemeni leader has to walk a political tightrope of sorts.  He has had to crack down on the rebels, \nsecessionists and militants in order to maintain national security, while simultaneously demonstrating anti-terrorism \nefforts for geopolitical reasons. Yet, in so doing, President Saleh cannot afford to alienate significant elements of \nYemeni society.  To this end, he must demonstrate the precise amount of cooperation with the Western powers to \nassuage them, while currying favor with the extremist elements of his own country.  In many senses, it has been the \nsame challenge facing other leaders in the region who must contend with a volatile population base while attending \nto the geopolitical and national security threats posed by militant Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe other territorial battles in Yemen have also factored into the country's complex landscape and challenging \nsecurity situation. In January 2010, Yemeni security forces entered into the sixth month of conflict with Shi'ite rebels \nin the northern part of the country. This was part of the government's ongoing \"Operation Scorched Earth\" offensive \naimed at ending the Houthi rebellion. The situation in the north has intersected to some degree with the increasing \nglobal attention on Yemen as an emerging base of al-Qaida extremist militants.  The government of Yemen has had \nto balance fighting terrorism and rebellion with appeasing extremist elements of the society, amidst a country with \nrebels in the north and secessionists in the south.  To satisfy these contradictory objectives, the Yemeni \ngovernment has at times aligned itself with controversial Islamists.  Among them has been Sheik Abdul-Majid al-\nZindan whom the United States has classified as a terrorist due to his alleged connection to al-Qaida, and who has \ngained notoriety for his anti-Western rhetoric. But the Yemeni government has relied on its alliance with cleric like \n\n\n\nal-Zindani in the fight against the Shi'ite rebels in the north, to oppose the secessionists in the south, and to hold \nonto its tenuous grip on power.\n\nCast along the complicated landscape has been the growing international call for the government to take a harder \nstance against al-Qaida, and the reality that such a move could ignite a fierce and deleterious repercussions from \nthe Islamic fundamentalist and tribal factions of Yemeni society.  Indeed, as noted by Ali Mohammed Omar, a \nYemeni who, according to a report by the Associated Press, fought in Afghanistan in the early 1990s and met \nOsama Bin Laden: \"Any movement against al-Qaida will lead to the fall of the Yemeni regime.\"  He went on to note \nthat if the United States or its allies were to become too directly involved in Yemen, \"the whole (Yemeni) people will \nbecome al-Qaida. Instead of 30 or 40 people, it would become millions.\"\n\nClearly aware of this potentiality, while the United States and the United Kingdom have increased support for anti-\nterrorism efforts in Yemen in the form of increased funding and training for counter-terrorism forces (noted above), \nthere is no indication of an overt military presence in that country.  In fact, in an interview with People magazine, \nUnited States President Obama made clear that he had no intention of deploying American troops to Yemen (or \nSomalia), despite the nations' growing importance as emerging centers of terrorism on the global landscape.  To \nthis end, President Obama said: \"I have no intention of sending U.S. boots on the ground in these regions.\" Instead, \nhe suggested that working with international partners on the situation in Yemen would be the best course. President \nObama also emphasized that the main center of al-Qaida activity was still in the Afghan-Pak region.\n\nThe president's sentiment was reflected in statements by General David Petraeus, who has been directing the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.  In an interview with Christiane Amanpour on CNN, he said of the Yemeni government that \nit was \"quite clear that Yemen does not want to have American ground troops there. And that's a ... good response \nfor us to hear, certainly.\" He continued, \"We would always want a host nation to deal with a problem itself. We want \nto help. We're providing assistance.\" Echoing what was clearly the Obama administration's position on the matter, \nAdmiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, \n\"Right now, as far as any kind of boots on the ground there, with respect to the United States, ... that's not a \npossibility.\"\n\nRecent Foreign Policy Developments\n\nImbroglio With Israel\n\nRoadmap for peace hits roadblock with East Jerusalem settlement plan; diplomatic imbroglio ensues between Israel \nand United States as a result\n\nOn March 8, 2010,  Israeli and Palestinian negotiators  agreed to indirect peace talks. Following a meeting with \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Israeli Vice Premier Silvan Shalom confirmed  that his country  \nwanted to \"move to direct talks\" with the Palestinians.  He said,  \"Israel would like to resume the negotiations \ndirectly immediately.\"  He also called for a shortened period before both parties moved toward direct dialogue.  At \nissue has been the so-called \"roadmap for peace,\" which has been sanctioned by the Middle East  Quartet made \nup of the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia, and which calls for the establishment of two \nstates -- Israel and Palestine -- living side by side in peace and security.\n\nDays later on March 11, 2010, this \"roadmap for peace\" appeared to have hit a roadblock when the Palestinian \nAuthority made clear that indirect talks could not proceed unless Israel could commit to a total construction freeze of \nJewish settlements.  According to Ynetnews.com, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was not willing to \nnegotiate \"under the current circumstances\"  -- an apparent reference to the news that Israel had new construction \nplans for east Jerusalem.  At the heart of the matter was a plan by Israel to build 1,600 new homes in  in Ramat \nShlomo in east Jerusalem, despite repeated pressure by the United States for a halt on Jewish settlements in the \ninterests of peace.\n\n\n\nFor some time,  Jerusalem has been a flashpoint in the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.  \nJerusalem is the official  capital city of the Jewish state of Israel, and Israel has laid claim to  the eastern part of the \ncity since the 1967 war.  However, Palestinians have clamored for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future \nPalestinian state.  Palestinians have argued that settlement activity in east Jerusalem is illegal under international \nlaw.  Israel, though, has disputed this view of international jurisprudence. Of course, to date, these competing \nclaims over the contested part of the city have seen no resolution, and the status of Jerusalem has remained a \nsticking point in the peace process.\n\nKey officials  in the Obama administration in the United States  have registered disapproval of this development, \nnoting that it was an obstacle to the process of building trust, confidence, and ultimately peace between Israelis and \nPalestinians.  Indeed, the Obama administration in the United States railed against Israel in response to the \nannouncement of settlement activity in east Jerusalem.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who was ironically in Israel at the time for the purpose of advancing the peace process, \ndenounced the development.  On NBC News, David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, referred  \nto Israel's settlement announcement as both destructive to the peace effort, and  insulting to the United States, a \nlikely reference to the timing of the announcement when Vice President Biden was in Israel.  He said, \"This was an \naffront, it was an insult but most importantly it undermined this very fragile effort.\" He continued, \"We have just \nstarted proximity talks, that is shuttle diplomacy, between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and for this \nannouncement to come at that time was very destructive.\" Earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this move by Israel was \"deeply negative\" for American-Israeli relations.\n\nFor his part, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his apologies for the situation that unfolded and \nexplained that the announcement had been accidental, however,  even a promise for an inquiry into the timing of \nthe announcement did little to assuage the White House.  Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the Israeli \npremier's regrets were only \"a good start\" and pressed for more constructive dialogue with an eye on peace.  The \nsituation was not helped by news reports that Prime Minister Netanyahu's brother in law, Hagi Ben-Artzi, referred to \nPresident Obama as \"anti-Semitic.\" This declaration only exacerbated the tense climate of relations and Netanyahu \nwas compelled to make it clear that he did not share the views of Ben-Artzi.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu was trying to negotiate a difficult balancing act.  On one hand, he could not \nafford to alienate Israel's most important and most powerful ally, the United States.  This was a particularly pressing \npriority at a time when global action was needed to deal with the nuclear ambitions of Iran, whose leadership has \nbeen vitriolic in its anti-Israeli sentiment.  But on the other hand, Prime Minister Netanyahu also had to deal with \ncoalition partners at home from  nationalist and Orthodox parties that embrace expanded settlement activity.  In an \neffort to simultaneously downplay the diplomatic imbroglio unfolding with the United States, and to shore-up the \nright-wing elements of his fragile ruling coalition, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed members of a cabinet \nmeeting as follows: \"I propose not to be carried away and to calm down.\" He continued, \"We know how to handle \nthese situations, calmly, responsibly and seriously.\"\n\nBy March 16, 2010,  the situation in Jerusalem was marked by a lack of calm  as angry Palestinians in the Arab-\ndominated eastern part of the city set fire to garbage cans and tires, and also hurled stones and rocks at Israeli riot \npolice.  In response,  Israeli riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to quell the violence.  The devolving \nsecurity scene only served to underline the complicated scene unfolding in Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, United States  envoy George Mitchell, cancelled his scheduled trip to Israel as a result of the diplomatic \nimbroglio.  On the issue of that diplomatic imbroglio, Secretary of State Clinton brushed aside claims that relations \nbetween the United States and Israel were in a state of crisis. She emphasized the \"close, unshakeable bond\"  \nshared between the two countries.  But at the same time, Clinton noted that her country wanted Israel and the \nPalestinians to demonstrate their clear commitment to the peace process.  Days later, at an address before the pro-\nIsrael lobby group, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Israel \nto make \"difficult but necessary choices\" if it desired a peace agreement with the Palestinians, emphasizing the \n\"unsustainable\" nature of the status quo.  She also highlighted the \"unshakable\" bond between her country and \nIsrael.\n\n\n\nIn a move intended to emphasize Israel's commitment in this regard, Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed \"trust-\nbuilding measures\" with the Palestinians, in the context of renewed peace negotiations.  Of course, the Palestinians \nnoted it would be difficult to move forward with \"proximity talks,\" given Israel's decision to expand settlement in \nRamat Shlomo, as discussed above.  An already-scheduled trip to the United States to address AIPAC, Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  offered the opportunity for face-to-face talks with United States President \nBarack Obama, with an eye on resolving the diplomatic imbroglio.  However, Netanyahu's decision not to call for a \nhalt on the settlement plan in Jerusalem did not bode well for progress. Indeed, the closed nature of the talks \nsuggested that the dissonance would not easily be ended.\n\nAt the broader level, the Middle East Quartet of peace mediators -- the United Nations, European Union, United \nStates and Russia - - has issued its own condemnation of  Israel's construction plan in east Jerusalem.  The \nQuartet made it clear that the matter would be reviewed during its forthcoming  ministerial meeting, which took \nplace on March 19, 2010,  in Moscow.\n\nRomanian president says his country will host United States missile interceptors\n\nOn February 4, 2010, President Traian Basescu  of Romania said that his country would host missile interceptors \nas part of a new United States defense shield system.  President Basescu explained that Romania's chief military \nand security entity, the Supreme Defense Council, agreed to such the proposal by the United States.  While the \nproposal would still have to be ratified by the legislative branch of government, there was some degree of \nconfidence that it would successfully pass through that branch of government.\n\nPresident  Basescu said in an interview with Radio Free Europe, \"Terrestrial interceptors will be placed on \nRomania's territory as part of the anti-missile system. According to the calendar agreed with the American side, the \ncomponents located on Romania's territory will become operational in 2015.\"  While he noted that  the missile \ndefense system would protect Romanian territory, he emphasized that the move would not threaten Russia.\n\nIndeed, the plan for Romania to host the missile defense system was a departure from a Bush-era program to \nstation 10 long-range interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic.  These directives \nraised the ire of Russia, which threatened to relocate its own missiles closer to Europe.  But the new proposal, \nwhich would instead involve Romania, appeared to be part of the Obama administration's approach to missile \ndefense. Indeed, this new approach would focus on a combination of both fixed and movable Standard Missile 3 \ninterceptors, as well as  radars responding to  the threat posed by short- and medium-range missiles. The location \nof fixed or ground-based interceptors in Romania was thought to be related to that country's proximity to Iran. \n\nThe Iranian Nuclear Issue \n\nOn the issue of Iran, the  international community, led by the United States, was looked toward imposing a new \nround of economic sanctions on Iran for its intransigence regarding its controversial nuclear development program. \nAt the start of 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was reportedly discussing a sanctions proposal \nwith allied nations aimed at placing pressure on the Iranian regime and the Revolutionary Guard. Indeed, Secretary \nClinton emphasized the inclusion of the Revolutionary Guard in this proposal saying, \"We have already begun \ndiscussions with our partners and with like-minded nations about pressure and sanctions.  Our goal is to pressure \nthe Iranian government, particularly the Revolutionary Guard elements, without contributing to the suffering of the \nordinary people, who deserve better than what they currently are receiving.\" \n\nThis proposal by the United States was being advanced in the wake of the fact that Iran missed the Dec. 31, 2009, \ndeadline set by the United States for Iran to accept a compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside \nits terrain for processing into fuel rods with the purity of 20 percent.\n\nAccordingly, five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany met for several hours \non Jan. 16, 2010, to discuss the matter.  The meeting ended without a clear agreement but Russian Deputy Foreign \n\n\n\nMinister Sergei Ryabkov explained that  most of the discussions were focused on the \"second track\" - a reference \nto the path of sanctions.  \n\nBy February 2010, in defiance of the international community,  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on \nhis country's nuclear head, Dr. Ali Akbar Salehi, to intensify  uranium enrichment.  The move was essentially a \nfulfillment of an earlier threat by Iran to enrich uranium at a higher purity level of 20 percent. At issue has been \nIran's prevailing claim that it is entitled to carry out a civilian nuclear program, aimed at generating energy.  This \nclaim has been disputed by several countries of the West, and Iran's case has been compromised by revelations of \nclandestine nuclear development facilities.\n\nThis development came after Iran rejected a compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside its terrain \nfor processing into fuel rods and, instead, imposed an ultimatum of its own. Specifically, Iranian Foreign Minister \nManouchehr Mottaki warned that his country would enrich uranium at the higher purity level (20 percent) if the West \ndid not meet its counter-demand that nuclear fuel be sold to Iran or nuclear fuel be swapped for Iran's low-enriched \nuranium.  Of significance has been the fact that civilian nuclear power requires uranium enriched to about only three \npercent, whereas weapons grade uranium has to be enriched to 90 percent.  Intensification beyond the three \npercent range has, therefore,  signaled alarm bells across the globe.\n\nClearly, the situation marked a further deterioration of relations between Iran and the West. The United States \ncalled for united global action in the face of a possible Iranian nuclear threat.  United States Defense Secretary \nRobert Gates said that while there was time for the proposed sanctions to work, the world would have to \"stand \ntogether.\"  During a visit to Italy, Gates said, \"Pressures that are focused on the government of Iran, as opposed to \nthe people of Iran, potentially have greater opportunity to achieve the objective.\"\n\nIn May 2010, as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan traveled to Tehran for negotiations on Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program in that country, there were suggestions from Ankara that a compromise deal was at \nhand.  The Turkish leader, along with Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, were playing key roles in trying to \npersuade Iran's government to agree to a deal that would transport its nuclear material abroad for processing. \nThere were hopes that the two countries, which have enjoyed relatively friendlier diplomatic terms with Iran than the \nWestern powers and Russia, might be positioned to successfully make the case for compromise.\n\nThis plan has seen several iterations over recent times, including provisions for the transfer of stockpiles of low \nenriched uranium to Russia and France for processing. It should be noted that until this time, the proposal has \nnever garnered Iranian concurrence. In this new arrangement, the low enriched uranium would be transferred to \nTurkey.  With Iran already trying to avert the prospect of new sanctions being imposed by the United Nations, it was \npossible that there would be greater receptivity to the resurrected compromise deal, albeit with a more neutral \ncountry as the partner state.  There were hoped that such a proposition would  allay the West's fears that Iran's \nnuclear ambitions include nuclear weapons proliferation.  These anxieties  have only been strengthened by \nrevelations about secret nuclear facilities in Iran, and non-compliance with monitoring regulations set forth by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.  \n\nHowever, the United States dismissed the deal brokered by Turkey, and drafted its own proposal to levy new \nsactions against Iran. That United States-drafted proposal was tabled at the United Nations Security Council, \nprompting Turkey to call for a delay in the interests of further negotiations.\n\nSuch a delay was unlikely, as United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the strong draft proposal \nagainst Iran was already backed  by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. For his \npart, United States President Barack Obama made it clear that his country intended to pursue the new sanctions \nagainst Iran, irrespective of the new nuclear deal with Turkey and Brazil.  President Obama reportedly informed \nTurkish Prime Minister during a phone call that the new agreement  failed to build \"necessary confidence\" that Iran \nwould abide by its international obligations.  Further, the United States leader acknowledged Turkey's and Brazil;s \n\n\n\nefforts, but noted that the new deal left open a host of \"fundamental concerns\" about Iran's atomic ambitions and \nbroader nuclear program.\n\n.\n\nFrom Tehran,  the head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed the prospect of looming \nsanctions and predicted that such a move by the international community would ultimately backfire.  Salehi said, \n\"They won't prevail and by pursuing the passing of a new resolution they are discrediting themselves in public \nopinion.\"  Nevertheless, the draft resolution on sanctions against Iran was reported to be already circulating in the \nchambers of the United Nations Security Council. \n\nNevertheless, by June 2010, the United Nations had passed sweeping sanctions against Iran, which reflected the \nUnited States' draft proposal and the expressed objective to  specifically target the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, \nwhich has emerged as a power center within that country.\n\nSoon thereafter,  the United States and announced its own unilateral sanctions to be imposed on Iran.  The new \nsanctions by the Treasury Department targeted Iran's nuclear and missile programs, by concentrating on the \nfinancial sector, the shipping industry and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. \n\nOther Key Foreign Policy Developments \n\nOn March 2, 2010, the United States agreed to move forward with the sale of missiles, helicopters and ships to \nTaiwan, effectively sparking the anger of the Chinese government in Beijing.  Despite a thawing of relations \ngenerally between Washington D.C. and Beijing, this move was expected to raise bilateral tensions, which had \nbeen strained over a number of issues ranging from Internet censorship to climate change. The United States' \nmoved to dispatch envoys to Beijing to calm the situation.  But on the other side of the equation,  the Chinese \ngovernment  made it clear that arms sales to Taiwan would deleteriously affect Sino-American relations.\n\nFor its part, however, the United States has been compelled to ensure Taiwan's ability to defend itself under the \nTaiwan Relations Act.  In an effort to act in accordance with this accord, while also recognizing China's sensitive \nrelationship with Taiwan, United States President Barack Obama attempted the geopolitical balancing act by \nreaffirming his country's  acknowledgment of \"only one China.\" \n\nAlso in March 2010, the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Congress approved a resolution, \nwhich characterized the World War I killing of Armenians by Turks as a genocide.  At issue for many Armenians has \nbeen the sense of betrayal over the deaths of 1.5 Armenians between 1915 and 1923 at the hand of the Ottoman \nEmpire.  Armenia has steadfastly called for international recognition of what they term as the Armenian genocide, \nbut Turkey has vociferously denied this bloody legacy. The Armenian call for recognition came to fruition in the \nUnited States, largely as a result of the determination of the Armenian diaspora, particularly in California.  But with it \nhas come the outrage of the Turkish government.  With an eye on preserving its crucial NATO alliance with Turkey, \nthe Obama administration said it intended to  block the bill from passage into law.  This scenario repeated a similar \nsituation two years prior when the same committee approved a similar resolution, but which did not go forward due \nto concerns of the previous Bush administration for precisely the same reason.  President Barack Obama, however, \nhad said he intended to characterize the mass deaths of Armenian Christians as a genocide during his 2008 \ncampaign for the presidency.  As such, this new position by his administration was regarded as something of a \npolicy reversal. Secretary of States Hillary Clinton explained the shift noting that circumstances had \"changed in \nvery significant ways.\"  Specifically, she pointed toward the 2009 accord, which normalized bilateral relations \nbetween Armenia and Turkey.\n\n\n\nMarch 2010 was also marked by violence across the border. A couple from the United States and one Mexican \nnational were killed in two separate incidents in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, just across the border from El Paso in \nTexas.  All of the three victims were affiliated with the United States Consulate in Ciudad JUarez. United States \nPresident Barack Obama expressed \"outrage\" and \"deep sadness\"  at the killings.  A statement releeased ed by the \nWhite House read as follows: \"The president is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of \nthree people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, including a U.S. \ncitizen employee, her U.S. citizen husband and the husband of a Mexican citizen employee. He extends his \ncondolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our \nforeign missions. In concert with Mexican authorities, we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice.\" \n\nOn March 28, 2010, United States President Obama made a surprise trip to Afghanistan to show resolve for the \npeace and security effort in that country.  It was his first trip to Afghanistan since becoming president and lasted \nonly a few hours; it was not pre-announced for ostensible security reasons.  Addressing United States troops at the \nBagram air base close to Kabul, the president thanked them for their service and sacrifice to the United States \nsaying, \"My main job here today is to say thank you on behalf of the entire American people.\"  To that end, \nPresident Obama  emphasized that the central mission  of the United States forces in Afghanistan against al-Qaida \nand the Taliban, noting that it was ultimately aimed at \"keeping America safe and secure.\"  President Obama also \nmet with  Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whom he invited to the United States for talks in May 2010.  President \nObama indicated that he wanted to press for progress on not only the peace and security front, but also in terms of \ncorruption and narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan.  \n\nIn a strange twist, following this visit from  President Obama, Afghan President Karzai accused the West of election \nfraud plot and threatened to join Taliban.  Karzai's rhetoric would likely feed sentiment that the Afghan leader was \nan unpredictable and erratic player on the geopolitical scene. It would certainly do little to help the increasing \nperception by the West that he was not acting in good faith and could not be counted on as a stable partner for the \npeace effort in Afghanistan.  On June 28, 2010, ten individuals using aliases were arrested in the United States for \nallegedly spying for the Russian government. According to the Justice Department of the United States, the ten \nindividuals were charged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government. Eight of the ten \nsuspects were reported to have had \"long-term, deep-cover assignments\" in the United States. As well, nine of the \nten suspects were charged with conspiracy to launder money. Five of the suspects appeared in a New York federal \ncourt where they were ordered to remain in jail pending hearings set for the end of July 2010. Other suspects soon \nfaced court in Virginia. The arrests came after an investigation that went on for several years and, if convicted, the \nsuspects could face five years in prison.\n\nAuthorities said they were in pursuit of an eleventh suspect.  That eleventh suspect was soon arrested in Cyprus \nand released on bail; he was subsequently reported to be missing after failing to present for a scheduled \"check in\" \nmeeting with the Cypriot police.  An arrest warrant was issued for that individual as a result but reports soon \nemerged that he may have fled that country. The Cypriot authorities were now under fire for mishandling the \nsituation; members of the opposition party in that Mediterranean country railed against the fact that an alleged spy \nwas allowed bail rather than being subject to a detention order.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Eastern Europe, made clear that the U.S. \nwas committed to positive ties with Russia, the emerging spy scandal notwithstanding.  Secretary Clinton said, \n\"We're committed to building a new and positive relation with Russia.\" She continued, \"We're looking toward the \nfuture.\"  For its part, Russia has also indicated that the scenario would not affect closer bilateral relations with the \nUnited States.\n\nBy the first week of July 2010, plans were in the works for a Cold War era \"spy swap\" in which ten Russian agents \nwould be deported  in exchange for the return of United States agents being held in Russia.  Those agents sought \nby the United States included a Russian nuclear scientist, a former Russian military intelligence agent and a former \nKBG agent who were jailed for spying on behalf of the United States.  There was also a former military intelligence \nagent jailed for spying for the United Kingdom. \n\n\n\nThe exchange ensued in Austria with the ten Russian agents boarding a flight to Moscow, and the four agents \nreleased by the Kremlin  boarding an American aircraft close to the main passenger terminals at the airport in \nVienna. The entire exchange took a total of 90 minutes.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the two countries involved cast the spy swap in positive terms.  Russia said that the ten \npersons in United States custody facing charges there had been freed \"for humanitarian considerations.\"  Russia \nalso lauded the move as being illustrative of \"the general improvement of Russia-United States relations.\"  \nMeanwhile, the United States was dismissing claims that only four agents were released in exchange for the ten \nRussians.  United States authorities made clear that then four in question were \"high value\" and garnered far more \nusable information in comparison to the ten Russians.  Moreover, the White House in the United States was playing \nup the fact that knowledge of the spy ring and plans for the spy swap had been in the works for several months \nbefore the Russians were ever arrested.  \n\nIn the third week of July 2010, the United States (U.S.) announced that it was imposing new sanctions against \nNorth Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the \nDemilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that \nthe sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear \nproliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea accused North Korea of provocative action over the sinking of its Cheonan warship months earlier, \nwhich an international investigation ultimately blamed on North Korea despite Pyongyang's denial of culpability. As \none the most sanctioned countries in the world, these new sanctions were likely intended to intensify the pressure \non North Korea in response to the Cheonan incident. In fact, as indicated by Secretary of State Clinton, they were \naimed at compelling Pyongyang to take responsibility for the sinking of the warship that left 47 dead. For its part, \nNorth Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.\n\nTensions on the peninsula were unlikely to decrease since the U.S. and South Korea conducted joint naval \nexercises, which North Korea characterized as \"dangerous sabre-rattling.\" But defense officials of United States \nand South Korea said that the military drills were intended to deliver a clear message to North Korea that its \n\"aggressive\" behavior should cease. Indeed, the North Korean official news agency reported the following \nstatement from the government in Pyongyang: \"The army and people of the DPRK will legitimately counter with \ntheir powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South \nKorean puppet forces.\"\n\nIn November 2010, a nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that \nduring a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the \nYongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed \"more than 1,000 centrifuges\" for \nenriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.\n\nSince  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North \nKorea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a \nhigh level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an \"ultra-modern control room.\"  \nAccording to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was \nno sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an \ninterview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be \"readily converted to produce highly enriched \nuranium bomb fuel.\"\n\nDr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  \nreactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the \nconstruction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, \nhowever, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could \npotentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.\n\n\n\nTo date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although \nthere has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being \nsaid, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear \nprogram.  Those talk stalled as relations between North Korea devolved due to the sinking of a South Korean \nwarship earlier in the year. \n\nIn November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip \naimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations.  However, those efforts were placed on hold due to the Nov. 2010 \nshelling of Yeonpyeong Island  (in South Korea's jurisdiction) by North Korea. By the close of the month, tensions \non the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in \nthe Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged \nmilitary exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A \nstatement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: \"We will deliver a \nbrutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.\"  But in  December 2010, South \nKorea was taking  a highly assertive position, warning that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air \nstrikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. \n\nWith fears of renewed war on the Korean peninsula at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when \nin mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations \nbeyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a \nmedia report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, \nhowever, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, \"It is a report \nbased on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time.\" Should \nthis claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear \nbombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on \na downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above). \n\nSpecial Report: U.S. Policy on Afghanistan\n\nThis Special Report commences with a briefing on the new command structure for Afghanistan, following the exit of \nGeneral Stanley McChrystal and the naming of his replacement, General David Petraeus. It includes an inquiry into \ncounterinsurgency strategy for fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida, and its use of \"human terrain teams.\"  The report \nadditionally considers accusations of the Pakistani intelligence agency's complicity with the Afghan Taliban. Also \nconsidered in this report are the politically-driven financial constraints at home in the United States related to the \nfunding of the war effort. These issues collectively have influenced emerging questions about the United States' \npolicy in Afghanistan and the  timeline for continued engagement there.\n\nNew commander for Afghanistan: Petraeus in;  McChrystal out --\n\nOn June 23, 2010, United States President Barack Obama announced that General Stanley McChrystal, the \ncommander of United States forces in Afghanistan, was relieved of his duties. The president also announced the \nnomination of General David Petraeus, commander of United States Central Command, to take over command of \nthe war in Afghanistan against the resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida. President Obama explained that he had decided \nto replace Gen McChrystal \"with considerable regret.\" The president explained that McChrystal failed to \"meet the \nstandard that should be set by a commanding general.\" President Obama additionally called on the Senate to \nquickly confirm Petraeus to his new position in Afghanistan.\n\nThe announcement came following a meeting between the president and his Afghanistan war advisers, and after \nMcChrystal was summoned from Afghanistan to Washington D.C. McChrystal first met with Defense Secretary \nRobert Gates and then with President Obama at the White House. There was some suggestion that McChrystal \nwould participate in the monthly strategy meetings of President Obama's Afghan war advisers, however, media \nreports indicated that he left the White House right after the meeting with the president. McChrystal apologized for \ncontroversial statements in a recent Rolling Stone article saying, \"It was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and \n\n\n\nshould never have happened.\" McChrystal also asserted in an official statement that he held a \"desire to see the \nmission succeed.\"\n\nPresident Obama said that the difficult decision to relieve McChrystal of his command duties was driven by the \ncontroversial remarks published in a Rolling Stone article written by journalist Michael Hastings. The remarks were \nattributed to McChrystal and his aides. In the article titled \"Runaway General,\" McChrystal and his aides were \nreported as having made disparaging comments about the civilian control of the United States military and the war \neffort. Of note were mocking statements made about senior members of the Obama administration, including Vice \nPresident Joe Biden and National Security Adviser Jim Jones. McChrystal also said he felt betrayed by U.S. \nambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry. McChrystal additionally complained about having to reply to electronic \ncommunication from United States special representative for the Afghan-Pak region, Richard Holbrooke. \nFurthermore, the article referenced pejorative statements made by McChrystal and his aides about foreign allies \nfighting the war in Afghanistan alongside the United States forces under NATO command. Notably, McChrystal \ndecried a dinner meeting with the French allies.\n\nPresident Obama cast aside the notion that he was making the decision to dismiss McChrystal for personal reasons \nsaying, \"I don't make this decision based on any difference in policy with General McChrystal... nor do I make this \ndecision out of any sense of personal insult.\" Instead, the president and commander-in-chief said McChrystal's \nconduct did not meet the standards of a commanding general. President Obama also foreclosed criticism from \npotential opponents of this decision by saying, \"War is bigger than any one man or woman, whether a private, a \ngeneral, or a president.\"\n\nThe politics of the situation demanded that President Obama dismiss McChrystal, or, risk being viewed as a weak \ncommander in chief. While some McChrystal stalwarts argued that he has simply indulged in inappropriate \ndiscourse and should be allowed to finish the mission, other analysts noted that McChrystal was barely short of \nviolating the United States Military Code of Justice Article 88, which calls for consequences for military personnel on \nduty maligning the president and vice president. As such, President Obama warned that some of the sentiments \nexpressed by McChrystal and his aides via the Rolling Stone article\" undermines the civilian control of the military \nthat's at the core of our democratic system.\" In this way, President Obama reminded the country of the requirement \nthat the military ranks remain neutral in a democracy.\n\nA week after the announcement about the dismissal of McChrystal, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed  as the \nnew commander of the Afghanistan war with a vote of  99-0. Petraeus, as expected,  garnered  praise from both \nRepublicans and Democrats, irrespective of their core disagreements on the policy toward Afghanistan.\n\nDuring confirmation hearings, Petraeus painted a grim picture of the war effort in Afghanistan, noting that an \n\"industrial-strength insurgency\" by the Taliban and al-Qaida elements were in the offing.  As well, Petraeus warned \nthat the fighting and violence would \"get more intense in the next few months.\"  That being said, he indicated that it \nwas part of the counterinsurgency process. He said, \"My sense is that the tough fighting will continue; indeed, it \nmay get more intense in the next few months. As we take away the enemy's safe havens and reduce the enemy's \nfreedom of action, the insurgents will fight back.\"\n\nAdditionally, Petraeus did not foreclose the possibility of recommending that President Barack Obama extend \nUnited States' troops engagement in Afghanistan beyond the August 2011 timeline for redeployment .\n\nPresident Obama's decision to name Petraeus as Chrystal's replacement was hailed positively by politicians on \nboth sides of the proverbial aisle in the United States, as well as the Karzai government in Afghanistan, which was \nanxious about effects on the war effort. The selection of Petraeus -- a celebrated military figure, thanks to his \nstewardship of the \"surge\" in Iraq, as well as his  notoriety as one of the key authors of United States modern \ncounterinsurgency strategy in war zones -- clearly banished such anxieties. The president's assertion that there \nwas \"a change in personnel but not a change in policy\" further augmented the widespread support for his decision. \nIndeed, the White House sought to show that the controversy ensconced within the Rolling Stone article, titled \n\"Runaway General,\" did not overtly extend to dissonance over the policy itself. Certainly, McChrystal expressed \nsupport for President Obama's strategy in Afghanistan saying, \"I strongly support the president's strategy in \nAfghanistan and am deeply committed to our coalition forces, our partner nations, and the Afghan people.\" As well, \n\n\n\nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen affirmed that the Western military alliance's Afghan war \nstrategy remained unchanged.  Nevertherless, with the refocused attention on the war in Afghanistan came the \nrefocused attention on the policy itself.\n\nCosts and complications of counterinsurgency strategy and human terrain units --\n\nIt should be noted that the Afghan war strategy -- to fight resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida, improve security in \nAfghanistan, and develop governing stability in that country as an alternative to a culture of warfare -- is founded on \nthe principles of counterinsurgency (COIN). The long-term objectives of COIN entail not only the clearing the field of \ninsurgents by the military, but also political imperative of replacing the insurgent power base with more stable \ngovernance. Effective counterinsurgency strategies, therefore, require close collaboration of the military, political, \neconomic and diplomatic spheres in the conflict zone. Clearly, puerile and openly-disdainful remarks about senior \nmembers of the Obama administration -- as uttered by McChrystal and his aides -- would not help the climate of \neffective cooperation, where support from the varying spheres would be critical to success of the mission.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, President Obama emphasized the need for unity in the effort to secure and stabilize \nAfghanistan saying, \"I won't tolerate division.\"  Also not surprisingly, strong support for the selection of  Petraeus as \nMcChrystal's successor in Afghanistan, as discussed above, was regarded as a boon for the counterinsurgency \nstrategy.  But also as indicated above,  the renewed focus on the war in Afghanistan brought with it fresh scrutiny \nof  the policy itself.\n\nOne particularly key reason for a sense of skepticism about the war strategy and its associated timeline were  \nmatters of financial costs of the war, and the  timeline attached to the Afghanistan strategy. That is to say, when \nPresident Obama first outlined his plan to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, he also noted that the \nUnited States would begin a redeployment of those troops by 2011. With debt worries prevalent in the United States \nand other NATO countries (as discussed below), questions arose as to whether or not the continued war effort in \nAfghanistan was a financially feasible endeavor. That is to say, the war and counterinsurgency mission requires a \nsubstantial outlay of resources that few governments (including the United States) could realistically commit to for \nthe long term.\n\nComplicating matters further has been the rising death toll of NATO forces in a war that has continued for close to a \ndecade. That increased death toll has contributed to decreasing support for the Afghanistan war effort.\n\nMoreover, analysts have pointed to the fact that COIN involves the idea of clearing the landscape of insurgents, \nfollowed by the establishment of a government as an alternative to the war culture. But clearance in one area often \nresults in the relocation of the terrorists elsewhere and a perpetual pursuit of the strategic enemy. Meanwhile, the \nestablishment of more stable governance, which has seen some success in the more politically mature Iraq, cannot \neasily be transposed to the largely tribal cultural orientation of Afghanistan, which does not have a strong legacy of \ngovernmental authority.\n\nWith an eye on understanding that tribal cultural orientation of Afghanistan, the United States military has employed \nanthropologists in the war zone to garner a more granular understanding of the complicated social and cultural \ndynamics of Afghanistan. Anthropologists' command of ethnographic fieldwork may be uniquely positioned  to map \nthe complex social structure of the company, ultimately helping the military to draw Afghans away from the Taliban.\n\nKnown as the army-funded \"Human Terrain System,\" as discussed in an article published in Time Magazine by \nJason Motlagh, the idea has been the source of debate with no consensus on its success.  Academia has frowned \non anthropologists being actively involved in the war theater.  As noted in a report by the American Anthropological \nAssociation, because human terrain teams are ultimately oriented toward the objectives of the military mission, \nthere is an ethical question of whether such work is \"a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.\" \nNevertheless, General Petraeus has been reported to be a strong supporter of the human terrain teams, suggesting \nthat they would for the immediate future continue to be part of the broader counterinsurgency strategy.\n\n\n\nThat being said, most anthropologists would agree that more than a year of intensive fieldwork is needed before \nconclusions can be made; thus, the success of human terrain units in Afghanistan would require a longer timeline \nthan currently expected for United States forces to remain \"in country.\"\n\nFinancial Cost of the War in Afghanistan --\n\nIn late June 2010, legislators in the United States voted to cut almost $4 billion in aid to the government of \nAfghanistan.  The move was in response to  allegations of corruption  by the Afghan government, and in the \naftermath of a report by the Wall Street Journal that significant funds had been flown out of the airport at Kabul. The \nreport alleged that Afghan officials and their allies were diverting  funds earmarked for aid and logistics to financial \nsafe havens outside the country.\n\nExplaining the Congress' decision to make these cuts, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the chair of the subcommittee \nresponsible for aid appropriations, said, \"I do not intend to appropriate one more dime  until I have confidence that \nUS taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords and \nterrorists.\"  Lowey additionally called for an audit of the billions of dollars already expended in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the funding cuts would not directly affect military operations of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, it could very \nwell affect  infrastructure projects, which are part of the nation building efforts in Afghanistan.  To this end, \nCongressman Mark Kirk, made note of  Kandahar's electrical system; he said  that obstacles to its construction, and \nother such infrastructure projects,  could negatively affect the war, which included the effort to win the hearts and \nminds of the Afghan people.\n\nThe issue has evoked questions about the financial costs of the war at large  at a time when  debt worries plague \nnot only in the United States, but also allied countries with troops operating in Afghanistan, as discussed in the \nsection above.\n\nAs NATO countries, including the United States, have been forced to consider austerity measures at home, the \nfinancial costs of the war in Afghanistan have taken on added importance.  In fact, that significance was apparent \non July 1, 2010, when President Barack Obama requested  $33 billion in military funding to support the surge of \n30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan's complicity with Afghan Taliban raises questions about U.S. strategy in region --\n\nSince June 2010, Afghanistan's  geopolitical relationship with Pakistan has taken center stage.  At issue were \nrevelations that the Pakistani intelligence service, known by the acronym ISI, has been funding, training, and \nproviding sanctuary to the Afghan Taliban.  For several years, there have been suspicions about such a clandestine \nrelationship between the two entities, however, the closeness and extensive nature of their ties was something of a \nrevelation.  Indeed, in a report issued by the London School of Economics support for the Afghan Taliban was \ndescribed as \"official ISI policy.\"\n\nAs noted by the author of the report, Matt Waldman of Harvard University,  \"This goes far beyond just limited, or \noccasional support. This is very significant levels of support being provided by the ISI.\" Waldman also asserted, \n\"We're also saying this is official policy of that agency, and we're saying that it is very extensive. It is both at an \noperational level, and at a strategic level, right at the senior leadership of the Taliban movement.\"\n\nThe report also included references to interviews with Taliban field commanders who said that ISI agents attended \nTaliban council meetings.  Shoring up the veracity of this claim was the following citation from the report: \"These \naccounts were corroborated by former Taliban ministers, a Western analyst, and a senior United Nations official \nbased in Kabul, who said the Taliban largely depend on funding from the ISI and groups in Gulf countries.\"  \nCorroborating evidence was also available from a source unrelated to the LSE report.  In an interview with Reuters, \nthe head of Afghan intelligence, Amrullah Saleh, who had just resigned from that position, said the ISI was \"part of \nthe landscape of destruction\" in Afghanistan and accused Pakistan of sheltering Taliban leaders in safe houses.\n\n\n\nSome observers have noted that with the impending exit of foreign troops from Afghanistan expected in 2011, \nPakistan's actions may be related to its desire to more deeply influence Afghanistan.  However, ISI activities related \nto Islamic militant extremists are not recent developments in response to the current landscape.  Indeed, the ISI has \nbeen accused of funding and training Islamic militant extremists in Afghanistan from as far back as the 1979 Soviet \ninvasion.  That being said, since the 2001 terror attacks in the United States, Pakistan has accepted billions of \ndollars in aid funding from the United States, supposedly for its support in the fight against terror enclaves like al-\nQaida and its Taliban allies.  Clearly, a continued relationship between the Pakistani ISI and the Afghan Taliban \nwould run counter to its expressed objectives of helping the United States quell the threat of terrorism emanating \nfrom such entities in the Afghan-Pak region.  As stated in the LSE report, \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-\ngame of astonishing magnitude.\"\n\nUpdate on the war in Afghanistan --\n\nIn July 2010, the Iceland-based website, known as Wikileaks, released six years worth of classified United States \ndocuments, numbering around 90,000, dealing with the war in Afghanistan. Several news organizations were given \naccess to the documents prior to actual publication, although United States authorities have argued that the \ndissemination of classified information was a threat to national security, an act of gross irresponsibility, and quite \npossibly, imbued with illegality. From Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai charged that the release of Wikileaks \ndocuments have endangered the lives of Afghan citizens who worked with NATO-led international forces. The \nAfghan leader said that the disclosure of the names of Afghans who cooperated with the NATO-led forces was \n\"shocking\" and \"irresponsible.\" For its part, Wikileaks has defended the release of the documents, noting that it \npresented an unvarnished view of the war in Afghanistan since 2004.\n\nRegardless of these competing views, the contents of the controversial documents have spurred debate about the \nUnited States' role in the war in Afghanistan, as well as the conduct of the war itself. To these ends, two Wikileaks \nrevelations could raise questions about the Obama administration's broader \"Afghan-Pak\" strategy, which considers \nnot only \"ground zero\" of the war effort -- Afghanistan -- but also Pakistan next door. While the strategy \nappropriately focuses on the region instead of one country, taking into consideration shared extremist Islamic \ninfluences, shared Pashtun culture, and a landscape on the borderland that is a stronghold for Taliban and al-\nQaida, two Wikileaks revelations strong doubts on the effectiveness of the strategy.\n\nFirstly, according to the document review by the New York Times, even as Pakistan receives funds from the United \nStates to help combat Islamic extremists militants and the threat of terrorism, the Pakistani Inter-Services \nIntelligence (ISI) was said to be helping the Taliban, even collaborating with them on terror attacks and \nassassination plots.\n\nSecondly, the tactic of using drone attacks in the tribal border regions has been lauded by the Obama \nadministration as a means of crushing the enemy and eliminating high value Taliban and al-Qaida targets. \nHowever, according the review by Der Spiegel, 38 Predator and Reaper drones crashed while on combat missions \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, requiring \"elaborate -- and dangerous -- salvage operations.\" On the ground, \"in country,\" \nthere are additional worries about the political costs of the civilian casualties caused by drone attacks.\n\nThe civilian costs provide a transition to discuss a third issue revealed by Wikileaks. According to the review by \nMarc Ambinder of The Atlantic, there were \"at least 144 separate incidents\" of civilian casualties that led to \"cover-\nups.\" Ambinder particularly took note of the unsuccessful attempt to kill Abu Layth Ali Libi, which resulted in the \ndeaths of several civilians and that resulted in a \"cover-up\" by Afghan officials.\n\nFinally, another key -- and bizarre -- revelation was that Osama Bin Laden -- the lynch pin of the extremist Islamic \nterror network, al-Qaida, has taken up the practice of gifting insurgents with wives. According to the associated \nreport by The Guardian, an insurgent known to be an expert in radio-controlled improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \nwas presented with an Arab wife by Bin Laden as an expression of thanks for his efforts in plotting terror attacks.\n\n\n\nConclusion --\n\nTaken together, these issues both inform and fuel emerging questions about a timeline for continued engagement \nin Afghanistan. Indeed, these factors  -- from financial costs to the strategic considerations -- have contributed to \nrising emphasis on a \"date certain\" exit from Afghanistan in 2011. Of course, on the other side of the equation, \ncounterinsurgency advocates have argued that the objectives of the mission could require an extended timeline \nbeyond 2011. With no consensus on the matter, the McChrystal fracas has revealed deeper questions about the \nstrategy and mission in Afghanistan. Despite the aforementioned assertions from the Obama administration and \nmilitary ranks that there would be no change in policy on Afghanistan, there were now emerging questions about \nthe precise nature of that policy itself, which have only been intensified with the Wikileaks revelations.  Indeed, can \ncounterinsurgency succeed in Afghanistan?  if so, what are the benchmarks for success?  Can the United States \nand its allies afford to fund the mission, given the demands on the domestic front?  And is Pakistan -- an apparent \nally -- actually undermining the effort to succeed in Afghanistan?\n\nNote that in late 2010,  NATO announced its plans to exit Afghanistan and transfer control over the anti-Taliban \nstruggle to Afghan forces by the close of 2014.  Afghan  President Karzai formalized the agreement  by signing a \nlong-term security partnership with NATO.  At the heart of the matter was NATO's contention that the Taliban not be \nallowed to simply wait out the presence of foreign forces.  As stated by NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh \nRasmussen, the security bloc would remain committed to security  and stability of Afghanistan. He said, \"One thing \nmust be very clear - NATO is in this for the long term.\" The NATO head then continued, \"If the enemies of \nAfghanistan have the idea that they can wait it out until we leave, they have the wrong idea. We will stay as long as \nit takes to finish our job.\"  For his part, Afghan President Karzai expressed gratitude for NATO's contributions to his \ncountry's interest but stated, \"I also informed them of the concerns of the Afghan people with regard to civilian \ncasualties, with regard to detentions, with regard to, at times, NATO's posture.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this decision by NATO did not necessarily coincide with an official decision by the United \nStates on the duration of combat operations by its forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOn that latter consideration, there was some indication of the direction of the United States in December 2010 when \na much-anticipated report dealing with United States President Barack Obama's strategy for the war in Afghanistan \nsurfaced in the public purview. That report concluded that United States forces were on track to begin their \nwithdrawal from Afghanistan in July 2011, as scheduled in the United States' president's war plan. This conclusion \nwas reached despite the fact there were mixed reports of success in the field. On that matter, the summary of the \nreport said that the United States forces continued to pursue and eliminate al-Qaida leadership figures, was \nsuccessful in reducing the terror enclave's ability to carry out attacks from the Afghan-Pak region, and had halted \nthe progress of the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the summary noted that those gains were \ntenuous and could well be reversed in the future.\n\nSpecial Report: U.S. ends combat operations in Iraq after seven and a half years\n\nIn the early hours of Aug. 19, 2010 (Iraq time) the last major combat brigade of United States forces left Iraq and \ncrossed the border into Kuwait. They were protected from above by Apache helicopters and F-16 fighters, and on \nthe ground by both American military and the very Iraqi armed forces that they helped to train. The exit of the United \nStates forces ensued in a phased basis over the course of several days. The final convoy of the United States \nArmy's 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, was carrying 14,000 United States combat forces in Iraq, according to \nRichard Engel of NBC/MSNBC News, who was embedded with the brigade. A small number of United States \ncombat troops were yet to depart Iraq, and approximately 50,000 troops would remain in Iraq until the end of 2011 \nin a support role to train Iraqi forces.  Indeed, by Aug. 24, 2010, less than 50,000 United States troops were \nreported to be \"in country\" -- the very lowest level since the start of the war in 2003.\n\nWhile violence continued in Iraq -- even in the days after the last American combat brigade left Iraq -- it was \napparent that the Obama administration in the United States would not be deterred from the schedule for \n\n\n\nwithdrawal,  these fragile and chaotic conditions on the ground in Iraq notwithstanding.  This decision has been a \nsource of consternation among some quarters.  In fact, a top military official in Iraq has questioned the withdrawal of \nUnited States forces from Iraq, warning that local security forces were not able to handle the security challenges on \ntheir own for at least a decade. Echoing a similar tone, military officials from the United States said in an interview \nwith the Los Angeles Times that it was highly unlikely that Iraqi security forces were capable of maintaining Iraq's \nfragile stability after the exit of United States troops from Iraq in 2010. Nevertheless, the citizenry in the United \nStates was war-weary and concerned over the costs of war at a time of economic hardship, while President Barack \nObama was intent on making good on his promises made while as a candidate and later, as president, to end the \nwar.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq -- the defining policy decision of former President W. Bush in 2003 -- resulted in the ousting of \nformer Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, from office. The invasion of Iraq was criticized as a violation of international \nlaw by many, and condemned as ill-conceived foreign policy by others who argued that Iraq had nothing to do with \nthe terror attacks of 2001, and that Iraq was not home to weapons of mass destruction -- the two expressed \nreasons for going to war in Iraq, according to the Bush administration. Analysts further warned that the unintended \ndeleterious consequence of the war and the ousting of Saddam Hussein would be ethno-sectarian strife and a \nstrengthened Iran. Of course, on the other side of the equation, the Bush administration insisted on the necessity of \nthe war in the interests of national security. These competing viewpoints notwithstanding, the war in Iraq ultimately \nleft more than 4,400 American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead.\n\nThe withdrawal of the last major combat brigade was regarded with great symbolism as an end to the combat \nmission of the war in Iraq that has gone on for seven and a half years. It also made clear that President Obama was \nfulfilling his central campaign promise to end the war in Iraq -- a vow that was reiterated in 2009 when President \nObama set the deadline for the end of the combat mission in Iraq as Aug. 31, 2010.  To this end, President Obama \nwas fulfilling this promise even though Iraq was yet to form a new government several months after its \nparliamentary elections. It should be noted that the withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq was set forth in the \nStatus of Forces agreement signed two years ago. It should also be noted that the Obama administration has \nemphasized the fact that there will be no permanent military bases in Iraq -- even after the withdrawal of all \nremaining troops from Iraq in 2011. As well, as stated in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 passed by \nCongress and signed by President Obama on Oct. 28, 2009: \"No funds appropriated pursuant to an authorization of \nappropriations in this Act may be obligated or expended ... to establish any military installation or base for the \npurpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq.\" That being said, Iraq is \nhome to one of the United States' most significant embassies.\n\nPresident Obama addressed the nation on August 31, 2010 regarding the end of the active phase of United States \noperations in Iraq.  That was the official deadline set by President  Obama for the exit of combat forces from Iraq \nand the end to the war.\n\nIn this address to the nation from the Oval Office, President Obama asserted: \"Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and \nthe Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.\"  President Obama paid tribute to the \nmilitary who carried out their mission, saying that he was \"awed\" by the sacrifices made by the men and women in \nuniform in service of the United States.  President Obama additionally noted that the United States itself paid a high \nprice  for the Iraq War saying, \"The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its \npeople.\"  The president noted that he disagreed with his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, on the \nvery premise of the war, but urged the nation to \"turn the page\" on that chapter of recent history. To these ends, he \nsaid: \"We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources \nabroad at a time of tight budgets at home... Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the US and Iraq, we \nhave met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page.\"\n\nFor his part, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki noted that his country was \"independent\" and said that Iraqi security \nforces would now confront  all the security threats facing the nation.  Maliki said in his own address to the nation, \n\"Iraq today is sovereign and independent. Our security forces will take the lead in ensuring security and \nsafeguarding the country and removing all threats that the country has to weather, internally or externally.\"  He also \n\n\n\nsought to reassure Iraqis that the security forces were \"capable and qualified to shoulder the responsibility\" of \nkeeping Iraq safe and secure.\n\nSpecial Report: Restarting the Middle East Peace Process --\n\nIn the third week of August 2010, Israeli and Palestinian officials were set to resume direct negotiations for the first \ntime in 20 months and a decade after the last serious final status talks. United States Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \nhad been invited to Washington on Sept. 2, 2010, for the commencement of the talks.  Both parties agreed to a \none-year timeline on the direct negotiations. Speaking from the State Department, Secretary of State Clinton said \nthat the two leaders had been invited by President Barack Obama to come to the United States to \"re-launch direct \nnegotiations to resolve all final status issues, which we believe can be completed within one year.\"\n\nCertain core issues -- known as \"final status issues -- have continuously caused consternation by both sides, but \nwould be taken up during the forthcoming meetings. These core issues included the status of Jerusalem, the \nconstruction of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories, the borders of a future Palestinian state, as well as the \nright of return. Analysts have warned that the prospects of an actual deal arising from the talks were unlikely, given \nthe intensity of these contentious differences. Nonetheless, the movement back to the negotiating table was being \nviewed as productive.\n\nWith an eye on keeping the process moving in a productive direction, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"It is \nimportant that actions by all sides help to advance our effort, not hinder it.\" She continued, \"There have been \ndifficulties in the past, there will be difficulties ahead. Without a doubt, we will hit more obstacles. But I ask the \nparties to persevere, to keep moving forward even through difficult times and to continue working to achieve a just \nand lasting peace in the region.\"\n\nAlso invited to join the talks were the leaders Egypt and Jordan --  two Arab countries with relatively positive ties to \nIsrael. To this end, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"President Obama has invited President Mubarak of Egypt and \nKing Abdullah of Jordan to attend, in view of their critical role in this effort. Their continued leadership and \ncommitment to peace will be essential to our success.\" Also invited to join the meetings was former British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair, the special representative of the Middle East Peace Quartet, composed of the United States, \nthe European Union, Russia and the United Nations.\" Excluded from the talks was the Islamic extremist group, \nHamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, noted that if the two sides were unable to \nmake progress, then the United States would be prepared to submit bridging proposals. Before such an end could \ntranspire, there was a sense of cautious hope tinged with reality. Indeed, Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged, \n\"reaching an agreement is a difficult challenge but is possible.\" Netanyahu's office issued a statement that read: \n\"We are coming to the talks with a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement between the two peoples that will \nprotect Israel's national security interests.\" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said in an interview with the \nBBC: \"I hope that Mr. Netanyahu will be our partner in peace... and we can do it.\"\n\nHamas attempts to derail the peace process --\n\nJust ahead of the much anticipated peace talks, four Israelis were shot to death in the West Bank.  Two Israeli men \nand two Israeli women died when their car came under gunfire as it traversed a road between the Palestinian \nsettlement of Bani Naim and the Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba, located near to the city of Hebron. The militant \nextremist  Palestinian organization, Hamas, which has not been a player in peace negotiations, claimed \nresponsibility for that attack. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak characterized the killings as an act of sabotage, \naimed at derailing the peace process, and warned of retribution for those responsible. Then, just as the peace talks \nwere due to begin,  another act of violence ensued when two Israelis were shot and wounded at the Rimonim \nJunction in the West Bank, close to the Jewish settlement of Kochav Hashahar.  Again, Hamas claimed \nresponsibility for this attack.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, even in the face of this tragic violence in the West Bank, peace talks commenced in the United \nStates amongst the stakeholders.  United States President Barack Obama, the host and main peace broker,  \nencouraged the Israeli and Palestinians leaders to remain on the course of engagement and not allow the \nopportunity to build a lasting peace \"slip away.\"  Promising that the United States would not waver in its \ncommitment to broker peace, President Obama said, \"This moment of opportunity may not soon come again.\"  The \nUnited States leader also condemned the aforementioned bloodshed in the west Bank at the hands of Hamas.\n\nCommencement of Peace Negotiations --\n\nOn September 1, 2010  -- ahead of the commencement of actual talks -- President Obama convened a meeting \nbetween Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of \nJordan, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  As noted above, that meeting was also included former British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair, the special representative of the Middle East Peace Quartet.\n\nPresident Obama said that the impending negotiations were \"intended to resolve all final status issues.\"  The United \nStates president explained that the talks, which were scheduled to last for a year, were aimed at ultimately  forging  \na permanent settlement to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in the form of two democratic states  -- one \nIsraeli and one Palestinian -- living side by side in peace.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu struck a similar tone \nsaying, \"Our goal is to forge a secure and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\"  He continued, \"We do \nnot seek a brief interlude between two wars. We do not seek a temporary respite between outbursts of terror. We \nseek a peace that will end the conflict between us once and for all.\" For his part, Palestinian President Abbas said, \n\"We will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause.\" \nHe also condemned the attacks on Israelis and called for  an end to the bloodshed.\n\nOn September 2, 2010, the actual negotiations began between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acting as the main \narbiter.  Opening the talks, Secretary of State Clinton said, \"Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, you have the \nopportunity to end this conflict and the decades of enmity between your peoples once and for all.\" Secretary of \nState Clinton asserted that her country had \"pledged its full support to these talks,\"  and said, \"We will be an active \nand sustained partner.\" However, she cautioned that Washington would not impose a solution on the Middle East. \nSecretary of State Clinton  issued the following warning: \"The core issues at the center  of these negotiations - \nterritory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and others - will get no easier if we wait, nor will they resolve \nthemselves.\"\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Abbas seemed to be fully cognizant of the challenge of the task at hand.  Prime Minister \nNetanyahu said, \"This will not be easy. True peace, a lasting peace, will be achieved only with mutual and painful \nconcessions from both sides.\"  President Abbas said: \"We do know how hard are the hurdles and obstacles we face \nduring these negotiations \u2013 negotiations  that within a year should result in an agreement that will bring peace.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the two leaders of Israel and the Palestinian territories appeared to have respectively enjoyed cordial \nrelations during the talks, despite Abbas' insistence that Israel cease its settlement activity in Palestinian territories.  \nAt issue has been the expiration of a partial freeze on building homes for Jewish settlers.  The matter has been the \ncause of much consternation with the Israeli saying that they might not renew the freeze, and Palestinians \nthreatening to walk away from the negotiating table if such the settlement activity resumed. But also of equal \nimportance was Israel's demands that (1) any peace deal consider the particular and special security needs of \nIsrael, and (2) that Palestinians recognize the unique identity of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nNevertheless, by the close of the first round of talks, the United States deemed the exercise to be constructive. \nUnited States envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, characterized private talks between the two leaders -- \nNetanyahu and Abbas -- as  \"cordial\" and observed that the meeting were conducted in a \"constructive and positive \nmood.\"  Moreover, Mitchell announced that both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas agreed not simply \nto continue to work toward peace in the abstract, but to meet again in just two weeks in the Middle East.  Mitchell \nsaid that the next talks would take place in mid-September 2010, with further negotiations to take place on a \n\n\n\nphased continuing basis every two weeks after that.  One of the immediate goals was to  arrive at a framework \nagreement on the contentious \"final status\" issues, effectively paving the way for a comprehensive peace treaty.\n\nAt that meeting in mid-September 2010 in Sharm-el-Sheik in Egypt, which was attended by Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Abbas, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and United \nStates envoy George Mitchell,  all the relevant parties said that they were committed to the negotiations. Special \nEnvoy Mitchell said that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders  held \"serious discussions on core issues.\"  He also said \nthat the objective of \"two states for two peoples\" remained at the heart of the matter, with efforts being expended to  \nachieve a framework for that goal.  Secretary of State Clinton noted this end result could not be achieved without \nongoing dialogue. \"It is a question of how can we work toward making these direct negotiations break through the \nclear and difficult obstacles that stand in the way toward achieving a comprehensive peace,\" she asserted.\n\nThe encouraging words aside, there appeared to be little resolution on the outstanding issue of Jewish settlements.  \nDespite Palestinian threats to exit the negotiations in settlement activity resumed, and in the face of Secretary of \nState Clinton's call for Israel to extend its freeze on West Bank construction, Israel was not promising to extend its \nmoratorium on settlement activity.\n\nStill, Prime Minister Netanyahu appeared to be making some concessions by suggesting that while the ban on all \nconstruction would not be renewed at the end of September 2010, the plan for the construction of thousands of \nhouses in the West Bank might not go forward.  Chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, however, appeared \nunimpressed in an interview with the Associated Press.  He said that \"half solutions\" by Israel were unacceptable.\n\nSecretary of State Clinton suggested that the construction freeze -- a highly politicized issue in Israel -- could be \nmade more palatable with assistance from the Palestinians.  Moreover, she suggested that there were alternate \nways of crossing \"the hurdle posed by the expiration of the original moratorium. \"  In an interview with Agence \nFrance Presse, Secretary of State Clinton said: \"Remember the goal is to work toward agreement on core issues \nlike borders and territory that would, if agreed upon, eliminate the debate about settlements.\"  Presumably, the \nUnited States' top diplomat was suggesting that rather than taking on the settlement issue outright as part of the \npeace process, the matter could be circumvented by focusing on finding agreement on long-term issues of borders \nand territory.  Whether or not that proposal was feasible was yet to be determined.\n\nCharting the Path for Peace --\n\nThe decision by the United States to commence an intensive diplomatic push for Middle East peace may be viewed \nas ambitious -- especially given the fact that it is a conservative, hardline Israeli government negotiating with the \nleader of the Palestinian Authority, while Hamas -- which controls Gaza -- has been left out of the equation.  In fact, \nPalestinian President Abbas would be negotiating on behalf of all Palestinians despite the fact that he has held no \neffective power over Gaza for some time.  Making matters more complicated, a conflict that had once been \nunderstood predominantly in territorial terms has increasingly taken on a more religious orientation in the current \nglobal arena. Clearly, resolving a conflict with religious undercurrents promised to be an even more challenging \nendeavor.\n\nIndeed, even under theoretically more favorable circumstances, peace has eluded the region.  Under the \nstewardship of former United States President Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a most \npromising peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians collapsed at the hands of the Palestinian leader of the \ntime, Yasser Arafat, despite much compromise by former Prime Minister Ehud Barack in 2000.  In fact, the collapse \nof that deal ushered in a bloody period of violence known as the Intifada.\n\nNow, in 2010, President Obama was trying to revitalize the peace process and find success in an arena that has \nbedeviled American presidents for generations.  But President Obama seemed to be something of a realist amidst \nthe ideals of Middle East peace.  Along with the imposition of a  deadline on peace talks, President Obama \nemphasized that success would ultimately be determined by the decision makers of Israel and the Palestinian \nTerritories.  He noted that his country -- the United States -- could not want peace  more than Israelis and \nPalestinians.  President Obama also warned that the peace process would be subject to the negative machinations \n\n\n\nof \"extremists and rejectionists who, rather than seeking peace, are going to be seeking destruction.\"  Whether  the \npeace process would move in a generative -- rather than destructive -- direction was yet to be determined.\n\nSpecial Report: Yemen Resurfaces as Emerging Base of Terrorism\n\nIn late October 2010, bombs were found hidden in cargo planes originating in Yemen and bound for Jewish \nsynagogues in the city of Chicago in the United States.  The devices containing pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)  \nand plastic explosives  mixed with lead azide (used to detonate explosives) were inserted into printer cartridges and \nmailed via cargo shipment from Yemen.\n\nIn one case, a printer was found on a cargo plane in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates  equipped with a circuit \nboard linked to a mobile phone card. In another case,  a explosive device was intercepted at the East Midlands \nAirport in the United Kingdom only after an initial search yielded no results.  Authorities in the United Kingdom were \nthen told that the explosives found in Dubai had been hidden in the printer, thus a more thorough secondary search, \nthis time with positive results.\n\nBritish  Prime Minister David Cameron issued the disturbing news that the explosive device was designed to be \ndetonated on the aircraft, although it was not known when it was intended to explode. In practical terms, this meant \nthat it was unknown as to whether  the bombs could be detonated remotely whileairliners were in flight, or, when the \npackages were opened at their destinations in the United States.  John Brennan, counter-terrorism adviser to \nUnited States President Barack Obama, warned that the bombs were \"sophisticated\" and \"self-contained\" devices, \nintended to be detonated by the terrorists according to their chosen schedules.  Given the use of the particular \nexplosives within the printer cartridges, it would have been difficult for any bomb-sniffing dogs or x-ray machines to \ndiscover them.\n\nBoth discoveries were made thanks  to intelligence passed on from Saudi Arabian authorities as well as a British \nM16 agent working in Yemen.  The Saudi-based intelligence was linked to a tip received from a repentant al-Qaida \nmember, Jabr al-Faifi, once held at Guantanamo Bay. Blame was quickly placed on al-Qaida in Yemen, which has \nbeen known to attempt bomb attacks using PETN.  Attention was also focused on a well-known al-Qaida \nexplosives expert, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, who was believed to be the bomb maker from Saudi Arabia now living in \nYemen.\n\nIn that country, now regarded as an emerging base of radical jihadist Islamists such as al-Qaida, a female student \nwas arrested in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on suspicion of dispatching the explosives-laden packages. The \nwoman's location was traced via the telephone number she furnished to the cargo company.  Given the threat, local \noffices of the cargo firms, UPS and FedEx, shut down freight operations in Yemen, while several countries placed a \nhalt on cargo transported from Yemen.  Yemeni officials were additionally on the hunt for additional suspects \nbelieved to be involved in procuring forged documents and identification cards.  Also under suspicion were two \nlanguage institutions in Yemen believed to be linked with the orchestrator of the mail bomb plot.\n\nMeanwhile, cargo airliners were not the only ones involved in what appeared to be thwarted terror attacks.  News \nreports indicated that at least one of the packages containing a bomb traveled on passenger flights.  To that end, \none package was transported on a Qatar Airlines flight from Yemen to Qatar, and then transferred to another Qatar \nAirlines flight onto Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  This revelation raised questions about the safety of global \ntravel, given the transportation of cargo in civilian airliners.\n\nUnder fire for yet another terrorist attempt emanating from his country, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said \nthat his country would keep up its fight against al-Qaida \"in co-operation with its partners.\"  However, the Yemeni \nleader intimated that his country would balk at the notion of intervention by foreign powers saying, \"But we do not \nwant anyone to interfere in Yemeni affairs by hunting down al-Qaeda.\"\n\nIt was yet to be seen how foreign powers would respond to this call since in December 2009, a Nigerian national \ntried to detonate explosives on a flight destined for the American city of Detroit.  That plot was thwarted by a vigilant \npassenger on the same flight but the plot was traced back to al-Qaida in Yemen.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States was making it clear that it wanted to assist President \nSaleh in the fight against al-Qaida. Indeed, the United States government was sending inspectors to Yemen to \ninvestigate cargo security practices, given the ostensible assumption that further bombs could be transported in the \nsame way as the two currently at issue.  The United States was also reiterating its commitment to destroying the \nterror enclave, al-Qaida.\n\nRussia and United States Sign New Arms Treaty\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged her Russian counterpart, Russian Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov, to move forward with efforts to finalize a new arms reduction treaty.  During a briefing, State \nDepartment spokesman Philip Crowley said the United States' top diplomat \"emphasized to the foreign minister that \nour negotiators are close to reaching an agreement and encouraged Russia to continue to move ahead, push hard \nso we can reach an agreement in the next couple of weeks.\"  That timeline seemed to coincide with Russian \nexpectations, since a Russian lawmaker, Konstantin Kosachyov, noted that discussions were underway on a new \ntreaty to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which  expired on Dec. 5, 2009.\n\nIn March 2010, Secretary of State Clinton was in Moscow for meetings with Foreign Minister Lavrov. From Moscow, \nClinton and Lavrov noted that a new START would soon be finalized.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Lavrov, Clinton said, \"The results of the latest negotiation rounds lead us to believe \nwe'll be reaching a final agreement soon.\" At issue is a plan that would reduce the United States' stockpile of 2,000 \nstrategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of close to 3,000, be reduced to between 1,500 and 1,675 \nwarheads respectively. There was, however, some dissonance on verification measures aimed at quantifying \nweapons and launch systems.\n\nAs progress was being made on a successor treaty to START, United States President Barack Obama called for  a \nreduction in the number of nuclear weapons, as part of a changing national security strategy.  To this end, he said: \n\"The United States reaffirms our resolve to strengthen the non-proliferation regime to meet the challenges of the \n21st century as we pursue our ultimate vision of a world without nuclear weapons.\" As President Obama marked \nthe  40th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, he intimated new post-Cold War policy, saying: \"Our \nforthcoming Nuclear Posture Review will move beyond outdated Cold War thinking and reduce the number and role \nof nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, even as we maintain a safe, secure and effective nuclear \ndeterrent.\"  President Obama also said he would work to  seek ratification on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1996, but which had yet to be enforced.  These statements \nappeared to reify President Obama's vision of a nuclear-free world, which was laid out in a keynote speech in \nPrague in 2009.  It also came ahead of a nuclear security summit, set to take place  in Washington D.C. in April \n2010.\n\nBoth President Obama and his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, were expected to sign the \nlandmark accord, which provides for the reduction of long-range nuclear weapons on both sides, and sets the path \nfor further  disarmament in the future. The accord was illustrative of the new texture of bilateral relations, marked by \nan increased level of cooperation and trust between the United States and Russia in the last two years.  \"Measures \nto Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\" was expected to be signed on April 8, 2010, in the \nCzech capital of Prague, symbolically marking President Barack Obama's call for a world without nuclear weapons \nin that very city a year earlier.  The timing would also ensure that both the United States and Russia would be able \nto enter the  forthcomingSummit on Nuclear Security with a joint claim of accomplishment.  They would also have \nthe moral high ground in their efforts to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nLauding the treaty as the most comprehensive weapons control accord in two decades, President Obama \ndeclared:  \"With this agreement, the United States and Russia - the two largest nuclear powers in the world - also \nsend a clear signal that we intend to lead.\"  He continued, \"By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons, and to ensure that \nother nations meet their own responsibilities.\"  Via his spokesperson, President Medvedev said the treaty \"reflects \n\n\n\nthe balance of interests of both nations.\"  As well, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the treaty \nmarked a \"new level of trust\" between the two countries.\n\nOn April 8, 2010, President Obama and President Medvedev held private talks at Prague Castle ahead of the \nsigning ceremony.  Later, both leaders signed their names on the new document that would significantly reduce the \narsenal of nuclear weapons held by their respective countries. The two leaders of the countries controlling 90 \npercent of the world's nuclear weapons made it clear that membership in the global nuclear club came with \nextraordinary responsibility, and a vision of non-proliferation.  President Obama said, \"This day demonstrates the \ndetermination of the United States and Russia... to pursue responsible global leadership. Together, we are keeping \nour commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which must be the foundation of global non-\nproliferation.\"  Meanwhile, President Medvedev said: \"This is a win-win situation. No one stands to lose in this \nagreement. Both parties won ... the entire world community won.\"  In effect, the fact that the two countries  were \nable to find consensus on such a complex matter, and the two leaders were able to sign one of the most important \ntreaties in decades, signaled the anticipated \"re-setting\" of United States-Russian relations sought by the Obama \nadministration in the United States when it came to power.\n\nThe difficult process of forging and signing such a bilateral agreement would be followed by the equally challenging \nprocess of ratification in the United States Senate. With an eye on this process, President Obama met in the Oval \nOffice with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and \nthe ranking republican, Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) to discuss this imperative. To the end, Senator Kerry \nsaid, \"A well-designed treaty will send an important message to the rest of the world that America is prepared to \nlead efforts with key stakeholders to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\" It should be noted that the new START \nwould also have to be ratified by the Russian Duma. Nevertheless, ahead of a global security summit scheduled to \ntake place in Washington, Russia and the United States would be able to claim the high ground on leadership and \nresponsibility among nuclear-armed nation states.\n\nIn November 2010, President Obama was calling on the United States Senate to ratify the treaty. He characterized \nthe need to do so as \"a national security imperative\" on Nov. 18, 2010, demanding that the upper chamber of \nCongress act affirmatively before departing at the close of the year. Bringing as much pressure to bear, President \nObama drew upon support from former secretaries of states and secretaries of defense from both political parties in \nthe United States -- Republican and Democratic -- to emphasize the urgency in ratifying the treaty. Speaking in the \nRoosevelt Room in the White House, the United States president said, \"This is not a Democratic concept. This is \nnot a Republican concept. This is a concept of American national security that has been promoted by Ronald \nReagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and now my administration. We've taken the time to do \nthis right.\" President Obama noted that his country would not \"afford to gamble\" with the matter. He emphasized \nthat the United States could not risk alienating Russia, whose support would be needed in pressuring Iran, given \nthat country's suspected program of nuclear proliferation. He continued, \"This is not about politics. It's about \nnational security. This is not a matter than can be delayed.\"\n\nBut delay was on the mind of Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona who rejected the president's call for a review \nprocess during the Senate's lame duck session of the outgoing Senate. At least eight Republican votes would be \nneeded by the outgoing Senate for ratification; in the newly-elected Senate, Democrats would have a tougher hill to \nclimb as they would need the support of at least 14 Republicans. Recently re-elected Senate Majority Leader \nHarry Reid, a Democrat of Nevada, expressed support for rapid action on the treaty, and said that he was \"puzzled\" \nby Kyl's desire to slow down action on a national security priority. Speaking to this issue, President Obama said: \n\"Every month that goes by without a treaty means that we are not able to verify what's going on on the ground in \nRussia. And if we delay indefinitely, American leadership on nonproliferation and America's national security will be \nweakened.\"  The president's stance had support from the other side of the aisle in the form of Senator Richard \nLugar, Republican of Indiana, who said: \"This is a situation of some national security peril.\"\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the Senate vote on the treaty, the minority leader of the Senate, Republican Mitch \nMcConnell, said he intended to vote against the deal, saying it would limit the United States missile defense \noptions. This view, however, was in direct contrast to the bill at hand, which as President Obama noted, placed no \n\n\n\nrestrictions on missile defense. Also joining the \"no\" vote chorus was Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona \nwho has steadfastly voted against most of President Obama's agenda. The lack of support from the likes of \nMcConnell and McCain notwithstanding, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear that a vote would be \nscheduled for Dec. 21, 2010. He said, \"It is time to move forward on a treaty that will help reverse nuclear \nproliferation and make it harder for terrorists to get their hands on a nuclear weapon.\" Reid continued that it would \n\"come down to a simple choice: you either want to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists, or you \ndon't.\"\n\nOn Dec. 21, 2010, eleven Republicans joined the Democrats and Independents who caucus with the Democrats to \nend debate on the matter. The cloture was 67-28 and indicated that  President Obama had overcome Republican \nopposition to secure overwhelming support for the new arms control treaty with Russia.  As expected, Republicans \nsuch as McConnell, McCain, and Kyl, did not support the proxy vote; however, several Republicans broke ranks \nwith the party leadership to do so.\n\nA final vote on the bill was set for Dec. 22, 2010.  Vice President Joe Biden presided over the Senate vote while \nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton observed the procedure from the floor of the upper chamber of \nCongress.  Speaking ahead of the final vote,  Foreign Relations Senate Committee Chairman John Kerry of \nMassachussetts said, \"The question is whether we move the world a little out of the dark shadow of nuclear \nnightmare.\" Not surprisingly, that final vote ended in overwhelming bipartisan support for the nuclear arms control \ntreaty.  Indeed, the final cote was 71-26, and the \"yes\" contingent included 13 Republicans (again breaking ranks \nwith the party leadership), two Independents who caucus with the Democrats, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden \nof Oregon who participated in the vote only two days after having cancer surgery.\n\nThe result was ratification of the new treaty to replace START -- and a significant foreign policy victory for \nPresident Obama. Lauding the bipartisan vote, President Obama characterized the treaty as the most important \narms control pact in nearly two decades. At a news conference at the White House, he said: \"This treaty will \nenhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them.\"\n\nTwo United States airmen killed in Germany\n\nAt the start of March 2011, two United States Air Force servicemen were killed by a gunman at the Frankfurt airport \nin Germany.\n\nTwo additional United States servicemen were injured in the same attack, one of whom was said to be in critical \ncondition.  According to authorities in Germany, the gunman became embroiled in an altercation at the airport \nbefore opening fire on the four servicemen.  The gunman was identified  as Arid Uka -- a man from Kosovo whose \nfamily migrated to Germany four decades earlier; Uka  was arrested at the airport's Terminal 2 where the attack \nensued\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama condemned the attack, characterizing  it as \"outrageous\" and calling for \njustice to be served.  He also praised the service of the victims to the country saying, \"I think the American people \nare united in expressing our gratitude for the service of those who were lost.\"  German Chancellor AngelaMerkel \npromised a full inquiry into the matter,  saying, \"I would like to assure you that the German government will do our \nutmost to investigate what happened.\"\n\nPresident Obama calls for pre-1967 boundaries as basis for two state solution in Middle East\n\nOn May 19, 2011, during a speech at the United States Department of State outlining United States policy and the \nMiddle East,  President Barack Obama said that a future Palestinian state would be based on the 1967 borders.\n\nThe United States president said, \"The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with \nmutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\"  Although a long-\n\n\n\nstanding tenet of Middle East negotiations (as discussed below), President Obama's statement yielded rebuke from \nhardliners who claimed he was abandoning Israel, and tensions with the Netanyahu administration. The controversy \n-- false though it might be -- over President Obama's policy stance  on Middle East Peace was expected to carry \nover for several days.  The president was scheduled to offer a speech at an American pro-Israel lobbying entity, \nAIPAC, at its annual conference.  As well, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the United States for a \nvisit and was scheduled to a joint session of the United States Congress.\n\nPalestinians prepare unilateral bid for recognition at United Nations; Israel wants return to peace negotiations while \nUnited States promises veto at Security Council\n\nSummary --\n\nPalestinian  Authority President Mahmoud Abbas  has sought full membership for a Palestinian state within the \nUnited Nations.  He said that full status and recognition at the United Nations was a legitimate right for the \nPalestinian people, and that this cause would be taken up at the meeting of the United Nations.  Of course, the \nunilateral measure has been opposed by Israel, which has cast the move as divisive and unlikely to help the peace \nprocess, which aims to achieve a two-state solution with an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living \nside by side  in peace and security. For its part, the United States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return \nto the peace process and the negotiating table as the only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  The \nUnited States also warned the Palestinians that it would use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to \nquell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for recognition. The  unilateral bid for recognition at the United Nations by the \nPalestinians was expected to  open the metaphoric \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions, with countries in the \nglobal community forced to take sides.\n\nPolitical Background --\n\nA key issue has been the Palestinians' call for recognition of a state consistent with the 1967 borders, which \nencompasses the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip.  This terrain has been occupied by \nIsrael since 1967 and has been a keystone issue in all discussions and peace negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinians.  A peace plan advanced by United States President Barack Obama  in May 2011 had  called for  pre-\n1967 boundaries (with swaps) as the basis for two-state solution in Middle East. The plan evoked anxiety on the \npart of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite the fact that this has been the \nfoundation for previous peace initiatives.\n\nIndeed, the pre-1967 boundaries refers to the borders that existed before the six-day Middle East war in 1967 that \nextended Israeli control into the West Bank and Gaza with predominantly Palestinian populations.  That terrain has \nconstituted the literal and figurative grounds of contestation in Israel and the Palestinian territories since some \n300,000 Israeli Jews have constructed settlements on the outlying areas.  Settlement activity has raised the ire of \nPalestinians who believe that the encroachment will curtail their own rights to land for a future Palestinian state.  \nThe matter has been one of great consternation, and has resided at the heart of peace negotiations with \nPalestinians demanding a halt to settlement activity, always alongside Israelis' demands for an end to attacks by \nPalestinian militants.\n\nTo be precise, peace initiatives on the Middle East over the years have often rested on the notion of resorting to \npre-1967 borders -- at the very least as a point from which to begin negotiations.  Stated another way, while brokers \nof peace in the Middle East may not have overtly foregrounded the pre-1967 borders in the forthright manner of \nPresident Obama, the same principle has been cast as a \"jumping off point\" of sorts (and not the ultimate \ndestination) of peace negotiations for decades.  It is well known that Israel will not accept the wholesale notion of \nthe pre-1967 borders, however, trade offs  for other priority issues have always been part of the terms of peace \nnegotiations. In this respect, President Obama's stance has differed little from predecessors in orientation, \nespecially as he emphasized the notion of \"mutually agreed swaps\" of terrain for the creation of \"a viable Palestine, \nand a secure Israel.\"\n\nNevertheless,  President Obama's peace initiative earlier in the year set off a firestorm  at home and abroad among \nright-leaning and hard line politicians.  Republicans at home accused him of abandoning Israel, while Israeli Prime \n\n\n\nMinister  Benjamin  Netanyahu was quick to note that the borders that existed prior to the 1967  war were \n\"indefensible.\" The Israeli head of government was referring to settlements such as those in  Judea and Samaria \nthat would be left undefended beyond those territorial lines.  Prime Minister Netanyahu also said that he \nappreciated President Obama's \"commitment to peace\" but that for peace to endure, \"the viability of a Palestinian \nstate cannot come at the expense of the viability of the one and only Jewish state.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu , \ntherefore, called for President Obama to affirm the United States' 2004 commitment to Israel, in which then-\nPresident George W. Bush said that Israel would be able to hold on to substantial settlements as part of a future \npeace deal.\n\nIt should be noted that despite this sudden controversy erupting from President Obama's plan, in fact, a 2002 \"land \nfor peace\" deal tabled by Saudi Arabia contained the very same \"withdrawal to pre-1967 borders\" provision and \nwas seriously considered by Israel at the time.\n\nCentral to the Saudi \"land for peace\" plan was  pan-Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for Israel's withdrawal \nfrom Arab lands captured in 1967 \u2013 the West Bank, Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.  During its \nown tenure at the helm of government in the United States, the Bush administration appeared to entertain the Saudi \n\"land for peace\"  plan as a worthy companion to its own \"roadmap for peace\" in the early 2000s.  Moreover, by \n2008,  Israel -- then under the control of the centrist Kadima Party -- reportedly was reconsidering the dormant \"land \nfor peace\" deal, albeit with reservations.  Palestinian negotiators encouraged Israel to pursue this track at the time.  \nThat being said,  members of the conservative Likud Party of Netanyahu rejected this proposal as a non-starter due \nto the aforementioned matter of leaving Jewish settlements vulnerable.  Now in power, Prime Minister Netanyahu \nwas unlikely to soften his position since he was in an uneasy alliance with the hard line party, Yisrael Beiteinu, \nwhich strenuously rejects any halt to settlement activity.  Given the need to massage the interests of his coalition \npartner, the domestic political scene in Israel would underline Netanyahu's imperative to reject the 2008 \"land for \npeace\" deal and the 2011 position, as articulated by President Obama.\n\nIt should also be noted that  foreign policy analysts could not interpret President Obama's speech as anything less \nthan a strong affirmation of the United States' enduring relationship with Israel.  Notably, President Obama offered \nIsrael an exit strategy from peace negotiations with the Palestinians -- for the moment, unified in governance among \nFatah and Hamas factions.  Specifically, in pointing to Hamas' refusal to recognize the Jewish State of Israel, \nPresident Obama noted that it would be ludicrous for Israel to pursue serious talks with an entity that would not \neven acknowledge existential and geopolitical realities.  Moreover, President Obama signaled that the United \nStates would be siding with Israel should the Palestinians petition the United Nations for statehood and  recognition \nlater in 2011 without resolving the outstanding territorial issues.\n\nThe Scene Ahead of the Palestinians' Bid for Statehood --\n\nAt the start of August 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said he was prepared to discuss a peace \nplan with the Palestinians, based on United States President Obama's borders proposition.  Netanyahu's \nannouncement to Middle East power brokers appeared aimed at reinvigorating stalled peace talks.  Months earlier \nin May 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu excoriated President Obama for advancing a plan that called for pre-1967 \nboundaries as a basis for two-state solution in Middle East.  Then, in August 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu \nappeared to be accepting the pre-1967 borders as a starting point for discussions, although the prime minister's \noffice refused to admit that it was reversing its earlier-stated objections to the terms put forth by President Obama.  \nPrime Minister Netanyahu's office, though, said that any peace agreement would be contingent upon the \nrecognition of Israel as a Jewish state -- a stance that has not found acceptance among Palestinian quarters.\n\nIt should also be noted that amid these moves by Israel was the impending decision by the Palestinian Authority to \npresent its application for international recognition of statehood to the United Nations in September 2011.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has made the claim that it does not wish to wait for independence via peace negotiations \nwith Israel, thus the thrust to vitiate the peace process.  However, with the United States -- an ally of Israel -- on the \nUnited Nations Security Council, it was inevitable that the Palestinian Authority's unilateral declaration of \nindependence would be be subject to veto.  As noted above, United States President Barack Obama had already \n\n\n\nwarned of such an outcome months earlier when he re-introduced the aforementioned terms of the peace process.  \nNonetheless, the Palestinian Authority was hoping that affirmative votes at the United Nations (United States \nexcluded) would  strengthen its hand in trying to achieve independence.\n\nAt the start of September 2011, in a last-ditch effort to avert a diplomatic showdown at the United Nations, the \nObama administration in the United States circulated a proposal aimed at restarting peace talks.  The proposal \nincluded a provision for the Palestinians to abandon the membership and recognition vote in the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly, which was expected to take place on Sept. 20, 2011.\n\nAs Israel's closest ally, the United States had been hoping to shift the momentum, while realizing that it could not \neasily  coalesce enough support from individuals countries to block ratification of the Palestinians' aspirations at the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. Accordingly, it had advanced the aforementioned proposal aimed at restarting \nthe peace process. Clearly, the United States was hoping to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to the table -- \nto traverse the course of the peace process.  The United States was also hoping that by providing an an alternate \npathway (i.e. distinct from the unilateral and inevitably controversial membership and recognition vote in the United \nNations), several individual countries would opt to support the peace process option at a vote in the General \nAssembly.\n\nAs noted above, the Palestinians were hoping to bypass the peace process, and if not outright achieve \nindependence via a vote at the United Nations, at least garner significant political power for the cause. Should the \nPalestinians ultimately decide to pursue this path at the United Nations, the United States warned the Palestinians \nthat it would use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to quell the Palestinians' unilateral bid for \nrecognition.\n\nPalestinians Bid for full UN membership --\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would seek full membership for a \nPalestinian state at the anticipated meeting of the United Nations in New York, set to take place within days.  As of \n2011, Palestinians hoed permanent observer status at the United Nations and were represented by the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO).  This move to pursue full membership could  be understood as the desire to seek an \nupgrade in status, of sorts.\n\nAbbas, who spoke from the Palestinian Authority headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah,  said that full \nstatus and recognition at the United Nations was a legitimate right for the Palestinian people, and that this cause \nwould be taken up at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nNote that this strategy involved a modest shift from the initial plan to pursue ratification at the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. Now, Abbas was opting to seek  full membership at the United Nations Security Council. \nSpeaking of this impending effort, Abbas said: \"We are going to the United Nations to request our legitimate right, \nobtaining full membership for Palestine in this organization.\" He added, \"We take with us all the suffering and hope \nof our people to achieve this objective.\"  Abbas also noted that more than 100 countries already recognized \nPalestine as a state and that the patience of the Palestinians people had been exhausted.\n\nIt should be noted that while Abbas was speaking on behalf of the collective Palestinian people, the extremist \nmilitant  Islamist entity, Hamas, which controls Gaza, was not on board with the decision of the Palestinian Authority \npresident.  Instead, Hamas has said that the venture into the United Nation was a \"risky\" endeavor.  Of course, \nHamas has never endorsed the notion of a two-state solution since it does not recognize the right of existence for \nthe Jewish state of Israel.\n\nThe unilateral measure by the Palestinians for statehood and United Nations membership has been strenuously \nopposed by Israel, which has cast the move as both  divisive and provocative.  Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister \nDanny Ayalon observed in dire terms, \"A unilateral declaration by the Palestinians of independence or any UN \ndecision will actually be a vote for friction and conflict over co-operation and reconciliation and I think that would be \ndeplorable for many years.\"\n\n\n\nIsrael has further said it would undermine the peace process, which aims to achieve a two-state solution, \ncharacterized by an independent Israel and an independent Palestine living in peace and security beside one \nanother.  Israeli government spokesperson Mark Regev declined to offer an official response to Abbas' speech.  \nThat being said, Regev warned that the Palestinians' move would deleteriously affect the prospects for peace; he \nalso emphasized that the two state solution would only be reached via direct negotiations in Ramallah and \nJerusalem, rather that through the United Nations.\n\nIsrael has additionally accused the Palestinians of attempting to undermine its legitimacy in pursuing this path at the \nUnited Nations. In response, Abbas struck a somewhat more diplomatic tone, saying, \"We are not heading there to \nde-legitimize Israel, no one can do this, it is a state with full membership at the UN. We want to de-legitimize the \nIsraeli occupation and its measures on our territories.\"  This stated objective  notwithstanding, in fact,  the vote \nwould do nothing to end Israeli jurisdiction in certain spheres of control over the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nFor its part, the United States has echoed Israel's concerns and  urged a return to the peace process and the \nnegotiating table as the only legitimate path to achieving the two-state solution.  While the United States was not \nkeen to go down the path of halting the independence aspirations of the Palestinian people at a time of instability in \nthe wider Middle East region,  it was, nonetheless, maintaining its veto threat.  Indeed, the Obama administration \nhas made it very clear that if the Palestinians went through with their pursuit of full recognition and membership \nvote, the United States intended to wield its veto power at the United Nation Security Council.  A veto by the United \nStates would effectively render the membership and recognition aspirations of the Palestinians  null and void.\n\nStriking a diplomatic course, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy was calling for a  compromise in the form of \nenhanced status (as a non-member state) for the Palestinians at the General Assembly, with a timetable for \nnegotiations on the road to a definitive agreement.\n\nThe French leader was anxious to see a showdown at the Security Council averted.  But it seemed that this \ncompromise found little resonance among the Palestinian leadership.  Indeed, Palestinian Authority President \nAbbas asserted that he was pressing forward with that move.\n\nLeaving no doubt of his course  of action to be undertaken, President Obama reportedly told the Palestinian leader \n(Abbas)  on Sept. 22, 2011 that he would veto his bid for United Nations membership.  In an address to the United \nNations, President Obama reiterated the United States' stance, emphasizing that a sovereign Palestinian state \ncould only be achieved through direct negotiations with Israel.  He said,  of the road to achieving the two-state \nsolution: \"There is no short cut to the end of a conflict that has endured for decades.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Abbas was apparently crafting his written application , which would be submitted \nto Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Sept. 23, 2011.  Pending approval by the Ban Ki-moon, the application would \nthen be taken up by the Security Council and would require nine affirmative votes of the 15 members, and no \nvetoes, to pass.  That vote, though, was not expected for several weeks. Of course, with a guaranteed veto by the \nUnited States in the offing, the application was on the road to nowhere.  That being said, Palestinians were claiming \nimminent victory, suggesting that they had successfully brought the matter of Palestinian independence onto the \nnational agenda.\n\nAt the same time, the Netanyahu  government in Israel  -- not exactly an entity that has enjoyed warm relations with \nthe Obama White House -- was praising President Obama for his country's stalwart support.  President Netanyahu \ndeclared that the American president deserved a \"badge of honor\" for his defense of Israel.  Indeed, Israel's friends \nand allies on this subject were limited in the context of the global community.\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2011, Palestinian Authority President Abbas formally requested full United Nations membership as a \npath toward statehood.  Abbas conveyed the written request to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \nthen  delivered a speech to the annual gathering of the General Assembly.  Following protocol, United Nations \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon then passed on Abbas' request to the Security Council.  A vote on the matter was \nnot expected for several weeks.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it was clear that the Palestinian independence move was likely to metaphorically open \na \"Pandora's box\" of diplomatic tensions with countries in the global community forced to take sides. Moreover, it \ncould well inflame passions in the region of the Middle East, which was already experiencing historic upheaval, \never  since the \"season of unrest\" began to sweep across the Arab world at the start of 2011.\n\nPresident Obama makes history as first U.S. president to address British parliament\n\nOn May 25, 2011, United States President Barack Obama made history by becoming the first United States \npresident to address the British parliament at Westminster Hall. In that speech, President Obama emphasized the \nstrong and enduring bond between the two countries -- the United States and the United Kingdom -- characterizing \nthe trans-Atlantic relationship as \"one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known.\" President \nObama also noted that the primacy of the West -- of the United states and allied European countries -- would be \n\"indispensable\" in the 21st century, given the ascendancy of new world powers, and the spread of democracy. \nLinking these two themes, President Obama said, \"There are few nations that stand firmer, speak louder and fight \nharder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Prime Minister Gordon \nBrown, and Sir John Major, were in attendance for President Obama's address at Westminster Hall. The reception \nby British members of parliament and peers to President Obama was extraordinarily warm, with the United States \nleader receiving extended standing ovations at the start and at the close of the address respectively. The prior \nnight, President Obama and Mrs. Obama were guests of the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and her consort, \nPrince Phillip, at an official state dinner.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nOsama Bin Laden killed in targeted attack in Pakistan; U.S. President Obama says world \"now a safer and better \nplace\"\n\nOn May 1, 2011, following a highly orchestrated operation ordered by United States President Barack Obama, it \nwas announced that notorious global terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, was killed by United States special forces during \na raid on a highly-fortified compound in Pakistan.\n\nUnited States forces from the elite Navy Seal Team Six launched an attack on Bin Laden's mansion in Abbottabad, \nlocated about 60 miles to the northeast of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. United States officials said that while \nBin Laden could have been taken into custody alive by United States commandos, the terrorist leader was shot to \ndeath after resisting detainment and an ensuing gun battle. It was later revealed that Osama Bin Laden was not \nactually armed at the time of his shooting.\n\nFour other individuals -- one of Bin Laden's sons, two couriers, and a woman -- were killed in the raid, according to \nUnited States officials. There was some confusion as to whether the woman killed in the raid was one of Bin \nLaden's wives or a human shield (voluntarily placed there or otherwise). Subsequent reports indicated that the \nwoman killed was a wife of one of the two couriers living in the compound. One of Bin Laden's wives was shot but \nnot killed; she and two more of Bin Laden's wives were taken into custody by Pakistani authorities after the raid was \ncomplete and Bin Laden was dead.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama said that the death of the leader of the Islamic Jihadist terror enclave, al-\nQaida, meant the world was now a safer and a better place. He said, \"I think we can all agree this is a good day for \nAmerica. Our country has kept its commitment to see that justice is done. The world is safer; it is a better place \nbecause of the death of Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the successful special operation to kill or capture Bin \nLaden delivered a message to al-Qaida as well as the Taliban in the Afghan-Pak region. She issued a direct \nwarning to the Taliban as follows: \"You cannot wait us out, you cannot defeat us, but you can make the choice to \n\n\n\nabandon al-Qaida and participate in a peaceful political process.\" It should be emphasized that the Obama-Biden \nadministration has dealt with the Taliban and remnants of al-Qaida in the region by addressing the matter as part of \na broader Afghan-Pak strategy. Clearly, that strategy was now bearing fruit.\n\nIn an unprecedented statement praising the unilateral military action of a member state, the United Nations Security \nCouncil hailed the elimination of Bin Laden as a positive development for global security. The Security Council \nreleased the following statement: \"The Security Council recognizes this critical development and other \naccomplishments made in the fight against terrorism and urges all states to remain vigilant and intensify their efforts \nin the fight against terrorism.\"\n\nBut the entire global community was not so sanguine about the news of Bin Laden's demise. In Pakistan, after the \nnews broke of Bin Laden's death, about 100 people protested in the city of Quetta, burning United States flags and \nexpressing anti-American views.\n\nNot surprisingly, it was a different scene at home in the United States where thousands of people gathered outside \nthe White House in Washington D.C., and at Ground Zero in New York, to celebrate what could well be \ncharacterized as a victory in the war on terrorism. These were boisterous gatherings with those present chanting \n\"USA! USA! USA!\" and singing the national anthem.\n\nFormer United States President George W. Bush issued his congratulations to President Obama and United States \nspecial forces as follows: \"I congratulated him [President Obama] and the men and women of our military and \nintelligence community.\" Bush continued, \"The fight against terror goes on but tonight the American people sent a \nmessage that no matter how long it takes, justice will be done. \"\n\nWhile President Obama gained praise from certain other Republicans, including former Vice President Dick \nCheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, he was also \nsubject to attacks by the far left and the far right activist wings.\n\nElements of the political far right refused to attribute credit to President Obama and his national security team, and \ndenounced President Obama's decision to end the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" which they asserted \nwere crucial in the interests of national security. Of course, the information that contributed to President Obama's \ndecision to carry out the raid on the Pakistani compound was not actually gathered as a result of enhanced \ninterrogation techniques championed by the Bush administration in the years immediately after the 2001 terror \nattacks. Instead, the intelligence on the identity of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti -- the al-Qaida courier who led to the \nlocation of Bin Laden -- was obtained through standard and non-coercive means. This point was emphasized by \nSenator John McCain (R-Arizona) -- a rival of President Obama in the 2008 presidential race in the United States.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, those of the political far left railed against the killing of Bin Laden, even \nquestioning the legality of such action. This view was echoed by the sons of Bin Laden who claimed that their \nfather's death was a violation of international law. It should be noted that since Osama Bin Laden -- the commander \nof al-Qaida, an enemy force -- declared war on the United States in the 1990s, his elimination cannot properly be \nclassified as an assassination; instead, it is to be legally understood as the targeting of an enemy of the state during \nwartime. As noted by United States Attorney General Eric Holder in an interview with BBC News, the killing of the \nal-Qaida leader was \"not an assassination.\" Holder said that the operation was legal under international law, which \nallows for the targeting of enemy commanders. Holder also emphasized the priority of acting under the aegis of \njurisprudence saying, \"I actually think that the dotting of the i's and the crossing of the t's is what separates the \nUnited States, the United Kingdom, our allies, from those who we are fighting.\"\n\nUnited States officials have asserted that DNA tests confirm that one of the persons shot at the Pakistani compound \nwas, indeed, Osama Bin Laden. The body of the man listed as the \"most wanted man\" in the world was given an \nIslamic funeral on the aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, in the northern Arabian Sea, according to the Pentagon, \nand then disposed of at sea. This line of action was apparently undertaken to prevent Bin Laden's body being \nplaced in a location that could later become a shrine to be revered by extremist militants. It should be noted, \nthough, that some Islamic clerics have decried the disposal of Bin Laden's body at sea saying that it ran counter to \nprinciples of Islamic law.\n\n\n\nPolitically, the successful elimination of Osama Bin Laden could hardly be interpreted as anything but a boon for \nPresident Obama. His predecessor, George W. Bush, staked his presidency on the anti-terrorism theme, even \narguing that a war in Iraq was necessary in the effort against global terrorism. However, Bush was never able to \napprehend Bin Laden. Bush was criticized by his political opponents for allowing Bin Laden to escape capture at \nTora Bora in Afghanistan and for using questionable tactics -- including torture and extraordinary rendition -- to try \nto find and eliminate al-Qaida terrorists. Earlier efforts by former President Bill Clinton to target Bin Laden also \nended in failure. Consequently, for years since his earliest forays into global terrorism, including the East Africa \nembassy bombings of the 1990s, Bin Laden evaded capture. In fact, he raised the ire of many in the world by \nregularly releasing taped messages encouraging attacks on the United States, Western interests, Western allies, \nand even fellow Muslims deemed to be enemies of his extremist doctrine.\n\nNow, in 2011, President Obama had made good on a promise he made while a candidate -- to move immediately \non actionable intelligence to either kill or capture Osama Bin Laden. Indeed, having received the intelligence that \nBin Laden may have been hiding out in the aforementioned mansion in Pakistan, President Obama opted not for a \ndrone attack; instead, he ordered a surgical strike, carried out by special forces, and left open the possibility of \ntaking Bin Laden alive. It was a high risk calculation that could have ended in disaster. Instead, the operation ended \nwith the world's most notorious terrorist dead, no deaths to Americans participating in the operation, no civilian \ncasualties, and five deaths in total (as discussed above). Striking a patriotic tone, President Obama hailed the \noutcome saying, \"Today we are reminded that as a nation there is nothing we can't do.\"\n\nAs more information surfaced over the week following Bin Laden's death, it became clear that the raid on Bin \nLaden's secret Pakistani compound was the culmination of years of painstaking intelligence and ended in a \nstrategic and operational success.\n\nA long period of coalescing intelligence related to a trusted courier of Bin Laden resulted in the discovery of the \ncompound outside of the Pakistani capital. The elaborate nature of the house with high windows and limited \nentrances, and the secure surrounding compound with 12 foot high walls and a heavily fortified perimeter hinted \ntoward inhabitants more important than a courier, and led to speculation that it housed Bin Laden or another high \nvalue terror target. Several months of assessment followed, which included highly technical intelligence analysis. \nThen, the Obama administration was able to determine with a high degree of probability that Bin Laden -- the man \nwho claimed responsibility for ordering the 2011 terror attacks in the United States that left more than 3,000 people \ndead, as well as many other bloody and violent acts of terrorism -- was living secretly in that particular compound \nand not hiding in the harsh mountainous region bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, as was the common myth.\n\nThe national security team of the Obama White House then discussed possible measures to be taken. President \nObama was confronted with great disagreement, given the risks associated with either a raid or a drone bombing of \nthe target. John Brennan, the United States' chief counter-terrorism official, explained that there was no overt \nconsensus among the United States' national security team on which course of action to take. Still, in the end, \nPresident Obama opted for this targeted strike. Brennan said of President Obama's decision-making: \"One of the ... \ngutsiest calls of any president in recent memory.\"\n\nEventually, the decision made by President Obama to pursue the raid option, which would be carried out by the \nUnited States military but under the aegis of Central Intelligence Agency legal command, due to the United States' \nrelationship with Pakistan (a country with which the United States is not at war). With the decision made by the \npresident to go down this path, the elite Navy Seal special forces team were subject to extensive and laborious \ntraining exercises to practice the operation and be prepared for contingencies.\n\nAs recounted by President Obama himself in an interview on the CBS show, \"60 Minutes,\" the risks were \noutweighed by the possibility of finally apprehending the world's most wanted man. He said, \"But ultimately, I had \nso much confidence in the capacity of our guys to carry out the mission that I felt that the risks were outweighed by \nthe potential benefit of finally getting our man.\" President Obama characterized the 40 minute raid by the elite Navy \nSeal unit on the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan as \"the longest 40 minutes of my life.\" Throughout, President \nObama said that he and his national security team were able to monitor the commando operation from he White \nHouse Situation Room but did not have clear information about what was taking place inside the compound.\n\n\n\nAs further details about the operation emerged, it was revealed that the assault team deployed to Pakistan was \nlarge enough to fight its way out of Pakistan, if confronted by hostile local police and security forces. Clearly, the \nObama administration was willing to compromise its relationship with the United States' so-called ally, Pakistan, in \norder to kill or capture Bin Laden.\n\nSenior Obama administration officials also said there were two teams of adjunct specialists on standby -- one to \norganize the burial of Bin Laden if he was killed during the operation, and a another one made up of translators, \ninterrogators and lawyers, should Bin Laden be captured alive. This revelation underlined the Obama \nadministration's assertion that the commandos were under instruction to either kill or capture the terror leader. As \nnoted by United States Attorney General Eric Holder in an interview with BBC News, Bin Laden was the subject of a \n\"kill or capture mission\" and United States commandos handled the raid \"in an appropriate way.\" He said of the \npotential capture of Bin Laden, \"If the possibility had existed, if there was the possibility of a feasible surrender, that \nwould have occurred.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that documents uncovered during the raid by United States elite special forces on the Bin \nLaden compound revealed plans for further large scale attacks on the United States homeland, possibly due to \ntake place on the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. The documents further showed that \nBin Laden was far more than a spiritual leader or symbolic figurehead of al-Qaida but instead was an active \nparticipant -- even an orchestrator -- of terror attacks. As noted by National Security Adviser Donilan in an interview \non ABC News, \"I think the principal thing to take away is that he was engaged not just in being a symbolic leader of \nal-Qaida, but he was involved in the strategic and operational leadership.\"\n\nGiven the fact that Bin Laden was living in an elaborate mansion on a fortified compound in Pakistan, as discussed \nabove, questions were therefore resting on the Pakistani authorities. How was it that Bin Laden could have been \nsafely residing in a facility in a major Pakistani city -- in close proximity to the Pakistan Military Academy -- for all \nthis time? How could the specially-designed mansion have been constructed in the neighborhood of the military \nacademy without drawing the attention of all around?\n\nTo these ends, President Obama indicated that he would not rest in the effort against allies of Bin Laden, saying, \n\"We're going to pursue all leads to find out exactly what type of support system and benefactors that Bin Laden \nmight have had.\" Echoing a similar sentiment, chief counter-terrorism official John Brennan, said that it was \n\"inconceivable\" that Bin Laden was without a support system in Pakistan. A week after Bin Laden's capture, on \nNBC's \"Meet the Press\" television show, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said of the Pakistani authorities, \"I \ndon't have any information that would indicate foreknowledge by the political, military or intelligence leadership.\" But \nhe continued, \"These questions are being raised quite aggressively.\" Weeks after the strike on Bin Laden's \ncompound, Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that while the Pakistani leadership did not appear to have \nknown of the terrorist leader's presence within the country's borders, it was likely that others leading Pakistanis -- \nperhaps former members of the military -- may have been \"in the know.\"\n\nIt should be noted that weeks prior to the strike on the Bin Laden compound, the United States top military officer \nAdmiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistani's spy agency -- the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) -- of having \nlinks with extremist militants. While Pakistan maintains that there is no connection between its intelligence service \nand militants, the record appears to show a very different story. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Pakistani ISI was \nknown to have fundraised for Islamic militants, as reported by international defense analysts as well as Pakistani \nmilitary officials at home. More recently in mid-2010, Pakistan's reputation as a serious player in the efforts against \nglobal terrorism was severely hurt by revelations that ISI was funding, training, and providing sanctuary to the \nAfghan Taliban. For several years, there have been suspicions about such a clandestine relationship between the \ntwo entities, however, the closeness and extensive nature of their ties was something of a revelation. In a report \nissued by the London School of Economics (LSE), support for the Afghan Taliban was described as \"official ISI \npolicy.\"\n\nSince the 2001 terror attacks in the United States, Pakistan has accepted billions of dollars in aid funding from the \nUnited States, supposedly for its support in the fight against terror enclaves like al-Qaida and its Taliban allies. \nClearly, a continued relationship between the Pakistani ISI and extremist militants would run counter to its \n\n\n\nexpressed objectives of helping the United States quell the threat of terrorism emanating from such entities in the \nAfghan-Pak region. Yet to be determined was the matter of the role of Pakistani authorities in the operation to \neliminate Bin Laden. Already, it was known that Pakistan was notified of the operation to capture or kill Bin Laden \nonly after United States forces had departed Pakistani airspace.\n\nCertain Pakistani quarters were quick to assert that the country's sovereignty had been violated in the United \nStates' operation to kill or capture Bin Laden. Accordingly, there were expectations that relations with the United \nStates promised to become more tense. On the other hand, such claims were not likely to derail the prevailing \nquestions about the culpability of Pakistani authorities over the presence of the world's most notorious terrorist on \nPakistani soil. Husain Haqqani, the Pakistani ambassador to the United States, denied his country acted to protect \nbin Laden. He said of an impending investigation into the matter: \"Heads will roll, once the investigation has been \ncompleted. Now, if those heads are rolled on account of incompetence, we will share that information with you. And \nif, God forbid, somebody's complicity is discovered, there will be zero tolerance for that, as well.\" Pakistani Prime \nMinister Yousuf Raza Gilani offered a less diplomatic explanation of the Bin Laden's presence on Pakistani soil. In \nan interview with Time Magazine, Gilani said that while there was certainly an intelligence failure at play, Bin Laden \nwas not his responsibility as prime minister of Pakistan.\n\nIt was yet to be seen if the United States would easily accept this stance. Already, members of the United States \nCongress were calling for a reassessment of the country's relationship with Pakistan and a possible halt of United \nStates aid to that country. Indeed, on May 17, 2011, Congressional Republicans and Democrats warned Pakistan \nthat American aid could be curtailed, if not entirely cut, should Islamabad fail to intensify its offensive against \nIslamist extremist terrorists operating from within its borders deep inside Pakistan.\n\nThat being said, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry (D-Mass), the \nranking member, Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), and President Obama himself have respectively expressed \nmore reticence about such measures, perhaps with a broader eye on geopolitical stability. That is to say, even \ngiven the frustrations with the Pakistani authorities, a relationship with the power brokers would be preferable to no \nrelationship at all with a nuclear power at the heart of Jihadist Islamic extremist movement.\n\nMeanwhile, with al-Qaida possibly primed to carry out retaliatory attacks for the death of Bin Laden, the United \nStates Department of State issued a worldwide travel warning for its citizens overseas, and put its embassies \naround the world on alert. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon Panetta, warned that al-Qaida \nwould \"almost certainly\" seek revenge over the death of Bin Laden. At the same, the chief counter-terrorism official \nin the United States, John Brennan, warned that although Bin Laden's death would weaken the global Jihadist \nmovement, al-Qaida, was still a danger to international security. He said, \"It [al-Qaida] may be a mortally wounded \ntiger but it still has some life in it.\"\n\nIn a related development, with a rising threat against United States forces in the wake of Bin Laden's death, the \nObama administration was working to increase security for the elite Navy Seal unit that carried out the raid on the \nBin Laden compound. Threats by al-Shabab, the terror enclave of Somalia aligned with al-Qaida, were issued \nagainst President Obama's step-grandmother, Sarah Obama, in Kenya. Given Kenya's unhappy history as the \ntarget of a terror attack by al-Qaida in the 1990s, concerns were high and led to increased security by Kenyan \nauthorities for the relative of the United States president.\n\nThen, in mid-May 2011, suicide bombers attacked a Pakistani military academy in the northwestern town of \nCharsadda, killing at least 80 people, most of whom were military recruits. The Taliban in Pakistan quickly claimed \nresponsibility for the attack and characterized it as part of the mission to avenge the death of Bin Laden, at the \nhands of elite United States forces. Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesperson for the Taliban, warned that this was only \nthe initial attack in a mission of vengeance, saying: \"There will be more.\" Terrorism analysts observed that typically, \nmost Taliban attacks in recent years have had an internal ideological purpose (i.e. the undermining and toppling of \nthe Western-backed government), rather than being of global Jihadist orientation. A revenge agenda on behalf of \nBin Laden would cast the Taliban in Pakistan as having widened its objectives; however, it was not an \ninconceivable move given the militant Islamist Taliban's close ties with the notorious terror enclave, al-Qaida.\n\n\n\nThis attack coincided with the decision by a Pakistani cabinet defense committee to review cooperation on counter-\nterrorism with the United States. It was not known if this move was being made in response to United States \nPresident Barack Obama's decision to launch a raid on Pakistani soil to kill or capture Bin Laden. Regardless, a \nshift in counter-terrorism efforts between the two countries could have potential geopolitical ramifications. In the \nUnited States, though, the Obama administration made clear that it had no intention of scaling back its drone \nattacks in Pakistan's northwest region, which is a known hotbed of extremist Islamic militants. \n\nBy July 2011, given the growing outcry by United States policy-makers over Pakistan's questionable behavior in \nanti-terrorism efforts, the United States moved to withhold $800m of military aid to Pakistan. At issue was about a \nthird of the annual United States' security aid package  to Pakistan andthus , the decision to limit aid to that country \nconstituted a serious message from the Obama administration in the United States. Speaking on the news network, \nABC, White House Chief of Staff, Bill Daley, explained that in recent times, Pakistan had \"taken some steps that \nhave given us reason to pause on some of the aid.\"  Explaining the Obama administration's position, Daily also \nsaid, \"It's a complicated relationship in a very difficult, complicated part of the world. Obviously, there's still lot of \npain that the political system in Pakistan is feeling by virtue of the raid that we did to get Osama Bin Laden, \nsomething that the president felt strongly about and we have no regrets over.\" He continued, \"Until we get through \nthese difficulties, we will hold back some of the money.\"  Nevertheless, Daley did not foreclose acontinuing \nrelationship with Pakistan saying that bilateral ties \"must be made to work over time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the start of June 2011, a United States missile strike appeared to have killed one of the most \nnotorious leaders of the terror enclave, al Qaida, in in Pakistan.  Several other people were killed in the strike in the \ntribal region of South Waziristan. While Pakistani authorities expressed confidence that the United States strike had \nreached its intended target, the death of Ilyas Kashmiri remained cloaked in a minor amount of doubt due to the fact \nthat the drone strike made it impossible for a body to be retrieved. Still, there were hopes that some DNA or \nphotographic evidence might provide confirmation.  To that end, as reported by the BBC, a photograph of what was \nidentified as Kashmiri's body was released by a militant group, Harakat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, while faxed statements \nconfirming Kashmiri's death were sent to Pakistani journalists.  The statement by the group's infamous \"313 \nBrigade,\" noted that Kashmiri was martyred and promised that revege attacks would rain down on the United \nStates.\n\nAccording to United States officials,  Kashmiri was al-Qaida's military operations chief in Pakistan, and has been \nlinked with the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai (India); he was also suspected of orchestrating terror plots against \nWestern interests, even being named a defendant in the plot to attack a Danish newspaper that entered the public \npurview years earlier when it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nOn Aug. 27, 2011, it was reported that Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, the suspected operations chief of the Jihadist \nIslamist terror enclave, al-Qaida, was killed in Pakistan.  According to international news media,  Atiyah Abd al-\nRahman actually died days earlier on Aug. 22, 2011, in the volatile Pakistani tribal region of Waziristan.  The actual \ncircumstances of his death were not immediately publicized by either Pakistani or United States authorities. \nHowever, the New York Times was soon reporting that Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was apparently killed in a drone \nattack by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States.  It should be noted that such drone attacks have \nbeen the preferred mode of the Obama administration in the United States in going after al-Qaida operatives.\n\nSenior United States officials were asserting that the death of Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was a clear blow to al-Qaida \nsince he had played an integral role in the orchestration and activation of terrorist activities of al-Qaida. The many \ndocuments discovered at the Pakistan compound  of now-deceased al-Qaida overlord and mastermind, Osama Bin \nLaden, clearly showed that Atiyah Abd al-Rahman had been deeply involved in al-Qaida's operations over the \nyears.\n\n\n\nIndeed, he was believed to have brokered the alliance with the Algerian Salafists who morphed into al-Qaida in the \nIslamic Maghreb. Moreover, since the elimination of Bin Laden by United States special forces, Atiyah Abd al-\nRahman had been playing a key support role to the new al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nA week after the elimination of  Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, news reports emerged that another major al-Qaida figure \nhad been detained along with two accomplices. Younis al-Mauritani was  apparently arrested along with two aides, \nAbdul Ghaffar al-Shami and Messara al-Shami, in the suburbs of the Pakistani city of Quetta.\n\nAccording to Pakistani authorities, Younis al-Mauritani was a significant player in al-Qaida's terror plots and \nreportedly orchestrated international operations.  A statement released by Pakistani authorities read as follows: \n\"Mauritani was tasked personally by Osama Bin Laden to focus on hitting targets of economical importance in \nUnited States of America, Europe and Australia.\"\n\nThe arrests of Mauritani and the other two individuals were the result of a joint operation between  the intelligence \nagencies of Pakistan and the United States.\n\nThe  news suggested somewhat improved relations between the  two countries  in the aftermath of the raid on the \nBin Laden compound in Abbottabad months earlier.  At the time, the United States looked with suspicion on \nPakistani intelligence since the world's most notoriousterrorist was living in relative luxury in a fortified compound \nclose to the Pakistani military.  But on the other side of the equation, Pakistan was angered over the invasion of its \nsovereignty by the United States in carrying out that operation.  The successful conclusion to this joint operation \n(with Mauritani as the target) was being hailed as a small step in a more positive direction for already-damaged \nUnited States-Pakistani bilateral relations.\n\nIn mid-September 2011,  a senior al-Qaida leader, Abu Hafs al-Shahri, was killed in Pakistan.  According to United \nStates officials, Shahri played a \"key operational and administrative role\" in al-Qaida and worked cooperatively with \nthe Taliban to execute  attacks in Pakistan.  They further noted that Shahri was killed in the Waziristan tribal region \n-- an area where American drone strikes against Islamic militants has been prevalent.  Only weeks earlier, Atiyah \nAbd al-Rahman, the suspected operations chief of  al-Qaida, was killed in the same volatile tribal region of \nWaziristan as a result of an apparent CIA drone strike.\n\nIt should be noted that such drone attacks have been the preferred mode of the Obama administration in the \nUnited States in going after al-Qaida operatives. In the case of the elimination of Shahri,  United States officials \nasserted that \"a key threat inside Pakistan\" had been removed.  They further noted that the death of Shahri would \n\"further degrade al-Qaida's ability to recover\" from the death of Abd al-Rahman, since he had been viewed as a \npossible successor to the dead al-Qaida operations chief.\n\nSpecial Report: U.S. Policy on Afghanistan\n\nU.S. President Obama unveils withdrawal plan for troops serving in Afghanistan\n\nSummary\n\nThis Special Report  details the  withdrawal and exit strategy plan for United States troops from Afghanistan. The \nSpecial Report includes an inquiry into counter-insurgency strategy for fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida. The report \nadditionally considers accusations of the Pakistani intelligence agency's complicity with the Afghan Taliban. Also \nconsidered in this report are the politically-driven financial constraints at home in the United States related to the \nfunding of the war effort. These issues collectively have influenced emerging questions about the United States' \npolicy in Afghanistan and the  timeline for continued engagement there.  Finally, this report looks at the \nAfghanistan exit strategy as a jumping off point to consider the Obama doctrine of foreign policy.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago in June 2010, United States President Barack Obama announced that General Stanley \nMcChrystal, the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan, was relieved of his duties. The president also \nannounced the nomination of General David Petraeus, commander of United States Central Command, to take \nover command of the war in Afghanistan against the resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida. President Obama explained \nthat he had decided to replace Gen McChrystal \"with considerable regret.\" The president explained that McChrystal \nfailed to \"meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general.\" At issue were controversial statements \nby McCrystal that were recorded in a recent Rolling Stone article. The politics of the situation demanded that \nPresident Obama dismiss McChrystal, or, risk being viewed as a weak commander in chief. A week after the \nannouncement about the dismissal of McChrystal, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed  as the new commander of \nthe Afghanistan war with a vote of  99-0 in the Senate. Petraeus, as expected,  garnered  praise from both \nRepublicans and Democrats, irrespective of their core disagreements on the policy toward Afghanistan.  Indeed, \nPetraeus was known as a celebrated military figure, thanks to his stewardship of the \"surge\" in Iraq, as well as his  \nnotoriety as one of the key authors of United States modern counterinsurgency strategy in war zones.\n\nDuring confirmation hearings, Petraeus painted a grim picture of the war effort in Afghanistan, noting that an \n\"industrial-strength insurgency\" by the Taliban and al-Qaida elements were in the offing.  As well, Petraeus warned \nthat the fighting and violence would \"get more intense in the next few months.\"  That being said, he indicated that it \nwas part of the counterinsurgency process. He said, \"My sense is that the tough fighting will continue; indeed, it \nmay get more intense in the next few months. As we take away the enemy's safe havens and reduce the enemy's \nfreedom of action, the insurgents will fight back.\"  Additionally, Petraeus did not foreclose the possibility of \nrecommending that President Barack Obama extend United States' troops engagement in Afghanistan beyond the \nAugust 2011 timeline to begin redeployment.\n\nCosts and complications of counterinsurgency strategy and human terrain units --\n\nIt should be noted that the Afghan war strategy -- to fight resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida, improve security in \nAfghanistan, and develop governing stability in that country as an alternative to a culture of warfare -- is founded on \nthe principles of counterinsurgency (COIN). The long-term objectives of COIN entail not only the clearing the field of \ninsurgents by the military, but also political imperative of replacing the insurgent power base with more stable \ngovernance. Effective counterinsurgency strategies, therefore, require close collaboration of the military, political, \neconomic and diplomatic spheres in the conflict zone.  While a respected strategy, with an exit timeline expected to \nbe completed in 2014, there has been increased skepticism about the ongoing involvement in Afghanistan as the \nwar has gone on for a decade.\n\nOne particularly key reason for a sense of skepticism about the war strategy and its associated timeline were  \nmatters of financial costs of the war, and the  timeline attached to the Afghanistan strategy. That is to say, when \nPresident Obama first outlined his plan to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, he also noted that the \nUnited States would begin a redeployment of those troops by 2011. With debt worries prevalent in the United States \nand other NATO countries (as discussed below), questions arose as to whether or not the continued war effort in \nAfghanistan was a financially feasible endeavor. That is to say, the war and counterinsurgency mission requires a \nsubstantial outlay of resources that few governments (including the United States) could realistically commit to for \nthe long term.\n\nComplicating matters further has been the rising death toll of NATO forces in a war that has continued for close to a \ndecade. That increased death toll has contributed to decreasing support for the Afghanistan war effort.\n\nMoreover, analysts have pointed to the fact that COIN involves the idea of clearing the landscape of insurgents, \nfollowed by the establishment of a government as an alternative to the war culture. But clearance in one area often \nresults in the relocation of the terrorists elsewhere and a perpetual pursuit of the strategic enemy. Meanwhile, the \nestablishment of more stable governance, which has seen some success in the more politically mature Iraq, cannot \neasily be transposed to the largely tribal cultural orientation of Afghanistan, which does not have a strong legacy of \ngovernmental authority.\n\n\n\nWith an eye on understanding that tribal cultural orientation of Afghanistan, the United States military has employed \nanthropologists in the war zone to garner a more granular understanding of the complicated social and cultural \ndynamics of Afghanistan. Anthropologists' command of ethnographic fieldwork may be uniquely positioned  to map \nthe complex social structure of the company, ultimately helping the military to draw Afghans away from the Taliban.\n\nKnown as the army-funded \"Human Terrain System,\" as discussed in an article published in Time Magazine by \nJason Motlagh, the idea has been the source of debate with no consensus on its success.  Academia has frowned \non anthropologists being actively involved in the war theater.  As noted in a report by the American Anthropological \nAssociation, because human terrain teams are ultimately oriented toward the objectives of the military mission, \nthere is an ethical question of whether such work is \"a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.\" \nNevertheless, General Petraeus has been reported to be a strong supporter of the human terrain teams, suggesting \nthat they would for the immediate future continue to be part of the broader counterinsurgency strategy.\n\nThat being said, most anthropologists would agree that more than a year of intensive fieldwork is needed before \nconclusions can be made; thus, the success of human terrain units in Afghanistan would require a longer timeline \nthan currently expected for United States forces to remain \"in country.\"\n\nFinancial Cost of the War in Afghanistan --\n\nIn late June 2010, legislators in the United States voted to cut almost $4 billion in aid to the government of \nAfghanistan.  The move was in response to  allegations of corruption  by the Afghan government, and in the \naftermath of a report by the Wall Street Journal that significant funds had been flown out of the airport at Kabul. The \nreport alleged that Afghan officials and their allies were diverting  funds earmarked for aid and logistics to financial \nsafe havens outside the country.\n\nExplaining the Congress' decision to make these cuts, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the chair of the subcommittee \nresponsible for aid appropriations, said, \"I do not intend to appropriate one more dime  until I have confidence that \nUS taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords and \nterrorists.\"  Lowey additionally called for an audit of the billions of dollars already expended in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the funding cuts would not directly affect military operations of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, it could very \nwell affect  infrastructure projects, which are part of the nation building efforts in Afghanistan.  To this end, \nCongressman Mark Kirk, made note of  Kandahar's electrical system; he said  that obstacles to its construction, and \nother such infrastructure projects,  could negatively affect the war, which included the effort to win the hearts and \nminds of the Afghan people.\n\nThe issue has evoked questions about the financial costs of the war at large  at a time when  debt worries plague \nnot only the United States, but also allied countries with troops operating in Afghanistan, as discussed in the section \nabove.\n\nAs NATO countries, including the United States, have been forced to consider austerity measures at home, the \nfinancial costs of the war in Afghanistan have taken on added importance.  In fact, that significance was apparent \non July 1, 2010, when President Barack Obama requested  $33 billion in military funding to support the surge of \n30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan's complicity with Afghan Taliban raises questions about U.S. strategy in region --\n\nSince June 2010, Afghanistan's  geopolitical relationship with Pakistan has taken center stage.  At issue were \nrevelations that the Pakistani intelligence service, known by the acronym ISI, has been funding, training, and \nproviding sanctuary to the Afghan Taliban.  For several years, there have been suspicions about such a clandestine \nrelationship between the two entities, however, the closeness and extensive nature of their ties was something of a \nrevelation.  Indeed, in a report issued by the London School of Economics support for the Afghan Taliban was \ndescribed as \"official ISI policy.\"\n\n\n\nAs noted by the author of the report, Matt Waldman of Harvard University,  \"This goes far beyond just limited, or \noccasional support. This is very significant levels of support being provided by the ISI.\" Waldman also asserted, \n\"We're also saying this is official policy of that agency, and we're saying that it is very extensive. It is both at an \noperational level, and at a strategic level, right at the senior leadership of the Taliban movement.\"\n\nThe report also included references to interviews with Taliban field commanders who said that ISI agents attended \nTaliban council meetings.  Shoring up the veracity of this claim was the following citation from the report: \"These \naccounts were corroborated by former Taliban ministers, a Western analyst, and a senior United Nations official \nbased in Kabul, who said the Taliban largely depend on funding from the ISI and groups in Gulf countries.\"  \nCorroborating evidence was also available from a source unrelated to the LSE report.  In an interview with Reuters, \nthe head of Afghan intelligence, Amrullah Saleh, who had just resigned from that position, said the ISI was \"part of \nthe landscape of destruction\" in Afghanistan and accused Pakistan of sheltering Taliban leaders in safe houses.\n\nSome observers have noted that with the impending exit of foreign troops from Afghanistan expected in 2011, \nPakistan's actions may be related to its desire to more deeply influence Afghanistan.  However, ISI activities related \nto Islamic militant extremists are not recent developments in response to the current landscape.  Indeed, the ISI has \nbeen accused of funding and training Islamic militant extremists in Afghanistan from as far back as the 1979 Soviet \ninvasion.  That being said, since the 2001 terror attacks in the United States, Pakistan has accepted billions of \ndollars in aid funding from the United States, supposedly for its support in the fight against terror enclaves like al-\nQaida and its Taliban allies.  Clearly, a continued relationship between the Pakistani ISI and the Afghan Taliban \nwould run counter to its expressed objectives of helping the United States quell the threat of terrorism emanating \nfrom such entities in the Afghan-Pak region.  As stated in the LSE report, \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-\ngame of astonishing magnitude.\"\n\nDevelopments in 2010 on the war in Afghanistan --\n\nIn July 2010, the Iceland-based website, known as Wikileaks, released six years worth of classified United States \ndocuments, numbering around 90,000, dealing with the war in Afghanistan. Several news organizations were given \naccess to the documents prior to actual publication, although United States authorities have argued that the \ndissemination of classified information was a threat to national security, an act of gross irresponsibility, and quite \npossibly, imbued with illegality. From Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai charged that the release of Wikileaks \ndocuments have endangered the lives of Afghan citizens who worked with NATO-led international forces. The \nAfghan leader said that the disclosure of the names of Afghans who cooperated with the NATO-led forces was \n\"shocking\" and \"irresponsible.\" For its part, Wikileaks has defended the release of the documents, noting that it \npresented an unvarnished view of the war in Afghanistan since 2004.\n\nRegardless of these competing views, the contents of the controversial documents have spurred debate about the \nUnited States' role in the war in Afghanistan, as well as the conduct of the war itself. To these ends, two Wikileaks \nrevelations could raise questions about the Obama administration's broader \"Afghan-Pak\" strategy, which considers \nnot only \"ground zero\" of the war effort -- Afghanistan -- but also Pakistan next door. While the strategy \nappropriately focuses on the region instead of one country, taking into consideration shared extremist Islamic \ninfluences, shared Pashtun culture, and a landscape on the borderland that is a stronghold for Taliban and al-\nQaida, two Wikileaks revelations strong doubts on the effectiveness of the strategy.\n\nFirstly, according to the document review by the New York Times, even as Pakistan receives funds from the United \nStates to help combat Islamic extremists militants and the threat of terrorism, the Pakistani Inter-Services \nIntelligence (ISI) was said to be helping the Taliban, even collaborating with them on terror attacks and \nassassination plots.\n\nSecondly, the tactic of using drone attacks in the tribal border regions has been lauded by the Obama \nadministration as a means of crushing the enemy and eliminating high value Taliban and al-Qaida targets. \nHowever, according to the review by Der Spiegel, 38 Predator and Reaper drones crashed while on combat \nmissions in Afghanistan and Iraq, requiring \"elaborate -- and dangerous -- salvage operations.\" On the ground, \"in \ncountry,\" there are additional worries about the political costs of the civilian casualties caused by drone attacks.\n\n\n\nThe civilian costs provide a transition to discuss a third issue revealed by Wikileaks. According to the review by \nMarc Ambinder of The Atlantic, there were \"at least 144 separate incidents\" of civilian casualties that led to \"cover-\nups.\" Ambinder particularly took note of the unsuccessful attempt to kill Abu Layth Ali Libi, which resulted in the \ndeaths of several civilians and that resulted in a \"cover-up\" by Afghan officials.\n\nAnalysis of Afghan Strategy by late 2010 --\n\nTaken together, these issues both inform and fuel emerging questions about a timeline for continued engagement \nin Afghanistan. Indeed, these factors  -- from financial costs to the strategic considerations -- have contributed to \nrising emphasis on a \"date certain\" exit from Afghanistan, starting in 2011 and to end in 2014. Of course, on the \nother side of the equation, counterinsurgency advocates have argued that the objectives of the mission could \nrequire an extended timeline.\n\nThere were also been emerging questions about the precise nature of that policy itself, which have only been \nintensified with the Wikileaks revelations.  Indeed, can counterinsurgency succeed in Afghanistan?  If so, what are \nthe benchmarks for success?  Can the United States and its allies afford to fund the mission, given the demands on \nthe domestic front?  And is Pakistan -- an apparent ally -- actually undermining the effort to succeed in Afghanistan?\n\nNote that in late 2010,  NATO announced its plans to exit Afghanistan and transfer control over the anti-Taliban \nstruggle to Afghan forces by the close of 2014.  Afghan  President Karzai formalized the agreement  by signing a \nlong-term security partnership with NATO.  At the heart of the matter was NATO's contention that the Taliban not be \nallowed to simply wait out the presence of foreign forces.  As stated by NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh \nRasmussen, the security bloc would remain committed to security  and stability of Afghanistan. He said, \"One thing \nmust be very clear - NATO is in this for the long term.\" The NATO head then continued, \"If the enemies of \nAfghanistan have the idea that they can wait it out until we leave, they have the wrong idea. We will stay as long as \nit takes to finish our job.\"  For his part, Afghan President Karzai expressed gratitude for NATO's contributions to his \ncountry's interest but stated, \"I also informed them of the concerns of the Afghan people with regard to civilian \ncasualties, with regard to detentions, with regard to, at times, NATO's posture.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this decision by NATO did not necessarily coincide with an official decision by the United \nStates on the duration of combat operations by its forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOn that latter consideration, there was some indication of the direction of the United States in December 2010 when \na much-anticipated report dealing with United States President Barack Obama's strategy for the war in Afghanistan \nsurfaced in the public purview. That report concluded that United States forces were on track to begin their \nwithdrawal from Afghanistan in July 2011, as scheduled in the United States' president's war plan. This conclusion \nwas reached despite the fact there were mixed reports of success in the field. On that matter, the summary of the \nreport said that the United States forces continued to pursue and eliminate al-Qaida leadership figures, was \nsuccessful in reducing the terror enclave's ability to carry out attacks from the Afghan-Pak region, and had halted \nthe progress of the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the summary noted that those gains were \ntenuous and could well be reversed in the future.\n\nJune 2011 Update: President Obama unveils Afghan exit strategy\n\nOn June 22, 2011, President Barack Obama was scheduled to unveil his exit strategy from Afghanistan.  At issue \nwas the number of United States troops expected to leave Afghanistan and the associated pace of withdrawal from \nthat country.\n\nAhead of the president's much-anticipated address regarding the Afghanistan exit strategy, speculation abounded \nabout whether or not the more hawkish advisers in government would prevail, and only a nominal number of troops \nwould be withdrawn, along with a vague exit date.  They pointed to the need for enough forces on the ground as the \nregion entered its summer fighting season. As well, many military commanders  argued that a premature withdrawal \nwould result in a reversal of the fragile military gains made against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nAmong these elements advocating only a modest \"draw down\" of forces, and at a slow place of withdrawal,  were \noutgoing Defense Secretary William Gates and the United States commander in Afghanistan, General David \nPetraeus, who was expected to soon come home to the United States to take the position of the head of the Central \nIntelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nOutgoing CIA director, Leon Panetta, was to take on the defense portfolio in the wake of Gates; it was not known if \nthis shift in personnel was imbued with a hint of a shift in strategy.\n\nAt the other end of the philosophical spectrum was a cadre of advisers who were against the initial surge strategy in \nAfghanistan,  favoring instead targeted attacks in the Afghan-Pak region.  This camp, led by vice President Joseph \nBiden,  has been lobbying for a significant \"draw down\" of the troops  from Afghanistan as early as mid-2011, with a \nsteady ongoing withdrawal from that point, culminating in a date-certain exit, preferably by a 2014 deadline.\n\nThe Biden-led camp has argued that the security gains in Afghanistan to date,  in combination with the disruption of \nthe al-Qaida network in that country, and the death of Osama bin Laden in neighboring Pakistan at the hands of \nUnited States special forces in May 2011, collectively pave the way for the United States to declare victory and \nbegin the process of ending the war.\n\nIt should be noted that the American citizenry was war-weary after a decade of combat operations across the \nworld.  Indeed, a recent survey by the Pew Institute showed that as many as 56 percent of respondents favored an \nend to the war in Afghanistan as soon as possible.  Even outgoing Defense Secretary Gates, who has stood on the \nside of the generals in favoring only a modest withdrawal of Afghanistan, was cognizant of the public support \nconundrum.\n\nTo that end, Gates acknowledged during a new conference to the State Department that  President Obama would \nhave to consider the concerns of the American people in his decision regarding the war in Afghanistan. Gate said, \n\"It goes without saying that there are a lot of reservations in the Congress about the war in Afghanistan and our \nlevel of commitment. There are concerns among the American people who are tired of a decade of war.\"\n\nThe United States Congress was itself growing increasingly anxious about the costs of constant warfare at a time \nwhen debt concerns dominated the domestic political spectrum.  A bipartisan group of United States senators  \ndispatched a letter to President Obama calling for a shift in the Afghanistan war strategy and advocating a \nsubstantial withdrawal of United States troops from that country.  The letter included the following statement: \"Given \nour successes, it is the right moment to initiate a sizable and sustained reduction in forces, with the goal of steadily \nredeploying all regular combat troops. The costs of prolonging the war far outweigh the benefits.\"\n\nThat being said, there was an equally vocal coterie of senators expressing the opposite view, urging instead that \nthe president heed the generals and hold steady in Afghanistan. Of note was Senator John McCain, a Republican \nfrom Arizona  who was President Obama's rival in the 2008 presidential election.  McCain said during an interview \nwith ABC News' \"Good Morning America,\" that his views lined up with Gates in calling for only a modest \"draw \ndown\" since  he did not want to see a reversal of the fragile gains already made.  McCain also suggested that a \ncontinued full throttle effort could potentially end in success saying, \"I believe that one more fighting season and we \ncan get this thing pretty well wrapped up.\"\n\nAhead of the June 22, 2011 national address, White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, confirmed that President \nObama had made a decision on the withdrawal plan and was in the process of informing the national security \nteam.  Without disclosing the details, Carney noted that the the \"draw down\" of the troops would commence in July \n2011, on a phased basis, with a complete withdrawal by 2014.  While the president himself has been on the record \nsaying that he would favor a \"significant\" withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan, the actual meaning \nof the term \"significant\" was yet a matter of interpretation.\n\nTo be clear, since coming to office, President Obama tripled the number of United States forces operating in \nAfghanistan, for a total of about 100,000 troops \"in country.\"  Included in this 100,000 number were the 30,000 \n\n\n\ntroops that were added as part of the \"surge\" aimed at providing reinforcements in the mission to  reverse the \nTaliban's battlefield momentum. At the time, President Obama had said that he would begin to redeploy United \nStates forces in mid-July 2011.  Carney's aforementioned statement indicated that the president intended to abide \nwith the promised timeline; the main question rested on the number of troops to be withdrawn along with the actual \npace.\n\nOn June 22, 2011, in keeping with his pledge made in late 2009, President Obama unveiled a plan to redeploy \nUnited States troops from Afghanistan and effectively end its commitments in that country that had now lasted a \ndecade. Explaining that al-Qaida was under pressure, with as much as half of the al-Qaida leadership, including Bin \nLaden killed,  and serious losses inflicted upon the Taliban, the United States was well-positioned to begin to close \nout the war in Afghanistan.\n\nTo that end, President Obama ordered the withdrawal of 10,000 United States troops from Afghanistan in 2011, \nwith  another 23,000 troops to be redeployed the following year.  This \"draw down\" of 33,000 United States forces \nfrom Afghanistan would essentially end the aforementioned surge by the summer of 2012.  Remaining \"in country\" \nwould be the rest of the troops -- about 67,000 in total --  which would themselves undergo a steady pace of phased \nwithdrawal to end by a final deadline of 2014. It was expected that commanders on the ground in Afghanistan would \nbe given the autonomy to sort out  the \"battlefield geometry\" and decide on  what types of troops would be needed \nin certain capacities from special forces, to trainers, intelligence officers, and combat troops.\n\nPresident Obama explained that the withdrawal plan would take time, saying, \"This is the beginning -- but not the \nend -- of our effort to wind down this war.\"  That being said, President Obama told the American people that they \nshould take comfort in knowing that the tide of war was receding. To that end, he noted that combat operations \nwere over in Iraq, and \"light was to be seen in distance\" in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to the president, the specific mission in Afghanistan going forward was to be: \"No safe-haven from which \nal-Qaida or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland, or our allies. We will not try to make Afghanistan \na perfect place. We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. That is the responsibility of the \nAfghan government, which must step up its ability to protect its people.\"\n\nIn this way, the president was  not only putting the Afghan authorities on notice that they had to take responsibility \nfor their own country, he was simultaneously emphasizing a circumscribed  role for the United States in \nAfghanistan.  With an eye on handing over security control in Afghanistan, President Obama announced that the \nUnited States would play host to a summit in 2012, which would include NATO allies, and would focus on \ntransitioning Afghanistan to a new future. The president noted that a peaceful future for Afghanistan would entail a \npolitical solution and accordingly, the United States  would \"join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, \nincluding the Taliban.\"  In this way, the president --  for the first time -- appeared to back the notion of talks with the \nTaliban, pending that group's renunciation of violence and separation from al-Qaida.\n\nAll told, the new mission would transition from that of comprehensive counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy to a \nfocused and targeted counter-terrorism strategy, aimed at capturing and killing terrorists and insurgents.  There \nwould also be a clear \"date-certain\" exit deadline. Borrowing from the experience in Iraq, the Obama administration \nbelieved that it was vital that the Afghan government be pressured towards taking full responsibility for the country's \nsecurity, and the United States Congress needed to have clear targets to be used as mileposts for evaluation.\n\nThis plan would fall within the parameters of the Biden camp as the troop reductions were deeper than initially \nanticipated; it also included a faster redeployment schedule than recommended by the military advisers. According \nto the New York Times, the plan was a validation of Vice President Biden's position.  As expected, the plan was not \neasily endorsed by General Petraeus, who wanted to see United States forces remain in place for a longer time \nhorizon.  The president was expected to draw attention to the success of a more limited counter-terrorism strategy, \nas exemplified by the capture and killing of Bin Laden.\n\nAt a broader level, President Obama used the exit strategy from Afghanistan to craft his own vision of United States \nforeign policy.  Indeed, the president said that while the United States would not retreat from its role as a global \npower, the country had to chart a new pragmatic and strategic course as regards international engagement.  \n\n\n\nPresident Obama said, \"Already this decade of war has caused many to question the nature of America's \nengagement around the world. Some would have America retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global \nsecurity, and embrace an isolation that ignores the very real threats that we face. Others would have America over-\nextend ourselves, confronting every evil that can be found abroad.\"\n\nRather than selecting from this dyad, President Obama opted for a third way, which he characterized as \"a more \ncentered course.\"  He said, \"Like generations before, we must embrace America's singular role in the course of \nhuman events. But we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute. When \nthreatened, we must respond with force \u2013- but when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies \noverseas. When innocents are being slaughtered and global security endangered, we don't have to choose \nbetween standing idly by or acting on our own. Instead, we must rally international action, which we are doing in \nLibya, where we do not have a single soldier on the ground, but are supporting allies in protecting the Libyan people \nand giving them the chance to determine their destiny.\"\n\nIn this one paragraph, one finds something of an Obama doctrine that embraces: (1) strategic pragmatism, reliant \nmore on intelligence and targeted operations than excessive boots on the ground, (2) multilateralism, in which an \nengaged United States of America works within an international framework to solve global problems; and (3) fidelity \nto democratic ideals, in which the United States would support self-determination of freedom-seeking people, while \neschewing the notion of American hegemony and empire.\n\nPresident Obama ended his address to the nation by stating that the time had come for the United States to \nconcentrate on nation building in the domestic sphere, emphasizing that the costs of war had been high, and the \ntime had come to focus on the plight of the American people at home.  Clearly,  the president was responding to the \npolitical climate at home, which was growing increasingly frustrated with economic strife at home and its \nconcomitant link to the heavy price tag of war abroad.\n\nReaction --\n\nPresident Obama's plan found conflicting resonance among political quarters.  Liberal members of the president's \nDemocratic Party, such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were pleased that the war was finally ending, but \ndisappointed that the process would not be immediate.  She said,  \"Tonight, President Obama made it clear: we are \nnow beginning the process of bringing our troops home and ending the war in Afghanistan. It has been the hope of \nmany in Congress and across the country that the fulldraw-down of U.S. forces would happen sooner than the \nPresident laid out \u2013 and we will continue to press for a better outcome.\" There was something of a Republican \nsplit.  House Speaker John Boehner warned that Congress would pressure the Obama administration against  a \nwithdrawal, if there was a security risk.  He said, \"It is my hope that the President will continue to listen to our \ncommanders on the ground as we move forward.  Congress will hold the Administration accountable for ensuring \nthat the pace and scope of thedraw-down does not undermine the progress we' ve made thus far.\" A potential 2012 \nObama rival  for the presidency, Mitt Romney, expressed displeasure with the president's \"date certain\" exit \nschedule saying, \"We all want our troops to come home as soon as possible, but we shouldn't adhere to an \narbitrary timetable on the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan.\"\n\nUpdate --\n\nOn Aug. 7, 2011, an apparent rocket-propelled grenade attack by the Taliban on a Chinook helicopter in \nAfghanistan, left  30 United States troops and eight Afghan commandos dead.  Several of the American troops who \ndied in the incident were members of the vaunted elite Seal Team Six, which carried out  the raid into Pakistan, \nwhich eliminated  al-Qaida leader, Osama Bin Laden.  United States authorities said that the attack did not \ndemonstrate gains for the Taliban and would not affect ongoing policy on Afghanistan.\n\nOn Sept. 10, 2011, a suicide truck bomb targeted United states troops at a  a military base in the eastern Wardak \nprovince of Afghanistan.  Two Afghan civilians died as a result of the attack, while 80 United States troops were \n\n\n\ninjured. The day also saw a United States base in Bagram attacked by rockets.  Both  attacks coincided with the \n10th anniversary of the  terror attacks by  al-Qaida in the United States a decade earlier on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe Taliban  quickly claimed responsibility and said that they were seeking revenge for the continued presence of \nUnited States troops in Afghanistan.  Indeed, the Taliban accused the United States of using the Sept. 11, 2001 \nattacks as justification for invading Afghanistan. Of course, it was those terror attacks, and the  alliance between \nthe Afghanistan-based Taliban and al-Qaida, which had spurred the war in Afghanistan.\n\nOusted from power as a result of the war in Afghanistan, the Taliban has been carrying out an insurgency for years, \naimed at repelling international forces and ending  rule by the new government.\n\nFor their part, United States forces have stayed in Afghanistan to fight the resurgent Taliban despite decreased \npopularity among both Afghans and Americans for the long-running war.  Speaking to this issue, United States \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker  said the United States troops needed to remain in Afghanistan to prevent extremists \nfrom using Afghan territory to plan another catastrophic terror attack.  In an interview with Agence France Presse, \nhe said,  \"We're here so there is never again another 9/11 coming from Afghanistan's soil.\"  \n\nWhile these attacks were also linked with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United \nStates, according to NATO, they were also aimed at derailing the effort to handover security to Afghan-led forces \nduring a phased withdrawal schedule beginning in the next year.  Indeed, 2011 has seen the most bloodshed in \nAfghanistan since December 2011 when United States-led forces toppled the rule of the Taliban in that country.  \nNevertheless, NATOappeared undeterred by this latest bout of violence and asserted its intent to stay the course.  \nAs noted by  NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, \"We have confidence in the Afghan authorities' \nability to deal with this situation. Transition is on track and it will continue.\"\n\nIslamic militants carried out a complicated  siege of the Kabul -- the capital of neighboring Afghanistan -- on Sept. \n13, 2011.  Particular targets of the siege included the United States embassy, NATO headquarters, and police \nstations in Kabul.\n\nAlthough suspicion immediately fell on the Taliban, it soon shifted.\n\nUnited States Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, said  that it was the Pakistan-based Haqqani network  \nthat had orchestrated the siege of Kabul.  Of course, the Haqqani network has been closely allied with the Taliban \nand al-Qaida both in terms of extremist Islamic ideology and in terms of its brutal use of terrorism.  Subsequently, \nCameron Munter, the United States ambassador to Pakistan asserted that there were links between the Haqqani \nnetwork and the Pakistani government.  During an interview with Radio Pakistan, Ambassador Munter said that \nthere was evidence linking the Haqqani militant network to Pakistan's government. \"The attack that took place in \nKabul a few days ago was the work of the Haqqani network, and the fact that, as we have said in the past, that \nthere are problems, there is evidence linking the Haqqani network to the Pakistan government, this is something \nthat must stop,\" said  Munter.  Soon thereafter, outgoing United States chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \nMike Mullen, suggested that the Pakistan's intelligence agency helped the terrorist who attacked his country's \nembassy in Kabul, according to a report by the New York Times.\n\nAlready, the United States government warned that if Pakistani authorities failed to take action against the Pakistan-\nbased Haqqani network for its attack on the United States embassy and NATO headquarters in Kabul, then it \nwould retaliate. For its part, Pakistani authorities have continued to deny any connection to  militant groups, the \nmanifold evidence linking Pakistani intelligence to the Taliban notwithstanding.\n\nMeanwhile, Ambassador Crocker asserted that the plague of violence in Afghanistan ten years after the 2001 terror \nattacks in the United States, which spurred the war in Afghanistan, would not change his country's plans.  Earlier, \nin the aftermath of the attack by the Taliban on United Stated bases in Afghanistan, Crocker  said the United States \n\n\n\ntroops needed to remain in Afghanistan to prevent extremists from using Afghan territory to plan another \ncatastrophic terror attack.  But Crocker on Sept. 14, 2011 was also adamant about the fact that the actions of \nmilitant extremists would not deter the United States from its transition schedule -- including the transfer of security \nduties from coalition forces to Afghan forces, and the phased exit of United States troops from Afghanistan.\n\nNote: Of the 100,000 United States troops in Afghanistan, about 33,000 were due to be redeployed in 2012.  A full \nwithdrawal of foreign combat troops was scheduled to take place in 2014.\n\nOther Foreign Policy Developments\n\nTalks between United States and North Korea deemed \"constructive\"\n\nIn late July 2011, even as domestic politics in the United States were mired in chaos over the debt ceiling and \nconcomitant default, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North \nKorea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye \nGwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the \nObama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, \"Yesterday and today \nwe discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and \nbusinesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.\"  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, \"These discussions \nare designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward \ndenuclearization.\" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral \ndenuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations \nwith  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to \nconsider how to proceed further with North Korea.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nDrone strike kills al-Qaida in Yemen terrorist orchestrator, U.S.-born al-Alwaki.\n\nAt the close of September 2011, it was reported in the international media that a  United States drone strike had \nkilled Anwar al-Alwaki -- a United States-born terrorist orchestrator and propaganda communicator for al-Qaida in \nthe Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  The  Yemeni Defense Ministry confirmed the deaths of Alwaki  and a number of his \nassociates in the Yemeni province of Jawf.\n\nAs an English-speaking United States citizen, Alwaki used his command of language and biculturalism, along with \nmodern media, to reach out to young Muslims in across the world with the objective of radicalizing them and urging \nthem to turn to terrorism. He was also believed to have been responsible for orchestrating a number of attempted \nattacks, including the recruitment of infamous Nigerian \"underwear\"  bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who \ntried but failed to blow up  a United States-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. Alwaki was also blamed for \ninspiring United States Major Nidal Malik Hasan to carry out a 2009 attack on an army base in Texas that left more \nthat a dozen people dead.  He was additionally linked with the  failed bombing in New York's Times Square in 2010.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama hailed the death of Awlaki in Yemen as a \"major blow\" to the terror enslave, \nal-Qaida.  President Obama said that the AQAP figure was instrumental in the \"planning and directing efforts to \nmurder innocent Americans\" and was  \"directly responsible for the death of many Yemeni citizens.\"\n\nPresident Obama also used the occasion to emphasize the United States' commitment to fighting terrorism. He \nsaid, \"This is further proof that al-Qaida and  its affiliates will find no safe haven anywhere in the world.\"\n\nAt home in the United States, there were some challenges to the legitimacy of eliminating a United States citizen \nwithout a trial.  That being said, the United States government could well argue that it was operating within legal \n\n\n\nbounds by targeting an enemy of the state, and a leader of a terror enclave that had declared war on the United \nStates.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nU.S uncovers plot by Iranian agents to assassinate Saudi envoy and bomb Saudi and Israeli embassies\n\nSummary:\n\nU.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies uncovered a conspiracy plot by Iranian agents working on behalf of \nthe elite Iranian Quds Force. The plot included plans to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United \nStates, and to bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington D.C. and Buenos Aires. The White House has \npromised to hold Tehran responsibility for its involvement in this elaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  \nMeanwhile, a connection between the Iranian agents and Mexican drug cartels has been uncovered, effectively \ncomplicating the already-tangled web of complex geopolitics.  The U.S. wasted no time in attempting in leveraging \nthese allegations to isolate Iran and place pressure on that country's nucleardevelopment program.\n\nIn detail:\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies in the United States have reportedly uncovered and \nfoiled a plot by Iranian agents to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, and to \nbomb the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Israel in Washington D.C. United States officials indicated there were \ndiscussions about extending the bombing targets to the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Buenos Aires -- the capital \nof Argentina.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, the individuals accused of \nconspiring to carry out this plot were two men of Iranian origin -- Manssor Arbab Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri.  \nOne of the men, Arbabsiar, was a naturalized United States citizen holding passports from both the United States \nand Iran. He was arrested on Sept. 29, 2011, and was said to be in United States custody and cooperating with \nAmerican authorities.  Indeed, Arbabsiar confessed his involvement in the plot, according to media reports. The \nother man, Shakuri, was apparently still at large, presumably in Iran where he was reported to be a member of \nIran's Quds Force --  --  an elite division  of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nBoth defendants were charged with conspiracy to murder a foreign official; conspiracy to use a weapon of mass \ndestruction (explosives); and conspiracy to commit an act of international terrorism transcending national \nboundaries. Arbabsiar was further charged with an additional count of foreign travel and use of interstate and \nforeign commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. Arbabsiar was due to appear in a federal court in \nNew York; if convicted of all charges, he would face life imprisonment.\n\nIn a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said: \"The criminal complaint unsealed \ntoday exposes a deadly plot directed by factions of the Iranian government to assassinate a foreign Ambassador on \nUnited States soil with explosives.\" He continued, \"Through the diligent and coordinated efforts of our law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies, we were able to disrupt this plot before anyone was harmed.  We will \ncontinue to investigate this matter vigorously and bring those who have violated any laws to justice.\"\n\nAttorney General Holder explained that while payment for the operation had already been transferred via a New \nYork bank, the conspiracy had not yet progressed to the point of the suspects acquiring explosives for the bombing \naspect of the operation.  Attorney General Holder also confirmed reports that Arbabsiar and Shakuri were \nconnected to the Quds Force --  the elite division of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has been \naccused of being responsible for operations in other countries, and which has been a major player in Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear development program.  Attorney General Holder additionally made it clear that the plot was \n\"conceived\" in Iran by the Quds force, effectively drawing a clear  line of connection to Iran's power base.\n\n\n\nAttorney General was unrestrained in his characterization of the plot, which he said had been orchestrated from the \nspring of 2011 to October 2011.  He emphatically asserted that the conspiracy was  \"conceived, sponsored and \ndirected by Iran,\" and warned that the White House would hold Tehran accountable for it alleged involvement in an \nelaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  It should be noted that United States officials were tying the plot to \nhigh levels of the Iranian government, albeit not directly to the Iranian president or ayatollah.  It  should also be \nnoted that the United States Department of State has listed Iran as a \"state sponsor\" of terrorism since 1984; now in \n2011, this latest revelation of an international conspiracy would no doubt reify that classification.\n\nA Justice Department report detailed Arbabsiar's recruitment by senior officials in Iran's Quds Force, which \nreportedly funded and directed the elaborate assassination and terror plot. Extracts from that Justice Department \nreport also indicated that Arbabsiar had gone so far as to discuss a Washington D.C. restaurant frequented by the \nSaudi ambassador and United States senators, as a possible venue for the target of the assassination.  Those \nextracts suggested that high level Iranians were unconcerned about the additional collateral damage to American \npoliticians or civilians in carrying out such an attack.  As the trusted and long-serving envoy of Saudi Arabia's King \nAbdullah, the assassination of United States-educated Adel Al-Jubeir, along with potential deaths of United States \ncitizens, would undoubtedly cause international furor.\n\nThere was an additional international trajectory, reminiscent of a Hollywood movie script, as the Iranian agents were \ntrying to secure the assistance of Mexican drug cartels in carrying out the assassination element of the plot.  \nIndeed, Arbabsiar was arrested as he attempted to travel to Mexico to meet with a Mexican drug cartel operative, \nallegedly to move forward with this plan.  The Mexican informant was, in fact, working on behalf of the United States \nDrug Enforcement Agency.  The involvement of Iranian agents, Mexican drug cartels, and terror targets on United \nStates and Argentine soil, belonging to Israeli, and Saudi interests, effectively complicated the already-tangled web \nof complex geopolitics and international intrigue.\n\nThe mechanics of the plot notwithstanding, there would no doubt be questions about the motivation for the Iranian \nQuds Force to act against Saudi and Israeli interests on United States and Argentine soil.  Of course, Iran's \ngovernment has never restrained its expression of enmity for Israel; its antagonism towards Saudi Arabia is more \nopaque.\n\nIn fact, the Middle East has become the terrain of an ethno-sectarian power struggle between Sunni Islamic Saudi \nArabia and Shi'a Iran in regional countries with mixed and complicated demographic mixtures of Sunnis and \nShi'ites.  According to United States authorities,  Iranian-backed militias have been responsible for the upsurge in \nsectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq, where Shi'a Iran hopes to extend its influence. United States authorities \nhave also alleged that the Iranian Quds Force has been instrumental in attacking American troops in Iraq.\n\nLikewise, in Bahrain, which has a similar Shi'a-Sunni demographic composition as Iraq, and which has seen its own \nepisode of unrest in the so-called 2011 \"Arab Spring,\" Iran's desire to extend its influence was apparent.  \nSpecifically, as Saudi Arabian troops aided the Bahraini government in cracking down on the predominantly Shi'a \nopposition in Bahrain, Iran was quick to condemn the presence of foreign forces there.  The scenario was a clear \nmanifestation of the prevailing power struggle between the two sectarian power houses of the region -- Sunni Saudi \nArabia and Shi'a Iran.  Thus, it was quite possible that this 2011 assassination and terror plot was another such \nmanifestation of these tensions.\n\nThere was little doubt that the matter would be taken to the United Nations Security Council, where veto-wielding \npermanent seat holders, China and Russia, have been reluctant to take strong measures against Iran in regard to \nthat country's controversial nuclear development program and its failure to abide with international conventions. \nIndeed, concurrence by China and Russia on the 2010 United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran was \nonly reached due to Iran's unambiguous failure to comply with the standards imposed by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), and the revelations about clandestine nuclear sites. Now, in 2011,  with news of this \nassassination and terrorism plot, and the implicating of the Iranian regime, heavy pressure would be placed  on \nChina and Russia to again act in concert with the broader international community.\n\n\n\nAt the diplomatic level, the Saudi embassy in the United States released a strong statement of appreciation for the \nUnited States government for uncovering and foiling the plot. As well, during a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, \nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a vociferous warning to Tehran that her country would be \nworking with the international community to isolate Iran, and to ensure that it would be held accountable for its \nactions in violation of international norms.  Days later, United States President Barack Obama fortified his country's \nstance by confirming that Iran would pay a price for its involvement in this assassination and terrorism plot.  \"We're \ngoing to continue... to mobilize the international community to make sure that Iran is further and further isolated and \npays a price for this kind of behavior,\" President Obama said.  The United States leader stopped short of accusing \nthe uppermost leadership echelon of the Iranian government of being involved in the alleged plot; however, he \nnoted that even if  Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  did not possess \noperational knowledge of the plot, \"there has to be accountability with respect to anybody in the Iranian government \nengaging in this kind of activity.\"\n\nFor its part, the Iranian government has mocked any claims of its complicity in the conspiracy, suggesting that the \nentire situation had been a sensationalized scheme fabricated by the United States.  It should be noted that the \nRevolutionary Guards holds control over Iran's nuclear program, as well as being the over-arching authority at the \nhelm of the Quds Force -- the very group believed to behind the assassination and terrorism plot discussed here.\n\nBy the middle of October 2011, the United States was looking to parlay the allegations of attempted assassination \nand terrorism against the Iranian Quds Force into international action against Iran's nuclear development program.  \nTo this end, President Obama was pressuring IAEA inspectors to release classified intelligence information \nilluminating Iran's continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons technology.\n\nThere have been some hints of the evidence against Iran available via the claims of IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, \nwho suggested in September 2011 that Iran was working on nuclear triggers and warheads. According to the New \nYork Times, insiders familiar with the findings of the classified IAEA report have intimated that Iran has made efforts \nto develop specific  technologies related to the design and detonation of a nuclear device, including the \nmechanisms for creating detonators,  the method for turning uranium into bomb fuel,  and the formulas for \ngenerating neutrons to spur a chain reaction,  and also casting conventional explosives in a shape that could set off \na nuclear explosion.\n\nClearly, coming after the revelations about the assassination and terrorism plot linked to the Iranian Quds Force, \nthe  move  to declassify the IAEA's report was  oriented toward isolating Iran, now with accentuated political \nammunition, and aimed at arguing the point that Iran was a grave threat to global security,  therefore, the need to \nhalt work on Iran's suspected weapons program was imminent. To this end, Tommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the \nNational Security Council, said: \"The United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable \nfor the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.\"\n\nOf course, one of the risks of disclosing the findings of the classified report was that  Iran could move to eject IAEA \ninspectors from that country, effectively foreclosing one of the few avenues available to the international community \nto monitor Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nMeanwhile, among the punitive measures being advocated by senior White House officials was a prohibition on \nfinancial transactions with Iran's central bank.  Another punitive measure  under consideration was the expansion of \nthe prevailing ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by Iranian companies under the control of the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nThese options have not, in the past, gained traction due to  objections by China among other Asian countries.  In \nthe case of China, as a significant buyer of Iranian oil, that country's energy interests could be affected.  At the \nsame time, key United States allies, such as Japan and South Korea, are also buyers of Iranian oil but additionally \nhandle transactions via the Iranian Central Bank. Complicating the scenario even further, oil and financial sanctions \ncarry with them the threat of spiking the price of oil at a time when the economies of the United States, the \nEuropean Union, and several other major global players, were enduring sluggish growth.\n\n\n\nThat being said, the case against Iran was bolstered by a November 2011 report by United Nations weapons \ninspectors, indicating a \"credible\" case that \"Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear \ndevice\" and arguing that such activities could well be ongoing.  United Nations nuclear inspectors gave no estimate \nof how long it would be until Iran would be able to produce a nuclear weapon; however, they confirmed the \naforementioned claim that Iran had created computer models of nuclear explosions in 2008 and 2009, and \nconducted experiments on nuclear triggers.  The IAEA then passed a resolution expressing \"deep and increasing \nconcern\" about Iran's nuclear program, and demanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's \nnuclear capabilities.\n\nWhile Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would \nserve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. \nUnder consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh \nsanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and \nCanada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.\n\nWith international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out \nat the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be \ntaking aim at the United Kingdom.\n\nNov. 29, 2011 saw militant students aligned with the hard line conservative government in Tehran storm the British \nembassy compound.  This action appeared to be part of a violent demonstration against the government of the \nUnited Kingdom, which joined the United States in issuing new financial sanctions against Iran.\n\nThere were serious allegations mounting that the assault on the British embassy compounds had taken place with \napproval from Iranian authorities. The scenario disturbingly  recalled the shocking assault  on the American \nEmbassy in 1979 following Iran's Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe United Kingdom was backed by the  15-nation United Nations Security Council, which condemned the attack \n\"in the strongest terms.\"  Separately, United States President Barack Obama called for the Iranian government to \nensure those responsible faced justice.\n\nOther Significant Foreign Policy Developments of 2011/2012 --\n\nPresident Obama authorizes 100 troops to help Uganda deal with notorious LRA rebels\n\nIn mid-October 2011, United States President Barack Obama  authorized the deployment  of approximately 100 \ncombat-equipped  forces to Uganda  to assist regional forces in dealing with the notorious Lord's Resistance Army.  \nThe precise mission was the \"removal from the battlefield\" \u2013 meaning capture or killing of --  LRA leader, Joseph \nKony, and other senior leadership.  The forces would be working in a cross-border zone encompassing Uganda, \nSouth Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and would be \noperating with the consent of the participating African countries.\n\nIn a letter dispatched to House Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, President Obama explained that \n\"although the U.S. forces are combat-equipped, they will only be providing information, advice, and assistance to \npartner nation forces, and they will not themselves engage LRA forces unless necessary for self-defense.\"  Of \ncourse, the action was consistent with prevailing legal norms in the United States, due to legislation passed \nunanimously by Congress more than a year earlier in May 2010, called the \"Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament \nand Northern Uganda Recovery Act,\" which expressed congressional support \"for increased, comprehensive United \nStates efforts to help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the LRA to civilians and regional stability.\"  \n\n\n\nPresident Obama also noted that this deployment in 2011 would advance \"United States national security interests \nand foreign policy, and will be a significant contribution toward counter-LRA efforts in central Africa.\"\n\nThe LRA is one of the most brutal entities operating in the world today. During the 20-year long conflict between the \nLRA and the Ugandan government, tens of thousands of people have died and two million have been displaced.  \nDespite periodic peace overtures by the government, and in defiance of their own ceasefire declarations, the LRA \nhas gone on to repeatedly carry out violent attacks on civilian populations in Uganda and surrounding border \nzones.  Indeed, the LRA has operated across borders in an area that traverses several countries, compelling a \njoint-offensive by regional powers in an effort to stamp out the rebels. Nevertheless, by 2010, the United States-\nbased human rights and anti-genocide group, Enough Project, said that the LRA had found safe haven in Sudan \nand was operating in Sudan's western Darfur region.\n\nThe LRA gained notoriety for its gross violations of human rights, such as rape, torture, murder,  abduction of \nchildren for the purpose of making them either child soldiers or sex slaves, and vicious mutilation.  United Nations \nHumanitarian Affairs head, Jan Egeland, has described the LRA's activities as being akin to the worst form of \nterrorism in the world.  He has also characterized the situation in Central Africa as a horrific humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn 2004, the International Criminal Court of the United Nations commenced a war crimes investigation into the \natrocities committed by  the LRA. A year later in 2005, the ICC completed the inquest and issued the indictments of \nthe group's five senior leaders.  The war crimes charges included murder, rape, and forcible enlistment of children.  \nThe five individuals indicted included Kony, the leader of the LRA, as well as Raska Lukwiya, Vincent Otti, Okot \nOdhiambo and Dominic Ongwen. All five were yet to be apprehended. According to the ICC, it would be Uganda's \nresponsibility to ensure that all five individuals were brought into custody to face trial.\n\nIn 2006, with no progress on the apprehension of the LRA leadership by Ugandan authorities, the international \npolice agency, INTERPOL, issued wanted notices for the five indicted individuals (including Kony) on behalf of the \nICC.\n\nPresident Obama's multilateral foreign policy is bolstered in Libya\n\nComing on the heels of the successful \"Jasmine Revolution\" in Tunisia and the \"Nile Revolution\" in Egypt, protests \nby thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in Libya resulted in the liberation of the eastern part of the country. \nAs part of a brutal crackdown aimed at shoring up power in the government's center of Tripoli, the Qadhafi regime \nopened fire on anti-government protesters before commencing a brutal military offensive against opposition \nstrongholds to the east. Unapologetic for his ruthless tactics and in the face of worldwide condemnation, Qadhafi \ncalled for the crushing of the resistance movement by all means necessary and \"without mercy.\"\n\nIn response to the audacious move by Qadhafi to attack and kill his own people, the United Nations Security \nCouncil, on Feb. 26, 2011, voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Libya and to refer the Qadhafi regime to the \nInternational Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. Then, on March 17, 2011, the United Nations \nSecurity Council authorized a \"no fly zone\" against Libya, with an international coalition commencing air strikes on \nmilitary targets in that country, with an eye on protecting the Libyan people from the Qadhafi regime.  By the close \nof March 2011, NATO had taken control of the operation, the rebels were reconstituting their efforts at taking control \nof eastern towns, and the Qadhafi regime said it welcomed an African Union plan for a ceasefire and resolution.  \nThe United States, in concert with its NATO allies, was providing a support role to the rebels of Libya as they \ncarried out their fight against one-time terrorist sponsor, Qadhafi.\n\nMonths later,  Tripoli had fallen and the Qadhafi regime was being isolated. Only two remaining pro-Qadhafi \nstrongholds remained: Qadhafi's hometown of Sirte and Bani Walid.  Fierce fighting was reported in these two \nareas, with a special emphasis on Sirte, where Qadhafi -- still evading captivity -- was believed to be hiding.  As \nrebels took control over the airport at Sirte, NATO forces were targeting command and control facilities in Sirte. \n\n\n\nAt the diplomatic level, the United States and allied Western nations wasted no time in recognizing the  Transitional \nNational Council (TNC) as the legitimate authority in Libya while the United Nations General Assembly had voted \noverwhelmingly to transfer control over Libya' seat at the international body to the interim Libyan authority. \n\nIn New York, the interim Libyan leader, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil,  attended the meeting of the United Nations General \nAssembly and also met with President  Barack Obama.  President Obama, along with  other Western leaders -- \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- were being hailed as heroes in \nLibya for their stewardship of NATO's efforts to support the rebel effort in that country.\n\nFinally, in October 2011, Libyan transitional authorities declared that Sirte -- the final pro-Qadhafi stronghold -- had \nfallen, Qadhafi had died, and  Libya's national liberation was at hand.  Indeed, it appeared that the rebels'  brazen  \nprediction was coming to pass: \"Zero Hour\" was finally descending on the Qadhafi regime in Libya.\n\nOn  Oct. 23, 2011, Libya's transitional government declared the national liberation of the country before a rejoicing  \ncrowds  at a venue now called \"Victory Square\" in  the eastern city of Benghazi, where the anti-Qadhafi revolt \nbegan months earlier.  He paid homage to Libyan martyrs who gave their lives for the cause of freedom and \nprofusely thanked NATO countries for their support.\n\nFaced with the objective of providing stabilizing support for the Libyan people's hard-fought victory, while at the \nsame time ensuring that the Libyan story was ultimately written by the Libyan people, United States President \nBarack Obama said: \"The United States is committed to the Libyan people. You have won your revolution.\" He \ncontinued, \"The Libyan people now have a responsibility to build an open democratic Libya that stands as a great \nrebuke to Qadhafi's dictatorship.\"  Following the declaration of national liberation, President Obama congratulated \nLibyans, saying: \"After four decades of brutal dictatorship and eight months of deadly conflict, the Libyan people \ncan now celebrate their freedom and the beginning of a new era of promise.\"\n\nThe death of Qadhafi -- the world's most wanted man in the aftermath of the elimination of terrorist leader Osama \nbin Laden -- could well be viewed as a vindication of United States President Barack Obama's foreign policy.  That \nforeign policy has been characterized by  limited military engagement within a multilateral framework of \ninternational structures, combined with the judicious use of refined geopolitical and  military intelligence. It was a \nposition the Obama administration wasted no time in claiming with great enthusiasm.  As stated by Vice President \nJoseph Biden in an apparent contrast to the previous Bush administration's invasion of Iraq: \"In Libya, the United \nStates only spent two billion dollars and lost not one  American life.\"  \n\nSee below for the ongoing controversy involving a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. \n\nIran arrests 12 \"CIA spies\" said to be targeting nuclear program; Hezbollah informants at risk in Lebanon\n\nOn Nov. 24, 2011, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, Iran announced it had broken up an American spy \nnetwork and that 12 individuals had been arrested. Iranian officials claimed that the 12 individuals were \"spies\" \nworking on behalf of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undermine the country's military and its \nnuclear program. No information was available about the identity or nationality of the dozen so-called agents. Parviz \nSorouri, an influential member of the  National Security and Foreign Policy Committee in the Iranian parliament, \nwas reported to have said that the agents were working cooperatively with Israel's Mossad.  He was quoted in \ninternational media having said, \"The US and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to use regional \nintelligence services, both inside and outside Iran, in order to deal a strong blow to our country. Fortunately, these \nsteps failed due to the quick measures taken by Intelligence Ministry officials.\" Iranian officials have further alleged \nthat the United States has recruited spies from diplomatic missions in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and \nMalaysia.\n\nThis news came on the heels of reports that  the militant extremist Islamic organization, Hezbollah, uncovered a \nCIA spy ring in Lebanon.  Months earlier, a Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, confirmed in an \ninterview with Agence France Presse that \"Lebanese intelligence vanquished U.S. and Israeli intelligence in what is \nnow  known as the intelligence war.\" A report by the Associated Press reflected the same claims with \n\n\n\nacknowledgment from officials in the United States. Of course, the dynamics of the respective governments \nnotwithstanding, the lives of the individuals accused of spying were now broadly regarded to be at risk.\n\nU.S. policy as regards Iran\n\nAs the year 2011 drew to a close, bilateral relations between the United States and Iran -- already dismally bad -- \nsunk even lower as an American drone was reported to be in Iranian hands. The official account was that the \nAmerican drone had been flying in -- or close to -- Iranian air space, and somehow crashed.  The drone, with its \nsensitive intelligence information, was then taken by Iranian authorities.  But a report by the Christian Science \nMonitor suggested that Iran's possession of the drone may not have been the result of an accidental crash.  \nInstead, according to an Iranian engineer,  the country hijacked the drone  and was able to technically take control \nof the aircraft by jamming the control signals, ultimately forcing it into autopilot mode.  The Iranians then vitiated the \nGPS tracking by reconfiguring the GPS coordinates, effectively \"fooling\" the drone into landing  in Iran, rather than \nin Afghanistan, which was where it was programmed to land. The images of the American drone in Iran's \npossession depict an aircraft remarkably intact -- rather than being subject to crash -- thus bolstering the credibility \nof the report by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nIn December 2011, Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range surface-to-air missile during military exercises in the \nPersian Gulf.\n\nThe test occurred only a day after Iranian naval commander Mahmoud Mousavi  denied media reports that  his \ncountry had test-fired long-range missiles.  Now, however, Mousavi was lauding the operation, noting that the \nmissile was equipped with the \"latest technology\" and \"intelligent systems.\"  Mousavi also noted that further missile \nlaunches would be carried out in the near future as part of Iran's  naval exercises in international waters close to the \nstrategic Strait of Hormuz.\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2011, a day after testing a medium-range missile, Iran reportedly test-fired long-range missiles in the \nPersian Gulf.  Making good on his previously-made vow that Iran would continue this path, Mousavi said on behalf \nof the Iranian government, \"We have test fired a long-range shore-to-sea missile called Qader, which managed to \nsuccessfully destroy predetermined targets in the gulf.\"\n\nThis news by Mousavi was followed by a disclosure by the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization that its scientists \n\"tested the first nuclear fuel rod produced from uranium ore deposits inside the country.\"  This news served only to \nbolster Western fears that Iran has made important progress in its nuclear development, augmenting anxieties that \nIran's ultimate ambition is to  enrich uranium at the 90 per cent level necessary to create a nuclear bomb.\n\nThis news from Iran came after  several Western countries indicated their to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil \nand financial sectors, to register discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, the United \nStates wasted no time in taking action and on Dec. 31, 2011, President  Barack Obama signed legislation \nauthorizing a package ofsanctions\n\nIran's central bank and financial sector.  These new sanctions by the United States aimed to intensify the pressure \non Iran's oil sales, most of which are processed by the central bank. Essentially, they would force multinational \ncompanies to choose whether to do business with Iran or the United States.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iranian \ncurrency -- the rial -- slipped in value to a record low as a result of the news.\n\nIran was increasingly slipping into a state of isolation. China and Russia -- typically antagonists to the notion of \nincreased pressure on that country -- seemed to be distancing themselves from Iran.  China was reportedly seeking \nalternative sources of oil, while Russia wwas expressing \"regret\" over Tehran's decision to start work at the new \nFordow uranium enrichment plant near Qom.  Russia went further by saying that Iran should commence \"serious \nnegotiations \u2026 without preconditions\" or face the reality of consequences.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 5, 2012, the United States (U.S.)  Pentagon announced that the U.S. Navy rescued 13 Iranian \nfishermen being held by pirates in the Arabian Sea. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy responded to a  \ndistress call from an Iranian fishing vessel, which had been boarded by pirates several weeks prior. The U.S. Navy \nwas able to apprehend 15 suspected pirates on that fishing vessel and release the Iranian fishermen whom the \nPentagon described as having been held hostage under harsh conditions.  A spokesperson for the U.S. Navy said \nthat after the rescue of the Iranian fishermen,  navy personnel went out of their way to treat the fishing crew \"with \nkindness and respect.\"\n\nThe incident occurred at a time when tensions between Iran and the West were elevated.  Several Western \ncountries had recently indicated their intent to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, for the \npurpose of registering discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions. Iran warned that it might retaliate \nagainst international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz through which a significant amount of oil is \ntransported.\n\nOnly days after the U.S. Navy rescued the Iranian fishermen (as discussed here), the Iranian Revolutionary Court \nsentenced an American national of Iranian descent to  death sentence for spying in behalf of the United States spy \nagency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The family of Amir Mirzai Hekmati said that he was in Iran to visit his \ngrandparents; however, the Iranian authorities claimed that Hekmati was guilty of  \"co-operating with a hostile \nnation,\" \"holding membership in the CIA,\" and \"trying to implicate Iran in terrorism.\"  For his part, Hekmati -- who \nhad served in the Marines as an Arabic translator -- was shown on television admitting that he had been sent to Iran \nby the CIA and was tasked with infiltrate Iran's intelligence agencies.  Of course, the United States Department of \nState has asserted that Hekmati's so-called confession was likely coerced and that the U.S. citizen had been falsely \naccused.\n\nHekmati would have the opportunity to appeal his sentence; it was yet to be seen if Iranian authorities were willing \nto damage already-hostile bilateral relations with the United States by executing a U.S. citizen.  Such a move would \nnot help Iran in the public relations game on the international scene, given the fact that the U.S. Navy had rescued \nthe aforementioned Iranian fishermen from pirates.\n\nFor its part,  Iran has warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz \nthrough which a significant amount of oil is transported.  Indeed, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi \npromised that \"not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz\" if further sanctions were imposed.  That \nbeing said, analysts have noted that such a drastic step by Iran might serve primarily to hurt the Iranian economy, \nand imperil relations with Russia and China.  Accordingly, the threat was being regarded with skepticism.\n\nMoreover, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that a closure of the strait would yield \nconsequences.  Specifically, Defense Secretary Panetta said  the United States  would \"not tolerate\" the blocking of \nthe Strait of Hormuz, and warned that was a \"red line\" for his country, to which there would be a response.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Obama administration in the United States reportedly dispatched a message \nvia alternative communications channels to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  warning him that the \nclosure of the Strait of Hormuz would not be tolerated.  In a separate report on CBS News, the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey appeared to underline the potential response by his country, \nsaying that the United States would \"take action and re-open the strait.\"  Of course, the general consensus was that \nthe re-opening of the Strait of Hormuz  could only be achieved  by military means.\n\nClearly, the missile launch, the nuclear development news, the  sanctions, the threats regarding the closure of the \nStrait of Hormuz,  collectively raised the stakes in a burgeoning confrontation between  Iran and the wider \ninternational community.  As January 2012 was coming to a close, attention was on the question of what form that \nconfrontation would take.\n\nGoing the route of \"soft power\" rather than military might, the West wasted no time in intensifying the sanctions \nregime against Iran in a bid to place pressure on the Islamic Republic's regime to curtail its controversial nuclear \n\n\n\ndevelopment moves. Specifically, the European Union was imposing a phased ban on oil purchases from Iran, \nwhile the United States was expanding its sanctions on Iran's banking sector.\n\nAccording to a statement issued in Belgium,  the countries of the European Union would not sign on to new oil \ncontracts with Iran and would terminate any existing contracts by mid-2012.  Since the European market has made \nup a full fifth of Iran's oil exports, this sweeping oil embargo would constitute a crushing blow.  Making matters \nworse for Iran was the news that the European Union would also  freeze the assets of the Iranian Central Bank and \nit would prohibit transactions involving Iranian diamonds, gold, and precious metals.\n\nExpressing marked disapproval for Tehran's lack of transparency regarding its nuclear program, British Prime \nMinister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Iran \nhad \"failed to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the United States' harsh sanctions regime  against Iran would become even more targeted as it focused \non the Bank Tejarat for its alleged role in (1) financing Iran's nuclear program,  and  (2) helping other banks evade \ninternational sanctions. In December 2011, United States President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition on any \ninvolvement with Iran's central bank. Now, a month later, the United States Treasury  was asserting that the new \nsanctions against Bank Tejarat would target \"one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial \nsystem.\"\n\nAlready diplomatically-isolated, Iran was  now well on its way to being seriously financially isolated in the global \nmarketplace. As noted by the United States Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism David Cohen, \"The new round \nof sanctions will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous and further \nimpair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program.\"  Indeed, the rial -- Iran's currency -- was being deleteriously \naffected as it underwent a massive downward slide in value.\n\nIn apparent reaction to the measures by the United States and the European Union, Tehran  again threatened to \nclose the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe level of brinkmanship reached new heights as the United States Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, promised \nthat his country and its allies would use any necessary measures to ensure that the crucial marine thoroughfare to \nthe Persian Gulf remained open. In an interview withBBC News, Daalder said, that the Strait of Hormuz  \"needs to \nremain open and we need to maintain this as an international passageway.  We will do what needs to be done to \nensure that is the case.\"  He continued, \"Of this I am certain -- the international waterways that go through the Strait \nof Hormuz are to be sailed by international navies, including ours, the British and the French and any other navy \nthat needs to go through the Gulf. And second, we will make sure that that happens under every circumstance.\"\n\nDaalder did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic solution, saying that the countries of the West stood \"ready \nat any time to sit down and have a serious conversation with [Iran] to resolve this [nuclear] issue with negotiations.\"\n\nJust days after the war of words was being ratcheted upward, Iranian  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared \nthat Tehran was prepared  to return to negotiating table as regards its nuclear program.  On Jan. 26, 2012, \nAhmadinejad said that he was open to the idea of reviving multilateral talks in order to show that Iran remained \ninterested in dialogue. At the start of 2011,negotiations between Iran and a cadre of six nations (the five permanent \nmembers of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and \nChina) as well as Germany -- ended in stalemate. Indeed, those talks were marked by Iran's refusal to engage in \nany meaningful dialogue regarding its nuclear program.  Now, a year later, Ahmadinejad  said on state-run Iranian \ntelevision, \"They have this excuse that Iran is dodging negotiations while it is not the case. Why should we run \naway from the negotiations?\"\n\nThere was some suggestion that Iran's interest in a return to the negotiating table might be a sign that international \npressure was taking a toll.  That being said, Ahmadinejad's words could just as easily be interpreted as a symbolic \ngesture by a figure head intent on rallying national sentiment.  To that end, Ahmadinejad suggested that the West \nwas responsible for the collapse of negotiations to date, saying. \"It is the West that needs Iran and the Iranian \n\n\n\nnation will not lose from the sanctions. It is you who come up with excuses each time and issue resolutions on the \nverge of talks so that negotiations collapse.\"\n\nAs February 2012 began, Israel entered the Iranian nuclear fray.  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak indicated that \nif sanctions against Iran did not serve to curtail that country's nuclear development, then his country would be \nwilling to consider military action against Iran, before it could become a global threat.  It should be noted that United \nStates Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expressed the view that Israel could very well strike Iran in the spring of \n2012 -- citing a timeline of April through June.  Panetta was cited in an article written by the Washington Post \ncolumnist David Ignatius, which suggested that Israel sought to hit Iran's nuclear targets before that country entered \na \"zone of immunity\" in the effort to build a nuclear bomb. The article noted that the United States was opposed to \nsuch an attack, noting that it would imperil an increasingly successful non-military effort to isolate Iran, including the \nimposition of a harsh international economic sanctions program.  Indeed, the Obama administration in the United \nStates was reportedly worried about the \"unintended consequences\" of military action by Israel.\n\nFor its part, Iran had already said it was undeterred by either sanctions or threats of military action.  Iranian Oil \nMinister Rostam Qassemi said  the country would continue with its nuclear agenda regardless of pressure from \nforeign countries. As well, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had earlier claimed that Iran was actually \nbenefiting from Western sanctions. He insisted that the sanctions were helping his country to grow domestically, \nand said that war would only hurt the United States and other Western countries.  Moreover, Khamenei issued a \ndisturbing warning that Iran had its own \"threats to make, which will be made in its due time.\"\n\nBy Feb. 6, 2012, United States President Barack Obama announced the imposition of  new sanctions against Iran's \nbanks, including its central bank, the Iranian government, and  all other Iranian financial institutions. In a letter to \nCongress detailing his executive order, President Obama wrote: \"I have determined that additional sanctions are \nwarranted, particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks to \nconceal transactions of sanctioned parties, the deficiencies in Iran's anti-money laundering regime and the \nweaknesses in its implementation, and the continuing and unacceptable risk posed to the international financial \nsystem by Iran's activities.\"  As before, the United States was hoping that the even stricter sanctions regime would \nfurther isolate Iran.\n\nPresident Obama also made it clear that the United States would stand in solidarity with Israel to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear power. In an interview with the NBC news, President Obama said the United States and Israel \nwould work \"in lockstep\" to deal with the Iranian nuclear issue. \"I will say that we have closer military and \nintelligence consultation between our two countries than we've ever had.\"  President Obama also emphasized that \nwhile his objective was to resolve the nuclear standoff diplomatically, he was not taking any options off the table.\n\nOf course, as noted above, the United States has sought to discourage Israel from going down the military route.  \nThis stance was emphasized on Feb. 19, 2012 when Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff, said in an interview with CNN that  his country viewed a military strike on Iran by Israel as \"not \nprudent.\" Dempsey noted that United States officials were attempting to move Israel away from that path saying, \n\"That's been our counsel to our allies, the Israelis.\"  He continued, \"I'm confident that they [the Irsaelis] understand \nour concerns that a strike at this point would be destabilizing and wouldn't achieve their long-term objectives.\"  That \nsaid,  Dempsey had no illusions about the effectiveness of this argument as he noted: \"I wouldn't suggest, sitting \nhere today, that we've persuaded them that our view is the correct view.  Nevertheless, Dempsey suggested that \nIran was  \"a rational actor\" and \"the current path [re: diplomacy and sanctions] that we're on is the most prudent at \nthis point.\"\n\nThe \"soft power\" of crippling sanctions -- led by the United States --  has, in fact, been yielding results. According to \na report by Reuters, Iran was finding it difficult to purchase staples such as rice and cooking oil, which  are needed \nto feed its population.  For example, Malaysian exporters of palm oil stopped sales to Iran because they could not \nreceive payment.  Likewise, there were reports that Iran had defaulted on payments for rice from India -- its main  \nsupplier.  As well, shipments of maize from Ukraine had apparently been cut in half. Meanwhile, the price of basic \nfood was exponentially escalating. Meanwhile, countries around the world that previously did business with Iran, \n\n\n\nsuch as South Korea, were looking for alternative sources of oil.  As well, multinational corporations based in \nEurope were suspending deals with Iran due to the new European Union sanctions.\n\nPerhaps more detrimental for Iran were obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving payments for its oil  exports. In \nplaces where Iran is still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds due to prevailing sanctions, \nespecially those levied by the United States.  And in another twist, if Iran cannot sell its typical  2.6 million barrels of \noil a day, or, it it must  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue will inevitably have a debilitating \neffect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.\n\nThese findings from international commodities traders, which were part of a Reuters investigation, indicated real \ndisruptions to Iran and flew in the face of claims from Tehran that sanctions were having no effect.\n\nIn February 2012,  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that his country had developed \"advanced \nnuclear centrifuges,\" and that scientists had inserted nuclear fuel rods into Tehran's reactor that were  enriched to \n20 percent. Ahmadinejad also defiantly made clear that Iran had no intention of halting its uranium enrichment \nprogram. The West offering a symbolic yawn in response to Iran's nuclear announcement.  France and the United \nKingdom issued pro forma statements of \"concern\" while the United States Department of State spokeswoman, \nVictoria Nuland, dismissed the announcement as \"not terribly new and not terribly impressive.\"\n\nBut on Feb. 21, 2012, Iran was now taking a belligerent tone as regards the prospects of military action with an \nIranian military commander declaring that his country will take pre-emptive actions against enemies if its national \ninterests are threatened.  The deputy head of Iran's armed forces, Mohammad Hejazi, said in an interview with the \nIranian Fars news agency, \"Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national \ninterests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions.\" Since Iran's leadership has a \ntendency to assert the country's ability to crush preceived enemies, it was difficult to determine if this statement \nshould be regarded as the ratcheting upof rhetoric or a warning.\n\nU.S Policy as regards Pakistan\n\nAs the year 2011 drew to a close, and with bilateral ties between Washington and Islamabad under great strain, the \nUnited States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  moved to suspend  some drone missile strikes in Pakistan.  \nAccording to a report by the Los Angeles Times, the CIA has suspended some drone missile strikes on gatherings \nof low-level targets suspected of terrorism or attacks on United States troops in  the Afghan-Pak region.\n\nAt issue has been deteriorating bilateral relations between the United States and Pakistan dating back to May 2011 \nwhen  United States President Barack Obama ordered a  raid into Pakistani territory that ended in the death of \nglobal Jihadist terrorist, Osama Bin Laden.  Relations were further strained by the November 2011 accidental death \nof 24 Pakistani soldiers as a result of  United States gunships operating under the aegis of NATO. In response,  \nPakistan demanded that the United States vacate the Shamsi air base.\n\nAs well, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani warned that Pakistan could even close Pakistan's air space to \nthe United States. Additionally, Pakistan  moved to block NATO supply convoys from operating \"in country\" and \ncalled for a review of cooperation with NATO and the United States.\n\nFor Pakistan, there was a growing climate of resentment for the invasion of sovereignty, and over the deaths of \nPakistani citizens as a result of United States anti-terrorism operations in Pakistani territory.  However, for the \nUnited States, there has been prevailing suspicion that Pakistan was complicit in attacks by the Taliban and other \nmilitant extremist groups, such as the Haqqani network, on Western and Afghan targets. In fact, the United States \nhas suggested complicity of the Pakistan's intelligence agency in the siege of Kabul that targeted the United States \nembassy and NATO headquarters  in the Afghan capital in September 2011.\n\nThe United States' claims were somewhat augmented by a report in the Dawn newspaper detailing the Pakistani \ngovernment's admission that it had limited authority  over the powerful military and intelligence services.  To that \n\n\n\nend, the  Pakistani Ministry of Defense reportedly told the country's Supreme Court  it had no operational control \nover the military or the country's intelligence agency.  This claim would coincide with analysts' warnings that the \neven as the Pakistani government was trying to protect its own claims of sovereignty, its own power within this \nnuclear-capable country was severely curtailed.  Thus, it was quite plausible that even as the Pakistani government \nwas extending overtures of cooperation to the United States in fighting terrorism, it was balancing a difficult \ntightrope.  Specifically, the powerful wings of the military and intelligence service in Pakistan could very well \nthreaten the elected government's grip on power.\n\nUnited States Restores Diplomatic Relations With Burma (Myanmar) in Response to Reforms\n\nSummary:\n\nThe United States restored diplomatic relations with (Myanmar) on Jan. 13, 2012, in response to the government's \nmove toward political reform.  These measures have included allowing pro-democracy icon and opposition leader, \nAug San Suu Kyi to contest upcoming parliamentary by-elections, a ceasefire with ethnic Karen rebels, and the \nrelease of political prisoners.\n\nLandmark Visit of United States Secretary of State Clinton\n\nIn the latter part of 2011, foreign policy was at the forefront of the political landscape in Burma (Myanmar) as the \nObama administration in the United States announced that it would send United States Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton to Burma (Myanmar) on the first  visit by an American secretary of state in half a century.  The decision \nappeared to be a test of sorts for the new civilian government. \n\nSpeaking from a regional summit in Indonesia at the time, President Barack Obama, linked the new domestic \ndevelopments in Burma (Myanmar) with the  decision to engage with that country.  In particular, he referenced the \nregime's recent treatment of pro-democracy icon and opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from \nhouse arrest and was preparing to contest impending parliamentary by-elections (as discussed below). President \nObama said, \"Last night, I spoke to Aung San Suu Kyi directly and confirmed she supports American engagement \nto move this process forward.\"  President Obama  noted that Secretary of State Clinton would \"explore whether the \nUnited States can empower a positive transition in Burma.\" He explained, \"That possibility will depend on the \nBurmese government taking more concrete action. If Burma fails to move down the path of reform it will continue to \nface sanctions and isolation.\"\n\nAs November 2011 came to an end, Secretary of State Clinton landed in Burma (Myanmar) in the highly-anticipated \nhistoric visit to that country.  There, Secretary of State Clinton met with Burmese President Thein Sein and pledged \nimproved ties with Burma -- but only  if that country continued on the path of democratization and reform.  \"The \nUnited States is prepared to walk the path of reform with you if you keep moving in the right direction,\" Clinton said. \nIn an interview with media,  Secretary of State Clinton addressed the recent moves to elections as follows: \"These \nare incremental steps and we are prepared to go further if reforms maintain momentum. In that spirit, we are \ndiscussing what it will take to upgrade diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors.\"  But the United States' top \ndiplomat asserted: \"We're not at the point where we could consider lifting sanctions.\" One of the sticking points for \nthe United States has been Burma's relationship with North Korea; the United States has apparently made it clear \nthat Burma should sever \"illicit ties\" with North Korea. For its part, the government of Burma appeared  to welcome \nthe \"new chapter\" in bilateral relations.\n\nIt should be noted that Secretary of State Clinton also held talks with pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in \nwhat the international community regarded as a landmark meeting of two of the most iconic female politicians of the \nmodern era.\n\nThe Political Realm in Burma (Myanmar)\n\nJust before United States Secretary of State Clinton arrived in Burma (Myanmar) in the aforementioned landmark \nvisit, the domestic landscape in this country was dominated by the news that the National League for Democracy \n(NLD), led by noted pro-democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, decided to rejoin the political scene.  The NLD  said \n\n\n\nthat it would re-registered as a legal political party and contest the forthcoming by-elections. Notably, Aung San Suu \nKyi would herself be among the 48 candidates of the NLD seeking to contest the parliamentary by-elections, which \nwere to be held in April 2012.\n\nSpeaking of this prospect  at the time during an interview with Agence France Presse, Aung San Su Kyi noted, \"If I \nthink I should take part in the election, I will. Some people are worried that taking part could harm my dignity. \nFrankly, if you do politics, you should not be thinking about your dignity.\" She continued, \"I stand for the re-\nregistration of the NLD party. I would like to work effectively towards amending the constitution. So we have to do \nwhat we need to do.\"\n\nThe move constituted something of a political comeback for the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi after years of absence \nfrom the country's political arena. Indeed, the NLD boycotted the previous elections because of electoral laws \nprohibited Aung San Suu Kyi from contesting those polls.  The NLD also accused the ruling junta of rigging the \npolitical structure to favor its newly-formed Union Solidarity and Development Party, and essentially creating a \ncontrived electoral process.  Now, the NLD had apparently decided that the time had come to re-enter the political \nsystem.\n\nNote: By mid-December 2011, the NLD's bid to re-register as a legal political party was approved. Then, as noted \nhere, in January 2012, it was confirmed that Aung San Suu Kyi would contest those elections for a parliamentary \nseat in the April 2012 vote.\n\nDemocratic Reform and Diplomatic Engagement\n\nIn late 2011, as the United States opened the door cautiously to bilateral dialogue,  the government of Burma \n(Myanmar)  appeared to be advancing measures intended to demonstrate its reformist credentials when Burmese \nPresident Thein Sein  signed legislation allowing peaceful demonstrations for the first time. While the new law \nrequires protesters to seek approval at least five days in advance of a possible rally, the move was clearly a shift in \nthe direction of increased freedoms since  all protests were previously prohibited.  Indeed, it demonstrated a clear \neasing of long-standing political restrictions.\n\nBy the start of January 2012, the government of Burma (Myanmar) appeared to be traversing the path of political \nreform as  the country's most prominent political dissidents were released from jail.  Among those enjoying new-\nfound freedom were\n\nstudent protesters imprisoned since the late 1980s, Buddhist monks involved in 2007 pro-democracy protests, \njournalists, as well as  ethnic and minority activists.  In addition, former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, who was \ndetained in a 2004 purge, was released from house arrest.\n\nThe release of political prisoners was something the United States has urged for some time. United States \nPresident Barack Obama hailed the news that the government of Burma (Myanmar) had decided to free political \ndissidents from detainment, characterizing the move as  a \"substantial step forward.\"  He said, \"I spoke about the \nflickers of progress that were emerging in Burma. Today, that light burns a bit brighter, as prisoners are reunited \nwith their families and people can see a democratic path forward.\"\n\nIn addition, there was new emerging from Burma (Myanmar) that the government was forging a ceasefire with \nethnic Karen rebels.  At issue was an emerging agreement with the Karen National Union. \n\nIn the background of these shifts was the parallel path of increased political participation of the opposition with the \nre-registering of the main opposition party, and the inclusion of Aung San Suu Kyi in impending parliamentary by-\nelections, as discussed here. \n\nThis groundwork yielded fruit for Burma (Myanmar) when the United States announced that Washington D.C. \nwould  restore diplomatic relations with Nay Pyi Taw in response to the Burmese government's move toward \npolitical reform. On Jan. 13, 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that her country would \ncommence  the process of exchanging ambassadors with Burma (Myanmar).\n\n\n\nAs noted by Secretary of States Clinton, the restoration of bilateral relations would be an ongoing process and it \nwould be  dependent on further reform.  She said, \"An American ambassador will help strengthen our efforts to \nsupport the historic and promising steps that are now unfolding.\"\n\nThe development was a clear diplomatic victory for the Obama administration's policy of engagement. For his part, \nPresident Obama urged leaders in Burma (Myanmar) to  take \"additional steps to build confidence.\"  He  continued, \n\"Much more remains to be done to meet the aspirations of the Burmese people, but the United States is committed \nto continuing our engagement.\" \n\nThis progress illuminated the success of  Secretary of State Clinton's landmark visit to Burma (Myanmar) in \nDecember 2011, which facilitated productive results. At the time, Secretary of State Clinton said that she wanted to \nbe \"in country\" to decide  for herself whether President Thein Sein was serious about taking the path of \ndemocratization.  To that end, it was believed that her visit could encourage Burma (Myanmar) to continue \ntraversing  that path of reform.\n\nIt should be noted that there was no immediate call for international sanctions against Burma (Myanmar) to be \neased. Those sanctions -- in place since the 1990s -- have included arms embargos, travel bans on officials of the \nruling regime, and asset prohibitions  on investment. While the United States has clearly rewarded Burma \n(Myanmar) for its recent thrust for reform, the  lifting of sanctions was not likely to occur until democratic changes in \nBurma (Myanmar) can be classified as incontrovertible and irreversible. \n\nInternational analysts would be watching the ruling government's future treatment of the political prisoners who \nwere recently released from detainment.  Would they be able to participate in the proverbial public sphere, without \nfear of recrimination?\n\nFor its part, the government has said that it does not recognize the categorization \"political prisoner\" and, instead, \nhas argued that it only jails people for criminality.  That being said,  President Thein Sein took a sanguine tone as \nhe suggested that the prisoners who were released  could \"play a constructive role in the political process.\"\n\nSee below for more recent developments related to relations with Burma.\n\nTensions with Egypt\n\nAt the start of February 2012, approximately 40 aid workers were  referred to a criminal court in Egypt on charges of \nillegally funding a civil society organization.  The 40 aid workers were a multinational group including Europeans, \nAmericans, Arabs, and Egyptians -- all of whom were non-governmental organization workers affiliated with \norganizations that failed to properly register with the government and were now facing charges.  Among the \ndefendants was  Sam LaHood -- the son of Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, who has been serving in the \nObama administration. The situation has sparked tensions between the United States and Egypt.  Speaking on \nbehalf of the Obama administration,  State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, \"We are urging the \ngovernment of Egypt to lift these restrictions immediately and allow folks to come home as soon as possible. \nFrankly, we don't know how this is going to come out yet.\"\n\nIrish Taoiseach meets with President Obama; grants U.S. president certificate of Irish heritage\n\nOn March 20, 2012, United States (U.S.) President Barack Obama and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny met behind \nclosed doors to discuss Iran and Syria.  After the meeting, the Irish Taoiseach described the talks as follows: \"We \ndiscussed the issue of Syria, and I gave the president a rundown on the last discussions at the European Council \nmeeting. We also discussed the question of Iran and what the U.S. has said very clearly about this in the short time \nwindow that there is\" to reach an agreement on that country's efforts to build a nuclear weapon.  For his part, \nPresident Obama  discussed the strong bilateral bonds shared between his country and Ireland, and also thanked \nIreland for contributing peacekeepers and humanitarian aid to various efforts around the world.  In a nod to \nPresident Obama's partial Irish heritage, Prime Minister Kenny presented the United States' biracial president with \n\n\n\nan official certificate of Irish heritage saying, \"These are rare, as rare as the man himself.\" Thanking the Irish \nTaoisech, President Obama\n\nsaid, \"This will have a special place of honor alongside my birth certificate.\"  There was a significant eruption of \nlaughter in the room in response to the president's quip regarding the ongoing obsession by far-right elements \nabout his natural born status as an American citizen.\n\nUpdate on Afghanistan\n\nAt the close of January 2012, it was reported that the Taliban in Afghanistan refused to assent to a ceasefire \ndemand by the United States in Afghanistan.  The demand was part of a prisoner exchange/peace proposal, which \nfocused on the release of five leading  Taliban commanders  who were being held at the United States military \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay (Cuba) since 2002. As reported by NBC news, a  Taliban spokesperson said:  \n\"Our stance is the same. We will announce a ceasefire when the foreign forces start their withdrawal from \nAfghanistan.\"\n\nBy the start of February 2012, attention switched to the security scene in Afghanistan, with NATO affirming that \nlocal  forces would play a leading role in defending the country in mid-2013, ahead of the complete termination of \nNATO combat operations in Afghanistan in  2014.\n\nSpeaking of these developments to come, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: From that time \n[2013], the role of our troops will gradually change from combat to support.\"  Consistent with this plan, French \nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy announced his intention to withdraw his country's troops from Afghanistan by 2013.  \nMeanwhile, United States  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was asserting success in the anti-extremist operations \nin Afghanistan, noting that insurgent forces there had been successfully weakened. Panetta said that the United \nStates' goal in Afghanistan was to complete the transition \"from a combat role to a training, advice and assist role\" \nin 2013.\n\nIn March 2012, following a series of incidents (the unfortunate burning of Korans and the killing of civilians by a \nUnited States soldier),  there was accentuated emphasis on  United States foreign policy regarding \nAfghanistan.  The American public was war-weary after such a lengthy engagement in Afghanistan and clamoring \nfor \"nation-building\" at home on the domestic front.  Accordingly, the calls for an even earlier exit strategy from \nAfghanistan were increasing.\n\nThat being said, the United States and its closest ally, the United Kingdom, indicated that the current schedule for \nending engagement in Afghanistan would remain intact.  Leaders of both countries addressed the matter while \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron was in the United States for a state visit with American President Barack \nObama. They said their respective countries would end combat roles in Afghanistan by mid-to-late 2013.  Before \nthen, 23,000 United States troops would return from Afghanistan by September 2012 (10,000 already returned in \nJune 2011), as promised by President Obama.  For its part, the United Kingdom would send 500 British troops \nhome in the early autumn of 2012. These moves would assure that American and British forces would shift from \nlead combat roles to  support and training capacities by the second half of 2013, with the complete termination of \nNATO combat operations in Afghanistan in  2014.\n\nUnited States President Obama said his intent was to ensure a \"responsible\" end to the war in Afghanistan.  \nSpeaking of this issue, the American president said, \"We have a strategy that will allow us to responsibly wind down \nthis [Afghan] war. We're steadily transitioning to the Afghans who are moving into the lead. And that's going to allow \nus to bring our troops home. Already we're scheduled to remove 23,000 troops by the end of this summer ... \nfollowing the 10,000 that we withdrew last year. And meanwhile, we will continue the work of devastating al-Qaida's \nleadership and denying them a safe haven.\"  Referring to the recent tragedies and unfortunate incidents that raised \ntensions with Afghanistan, President Obama said, \"There's no question that we face a difficult challenge in \nAfghanistan, but I am ... confident that we can continue the work of meeting our objectives, protecting our country \nand responsibly bringing this war to a close.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that France was set to withdraw 1,000 of its soldiers from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, \nleaving about 3,000 \"in country.\" Belgium had begun withdrawing half of its force at the start of 2012.  Norway \nlikewise began its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and was looking towards a complete exit.  Spain said that \n2012 would mark the start of its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, with a complete exit set for 2014.  Canada \nwithdrew its combat troops in 2011 and had already made its transition to a training role in Afghanistan.\n\nWith an eye on smoothing tensions with Afghanistan, especially after Afghan President Karzai urged a faster exit of \nNATO forces from his country (as noted above), President Obama reportedly convened a telephone meeting with \nthe Afghan leader.  In that call, the White House said that President Obama and President Karzai \"affirmed that \nthey share the goal of building capable Afghan security forces and strengthening Afghan sovereignty so that \nAfghans are increasingly in charge of their own security, with the lead for combat operations shifting to Afghan \nforces, with U.S. forces in support, in 2013.\"  Obviously, this schedule would also mean that the \"date certain\" for \nthe deadline of the complete termination of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan in  2014 remained intact.\n\nAs March 2012 was entering its final week, the White House confirmed the exit schedule noting that the United \nStates would have about 68,000 troops in Afghanistan in 2013 after surge forces withdraw from that country.  \nObviously, this schedule would also mean that the \"date certain\" for the deadline of the complete termination of \nNATO combat operations in Afghanistan in  2014 remained intact.\n\nSpecial Report: \n\nIt's officially over; United States ends Iraq War\n\nSummary:  On Dec. 15, 2011, the flag of United States forces in Iraq was lowered in Baghdad, officially bringing the \nwar to a close. As promised by President Barack Obama,  the United States military would complete a full \nwithdrawal of its troops from Iraq by the close of 2011.  The move, as discussed here, would provide President \nObama with the opportunity to assert that he kept of one his most important 2008 campaign promises: to bring the \ncontroversial war in Iraq to a responsible conclusion.  Speaking at a ceremony at Fort Bragg in North Carolina for \ntroops returning home the previous day, President Obama declared: \"The war in Iraq will soon belong to history, \nand your service will belong to the ages.\"  He additionally noted that his country had  left behind a \"sovereign, \nstable and self-reliant Iraq.\" At home, Americans were sure to applaud the fact that there would be no more \nexpenditure on former President George Bush's Iraq War, which cost some one trillion USD. Meanwhile, the future \ncourse of Iraq -- in terms of political stability, national security, and economic development -- was now in the hands \nof the Iraqi people.\n\n---\n\nU.S. ends combat operations in Iraq after seven and a half years\n\nIn the early hours of Aug. 19, 2010, (Iraq time) the last major combat brigade of United States forces left Iraq and \ncrossed the border into Kuwait. They were protected from above by Apache helicopters and F-16 fighters, and on \nthe ground by both American military and the very Iraqi armed forces that they helped to train. The exit of the United \nStates forces ensued in a phased basis over the course of several days. The final convoy of the United States \nArmy's 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, was carrying 14,000 United States combat forces in Iraq, according to \nRichard Engel of NBC/MSNBC News, who was embedded with the brigade. A small number of United States \ncombat troops were yet to depart Iraq, and approximately 50,000 troops would remain in Iraq until the end of 2011 \nin a support role to train Iraqi forces. Indeed, by Aug. 24, 2010, less than 50,000 United States troops were reported \nto be \"in country\" -- the very lowest level since the start of the war in 2003.\n\nWhile violence continued in Iraq -- even in the days after the last American combat brigade left Iraq -- it was \napparent that the Obama administration in the United States would not be deterred from the schedule for \nwithdrawal, these fragile and chaotic conditions on the ground in Iraq notwithstanding. This decision has been a \nsource of consternation among some quarters. In fact, a top military official in Iraq has questioned the withdrawal of \nUnited States forces from Iraq, warning that local security forces were not able to handle the security challenges on \n\n\n\ntheir own for at least a decade. Echoing a similar tone, military officials from the United States said in an interview \nwith the Los Angeles Times that it was highly unlikely that Iraqi security forces were capable of maintaining Iraq's \nfragile stability after the exit of United States troops from Iraq in 2010. Nevertheless, the citizenry in the United \nStates was war-weary and concerned over the costs of war at a time of economic hardship, while President Barack \nObama was intent on making good on his promises made while as a candidate and later, as president, to end the \nwar.\n\nThe withdrawal of the last major combat brigade was regarded with great symbolism as an end to the combat \nmission of the war in Iraq that has gone on for seven and a half years. It also made clear that President Obama was \nfulfilling his central campaign promise to end the war in Iraq -- a vow that was reiterated in 2009 when President \nObama set the deadline for the end of the combat mission in Iraq as Aug. 31, 2010. To this end, President Obama \nwas fulfilling this promise even though Iraq was yet to form a new government several months after its \nparliamentary elections. It should be noted that the withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq was set forth in the \nStatus of Forces agreement signed two years ago.\n\nPresident Obama gave a televised address on Aug. 31, 2010, regarding the end of the active phase of United \nStates operations in Iraq.  That was the official deadline set by President  Obama for the exit of combat forces from \nIraq and the end to the war.\n\nIn this address to the nation from the Oval Office, President Obama asserted: \"Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and \nthe Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.\"  President Obama paid tribute to the \nmilitary that carried out their mission, saying that he was \"awed\" by the sacrifices made by the men and women in \nuniform in service of the United States.  President Obama additionally noted that the United States itself paid a high \nprice  for the Iraq War saying, \"The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its \npeople.\"  The president noted that he disagreed with his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, on the \nvery premise of the war, but urged the nation to \"turn the page\" on that chapter of recent history. To these ends, he \nsaid: \"We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources \nabroad at a time of tight budgets at home... Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the US and Iraq, we \nhave met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page.\"\n\nFor his part, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki noted that his country was \"independent\" and that Iraqi security \nforces would now confront  all the security threats facing the nation.  Maliki said in his own address to the nation, \n\"Iraq today is sovereign and independent. Our security forces will take the lead in ensuring security and \nsafeguarding the country and removing all threats that the country has to weather, internally or externally.\"  He also \nsought to reassure Iraqis that the security forces were \"capable and qualified to shoulder the responsibility\" of \nkeeping Iraq safe and secure.\n\nUnited Nations lifts sanctions on Iraq\n\nIt should also be noted that in  December 2010, the United Nations Security Council lifted sanctions against Iraq. \nThe vote ended most of the measures comprising a harsh sanctions regime that had been held in place for almost \ntwo decades, starting with the time of Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait during the era of Saddam Hussein. In its \nstatement, the United Nations Security Council said that it \"recognizes that the situation now existing in Iraq is \nsignificantly different from that which existed at the time of the adoption of Resolution 661.\" Iraqi Foreign Minister \nHoshyar Zebari said of the move, \"Today Iraq will be liberated from all sanctions caused by wars and misdeeds of \nthe former regime.\" Meanwhile, United States Vice President Joe Biden, who acted as chairman of the meeting, \nsaid: \"Iraq is on the cusp of something remarkable -- a stable, self-reliant nation.\" Striking a more pragmatic tone, \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon noted that Iraq would yet have to forge an agreement with Kuwait in \nregards to its border, and would also have to resolve the matter of war reparations. To date, five percent of Iraq's oil \nrevenues have been used to pay war reparations to Kuwait.\n\nU.S. President Obama announces complete withdrawal of troops by close of 2011\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2011, United States President Barack Obama announced the complete withdrawal of all American \ntroops from Iraq by the close of 2011.  President Obama said his country's nine-year military engagement in Iraq \n\n\n\nwould officially come to an end at that time.  He noted that the United States had fulfilled its commitment in Iraq and \nwould bring all American troops home \"in time for the holidays.\"\n\nWith the end of United States' combat operations in Iraq in August 2010, the end of the war was believed to be in \nthe offing.  That being said, at the time in mid-2010, approximately 50,000 troops  remained in Iraq in a support role \nto train Iraqi forces.  Negotiations have been ongoing since that  time to forge a deal that would  allow them to stay \nin Iraq to work with Iraqi security forces.  However, the United States and Iraq were unable to find concurrence on \nan agreement allowing United States trainers to remain \"in country\" and still enjoy immunity.  Thus, United States \nPresident Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki concluded that the time had come to shift the nature of \ntheir bilateral relationship to one marked by respect for mutual sovereignty.\n\nThe end of the Iraq war would close a controversial chapter in the story of American foreign policy, which began \nwith George W. Bush's doctrine of \"pre-emptive war,\" undertaken in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Indeed, the invasion \nof Iraq -- the defining policy decision of former President Bush  -- resulted in the ousting of former Iraqi leader, \nSaddam Hussein, from office. The invasion of Iraq was criticized as a violation of international law by many, and \ncondemned as ill-conceived foreign policy by others who argued that Iraq had nothing to do with the terror attacks \nin the United States of 2001, and that Iraq was not home to weapons of mass destruction -- the two expressed \nreasons for going to war in Iraq, according to the Bush administration. Analysts further warned that the deleterious \nconsequence of the war and the unintended result of the ousting of Saddam Hussein would be ethno-sectarian \nstrife and a strengthened Iran. Of course, on the other side of the equation, the Bush administration insisted on the \nnecessity of the war in the interests of national security. These competing viewpoints notwithstanding, the war in \nIraq ultimately left more than 4,400 American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead.\n\nAs President Bush's successor to the presidency, President Obama has stood as a vocal critic of the Iraq war \nwhose political influence in the war-weary United States intensified due to his  pledge to bring an end to the \ncontroversial military engagement in Iraq.  Clearly, now in 2011, President Obama was  honoring  a 2008 campaign \npromise to end the war in Iraq in a responsible manner.  Indeed, President Obama said: \"The U.S. leaves Iraq with \nour heads held high.\"  He continued, \"That is how America's military efforts in Iraq will end.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that the Obama administration has emphasized the fact there will be no permanent military \nbases in Iraq -- even after the withdrawal of all remaining troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. As well, as stated in \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 passed by Congress and signed by President Obama on Oct. 28, \n2009: \"No funds appropriated pursuant to an authorization of appropriations in this Act may be obligated or \nexpended ... to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of \nUnited States Armed Forces in Iraq.\" That being said, Iraq is home to one of the United States' most significant \nembassies.\n\nFlag of U.S. forces in Iraq lowered in Baghdad bringing the war to a close\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2011, the flag of United States forces in Iraq was lowered in Baghdad, officially bringing the war to a \nclose. The small, somber, and symbolic ceremony in Baghdad, which focused on the military tradition of retiring or \n\"casing\" the flag,  marked the end of the Iraq War.  On this historic day, only 4,000 troops remained \"in country,\" \nand were expected to depart Iraq within two weeks. At the height of the United States-led occupation of Iraq, there \nwere as many as 170,000 American troops in that country.\n\nSpeaking of the momentous occasion, United States Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said: \"To all of the men and \nwomen in uniform today your nation is deeply indebted to you.\" Secretary Panetta paid tribute to the sacrifices of \nUnited States' troops saying that they could leave Iraq with great pride. He declared, \"After a lot of blood spilled by \nIraqis and Americans, the mission of an Iraq that could govern and secure itself has become real.\"\n\nAs promised by President Barack Obama, the United States military would complete a full withdrawal of its troops \nfrom Iraq by the close of 2011.  The move, as discussed here, would provide President Obama with the opportunity \nto assert that he kept of one his most important 2008 campaign promises: to bring the controversial war in Iraq to a \nresponsible conclusion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a ceremony at Fort Bragg in North Carolina for troops returning home the previous day, President \nObama declared: \"The war in Iraq will soon belong to history, and your service will belong to the ages.\"  He \nadditionally noted that his country had  left behind a \"sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq.\"  The American \npresident also asserted that United States troops had left \"with their heads held high\" and he lauded their \n\"extraordinary achievement.\"  President Obama said, \"Everything that American troops have done in Iraq, all the \nfighting and dying, bleeding and building, training and partnering, has led us to this moment of success.\"  He \ncontinued, \"You have shown why the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the history of the world.\" At home, \nAmericans were sure to applaud the fact that there would be no more expenditure on former President George \nBush's Iraq War, which cost some one trillion USD.\n\nIraq -- while now liberated from the dictatorial hand of Saddam Hussein -- was not fully stabilized.  Indeed, an \ninsurgency continues to plague the country, which is culturally and politically characterized by  ethno-sectarian \ntensions.  There are enduring questions about the Iraqis' ability to maintain security in this country.  Nevertheless, \nIraq has made it clear that the time had come to end the occupation of their country. Indeed, as stated by Iraqi \nDeputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani,  \"I think we are all happy that the American soldiers are returning \nhome safely to their families and we are also confident that the Iraqi people and their armed forces, police, are in a \nposition now to take care of their own security.\"\n\nClearly, the future course of Iraq -- in terms of political stability, national security and economic development -- was \nnow in the hands of the Iraqi people.  That agenda would not be achieved with ease.  On Dec. 20, 2011, only one  \nday after the United States withdrew its last combat troops from Iraq, the Shi'a-dominated government of that \ncountry ordered the arrest of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni, on grounds of terrorism.  The Iraqi \nauthorities accused al-Hashimi of directing a death squad that assassinated police officers and government \nofficials. The serious charges were sure to damage the coalition government, and indeed, already a  Sunni-backed \npolitical coalition said that its ministers would resign from their posts, effectively leaving several Iraqi agencies in \ndisarray. While the charges themselves, if true, could not be understood as anything by highly disturbing, another \nschool of thought was warning that the the Shi'a dominated government might be abusing its authority to persecute \nthe minority Sunni in leadership positions, in a bid to consolidate power.  For his part, Vice President Hashemi \ndenied any wrongdoing and said he was ready to defend himself against the accusations of terrorism.  Vice \nPresident Hashemi also wasted no time in accusing Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shi'a, of orchestrating a \nsensational plot to debase him and to undermine the process of  national reconciliation.  He also warned that the \nsituation could send Iraq -- an incredibly young and fragile democracy characterized by complex ethno-sectarian \ntensions -- into a state of sectarian war.\n\nSpecial Feature: \n\nNuclear Politics on the Global Stage\n\nHighlights --\n\n--U.S. President Obama visits Korean DMZ; affirms ties with South Korea\n\n--U.S. President  calls for \"a world free of nuclear weapons\"\n\n--Follow up on the \"New START\" treaty between U.S. and Russia\n\n--North Korean \"denuclearization for food\" deal dead amidst plans for satellite launch\n\n--Japan and U.S. prepare for fallout from North Korean launch\n\n--Implications of global cooperation on Iran's nuclear development program\n\n--New sanctions for Iran?\n\nIn Detail --\n\nIn the aftermath of a  \"denuclearization for food\" agreement with the United States, there were high hopes that the \ndeal would facilitate progress in multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program.  Those high hopes \nwere somewhat dashed by news that North Korea intended to launch a satellite into orbit.\n\n\n\nThe bilateral \"denuclearization for food\" deal was formalized at the end of February 2012 and included  the \nexchange of 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards \ndenuclearization.  The agreement included provisions for a North Korean moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range \nmissile launches and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon nuclear center,  and acceptance of  United Nations \ninspectors who would monitor the implementation of the terms.  At the time, South Korea's Yonhap news agency \nreported that  Washington and Pyongyang \"reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement \ninitial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program\" in exchange for \nmuch-needed food. North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received \nshipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was \nrequested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to \nthe country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.\n\nThe agreement  was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- \ninvolving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008. \nFor its part, the United States welcomed the North Koreans' movement on the breakthrough deal, deeming it \n\"important, if limited.\"  United States Department of State spokeswoman Victoria Nuland took a cautiously optimistic \nstance saying,  \"The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behavior across a wide \nrange of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these.\"\n\nThat caution appeared to be well placed since North Korea was planning to launch a satellite.  Pyongyang \nannounced on March 16, 2011, that it would launch an \"earth observation\" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, \nusing a long-range rocket.  The event was intended  to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung.  Of \ncourse, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's \nuse of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology,  as well as the aforementioned \"denuclearization for \nfood\" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-\nrange missile launches.\n\nNot surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, \nand the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea. Nuland pointed to this concurrence and \nurged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, \"Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the \nsix-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart.\"  The \nUnited States also noted it would be \"very hard\" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea \nmoved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.\n\nThe geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated on March 21, 2012, when the White \nHouse in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit to the world's most heavily \nmilitarized border -- the  Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ \nwas intended  to convey the president's support  for the  30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and \nto augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul.  In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for \nthe White House National Security Council, said: \"The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, \nand it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to \nsee and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.\"\n\nAfter his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit  aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear \nterrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul. In addition to the controversial and difficult issues of nuclear \ndevelopment in Iran and North Korea, the summit also addressed the threats posed by nuclear terrorists, as well as \nradiological materials that could be used to construct a \"dirty bomb\" (i.e. a bomb that would spread radiological \ncontamination rather than causing a nuclear explosion).  Also on the agenda was a plan for nuclear power stations \nto convert to low-enriched fuel.  Due to the complexity of  these issues, it was  unlikely that new agreements and \nconcurrence would be found anytime soon despite the participation of 50 countries at the Nuclear Security Summit.  \nNotably absent from the list of participants  at the summit were North Korea and Iran.\n\n\n\nDuring his trip to Asia for the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama  reiterated his call for  \"a world without \nnuclear weapons\" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  \nnuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.\n\nIn a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United \nStates -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of \nnuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a\n\n\"moral obligation\" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the \naudience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with \nnuclear threats.\n\n\"I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,\" Obama said. \"I say it as a commander in \nchief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my \ntwo young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.\"\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world but noted that \"serious sustained global \neffort\" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.\n\nThe issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns \nabout North Korea's nuclear arsenal as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions.  To that latter end, President Obama was \nexpected to meet with Russia's outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev on the matter of Iran's nuclear program -- an \nissue that has not always seen progress due to divisions among countries with veto power on the United Nations \nSecurity Council. With an eye on working cooperatively with such countries, President Obama pledged to work with \nRussia and China at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.\n\nWith regard to China, President Obama noted he has called on Beijing to work directly with Washington and this \noffer \"remains open.\"  He further noted that the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul presented an opportunity for the \nUnited States and China to fortify bilateral relations.  He said, \"I think this is also an opportunity to build on the \nexcellent cooperation and dialogue across all the dimensions of our relationship that we've been able to establish \nover the last three years\"  The United States leader observed that the  summit \"shows the progress that the \ninternational community has made in preventing nuclear proliferation and making sure that we've secured nuclear \nmaterials.\"  He continued,\n\n\"And I know that's in the interest of both the United States and China.\"\n\nWith regard to Russia,  the United States president said he hoped to follow up on the New Start Treaty (Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty).\n\nThe \"New START\" provided for the significant reduction of the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the United \nStates and Russia; it would limit the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's \nstockpile of nearly 3,000 to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively. \"New START\" was regarded as a \nmilestone in the decades-long thrust to decrease the chances of nuclearized warfare. Indeed, it could arguably be \ncharacterized as one of the most important treaties forged in a generation.\n\nPresident Obama expressed hope there could be a deal forged with Russia for further strategic arms cuts with \nRussia as part of the nuclear disarmament agenda. \"Going forward, we'll continue to seek discussions with Russia \non a step we have never taken before -- reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical \nweapons and warheads in reserve,\" President Obama said.\n\nDomestic politics intervened onto the international summit when President Obama was overheard telling his \nRussian counterpart President Dmitry Medvedev that  dealing with the European missile defense shield would have \nto wait until after the election. President Obama suggested he would have more \"flexibility\" on difficult issues, such \nas missile defense, after the presidential election in the United States later in the year.  Willard \"Mitt\" Romney, a \n\n\n\npolitical rival of President Obama,  pounced on the United States' presidents words, saying that they were  \n\"alarming\" and \"troubling.\"  Romney also cast Russia as the \"number one geopolitical foe\" of the United States.  \nRussian President Medvedev responded to these claims by  rebuking the American presidential hopeful for using \nsuch bellicose language, saying  Romney's comments \"smelled of Hollywood.\"  Medvedev also offered some \nadvice to American aspirants to higher office regarding foreign policy in the modern era.  He said,  \"I recommend \nthat all U.S. presidential candidates... do at least two things: that they use their head and consult their reason when \nthey formulate their positions, and that they check the time - it is now 2012, not the mid-1970s.\" For its part, the \nWhite House explained that President Obama was expressing the political reality of the campaign season  where \nrigorous diplomacy and negotiations would be difficult to accommodate.\n\nPresident Obama addressed the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, saying that time \nremained to resolve the deadlock through diplomacy.  \"But time is short,\" said President Obama. \"Iran must act with \nthe seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,\" he continued.\n\nFor its part, Iran has insisted that it has the right to develop nuclear development for peaceful civilian purposes.  On \nthe other side of the equation, the West has asserted that Iran is seeking  to build nuclear weapons via its \nclandestine nuclear arms development program.  While Iran has been subject to sanctions as a result of its failure \nto fulfill its international obligations, international concurrence has not come easily due to objections from China and \nRussia.  However, President Obama made it clear that he intended to work with these two countries as he stated: \n\"Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its \nobligations.\"\n\nAddressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States \nheld \"no hostile intent\" to that country, but warned that there would be \"no rewards for provocation.\"\n\nThe United States president said:  \"The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed \nto peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to \nNorth Korean mothers and children.\"  President Obama continued, \"But by now it should be clear, your \nprovocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. \nInstead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met \nwith strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that \nleads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people \nof North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.\"\n\nPresident Obama also  reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch \nto place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.\n\nHe said,\n\n\"With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go \nforward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is \nthat we can resolve these issues diplomatically.\"\n\nPresident Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject \nto further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President \nObama addressed the leadership of that country saying, \"You can continue with the road you are on but we know \nwhere that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.\"\n\nFor his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm \nof rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  \"a childish farce.\"  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  \ndenunciations of North Korea  would amount to a \"declaration of war.\"\n\nPyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into \norbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad \n\n\n\nclose to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which \nPyongyang has said will take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  \ntrajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.\n\nAccordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept \nNorth Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue \npersonnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the \nSouth Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory.  \nAs well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the \nprospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on \nPyongyang to abandon the launch plans.\n\nIt should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea \ndue to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as \nsaying: \"Why we're not providing that food assistance at\n\nthis point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it \nas a lever to change their policies.\"\n\nAlong another vein, the United States was clearly using sanctions to pressure Iran into changing its nuclear \ndevelopment policies.  As March 2012 drew to a close, President Obama was clearing the way to tighten sanctions \nagainst that country.  Suggesting that there was enough oil on the world market to  allow countries to withstand the \nloss of some Iranian oil, President Obama moved to ramp up sanctions against Iran that would penalize foreign \nentities that purchase oil from Iran's central bank, which collects payment for most of the country's energy exports. \nThis move was intended to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nU.S. President Obama marks one-year anniversary of elimination of Bin Laden; makes surprise trip to Afghanistan\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn May 1, 2012, United States President Barack Obama marked the one year anniversary  of the elimination of \nnotorious global Jihadist terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, by making a surprise visit to Afghanistan, to mark the \napproaching end of the war that has lasted for more than a decade. While President Obama traveled to \nAfghanistan  to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Afghanistan, the trip  was imbued by symbolic \nsignificance.  As a president seeking a second term in office, the trip brought to mind the signature achievement  of \nPresident Obama's refocused war effort: the killing of Bin Laden.\n\nRevisiting the Elimination of Bin Laden --\n\nThe war in Afghanistan was sparked by the tragic 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, which were \norchestrated by Bin Laden.  As the leader of the terror enclave al-Qaida operating from Afghanistan, then-United \nStates President George W. Bush promised to hunt down Bin Laden and get him \"dead or alive.\"  Bush launched \nattacks on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which was allied with Bin Laden, later that year.  While the Taliban \nregime was defeated and a new government installed, the effort to capture or kill Bin Laden waned, most notably as \nthe Bush administration became embroiled in the war in Iraq, leaving Afghanistan war effort in the hands of \nmultinational coalition forces under the aegis of NATO command.  Since his election to power in 2008, President \nObama closed down the war in Iraq and made good on his campaign promise to redouble the United States' war \neffort in the Afghan-Pak region, given the general belief that Bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan and that al-Qaida \nwas now operating widely across the border.\n\nFinally, on May 1, 2011, following a highly orchestrated operation ordered by United States President Barack \nObama, it was announced that  Bin Laden had been killed by United States special forces during a raid on a highly-\nfortified compound in Pakistan. United States forces from the elite Navy Seal Team Six launched an attack on Bin \n\n\n\nLaden's mansion in Abbottabad, located about 60 miles to the northeast of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. \nUnited States officials said that while Bin Laden could have been taken into custody alive by United States \ncommandos, the terrorist leader was shot to death after resisting detainment and an ensuing gun battle.\n\nPolitically, the successful elimination of Osama Bin Laden could hardly be interpreted as anything but a boon for \nPresident Obama. His predecessor, Bush, staked his presidency on the anti-terrorism theme, even arguing that a \nwar in Iraq was necessary in the effort against global terrorism. However, Bush was never able to apprehend Bin \nLaden. Bush was criticized by his political opponents for allowing Bin Laden to escape capture at Tora Bora in \nAfghanistan and for using questionable tactics -- including torture and extraordinary rendition -- to try to find and \neliminate al-Qaida terrorists. Earlier efforts by former President Bill Clinton to target Bin Laden also ended in failure. \nConsequently, for years since his earliest forays into global terrorism, including the East Africa embassy bombings \nof the 1990s, Bin Laden evaded capture. In fact, he raised the ire of many in the world by regularly releasing taped \nmessages encouraging attacks on the United States, Western interests, Western allies, and even fellow Muslims \ndeemed to be enemies of his extremist doctrine.\n\nBut in 2011, President Obama had made good on a promise he made while a candidate -- to move immediately on \nactionable intelligence to either kill or capture Osama Bin Laden. Indeed, having received the intelligence that Bin \nLaden may have been hiding out in a mansion in Pakistan, President Obama opted not for a drone attack; instead, \nhe ordered a surgical strike, carried out by special forces, and left open the possibility of taking Bin Laden alive. It \nwas a high risk calculation that could have ended in disaster. Instead, the operation ended with the world's most \nnotorious terrorist dead, no deaths to Americans participating in the operation, no civilian casualties, and five deaths \nin total (Bin Laden included). Striking a patriotic tone at the time, President Obama hailed the outcome saying, \n\"Today we are reminded that as a nation there is nothing we can't do.\"\n\nAn Exit Strategy from Afghanistan --\n\nSince the elimination of Bin Laden in 2011, the war-weary American public has clamored for an end to the military \nengagement in Afghanistan. The matter has caused political consternation between some factions. On one hand \nwere those who want the United States out of Afghanistan, in accordance with a \"date certain\" schedule, and \nconcentrating on economic development on the home front.  Then there were the neoconservatives who have \nurged continual military engagement in Afghanistan as part of a muscular  anti-terrorism campaign. Another divide \nresided at the heart of the Afghanistan war debate. There were hawkish elements warning that a premature \nwithdrawal of ground forces would result in a reversal of the fragile military gains made against the Taliban and al-\nQaida in Afghanistan.  At the other end of the philosophical spectrum was a cadre of advisers who were against the \ninitial surge strategy in Afghanistan,  favoring instead targeted attacks in the Afghan-Pak region.\n\nIn June 2011, more than a month after the killing of Bin Laden, President Obama  unveiled his exit strategy from \nAfghanistan.  At issue was the number of United States troops expected to leave Afghanistan and the associated \npace of withdrawal from that country.\n\nTo be clear, since coming to office, President Obama tripled the number of United States forces operating in \nAfghanistan, for a total of about 100,000 troops \"in country.\"  Included in this 100,000 number were the 30,000 \ntroops that were added as part of the \"surge\" aimed at providing reinforcements in the mission to  reverse the \nTaliban's battlefield momentum.\n\nIn his 2011 Afghanistan strategy address, President Obama unveiled a plan to redeploy United States troops from \nAfghanistan and effectively end its commitments in that country that had now lasted a decade. President Obama \nordered the withdrawal of 10,000 United States troops from Afghanistan in 2011, with  another 23,000 troops to be \nredeployed the following year.  This \"draw down\" of 33,000 United States forces from Afghanistan would essentially \nend the aforementioned surge by the summer of 2012.  Remaining \"in country\" would be the rest of the troops -- \nabout 67,000 in total --  which would themselves undergo a steady pace of phased withdrawal to end by a final \ndeadline of 2014. Commanders on the ground in Afghanistan would be given the autonomy to sort out  the \n\"battlefield geometry\" and decide on  what types of troops would be needed in certain capacities from special \nforces, to trainers, intelligence officers, and combat troops.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama explained that the withdrawal plan would take time, saying, \"This is the beginning -- but not the \nend -- of our effort to wind down this war.\"  He also outlined the specific mission in Afghanistan going forward was \nto be: \"No safe-haven from which al-Qaida or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland, or our allies. \nWe will not try to make Afghanistan a perfect place. We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. \nThat is the responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its ability to protect its people.\"\n\nAll told, the new mission would transition from that of comprehensive counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy to a \nfocused and targeted counter-terrorism strategy, aimed at capturing and killing terrorists and insurgents.  There \nwould also be a clear \"date-certain\" exit deadline. Borrowing from the experience in Iraq, the Obama administration \nbelieved that it was vital that the Afghan government be pressured towards taking full responsibility for the country's \nsecurity, and the United States Congress needed to have clear targets to be used as mileposts for evaluation.\n\nExit Strategy Confirmed --\n\nFast forward to May 2012 and the United States president landed in Afghanistan in a surprise visit to sign a \npartnership security agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.\n\nPresident Obama  -- traveling in Air Force One -- traveled to Afghanistan under a veil of secrecy before landing in \nthe dark of night at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul.  The trip meant that the partnership security agreement  would \nbe signed on Afghan soil.  Coming on the anniversary of the death of al-Qaida's leader, the timing of the trip was \nkey.  Not only was it a reminder that Afghanistan -- the geopolitical source of the 2001 terror attacks remained in \nthe cross-hairs of American interests -- but it also signaled that the long engagement in that country was coming to \nan end.\n\nThe agreement, which was signed at the Afghan presidential palace,  was something of a road map for bilateral \nrelations going forward. Ensconced in it was the confirmation of the exit strategy as regards military engagement at \nthe close of 2014, as well as the direction for future relations through the following decade.\n\nBefore departing from Afghanistan, President Obama offered an address to his fellow Americans.  Speaking from a \nmilitary base in Afghanistan, the United States president acknowledged the end of the Iraq war and presaged an \nend to the war in Afghanistan  saying, \"The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut \nin half, and more will be coming home soon. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan, while \ndelivering justice to al-Qaida.\" President Obama nonetheless indicated that the United States had to complete its \nmission. He said, \"I will not keep Americans in harm's way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our \nnational security,\" Mr Obama said. \"But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan, and end this war \nresponsibly.\" Making it clear that the Afghanistan war was moving towards its final stages, President Obama said, \n\"My fellow Americans, we have traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war. Yet here, in the \npre-dawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon.\" Conjuring up the national \nagenda, he said: \"It is time to renew America.\"\n\nThe president also noted that at the forthcoming NATO summit in Chicago, the alliance would \"set a goal for Afghan \nforces to be in the lead for combat operations across the country next year.\" Already, NATO -- in line with the \nPresident's exit schedule -- had signaled that combat operations in Afghanistan would end by the close of 2014. \nIndeed,  NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was already on the record indicating that 2013 would \nbe a transitional year for NATO, with 2014 as a likely end date.  He said: From that time [2013], the role of our \ntroops will gradually change from combat to support.\"\n\nConsistent with this plan, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced his intention to withdraw his country's \ntroops from Afghanistan by 2013, although, like the United States, phased withdrawals would begin in 2012.  As \nwell,  British Prime Minister David Cameron has said that his country would end its combat roles in Afghanistan by \nmid-to-late 2013, with phased withdrawal starting in 2012 and a shift to a support role for remaining troops in the \nnext year.  Belgium had already begun withdrawing half of its force at the start of 2012.  Norway likewise began its \nwithdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and was looking towards a complete exit.  Spain said that 2012 would mark \n\n\n\nthe start of its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, with a complete exit set for 2014.  Canada withdrew its \ncombat troops in 2011 and had already made its transition to a training role in Afghanistan.\n\nIt should be noted that only hours after President Obama departed Afghanistan on Air Force One, a suicide car \nbombing ensued in Kabul. Afghan officials said that at least two suicide bombers targeted a guesthouse popular \nwith foreigners in the eastern part Kabul in the attack, killing several people. The Taliban soon claimed \nresponsibility for the attack.\n\nShift in Strategy --\n\nIn May 2012, the New York Times reported that President Obama's strategy in the Afghan-Pak region has shifted \nover time, and his policy-making has gradually moved away from advice from military commanders to influence by \nhis inner national security circle.  At issue in the New York Times report was a suggestion that military leaders \nagreed to the president's circumscribed withdrawal schedule  only because they believed  they could persuade \"an \ninexperienced president\" to extend the engagement. Such an end, was not to come.  According to a White House \nnational security aide, President Obama reportedly said: \"Well, I'm not going to give them more time.\"\n\nThe New York Times asserts that President Obama concluded in his very first year in office that the neo-\nconservative vision -- advanced by the previous Bush administration -- of remaking a democratized Afghanistan \nwas unrealistic, and that the real threat posed to the United States was emanating from nuclearized Pakistan with \nits fragile and unstable government.  Over the course of the next two years, President Obama repeatedly narrowed \nthe goals of the Afghanistan mission, limiting the goals to targeted assassinations in the region against al-Qaida's \nleadership and weakening that terrorist enterprise.  References to the fight against the resurgent Taliban were \nlimited, and in some ways replaced by reminders that Afghanistan would have to be responsible for its own \nsecurity.  There has also been an increased reliance on drone strikes in the Afghan-Pak region and also in Yemen, \nwhere al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has become far more active.  Stated differently, rather than being bogged \ndown further in a potentially victory-free war in Afghanistan, the Obama administration has moved toward a more \ntactical and targeted approach of eliminating enemies of the state.\n\nPresident Obama's shift in approach was reportedly sourced in a briefing of the Obama transition team shortly after \nBarack Obama won the 2008 election.  During that briefing, Thomas Donilon -- who would eventually become \nPresident Obama's national security adviser -- viewed a Power Point presentation in which military officials in the \noutgoing Bush administration expressed an inability to articulate a clear strategy for engagement in Afghanistan \nafter eight years at war in that country.\n\nThe president's evolving strategy was also informed by the realization that Afghan President Hamid Karzai was a \nvolatile and corrupt leader, who should not be trusted as a reliable partner. Another consideration has been the cost \nof a continued counter-insurgency plan championed by the generals that would cost about one trillion over ten \nyears, without any guarantees of truly transforming the Afghan landscape.  As stated by the New York Times, \"The \nmore he [President Obama] delved into what it would take to truly change Afghan society, the more he concluded \nthat the task was so overwhelming that it would make little difference whether a large American and NATO force \nremained for two more years, five more years or ten more years.\"\n\nFollowing up on that insight, once he was inaugurated, President Obama commissioned a rapid review by former \nCentral Intelligence Agency officer Bruce Riedel. That review offered the first glimpse of an emerging policy that \nwould look not only at Afghanistan, but at the threat posed by al-Qaida terrorists from the wider Afghan-Pak region, \nwhere nuclear-armed Pakistan with its shadowy intelligence service was identified as the bigger challenge. At first, \nthe political calculation was that indicting Pakistan with such claims would not pay dividends either in Islamabad or \nin Washington D.C.  As well,  according to his aides, the president felt compelled to try to eke out a victory in \nAfghanistan by continuing the effort there, if only with a date-certain exit. Over time, though, the goals of that effort \nbecame more limited with the president's national security aides informally dubbing it: \"Afghan Good Enough.\"\n\nBy 2011, President Obama reportedly reached his breaking point and concluded that he wanted an orderly exit \nstrategy to be draw up for Afghanistan. The results of that assignment was manifested in the Obama \nadministration's withdrawal schedule and plan, as discussed here.\n\n\n\nFastforward to the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago and on May 20, 2012, President  Obama again affirmed the exit \nschedule from Afghanistan in 2014, while making it clear that all combat operations led by United States forces end \nin 2013. The end of the war in Afghanistan dominated the NATO summit where France's newly-elected President \nFrancois Hollande made it clear that  French troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2012 -- two years ahead of \nthe schedule.  (As noted above, France was to withdraw 1,000 troops in 2012 with the rest to remain \"in country\" \nuntil 2014.)  Acknowledging that there would be \"hard days ahead\" for Afghanistan, President Obama urged allied \ncountries to \"pool resources\" to assist in completing the mission. NATO leadership and  the Obama administration \nalso placed pressure on Pakistan to re-open key NATO supply routes through that country into Afghanistan, which \nwere closed in late 2011 after air strikes accidentally killed Pakistani troops.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nPresident Obama's decision to end the Iraq war, his restrained approach towards conflicts in Libya and Syria, his \nreliance on smart sanctions (or \"soft power\")  with regards to nuclear Iran,  suggest a \"light footprint\" orientation. \nFurthermore, President Obama's refocus on the Afghan-Pak region, culminating in May 2011 with the elimination of \nBin Laden, and his tactical/targeted approach to deal with al-Qaida havens, collectively  offer a glimpse of his \nforeign policy. Indeed, the Obama doctrine has embraced the following elements: (1) vigorous diplomatic \nengagement augmented by strategic military pressure; (2) strategic pragmatism, reliant more on intelligence and \ntargeted operations than excessive boots on the ground; (3) multilateralism, in which an engaged United States of \nAmerica works within an international framework to solve global problems; and (4) fidelity to democratic ideals, in \nwhich the United States would support self-determination of freedom-seeking people, while eschewing the \nneoconservative vision of American hegemony and empire.\n\nNational Security Special Reports \n\nCIA says it foiled another \"underwear bomb plot\" involving double agent\n\nOn May 7, 2012, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said that it foiled a new \"underwear bomb \nplot\" by al-Qaida in Yemen.  According to United States authorities, an upgraded version of the failed 2009 \n\"underwear bomb\" was disrupted and the improvised explosives device (IED) was now in the hands of United \nStates intelligence officials. The bomb plot did not reach the advanced planning stages -- such as selection of a \ntarget and the purchase of airplane tickets -- and, accordingly, did not pose a direct threat to the public.  That being \nsaid, the very development of the IED  was a clear indication of the intent to carry out a terrorist attack.\n\nA statement released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation read as  follows:  \"As a result of close co-operation \nwith our security and intelligence partners overseas, an improvised explosive device (IED) designed to carry out a \nterrorist attack has been seized abroad. Initial exploitation indicates that the device is very similar to IEDs that have \nbeen used previously by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in attempted terrorist attacks, including against \naircraft and for targeted assassinations.\"\n\nIt was soon disclosed that the foiling of the plot involved a double agent who infiltrated an al-Qaida terror cell, \nvolunteered for the suicide mission, but who then delivered the IED to joint United States and international \nauthorities. The double agent -- a British national of Saudi background -- supplied crucial intelligence information to \nUnited States and other foreign intelligence agencies, which allowed the CIA to successfully direct a recent drone \nstrike in Yemen that killed Fahd al-Quso -- a senior figure in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Quso \nwas linked with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, with the IED in the hands of the CIA, it could now undergo technical and forensic analysis. Of concern \nwas the degree of technological advancement garnered by al-Qaida terrorists as they attempt to evade \nconventional airport security measures, such as metal detectors and body scans.  The \"custom fit\" device was \nreportedly difficult to detect in current airport security checks, and is believed to be the work of master bomb-maker \nand member of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri.\n\n\n\nOverall, the operation was  an extraordinary intelligence coup for joint United States, British, and Saudi authorities.  \nThe identity of the double agent/informant has not been disclosed although, according to the New York Times, the \nBritish national was recruited by United Kingdom intelligence and has been functioning under the aegis of  Saudi \nintelligence service, and in close cooperation with the CIA for several years.\n\nU.S. cuts aid to Pakistan aid over jailing of doctor who helped with Bin Laden raid\n\nOn May 25, 2012, a United States (U.S.) Senate panel cut $33 million in aid to Pakistan as a result of that country's \ndecision to place Shakil Afridi in jail for assisting the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  in locating the notorious \nJihadist terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, who was ultimately  found -- and killed -- on Pakistani soil.  Afridi -- a Pakistani \ndoctor -- was sentenced to 33 years in jail for  treason under a tribal system of justice.  He was found guilty of \noperating a vaccination program as a cover for gathering intelligence on behalf of the CIA. United States Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton characterized Afridi's jail term as \"unjust and unwarranted.\" Accordingly, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee decided to  cut U.S. aid by one million for each year of Afridi's sentence.  Describing his \ncountry's increasingly problematic relationship with Pakistan, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said: \"It's Alice in \nWonderland at best. If this is co-operation, I'd hate like hell to see opposition.\"  Likewise, his Republican colleague, \nLindsay Graham said: \"We need Pakistan, Pakistan needs us, but we don't need Pakistan double-dealing and not \nseeing the justice in bringing Osama Bin Laden to an end.\" For its part, Pakistan has maintained the view that that \nany country would take strong action if it found one of its citizens working for a foreign spy agency.\n\nAl-Qaida deputy commander al-Libi killed by U.S. drone strike in Pakistan\n\nOn June 5, 2012, United States officials confirmed that the al-Qaida deputy commander, Abu Yahya al-Libi, was \nkilled during a drone strike in the tribal area of northwestern Pakistan.  As the second in command after al-Qaida \nleader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Abu Yahya al-Libi was a high value target on the face of it.  That said, al-Libi's \nelimination was also a practical accomplishment in the mission to defeat al-Qaida.  Specifically, al-Libi has played a \ncritical role in organizing al-Qaida's terrorism agenda against the West, according to United States  officials, and \nthere would be few individuals capable of filling his shoes. Moreover, as a young and charismatic figure, he was \nlong considered the future leader of al-Qaida, and a likely successor to  the less popular Zawahiri.\n\nAn Islamic scholar from Libya, al-Libi had became a respected al-Qaida leader possessing both religious \ncredentials as he issued fatwas,  as well as logistical guidance in terror operations. He joined al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan  in the 1990s and was captured by NATO forces in 2002.  Instead of transporting him to the United \nStates for trial as a member of a designated terrorist organization, the Bush administration kept him jailed  at the \nBagram airbase along with many other high-ranking al-Qaida operatives.  There, in 2005, al-LIbi and three other \nleading al-Qaida terrorists launched a successful prison break from Bagram.  He then rejoined al-Qaida in Pakistan, \nand rose through the ranks due to his cachet as an escapee from  \"the belly of the infidel.\"  Al-Libi's  standing as a \nmarquee player in al-Qaida became obvious as more videotaped footage of  him leading the front-lines, training \noperatives, and offering Jihadist sermons took hold on extremist Islamic websites.\n\nOf course, in Pakistan, the drone strike raised the ire of the Pakistani government, and spurred Pakistani authorities \nto lodge a formal protest against the United States for violating its sovereignty. Indeed, coming after a spate of \ndrone strikes by the United States on Pakistani territory in only the space of two weeks, anger by Pakistani \nauthorities was at new heights.\n\nHowever, the United States was well-placed to offer that counter-argument that Pakistan's sovereignty argument \nwas weak since it clearly has no sovereign control over the volatile tribal regions of the northwest where extremists \nmilitants and terrorists have found safe haven.  For its part, the United States was likely to be quite satisfied that it \nhad struck a blow to the al-Qaida \"brand\" around the world.\n\nUnited States will designate Haqqani network as terrorists\n\nIt should be noted that by September 2012, the Obama administration  in the United States announced that it \nwould  blacklist the Haqqani network by designating the group to be a terrorist organization.  To be sure, the \n\n\n\nHaqqanis were responsible for some of the deadliest attacks against American troops in Afghanistan in recent \ntimes.  The move was expected to help in curtailing the  group's fund-raising activities in countries like Saudi Arabia \nand United Arab Emirates; moreover, it could help spur Pakistan into launching its own military offensive against the \nHaqqanis.\n\nSpecial Reports on Foreign Policy (as of 2012/2013) \n\nRussian President Putin says missile deal more likely with Obama than Romney \n\nIn the first week of September 2012,  Russian President Vladimir Putin entered the fray of American presidential \npolitics, characterizing United States President Barack Obama as \"a very honest man\" while disparaging \nRepublican nominee Mitt Romney as being politically craven.\n\nIn an interview with state media, President Putin said that if President Obama was re-elected in the November 2012 \nelections in the United States, he believed it was possible for a compromise agreement to be forged over the \ndifficult issue of a United States' proposal for  missile defense system in Europe.  Russia has been opposed to the \nestablishment of such a missile system in its geopolitical neighborhood; however, President Putin was signaling that \na deal could be reached with an Obama administration in the United States that would satisfy the interests of both \ncountries. He said, \"Is it possible to find a solution to the problem, if current President Obama is re-elected for a \nsecond term? Theoretically, yes.\"  The Russian president went on to state the following: His desire to work out a \nsolution is quite sincere. I met him recently on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, where we \nhad a chance to talk. And though we talked mostly about Syria, I could still take stock of my counterpart. My feeling \nis that he is a very honest man, and that he sincerely wants to make many good changes.\"  He continued, \"But this \nisn't just about President Obama.\" \n\nThe Russian head of state pivoted to talk about President Obama's rival for the presidency saying that although he \ncould work with any American administration, there were limits to be considered.  He said, \"We'll work with \nwhichever president gets elected by the American people. But our effort will only be as efficient as our partners will \nwant it to be.\"  President Putin  then launched into as sharp rebuke of Mitt Romney's claim that  Russia was \n\"without question\" the United States'  \"Number one geopolitical foe.\" \n\nPutin said: \"As for Mr. Romney's position, we understand that this is to a certain extent motivated by the election \nrace. But I also think that he was obviously wrong, because such behavior on the international arena is the same as \nusing nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic policy. It has the same effect on the international \narena when a politician, a person who aspires to lead a nation, especially a superpower like the U.S., proclaims \nsomeone to be an enemy.\"  Returning to the contentious matter of the missile shield, President Putin posed the \nfollowing rhetorical question: \"But what happens if Mr. Romney, who believes us to be America's No. 1 foe, gets \nelected as president of the United States? In that case, the system will definitely be directed against Russia.\" \n\nIt should be noted that President Putin's rare praise for President Obama stands in contrast to his attitude towards \nother American officials, or, American foreign policy in general.  Russia has blocked a number of United State-\nbacked Security Council resolutions against Syria at the United Nations, has at times stymied efforts to pressure \nIran on its nuclear development program, and has even accused the United States' Department of State of \nproviding tacit verbal support of anti-government demonstrations after Russia's recent  disputed parliamentary \nelections.  \n\nIsraeli PM wants \"red line\" on Iran over nuclear threat; Iran threatens retaliation for possible attack  \n\nAs September 2012 began, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) \nreport that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According to the IAEA, \nthere were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new equipment was not \n\n\n\nyet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had \"significantly hampered\" its ability to inspect the Parchin military \nsite, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been \"sanitized,\" presumably to obfuscate Iranian nuclear \nactivities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian \nnuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to address \nthe United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.  \n\nWith that gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in the offing, Israeli Prime Minister \nattempted to schedule a meeting with United States President Barack Obama. Media reports indicated that \nNetanyahu said that he was prepared to travel to Washington D.C. to meet with President Obama.  The White \nHouse declined the meeting on the basis of the United States' leader schedule; it also drew attention to the fact that \nthere were no bilateral meetings scheduled for the United States president with any other leaders.  The White \nHouse also pointed to a meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .  \n\nThe White House further noted that there was ongoing contact between President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu over a number of security issues, including the nuclear threat posed by Iran. In  statement, the  White \nHouse confirmed that President Obama had just spoken with President Netanyahu for an hour on Sept. 11, 2012.  \nThe statement included the following assertions: \"The two leaders discussed the threat posed by Iran's nuclear \nprogram, and our close cooperation on Iran and other security issues. President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, \nand agreed to continue their close consultations going forward.\"  \n\nNevertheless, Netanyahu's inability to secure a meeting with President Obama fueled speculation about poor \nrelations between the two men.  It was certainly possible that the White House was not in the mood to reward \nNetanyahu after he criticized the United States for not being tough enough on Iran over its nuclear program.  \nDuring  a news conference in Jerusalem with  Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov,  Netanyahu spoke of of the \ninternational community's reluctance to sanction a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.  He said, \"The \nworld tells Israel: wait, there's still time. And I say: wait for what? Wait until when?\" He continued, \"Those in the \ninternational community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before \nIsrael.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu went on to characterize  Iran as \"the greatest threat to world peace.\"  The level \nof rhetoric from the Israeli leader was so high that the Haaretz newspaper described Netanyahu's remarks as \"an \nunprecedented verbal attack on the United States government.\"\n\nBy the close of September 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had addressed the United Nations General \nAssembly and declared that time was running out to halt Iran's push to acquire enough enriched uranium to develop \na nuclear bomb.  Using a crude visual and a red pen, Netanyahu again reiterated his demand that there be a \"red \nline\" draw as regards the Iranian nuclear threat.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu charged that Iran might have sufficient material to create a nuclear bomb by the middle \nof 2013, thus requiring a clear message from the international community in the form of the \"red line.\"  Netanyahu \nsaid, \"Red lines don't lead to war, red lines prevent war. Nothing could imperil the world more than a nuclear-armed \nIran.\"  He also dismissed the effectiveness of sanctions passed against Iran, saying that they had not curtailed \nIran's nuclear program and asserting that \"The Iranian nuclear calendar does not take time out.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the United States has generally taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the \nbest path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program.  As well, United States Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton seemed to dismiss Netanyahu's call, saying instead that her country was not prepared to \ncommit to drawing \"red lines.\"  In his own address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack \nObama asserted that his country  would \"do what we must\" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms.\"  But he also \n\n\n\nmade it clear that while the United States has not foreclosed a military option against Iran, multinational \nnegotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.\n\nFor its part, Iran responded  to the Israeli prime minister's address by warning that it had the right to retaliate to any \nmilitary strike on its territory or interests.  Iran's deputy United Nations ambassador also said that his county \npossessed enough military might to defend itself and that it was not seeing nuclear weapons capability in the first \nplace.  Eshagh al-Habib said his country was \"strong enough to defend itself and reserves its full right to retaliate \nwith full force against any attack.\"\n\nThat being said, Iran's often-repeated claim that it had the right to a civilian nuclear program was itself subject to \nserious challenge. In mid-September 2012, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), issued a stern rebuke of Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. Notably, the IAEA's \nresolution was proposed jointly by the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in \na rare display of unity as regards the Iranian nuclear development issue. Meanwhile, IAEA Director General Yukiya \nAmano noted that despite a series of meetings with Iran throughout 2012 aimed at ensuring that the IAEA would be \nable to carry out its investigations, there had been no concrete results.  Amano characterized the lack of progress  \nas \"frustrating.\"\n\nNuclear talks between Iran and the United States?   \n\nOn Oct. 21, 2012, the New York Times reported that Iran had agreed to bilateral negotiations with the United States \nover its controversial nuclear development program. The New York Times, in its report, suggested that the talks \nmight be held after the November 2012 general elections in the United States. But shortly after this news item broke \nin the public sphere, the Obama White House was denying key aspects of these claims, asserting instead that while \nit was, in principle, prepared to meet with Iran bilaterally, there was actually no such plan afoot.   \n\nTommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, offered the following statement: \"It's \nnot true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American \nelections.\" He continued: \"We continue to work... on a diplomatic solution and have said from the outset that we \nwould be prepared to meet bilaterally.\" Vietor reiterated the Obama administration's stance, saying: \"The president \nhas made clear that he will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and we will do what we must to achieve \nthat. The onus is on the Iranians to do so, otherwise they will continue to face crippling sanctions and increased \npressure.\"   \n\nThis latter statement referred to the ongoing approach to dealing with Iran. With an eye on pressuring Iran, the \nUnited States, countries of the European Union, and other Western nation states have levied harsh sanctions on \nthat country.\n\nThe United States, in particular, has taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the best path to \nplacing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program. While United States President Barack Obama \nhas not foreclosed the option of a military strike (either by the United States or Israel) on Iran's nuclear facilities, \nand he has made his determination to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb clear, he has also been emphatic that \nthe harsh sanctions regime be given a chance to work. In a September 2012 address to the United Nations General \nAssembly, President Barack Obama asserted that his country would \"do what we must\" to stop Tehran acquiring \nnuclear arms.\" But he also said that multinational negotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.\n\nTo that end, Iran was certainly suffering as a result of the crippling sanctions that included restrictions on banking, \nshipping, trade, insurance, as well as commodities and energy transactions. Together they have struck a blow on \nIran's commercial ties to the outside world. One area of sanctions that has seen notable success has been the \n\n\n\nexhaustive ban by SWIFT -- an international financial clearinghouse -- which prohibits the transfer of Iranian funds. \nThe SWIFT ban has affected access by ordinary Iranians to basic food items. At the same time, Iranians were being \nsubject to inflated prices of cooking oil and other staples, as well as a precipitous decline of Iran's national currency, \nwhich itself led to domestic unrest. Meanwhile, customs data from around the world showed that Iranian oil exports \nand oil revenues had sharply decreased. The question, of course, was whether or not the burgeoning decimation of \nthe Iranian would actually affect Tehran's behavior on the nuclear issue.\n\nA possible indication of the answer to that latter question came on Nov. 3, 2102, when the British-based Guardian \nnewspaper reported that Iran suspended its 20-percent uranium enrichment levels as a goodwill gesture ahead of \ntalks with the United States. Higher levels of uranium enrichment was a precursor to weapons-grade uranium. The \nGuardian cited a report on the Al Arabiya website, which quoted Mohammad Hossein Asfari, a Iranian member of \nparliament, who indicated that his country was hoping that damaging sanctions would be lifted in return for this \nmove. The report seemed to be on something of a collision course with a recent revelation that Iran had recently \nfinished installing centrifuges for enriching uranium at its underground nuclear facility in Fordo. It should be noted \nthat the Guardian soon published a clarification of its original story, noting that Asfari was misquoted and that Iran \nhad, in fact, not already halted 20 percent uranium enrichment. Instead, Asfari was indicating Iran's willingness to \nstop enrichment at these higher levels if sanctions were lifted.\n\nMeanwhile, in the same period of early November 2012, goodwill between the two sides was likely strained when \nIranian fighter jets shot at an unmanned United States drone carrying out routine surveillance mission over \ninternational waters. According to the Pentagon, two Iranian jets intercepted the Predator drone and fired \"multiple \nrounds\" in its direction. The Pentagon also made it clear that the drone was over international waters and never in \nIranian air space. That being said, the shots from the Iranian jets ended in futility as the drone was guided back to \nbase successfully. The Pentagon noted that the United States was undeterred from its intent to continue \nsurveillance in the area. Speaking on behalf of the Pentagon, spokesperson George Little said: \"The United States \nhas communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters over \nthe Arabian Gulf.\"\n\nPresident Obama set to become first U.S. leader to visit Burma (Myanmar)\n\nComing off his re-election victory in the United States in November 2012, United States President Barack Obama \nwas set to visit Burma (Myanmar). According to the White House, President Obama would travel to the southeast \nAsian country of Burma (Myanmar) as part of a three-leg tour in the third week of November 2012, that would also \ninclude visits to Thailand, as well as Cambodia -- the site of the summit of the Association of South East Asian \nNations. In Burma (Myanmar), he would meet with President Thein Sein as well as pro-democracy icon and \nopposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nPresident Obama would make history as the first United States leader to visit Burma (Myanmar), which was subject \nto economic sanctions due to its prior record of political repression, but which has since been undergoing a process \nof economic and political reform advocated by the Obama administration. Indeed, until the announcement of the \npresident's trip to Burma (Myanmar), Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had the distinction of being the most senior \nUnited States official to travel to Burma when she visited in December 2011. The White House said the president's \nvisit to Burma (Myanmar) was intended \"to encourage Burma's ongoing democratic transition.\" That said, further \nreforms were likely needed as political prisoners remain detained in that country and ethno-religious violence \nbetween ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine state has increasingly become a \nproblem.\n\n\n\nDeadly attack on consulate in Libya becomes domestic flashpoint in U.S.\n\nBackground\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2012, militants stormed the United States consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi yielding \ndeadly consequences.  Reports from the ground in Libya indicated that at least one United States state department \nofficial was killed and  other Americans were wounded  in the ensuing fracas, and that the embassy compound was \nset ablaze. That state department official was later revealed to be Ambassador Christopher  Stevens who, along \nwith other officials, died when unidentified armed men stormed the consulate compound and unleashed a volley of \ngunfire, grenades, and handmade bombs.  Security forces returned fire but were overwhelmed for a time until the \ngunmen were repelled.  Ambassador Stevens  died of suffocation, presumably from the smoke and fire produced by \nthe rocket attack.\n\nInitial reports from authorities in the United States indicated that the violence may have been sparked by a film that \nwas said to possess anti-Islamic inclinations. The film, \"Innocence of Muslims,\" appeared to be of amateur quality \nbut was promoted by an ultra-conservative church pastor in Florida, Terry Jones, who was in the international \nspotlight in 2010 over his plan to burn Korans. A  trailer of the film was released on YouTube and translated into \nArabic around the same time as another film with negative Islamic depictions, titled \"Mohammad, Prophet of \nMuslims,\" was circulating in the public purview. Together,  the publicity surrounding these filmic productions  \nresulted in a massive outcry with Muslims across the world saying that they were insulting to the Islamic Prophet \nMohammad.\n\nTo that end, protests over the film erupted in the Egyptian capital city of Cairo as well as the Yemeni capital of \nSanaa, with the United States embassy being the main target in both cases.  The protests soon spread to \nembassies of Western countries located in various other Muslim countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the apparent film producer, Sam Bacile, was reported to have maintained a defiant stance in an \ninterview with the media.  Speaking from an undisclosed location,  Bacile said  \"Islam is a cancer\"  and asserted \nthat his work was intended to be a provocative political statement.  He insisted that it would help expose Islam's \nflaws to the world.  In the interview reported by Reuters, Bacile appeared unaffected by the news that the negative \nreception of his film may have contributed to the tragedy unfolding in the Middle East.  He said, \"I feel the security \nsystem (at the embassies) is no good. America should do something to change it.\" Of course, the media has \nsubsequently reported that Bacile was a pseudonym, with  the identity of the producer being linked to Nakoula \nBasseley Nakoula -- an apparent Coptic Christian who was convicted of bank fraud.  It was clear that  a great deal \nof mystery increasingly surrounded the anti-Islamic treatise.\n\nBlame for the violence and the killings initially fell the Islamist extremist militia, known as the Ansar al-Sharia \nbrigade. There were other reports suggesting the involvement of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb -- an offshoot of \nthe terror base, al-Qaida -- in the Libyan attack, with United States officials hinting that the assault may have been \na planned operation.  Stated differently, the attack in Libya might be distinct from other protests unfolding in other \nparts of the region over the controversial anti-Islamic film.  Instead, there was initial fear that it may have been an \noperation intended to be carried out on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United \nStates 11 years prior, and it may have utilized the convenient \"cover\" of these mass protests.  The rationale for \nsuch an attack, other than being of a pure Jihadist orientation, remained unclear; however, it was possible that al-\nQaida sought revenge over the killing of  al-Qaida deputy leader,  Abu Yahya al-Libi,  who died in a drone strike \nearlier in the year.  Notably, al-Qaida confirmed the death of al-Libi, whose name itself translates into \"the Libyan\" \non Sept. 11, 2012 -- the very day of the attack in Libya.  That being said, this was simply a theory in a still-evolving \n\n\n\nstory, which has focused on the mass unrest spreading across the Muslim world. (See \"Update\" below for more \ninformation about the emerging terror connection to the Benghazi tragedy.)\n\nThe Libyan government was quick to distance itself from the violence directed at Ambassador Stevens and the \nother State Department officials and to emphasize its strong ties to the United States. Libyan deputy Prime Minister \nMustafa Abu Shagour condemned the killing of the American diplomats, characterizing the violence  as cowardly.  \nAdditionally, Libya's interim President Mohammed Magarief apologized to the United States over the deaths of the \nAmerican diplomats, characterizing the bloodshed as \"cowardly criminal acts.\"  As well, Libya's deputy envoy to the \nUnited Nations, Ibrahim Dabashi, pledged that there would be an investigation into the violence.  In remarks in front \nof the United Nations Security Council, Dabashi referred to Ambassador Stevens' death as follows: \"We cannot \nunderstand how this group, or these persons, could have eliminated such a wonderful person.\"\n\nSpeaking on behalf of her country, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responded to the death of the \nState Department diplomats in Libya with the following statement: \"We are heartbroken by this terrible loss.\"  The \nstatement continued, \"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material...  \nThe United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But let me be clear: \nThere is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\"\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama  condemned \"in the strongest possible terms the outrageous and shocking\" \nattack.  Speaking from the Rose Garden at the White House, he paid tribute to the tragic end of Ambassador \nStevens' life, referencing the veteran diplomat's role in the overthrow of Libya's former dictatorial leader, Qadafi, \nsaying:  \"It is especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save.\"  \nPresident Obama  vowed to bring to justice those who carried out the attack that killed  Ambassador Stevens and \nother diplomatic personnel in Libya. To this end, President Obama said:  \"Justice will be done.\"\n\nHe also indicated an emerging belief that the attack in Benghazi might be connected to terrorism, as he asserted: \n\"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the president  ordered security at diplomatic missions be intensified around the world, and \nadditionally  deployed an anti-terrorism team consisting of experts from the Marines to Libya  to\n\nbolster security there in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nAs September 2012 entered its final week, tens of thousands marched in Benghazi to show their opposition to \narmed militias in Libya. On Sept. 21, 2012,  a mass of Libyans registered their outrage over the killing of \nAmbassador Stevens by storming the  compound of the Islamic extremist militia  Ansar al-Shariah Brigade, which \nwas  suspected  of being involved in the attack.  The crowd forced militia fighters out of the premises and set the \nbuilding ablaze.  Fighters from Ansar al-Shariah at first tried to disperse the crowd using gunfire, but soon \nabandoned the compound as they were overwhelmed by the wave of outraged and angry Libyans screaming \"No to \nmilitias.\" While no deaths were reported in the assault on the building, the action was a clear message that regular \nLibyans rejected the orientation of extremism in their country, only recently liberated from the tyranny of the Qadhafi \nregime.\n\nPolitics and the terrorism link to Benghazi tragedy\n\n\n\nIn late September 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton followed up on the president's \nwords in the Rose Garden of the White House that were uttered the day after the Benghazi tragedy unfolded.  \nClinton  publicly connected the attack at the United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi with terrorism.  She \nnoted that there was quite possibly a link with an al-Qaida affiliate in the region, perhaps even al-Qaida in the \nMaghreb.  Soon thereafter, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta offered a more definitive assessment as follows: \"It \nwas a terrorist attack. As we determined the details of what took place there and how that attack took place, it \nbecame clear that there were terrorists who had planned that attack.\"\n\nThe office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, attempted to address the shifting \nexplanation of what transpired in Benghazi.  DNI spokesperson, Shawn Turner explained that intelligence initially \nconcluded that the attack on the diplomatic mission was sparked in the aftermath of the violent protests in Egypt.  \nHe continued, \"We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who \nused that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. As we learned \nmore ... we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was deliberate and organized \nterrorist attack carried out by extremists.\"\n\nRepublicans were quick to pounce on the evolving explanation, first claiming that it was clear the killing of \nAmbassador Stevens was part of a terrorist attack, and later suggesting that the White House may have attempted \na \"cover up\" of the true events that transpired in Benghazi.  Specifically, they alleged that the Obama administration \nwas trying to hide the fact that an act of terrorism may have taken place, since such an occurrence would mar \nPresident Obama's national security record. That being said, in the wake of the attack, Libyan officials were quite \nclear in their belief that the assault on the United States diplomatic mission was the work of terrorists.  As well, \nPresident Barack Obama himself used the following words only one day after the attack (as noted above):  \"No \nacts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\"  Thus,  some observers noted that if a \"cover up\" was \nafoot, it was not a particularly well-plotted one since the president himself and the country's allies in Libya were all \nreferencing the possibility of terrorism.\n\nBy the second week of October 2012, about a  month ahead of the 2012 presidential election, the Republican \nchairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, convened emergency \nhearings, charging that security failures at the embassy in Benghazi led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and \nthree other Americans in Libya. For Democrats, the hearings constituted a transparent attempt to  embarrass the \nObama administration for inadequate diplomatic security at the embassy in Benghazi. But as noted in an article by \nDana Milbank in the Washington Post, diplomatic security may have been less than optimal  largely due to budget \ncuts brought about by Republicans in Congress.  To that end, Milbank wrote: \"For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled \nHouse proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department's Worldwide Security Protection program \u2014 well \nbelow the $2.15 billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration's \nrequest for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012. (Negotiations \nwith the Democrat-controlled Senate restored about $88 million of the administration's request.) Last year, \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans' proposed cuts to her department would be \"detrimental \nto America's national security\" -- a charge Republicans rejected.\"\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2012, Secretary of State Clinton said in an interview with CNN that she, and not the White House, took \nresponsibility for the security situation in Benghazi, leading up to the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack at the consulate \nthere that left four Americans, including the ambassador, dead.  She said: \"I take responsibility.\"  Secretary of State \nClinton also explained that the state of \"confusion\" in the aftermath of the attack contributed to inconsistent, and \nsometimes confusing, explanations of the cause of the attack in Libya, and the actual motivation of those \nresponsible. She said that she was taking public responsibility for what happened because she wanted \"to avoid \nsome kind of political gotcha.\"\n\n\n\nBut the issue was, indeed, becoming a political flashpoint. As noted above, House Republicans were determined \nto argue that the Obama administration was to be blamed for either insufficient security or a cover up.  The matter \nwas slipping into the presidential race where Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, was arguing that the situation in \nLibya was illustrative of President Obama's \"unraveling\" foreign policy.\n\nIn a pre-election presidential debate in the United States in mid-October 2012, there was a question from selected \nvoters on the subject of Libya and foreign policy. The Republican candidate attempted to draw President Obama \ninto a contretemps over the administration's handling of the terror attack in Benghazi.  Romney  suggested that the \npresident waited two weeks before characterizing the incident as a terror attack, saying, \"It took the president 14 \ndays before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.\"  But President Obama was sanguine in his \nknowledge that he had, on the day after the attack, promised in a speech from the White House Rose Garden the \nfollowing: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\"\n\nRomney seemed unwilling to let go of his  confidence in the two week timeline, although the moderator, Candy \nCrowley, confirmed that the president had indeed called the attack \"an act of terror\" on Sept. 12, 2012.\n\nBy Oct. 24, 2012, email correspondence between the States Department, the White House, and intelligence \nofficials, revealed that the aforementioned Islamist group, Ansar al-Sharia, had claimed responsibility for the \nattack.  Some critics of the Obama administration in the United States suggested that the emails would place \npressure on the White House.  That is to say, they might reinforce Republican claims that there was some sort of \nobfuscation involved in the situation, as well as a reluctance by the White House to acknowledge the terrorism \nelement. However, the Ansar al-Sharia connection was not a new revelation.  As noted above, right after the attack \non the Benghazi consulate, there were immediate reports the Ansar al-Sharia brigade was to blame.  Immediate \nreports, though, could not be considered conclusive. The group's claim of responsibility on Facebook, as noted by \nSecretary of State Clinton, was not the same as proof. Indeed, extremist groups often surface to claim responsibility \nfor attacks even when they are not involved; they do so in order to garner (dubious) cachet for the successful \nexecution of acts of terrorism.  Secretary of State Clinton said that the review board she appointed to investigate the \nattack would be \"looking at everything,\" instead of \"cherry picking one story here or one document there.\"\n\nNevertheless, it was expected that the political dimensions of the Benghazi would continue to dominate the \nlandscape in the United states, with oversight committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate \nexpected to look into the matter themselves. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the government of Tunisian \ngovernment arrested  Tunisian national in connection with the consulate attack in Libya.\n\nCongressional testimony on Benghazi tragedy\n\nThe abrupt resignation of General David Petraeus, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), re-ignited \nthe partisan fire over the Benghazi tragedy only days after President Barack Obama's re-election victory in \nNovember 2012.\n\nPetraeus resigned after issuing a statement in which he admitted that he had engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nThe timing of this revelation was regarded as unfortunate since Petraeus was expected to give testimony at \noversight committee meetings in the House of Representatives and the Senate over death of Ambassador Steven \nin Libya.  The exit of Petraeus appeared to further fuel speculation about a cover-up regarding Libya.  Some \nRepublicans returned to the (now-debunked) claim that it took the Obama administration several days to \ncharacterize the event as a terrorist attack, while others accused the White House of misleading the public over \n\n\n\nwhat happened in Benghazi. Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham were at the forefront of vociferous \ndemands for intensified investigations into the death of Ambassador Stevens in Libya.  In the crosshairs of McCain \nand Graham was United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, who made frequent appearances on television in the \ndays after the Libyan tragedy postulating the original theory that the protests  broke out over the anti-Islamic film \ndiscussed above.\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans pounced on the notion that the former CIA head was being forced into silence under \nthe guise of a personal indiscretion.  That theory was blown open when Petraeus attending congressional hearings \non Nov. 16, 2012, and gave testimony on the intelligence surrounding the Benghazi affair.\n\nIn those congressional hearings, according to the Associated Press, Petraeus told lawmakers that he believed all \nalong that the deadly attack on the United States consulate in Libya was an act of terrorism. Petraeus said that its \ndraft on the events included a reference to it as a terrorist attack, but that reference was removed from the final \nversion by a separate federal or intelligence agency.  He noted that the CIA's draft included a reference to named \nterror entities, such as al-Qaida, as being behind the attack, but that the names were replaced with the generic \nterm \"extremists\" along the way.\n\nCongressman Peter King expressed concern over this news, saying in an interview with the media: \"The fact is, the \nreference to al-Qaida was taken out somewhere along the line by someone outside the intelligence community. We \nneed to find out who did it and why.\"  But Senator  Mark Udall offered this counterpoint: \"The extremist description \nwas put in because in an unclassified document you want to be careful who you identify as being involved.\"  Udall \nalso pointed out that Petraeus himself acknowledged that signed off on the final draft of the report, which included \nthe reference to \"extremists\" in general terms.\n\nAccording to Representative Adam Schiff, Petraeus made clear that the White House played no political role in the \nprocess of putting the intelligence report together. Schiff was on the record saying, \"The general was adamant there \nwas no politicization of the process, no White House interference or political agenda. He completely debunked that \nidea.\"  Still, Republicans remained unsatisfied and retained their criticism of the Obama administration's handling \nof the situation. Senator Marco Rubio said that  Petraeus' testimony showed that \"the security measures were \ninadequate despite an overwhelming and growing amount of information that showed the area in Benghazi was \ndangerous, particularly on the night of September 11.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also expected to offer testimony to Congress on the \nLibya embassy attack. According to Republican Congresswoman  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Clinton would testify after \nan internal review of events was complete.\n\nSecretary of State defends handling of Benghazi consulate attack\n\nOn Jan. 23, 2013, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  gave testimony to committees in both houses of Congress over \nthe handling of the attack by terrorists on the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.  \nDuring her testimony, Secretary Clinton took responsibility for the security failures that led to the attack, which \nended fatally for Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.  The matter spurred a heated \npartisan debate, with many Republicans accusing the Obama administration of trying to obfuscate the terrorist \nelement of the attack, even though both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Clinton wasted no time in \ncharacterizing the attack as such.  The matter reached such heights as to cause leading Republicans to pillory \nUnited Nations Ambassador Susan Rice for adhering to the intelligence talking points during Sunday morning news \nshows after the attack, which at the time suggested that the attack was the result of a spontaneous disturbance.  \n\n\n\nMoreover, several conservative voices accused Secretary of State Clinton of faking her head concussion that \nprevented her from testifying earlier before Congress, speculating that she was trying to evade the experience.\n\nNow that Secretary of State Clinton was before Congress, she  tearfully recalled accompanying President Barack \nObama to receive the bodies of the four victims.  As well, Secretary Clinton accepted all the recommendations of a \nnon-partisan inquiry board looking into the attack and security lapses, saying:  \"Nobody is more committed to \ngetting this right.  I am determined to leave the state department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.\" \nThe previous controversy over the information Ambassador Rice offered in September 2012 emerged during \nClinton's testimony with Republican  Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin saying, \"We were misled that there were \nsupposedly protests and then something sprang out of that, an assault sprang out of that.\"  Secretary Clinton \nresponded with discernible outrage, asserting: \"But with all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans;  \nwas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some \nAmericans.\" Punctuating her anger with raps on the table in front of her, Clinton continued, \"What difference, at this \npoint, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever \nhappening again, senator.\"  Another confrontation occurred when Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky \nRepublican suggested that  Clinton failing to  read the diplomatic cables from Libya seeking additional security \nahead of the attack as\"inexcusable.\"  Rand pugnaciously suggested that if he were president,  Clinton would have \nbeen fired.  He said: \"Had I been president at the time and I found that you did not read the cables, 'I would have \nrelieved you of your post.' \"  Clinton, who enjoys the highest approval ratings of any politician -- male or female -- on \nthe national scene, merely  smiled in reaction to this  hypothetical scenario.\n\nNote that at the start of May 2013, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States released \nsurveillance photos of three individuals who were on the grounds of the United States Special Mission in Benghazi \nwhen it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2012. The attack resulted in the death of Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to \nLibya, and three other Americans.  The FBI was hoping that the release of the three men on the United States \ndiplomatic compound would spur the memories of persons able to shed light on the violent attack, and thus assist \nin bringing those responsible to justice.  The FBI did not specifically identify these three men as suspects although, \naccording to NBC News, the agency has 45 possible persons on a list of \"persons suspected of involvement in the \nattack.\"  Meanwhile, an anonymous source from United States law enforcement told CNN News that it was \nbelieved that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula may have played a role in  attacks on the consulate office in Libya.\n\nUnited States confirms complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan\n\nIn January 2013, as Afghan President Hamid Karzai arrived in the United States capital of Washington D.C. for \nmeetings, the Obama administration was reported to be considering a complete withdrawal of troops from \nAfghanistan. In a conference call, Ben Rhodes -- the deputy national security adviser for strategic communication -- \nacknowledged that the total withdrawal of troops (known as the \"zero option\") was indeed an option that the Obama \nadministration had on the proverbial table. Rhodes said, \"The U.S. does not have an inherent objective of X number \nof troops in Afghanistan. We have an objective of making sure there's no safe haven for al-Qaida within Afghanistan \nand making sure that the Afghan government has a security force that is sufficient to ensure the stability of the \nAfghan government and the denial of that safe haven.\" He continued, \"So that's what guides us and that's what \ncauses us to look for different potential troop numbers, or not having potential troops in the country.\" One possibility \nwas the notion of using non-military means of meeting the national interests in Afghanistan.\n\nRhodes' statement was an indication that in his second term, President Barack Obama intended to put more of his \nown stamp on foreign policy, as shown by his selection of former Senator Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. The \nVietnam war veteran holds that military engagement should be used judiciously and shares Obama's skepticism \nover the Iraq war; perhaps most pertinently, Hagel has advocated a faster withdrawal from Afghanistan. Overall, \n\n\n\nmany aspects of Hagel's foreign policy orientation tracks harmoniously with that of President Obama, and was \ncertainly a departure from the neo-conservative foreign policy, which was vociferously championed by \nRepublicans during the previous Bush administration.\n\nA report in the Washington Post noted that some elements of the Obama administration have advanced the idea of \nreducing the United States' troop presence in Afghanistan radically to only 2,500 after 2014. By way of comparison, \nthere were about 68,000 United States troops stationed in Afghanistan at the start of 2013. Those voices in the \nObama administration -- quite in contrast to certain military officials -- have suggested that it would be the best way \nto end a long, expensive, and increasingly unpopular war. But some military officials believe that an accelerated \nwithdrawal from Afghanistan would be irresponsible. Certainly, some reports from the Pentagon indicate that \nAfghanistan security forces are barely able to manage their duties without support from United States forces.\n\nRegardless of the efficiency of Afghan security forces, the reality was that the foreign troop presence in Afghanistan \nwas highly unpopular and the Afghan government itself was not restrained in casting aspersions on the United \nStates' troops stationed in Afghanistan. Indeed, just ahead of his trip to the United States in January 2013, Afghan \nPresident Hamid Karzai blamed the United States troop presence for the rise in corruption and violence in his \ncountry, the actual causality of bloodshed in that country over decades notwithstanding. The formulation of a post-\n2014 foreign troop presence in Afghanistan was expected to be the main agenda item to be discussed during \nKarzai's visit to the United States.\n\nThere appeared to be little concurrence between the United States and Afghanistan on the nature of a continued  \nUnited States troops presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014.  According to the New York Times, despite his bluster \nabout the United States military in Afghanistan being the cause of  troubles in his country, Karzai wanted as  many \nas 15,000 troops to remain past the official end of the war.  By contrast, the United States was considering a total \nwithdrawal  by 2014.\n\nNote that on Jan. 11, 2013, after a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai,  United States President Barack \nObama said that a transition of security responsibilities to Afghan forces would ensue over the course of  2013 with \na complete end of the war in Afghanistan  at the end of 2014.  The Obama White House also released a statement \nmaking it clear that the year 2013 was intended to bring an end to United States combat operations in Afghanistan.  \nExplaining his exit strategy from Afghanistan, President Obama said, \"But let me say it as plainly as I can: Starting \nthis spring, our troops will have a different mission -- training, advising, assisting Afghan forces.  And by the end of \nnext year, 2014, the transition will be complete -- Afghans will have full responsibility for their security, and this war \nwill come to a responsible end.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the governments of the United States and Afghanistan additionally agreed to a plan to engage Taliban \nofficials in future peace talks, which Karzai said were intended to  return \"peace and stability to Afghanistan as soon \nas possible.\"\n\nAttack on U.S. embassy in Turkey evokes recent memory of Benghazi tragedy\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2013,  a suicide attack on the United States embassy in the Turkish capital city of Ankara left two \npeople dead and several people injured.  Among the dead were the suicide bomber and a guard at the embassy.  \nTurkey's extreme-left Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), which is  designated to be a terrorist \norganization by the United States, soon claimed responsibility for the attack.  An online statement by the DHKP-C \nread as follows: \"Our warrior Alisan Sanli carried out an act of self-sacrifice on 1 February 2013, by entering the \n\n\n\nAnkara embassy of the United States, murderer of the people of the world.\"  For its part, the United States warned \nAmericans citizens to avoid diplomatic missions in Turkey  for the foreseeable future.  The incident evoked \nunfortunate reminders of the attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, which left \nAmbassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead in Libya. Not surprisingly, leading politicians in \nthe United States were referring to both attacks as evidence of a vital and pressing need for a foreign security \nreview.\n\nCIA operating secret air base for unmanned drones in Saudi Arabia\n\nOn Feb. 6, 2013, various media outlets in the United States were reporting that the United States Central \nIntelligence Agency (CIA) was operating a secret air base for unmanned drones in Saudi Arabia.  The air base and \ndrone operations had been in place  for the previous two years are was oriented towards targeting  terrorists linked \nwith  al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which has its stronghold  in Yemen.\n\nThe use of drones in places like Yemen came to the fore in 2011 when the unmanned aircraft was used to eliminate \nAnwar al-Awlaki -- a United States-born terrorist orchestrator and propaganda communicator for al-Qaida in the \nArabian Peninsula.  Alwaki used his command of language and biculturalism, along with modern media, to reach \nout to young Muslims in across the world with the objective of radicalizing them and urging them to turn to terrorism. \nHe was also believed to have been responsible for orchestrating a number of attempted attacks, including the \nrecruitment of infamous Nigerian \"underwear\"  bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried but failed to blow up  \na United States-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009.\n\nThe existence of the secret air base has been known to United States media but was not disclosed until the New \nYork Times decided to publish a report on the matter.\n\nUnited States officials in the Obama administration expressed alarm over the revelation  about the drone air base in \nSaudi Arabia, noting the success of the drone program in killing \"high value targets.\"  The also pointed to the fact \nthat it could  undermine operations against  al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and undermine the United States' \ncooperation with Saudi Arabia on counter-terrorism efforts.  Indeed, news of a secret United States air base on \nSaudi soil could only turn into a complicated geopolitical challenge for the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nAt home in the United States, critics of the drone program have challenged  the legitimacy of eliminating United \nStates citizens (such as Alwaki and his son) via a drone strike and without a trial.  That being said, the United \nStates government has argued that it was operating within legal bounds by targeting an enemy of the state, and a \nleader of a terror enclave that has  declared war on the United States.  Only a day earlier on Feb. 5, 2013,  a United \nStates Justice Department memorandum was leaked to the media,  detailing the Obama administration's argument \nfor eliminating any American abroad who is believed to be a \"senior, operational leader\" of al-Qaida or its allies.\n\nIt should be noted that the use of drones in anti-terrorism efforts has been expanded under the Obama \nadministration. It was yet to be determined if President Obama would pay a political price for the controversial drone \nprogram, or, if war-weary Americans would view targeted killings of apparent enemies as preferable  to traditional \nwarfare with its mounting death toll of soldiers.\n\nU.S. tightens sanctions against Iran; Ayatollah rebuffs talks with U.S.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 6, 2013, the United States tightened its financial sanctions against Iran, making it more difficult for that \ncountry to spend oil revenue.  Iran has already been subject to harsh international sanctions due to its controversial \nnuclear development program, its clandestine nuclear development activities, and its lack of cooperation with \nnuclear inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It has additionally been subject to unilateral financial \nsanctions by the United States and other Western countries, in an effort to place pressure on Iran to relinquish its \nnuclear program, which most international powers believe is not intended for peaceful purposes but oriented \ntowards nuclear weaponization.  Existing financial sanctions were already having an effect on Iran's economy, \nmaking it difficult to procure basic good, such as cooking oil and medical supplies,  creating huge obstacles for Iran \nto do business with other countries, and contributing to a precipitous decline in the value of the Iranian currency, the \nrial.                \n\nOn Feb. 7, 2013, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rebuffed the notion of direct talks with the United States during an \naddress that was published on the Internet.  With an apparent reference to United States Vice President's \nsuggestion of direct bilateral talks, followed by the tightening of sanctions, Khamenei said the United States was \ngiving the appearance of being open to negotiations while simultaneously  \"pointing a gun at Iran.\"  He further \nasserted that talks with the United States \"would solve nothing.\"  At issue were upcoming multilateral talks on Iran's \nnuclear program.\n\nBiden was suggesting parallel bilateral talks, saying that his country was prepared to hold direct negotiations with \nIran \"when the Iranian leadership, supreme leader, is serious.\"  He continued, \"That offer stands, but it must be real \nand tangible and there has to be an agenda that they are prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for \nthe exercise.\" Of course, on Feb. 7, 2013,  with Khamenei's reaction on the record, it was apparent that the notion \nof bilateral talks was just an exercise in theory.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2013,  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, insisted that his country was not \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  He also said that his preference would be the prohibition of nuclear weapons across \nthe world.  Still, Khamenei foreclosed the notion of global pressure on Iran and made it clear that if Iran wanted to \nmanufacture a nuclear bomb, no other country would be able to stop the process.  He said: \"We believe that \nnuclear weapons must be obliterated, and we do not intend to make nuclear weapons, but if we had not had this \nbelief and had decided to possess nuclear weapons, no power could have ever been able to stop us.\"\n\nWith a presidential election scheduled to be held in June 2013, there was no likelihood that the Iranian authorities \nwould give way to the will of the international community.  In fact, outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave \nvoice to the domestic political climate in Iran when he said in a national address on state television: \"On behalf of \nthe Iranian nation, I say that whoever thinks that the Iranian nation would surrender to pressure is making a huge \nmistake and will take his wish to the grave.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks in mid-February 2013 involving United Nations inspectors  yielded no progress.  Inspectors from \nthe United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had traveled to Iran \nto try to reach an agreement aimed at allowing inspectors back into the country to continue their investigation into \nIran's suspected nuclear weapons program.  Of particular concern to IAEA inspectors has been the Parchin military \nbase where explosives tests related to nuclear weaponry were suspected to have taken place.  There were \nprevailing suspicions that Iran had  \"sanitized\" the site to conceal evidence of clandestine activities. That being said, \nIAEA inspectors attempting to reinvigorate the  nuclear investigation characterized their efforts with the Iranians as \nwholly unproductive.  In a news conference, the chief United Nations inspector, Herman Nackaerts, said that he and \nhis colleagues \"could not finalize the document\" aimed at resuming the inquiry, and that no new date had been set \nfor further negotiations.\n\n\n\nThere was an emerging sense -- even from the West -- that the door was closing on a peaceful resolution to the \nchallenge of the Iranian nuclear issue. According to a report by Reuters News,\n\na Western diplomat accredited to the IAEA was on the record saying: \"Despite its many commitments to do so, Iran \nhas not negotiated in good faith. It appears that we now have to ask ourselves if this is still the right tactic.\"\n\nThe expressed admission  by an IAEA-aligned diplomat of the failure of the negotiations progress meant that non-\nmilitary options were quickly dissipating.  Without progress on the diplomatic front, and with Iran in a stalemate with \nthe international community,  the specter of military action loomed large.  Israel has made it clear that it was willing \nto  use force, if necessary, to prevent Iran from developing its suspected nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt should be noted that Iran has done little to reduce the anxiety of the Western world.  First, the IAEA had already \nmade it clear that engagement with Iran  yielded absolutely no progress and that concerns related to Iran's nuclear \nprogram remained in tact.  Second,  Iran had denied IAEA inspectors from visiting the aforementioned Parchin site.\n\nThe case against Iran was further bolstered by the news that IAEA inspectors identified  new centrifuges at  Natanz \n-- Iran's main enrichment plant.  As reported by Reuters News on Feb. 21, 2013,  Iran  was now  installing \nadvanced machines to refine uranium -- a development that could potentially accelerate the  accumulation of \nmaterials used to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe  new model of centrifuges, known as the IR2m, was able to enrich  uranium at rates two or three times faster \nthan prior levels  to date.  Although the new model of centrifuges were not yet believed to be fully functional, Iran \nwas already expanding its stockpile of higher grade uranium,  moving gradually closer to the so-called \"red line\" \nidentified by Israel as its final grounds for taking military action.\n\nIn a bit of encouraging news,  the IAEA also reported that Iran resumed converting some of its 20 percent \nconcentration uranium  for use as reactor fuel in late 2012.  That usage likely curtailed Iran's ability to develop a  \nhigher-grade uranium stockpile.  It was  possible that this information could cause Israel to delay military action \nagainst Iranian nuclear facilities.  Nevertheless, in the third week of February 2013,  Israel's Ambassador to the \nUnited States Micheal Oren reiterated his country's position that if no progress was made in the effort to stop Iran's \nnuclear development program, there was a high likelihood of a military gesture by mid-2013.  Oren made these \nremarks during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" television show.\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in condemning Iran  over the installation \nof the IR2m centrifuges at the main uranium enrichment plant of Natanz.  As stated by United States Department of \nState spokesperson Victoria Nuland: \"The installation of new advanced centrifuges would be a further escalation \nand a continuing violation of Iran's (U.N.) obligations. It would mark yet another provocative step.\"\n\nAt  the end of February 2013, Iran  attended multilateral talks in Kazakhstan with the  so-called P5+1 group -- the  \nUnited Nations Security Council permanent members of China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom,  and the \nUnited States, plus plus Germany. According to Reuters News,  Vincent Floreani, a spokesperson for France's \nForeign Ministry, said the P5+1 countries were prepared to table a new offer for Iran, which could change the \ntrajectory of the negotiations to date .  He said, \"We will make a new offer that will have significant new elements. \nThe approach ... is to begin gradually with confidence-building measures. We want a real exchange that will lead to \nconcrete results.\"  For its part, Iran was claiming that it looked forward to these talks.  Iran's United Nations \n\n\n\nAmbassador Mohammad Khazaei said: \"As the representative of the Islamic Republic, I announce that Iran is not \nessentially against negotiations. Iranians are a civilized nation and always favor dialogue and are opposed to war.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the discussions in Kazakhstan, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief negotiator, characterized the meeting in \na positive tone, describing the aforementioned new offer from the P5+1 countries as  \"more realistic and positive\"  \nand \"a little closer to Iran's position.\" According to the New York Times, the offer would require  Iran end its program \nof  uranium enrichment to 20 percent,  export its stockpile of existing more highly enriched uranium, and close its \nFordo enrichment facility.  In return or these three actions, the P5+1 countries would offer Iran sanctions relief,  \nincluding permission to resume trading of gold and precious metals, and permission to resuming limited  petroleum \ntrading and international banking.\n\nAt the end of these talks in Kazakhstan where the new offer was brought forward, all the parties reportedly agreed \nto a round of further discussions in April 2013.  It was to be seen if these negotiation on the basis of the new \nproposal  would prove fruitful or accentuate the prevailing perception that the door on a negotiated resolution was \nrapidly closing.\n\nPressure on Iran was mounting with the call from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \nYukiya Amano, on March 4, 2013, saying that Iran should \"proceed with a sense of urgency\" and focus on \nachieving real and rapid results.  Amano reiterated its stance that the IAEA \"cannot conclude that all nuclear \nmaterial in Iran is in peaceful activities.\"  At issue was the IAEA's desire to inspect the  Parchin military site where \ntesting related to nuclear weapons development was believed to have taken place, but where access to IAEA \ninspectors has long been subject to denial by Iran.\n\nOn the same day, United States Vice President Joe Biden said that President Barack Obama was \"not bluffing\" \nabout the United States' determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  In a speech in front of a \nmajor pro-Israeli lobbying group, he said, \"We're not looking for war. We're ready to negotiate peacefully. But all \noptions including military force are on the table. While that window is closing, we believe there is still time and \nspace (for diplomacy).\"\n\nThe main question for the IAEA, the United Nations Security Council, the P5+1 countries, Israel, and the global \ncommunity at large, involved the matter of how easy (or difficult) it would be for Iran to increase its uranium \nenrichment activities in a manner that would allow for the development of a nuclear bomb. Further, what kind of \ntimeline was at stake in achieving this end?  Was United States Vice President Joe Biden's statement on Iran on \nMarch 4, 2013, pure bluster? Or was it a warning  of sorts from Washington to Tehran?\n\nThese questions would likely be complicated by the announcement of  new uranium discoveries in Iran and the \nIranians' declaration that it was expanding its nuclear development program.  Iran said that it had found  new \nuranium deposits and as many  as 16 sites were deemed to be suitable for the construction of new power plants.  \nIran additionally said that the discovery of uranium deposits would multiply \"the current amount of [uranium] \nresources,\" and thus facilitate the expansion of the country's nuclear development program.\n\nBy mid-March 2013, as United States President Barack Obama was preparing to embark on his first official visit to \nIsrael as a sitting American head of state,  the issue of Iran's nuclear development program was dominating the \ninternational geopolitical landscape.  For some time, Israel has threatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear \nfacilities, in the interests of national security.  Indeed, Iran does not recognize the Jewish state of Israel and has \n\n\n\nissued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to \"wipe Israel off the map,\" essentially posing an existential threat to \nthe Jewish State.\n\nWhile the United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in \nasserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear \nweapon.\n\nAhead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to \nproduce a nuclear weapon.  In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israeli, he said that Iran was \"over a year or \nso\" away from being able to develop a nuclear weapon.  Still, President Obama said that he was not interested in \nleaving action against Iran for the last moment.  He said, \"We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to \nactually develop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close.\" Describing the purpose of his \nmeeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, \"My message  \nwill be the same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to \nkeep all options on the table.\"  The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear \nfacilities, saying, \"When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States \nobviously has significant capabilities.\"\n\nOnce \"in country\" in Israel, President Obama confirmed his stance on Iran, asserting the United States' resolve to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu  underlined the United States \npresident's commitment on this issue,  saying he was \"absolutely convinced that the president [Obama] is \ndetermined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. In a significant development, Netanyahu acknowledged \nthat Obama's stated one  year timeline on Iran's nuclear weapons development capacity was correct, although he \nnoted that his [Netanyahu's] so-called \"red line\" involved the uranium enrichment aspect of weaponization and not \nthe actual building of a nuclear weapon.  Of course, both uranium enrichment and the manufacture of a bomb would \nbe involved in nuclear weapons development.  Accordingly, it seemed that  President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu were respectively offering a sense of unanimity on the issue of Iran and its nuclear development \nprogram. \n\nBin Laden's spokesperson captured; set to be tried in New York\n\nOn March 7, 2013, reports were emerging that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith  had been captured in Jordan and was \ntransported to the United States where he was expected to face trial in a New York court.  Abu Ghaith was said to \nbe a spokesperson for the now-deceased terrorist mastermind, Osama Bin Laden; he also shared a personal \nconnection with Bin Laden as his son-in-law.  Assistant Director George Venizelos of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) declared in a statement:  \"Sulaiman Abu Ghaith held a key position in al-Qaida, comparable to \nthe consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime. He used his position to threaten the \nUnited States and incite its enemies.\"                    \n\nAfter the terror attacks in the United States in 2001, Abu Ghaith was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship. But his \napparent Jihadist inclinations did not cease as Abu Ghaith was identified in recorded footage, alongside Bin Laden \nand   Ayman al-Zawahiri,  threatening the interests of United States during the period of 2001 through 2002.                    \n\nAbu Gaith would now face justice for  charges of \"conspiracy to kill United States nationals.\"  His capture was one \nof the most significant developments in the fight against Jihadist terrorism since the elimination of Bin Laden in \n2011.  While scores of foreign terror suspects have been  convicted in United States federal courts since 2001, the \nimpending trial of Abu Ghaith in a New York court  would mark the first major prosecution of a senior al-Qaida \nleader on American soil.  Some Republican lawmakers objected to this course, arguing that Abu Ghaith should \ninstead be sent to Guantanamo Bay.  However, the Obama administration in the United States has been vociferous \n\n\n\nin its position that Abu Ghaith be tried in a federal court, rather than adding to the population of the controversial \nprison at Guantanamo, which it would ultimately like to close.                    \n\nAfghan \"insider\" opens fire on United States troops; Karzai accuses U.S. of working with Taliban\n\nOn March 11, 2013, a man clad in the uniform of an  Afghan police officer opened fire on security forces at a police \nstation in Afghanistan,  killing two United States troops and three Afghan troops, and wounding several others. The \nattack took place as United States and Afghan troops were holding an early morning meeting. Officials said the \nattack was an \"insider\" operation and  the killer was identified as a member of the Afghan security forces.  Although \nthe killer was eventually eliminated and the area was said to have been secured, the United States military \ncharacterized the violence as a \"betrayal.\"\n\nThis incident in Wardak occurred only one day after United States special forces withdrew from the province. It also \noccurred  just after the Afghan government, led by President Hamid Karzai, made the bizarre assertion of collusion \nbetween United States forces and the Taliban.  Karzai made this claim on March 10, 2013, following a bombing in \nthe Aghan capital of Kabul that left around ten people dead.  Karzai suggested that there were \"ongoing daily talks \nbetween Taliban, American and foreigners in Europe and in the Gulf states\" and advanced the notion that the \n\"Taliban want longer presence of foreigners -- not their departure from Afghanistan.\" The commander of the NATO-\nled forces in Afghanistan, Marine General Joseph Dunford, took vociferous exception to Karzai's claim, declaring: \n\"We have fought too hard over the past 12 years. We have shed too much blood over the past 12 years. We have \ndone too much to help the Afghan Security Forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or \ninstability would be to our advantage.\"  It should be noted that Karzai has described by political insiders, including a \nfomer United States ambassador to Afghanistan,  as having a history of erratic behavior.\n\nUnited States President Obama emphasizes bond with Israel in first official state visit as president\n\nOn March 20, 2013, United States President Barack Obama traveled to Israel in his first official state visit as \npresident. The trip would offer an opportunity for the American president to improve frosty personal ties with Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, rather than operate as a policy catalyst of any sort. The White House in the \nUnited States indicated that meetings between Obama and Netanyahu were not likely to focus on the peace \nprocess with Palestinians, since the movement on that track was expected to be slow. Instead, the focus would be \non the matter of Iran's nuclear aspirations and the priority to prevent that country, which poses a threat to Israel, \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. The war in Syria was also likely to be addressed during bilateral meetings. But \nthe essential purpose for the trip appeared to be oriented towards recalibrating the relationship between the two \nleaders.\n\nIn 2013, the political landscape was quite different from the scenario of the last few years, and the political \ndynamics for the two men had certainly changed. Whereas United States President Obama had been decisively re-\nelected to power in November 2012 and inaugurated for a second term in January 2013, Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu had emerged from his country's elections as the weakened leader presiding over a precarious coalition. \nNow, with both men having to deal with one another and with the geopoitical stakes in the ever-more volatile Middle \nEast higher than ever, it appeared that the time was right for a \"re-setting\" of the relationship between the two men \nand an affirmation of bilateral ties.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama arrived in Israel for this highly-anticipated visit on March 20, 2013. As the president disembarked \nfrom Air Force One onto the tarmac of Ben-Gurion International Airport, he was personally greeted by both Israeli \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres.\n\nPresident Obama affirmed the United States' long-standing and unbreakable bond with Israel saying, \"Just as we \nhave for these past 65 years, the United States is proud to stand with you as your strongest ally and your greatest \nfriend.\" Emphasizing the bilateral bond between the two countries, President Obama characterized his visit to Israel \nas \"an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our nations, to restate America's unwavering \ncommitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.\" He continued \nby noting that the United States' interests intersected with those of Israel, saying, \"It's in our fundamental security \ninterest to stand with Israel.\" There was a moment of levity when President Obama said to Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Peres, \"It's a lovely day. Great to see you, great to be here ... It's good to get away from \nCongress.\"\n\nDuring a joint press conference, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made a clear departure from the challenging tone \ntaken with President Obama in previous venues of this sort. In one infamous case, Netanyahu stood next to Obama \nduring a news conference and lectured the leader of the free world on Israel's unique security challenges. This time, \nNetanyahu's attitude towards Obama was significantly more conciliatory, and even marked by amity. Indeed, Prime \nMinister Netanyahu offered a heartfelt welcome to the American president, saying, \"I come here today with a simple \nmessage. Thank you.\" He continued, \"Baruch haba ley Israel \u2014 welcome to Israel. The people of Israel are \nhonored to have you visit.\" Netanyahu further thanked President Obama for the United States' support for the \nJewish state of Israel saying, \"Thank you for standing by Israel at this time of historic change in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe trip was not purely focused on improved personal relations between the two heads of government, The serious \nchallenge of a nuclearized Iran was also on the table for discussion. Indeed, even before President Obama's trip to \nIsrael, the issue of Iran's nuclear development program has loomed large. It should be noted that Iran does not \nrecognize the Jewish state of Israel and has issued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to \"wipe Israel off the \nmap,\" essentially posing an existential threat to the Jewish State. With such threats prevailing and with the prospect \nof a nuclear-armed Iran on the horizon, Israel has threatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear facilities. While \nthe United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in \nasserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear \nweapon.\n\nAhead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to \nproduce a nuclear weapon. In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israel, he said that Iran was \"over a year or so\" \naway from being able to develop a nuclear weapon. Still, President Obama said he was not interested in leaving \naction against Iran for the last moment. He said, \"We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually \ndevelop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close.\" Describing the purpose of his meeting \nwith Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, \"My message will be \nthe same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to keep all \noptions on the table.\" The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, \nsaying, \"When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States obviously \nhas significant capabilities.\"\n\nOnce \"in country\" in Israel, President Obama confirmed his stance on Iran, asserting the United States' resolve to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu underlined the United States \npresident's commitment on this issue, saying he was \"absolutely convinced that the president [Obama] is \ndetermined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nIn a significant development, Netanyahu acknowledged that Obama's stated one year timeline on Iran's nuclear \nweapons development capacity was correct, although he noted that his [Netanyahu's] so-called \"red line\" involved \nthe uranium enrichment aspect of weaponization and not the actual building of a nuclear weapon. Of course, both \nuranium enrichment and the manufacture of a bomb would be involved in nuclear weapons development. \nAccordingly, it seemed that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu were respectively offering a sense of \nunanimity on the issue of Iran and its nuclear development program. Indeed, as noted by President Obama himself, \nthere was \"not a lot of daylight\" between American and Israeli assessments on the stage of Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment program, although he added that there was \"time to resolve this diplomatically.\"\n\nNetanyahu reserved the right to take unilateral action against Iran saying that he was certain Obama appreciated \nthe fact that Israel \"can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends.\" He \ncontinued, \"Today we have both the right and the capability to defend ourselves.\" For his part, President Obama \noffered concurrence on this point, saying \"Each country has to make its own decisions when it comes to the \nawesome decision to engage in any kind of military action. And Israel is differently situated than the United States.\"\n\nPresident Obama also expressed hopes that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process might be revitalized. Although \nPresident Obama was scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinians in the West Bank \nand Gaza appeared to have no enthusiasm for the American president. The previously-hopeful attitude of \nPalestinians towards Obama was now replaced with jaded resentment, presumably due to the United States' \nopposition to the Palestinians' unilateral bid for statehood at the United Nations and the lack of active participation \nby the Obama administration on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\n\nConversely, President Obama -- who arrived in Israel in 2013 without great support from the Israeli people -- was \nnow experiencing the benefits of thawing relations. The majority of Israelis were not fans of President Obama, \nviewing with suspicion his relentless push for Israel to end its settlement activities in predominantly Palestinian \nareas, as well as his decision not to visit Israel during his 2009 trip to the Middle East when he gave his landmark \npro-democracy speech in Cairo. Now, however, the tide appeared to be turning.\n\nIsraelis watched President Obama's motorcade as it drove through the streets of Jerusalem from the homes and on \ntelevision with interest. News commentators in Israel cast the temperature between Obama and Netanyahu as \ngenuinely warmer. If the news commentators in Israel were reflective of national sentiment, Obama's declaration \n\"Tov lihiyot shuv ba'aretz\" -- Hebrew for \"It is good to be back in Israel\" -- resonated very positively with Israelis. \nThe Israeli news commentators also paid particular -- and affirmative -- attention to President Obama's statement \nthat Israel was \"the historic homeland of the Jewish people.\" President Obama said, \"More than 3,000 years ago, \nthe Jewish people lived here, tended the land here, prayed to God here. And after centuries of exile and \npersecution, unparalleled in the history of man, the founding of the Jewish state of Israel, was a rebirth, a \nredemption, unlike any in history. Today, the sons of Abraham and the daughters of Sarah are fulfilling the dream of \nthe ages: to be masters of their own fate in their own sovereign state.\" This fulsome nod to the plight of Jews \nthrough history appeared to reify the essential and historic claim of the Jewish people on the land of Israel.\n\nPresident Obama also earned personal capital in the simple gesture of assisting 89-year old President Peres along \nthe red carpet. As stated by one Israeli commentator, \"Who Remembers Romney Now?\" in a clear reference to the \nfact that Prime Minister Netayahu and many Israelis were hoping for a one-term Obama presidency. Likewise, as \nnoted by Herb Kleinom in the Jerusalem Post, \"He had us at \"Shalom.\"\n\n\n\nOn March 21, 2013, as expected, President Obama met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in \nRamallah. There he called on Palestinian leaders to resume peace talks with Israel, regardless of ongoing Israeli \nsettlement building. Obama's arrival in the West Bank was not without political stress. Palestinian extremists \ngreeted the United States leader by firing rockets from Gaza into the Israeli border city of Sderot in violation of a \nprevailing ceasefire agreement.\n\nOn the same day, President Obama delivered a speech to Israeli university students at the International Convention \nCenter in Jerusalem. In that address, he acknowledged the obstacle to resolving the Palestinian issue, but asserted \nthat peace \"is the only path to true security.\" President Obama noted that the path to ensuring Israel remained a \ndemocratic and Jewish state necessitated peace and a two-state solution with Israel existing alongside a future \nPalestinian state.\n\nPresident Obama said, \"Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and \nthrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine.\" He also \noutlined the rights for Palestinians, saying, \"The Palestinian people's right to self-determination and justice must \nalso be recognized.\" On the issue of national security, and given the challenge of global opinion, President Obama \nurged Israel to take on the challenge of peace, saying: \"Given the frustration in the international community, Israel \nmust reverse an undertow of isolation. And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli \npeople is through the absence of war -- because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough, to stop \nevery enemy from inflicting harm.\"\n\nIrrespective of the controversial subject matter, President Obama's address was well-received by the Israeli youth \nwho applauded his passionate call for the cause of peace, gave him a standing ovation in response to his good \nhumored attitude to a heckler, and even expressed support for the notion of a Palestinian state.\n\nA state dinner, hosted by Israeli President Shimon Peres, brought a conclusion to President Obama's first official \nvisit to israel as the American head of state and leader of the free world. There, President Peres awarded Obama \nwith Israel's Presidential Medal of Distinction in recognition of his [Obama's] \"tireless work to make Israel strong, to \nmake peace possible.\" As he bestowed on President Obama Israel's highest honor, President Peres said: \"The \npath to tomorrow may be fraught with obstacles, I believe we can overcome them with our determination and with \nyour commitment.\"\n\nNote: Barack Obama is the first serving United States president to receive the Medal of Distinction from the state of \nIsrael.\n\nNorth Korea and the Nuclear Threat of War\n\nAt the start of 2013,  the United Nations tightened sanctions against North Korea.  This move was made in \nresponse to North Korea's December 2012 rocket launch.  For its part, North Korea reacted with anger and \npromised strong retaliation.  All expectations were that another nuclear test might be in the offing, although North \nKorea was raising the anxiety of the international community by raising the rhetoric and threatening an even \nharsher actions. North Korea  warned of retribution against the United States, which it described as a \"sworn \nenemy.\"  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: \"We do not hide that a \nvariety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in \nthe upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean \npeople.\"  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to noted that it would take action against South Korea, if it \nparticipated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency  was also reporting that \n\n\n\nPyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since \"the U.N. Security Council has been reduced \ninto an organization bereft of impartiality and balance.\"                          \n\nNorth Korea's bellicose language was matched with provocative visual imagery.  At issue was the release of a  \nthree-minute video on TouTube depicting a North Korean man's dream sequence in which the city of New York is \ndestroyed, with the 1985 song \"We are the world\" playing in the background.\n\nA caption, which was translated from Korean in The Guardian newspaper, reads as follows: \"Somewhere in the \nUnited States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.  It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire \nstarted by itself.\"\n\nIt continues:  \"Despite attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us \u2026 never will anyone be able to stop the \npeople marching towards a final victory.\" The video was reported to have been released by  North Korea's state-run \nmedia and while of amateur quality in some regards, it nonetheless represented a sharp threat against the United \nStates and/or the interests of its allies.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that North Korea may have selected an even earlier \ndate to go forward with its third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity was emanating from the same area where \nNorth Korea conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry \nindicated that country's belief, saying, \"We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.\"  Meanwhile, the \nUnited States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to \nbe one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of \nthe international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test \nwas twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium \nin this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead.\n\nNorth Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a \n\"miniaturized\" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: \"It was confirmed \nthat the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and \nlighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the \nsurrounding ecological environment.\"\n\nNorth Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against \"U.S. hostility\" and warned that further  \nmoves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear \ntest  \"was only the first response\" taken \"with maximum restraint.\"  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in \nthe offing, saying: \"If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be \nforced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps.\"\n\nThe chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary \nGeneral Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a \"clear \nand grave violation\" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an \"irresponsible act\" that posed a \nserious threat to world peace.\n\nChina, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while \nForeign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was \"strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed\" to the nuclear test.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: \"The danger posed \nby North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The \nUnited States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.\"\n\nThe United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013, to discuss future \nmeasures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  \nunanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that \"appropriate measures\" would be in the \noffing. But North Korea has rarely been deterred by such a prospect.\n\nNorth Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled \nnewspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying \nout  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  \n\"imperialists\"  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal. According to a review in \nRodong Sinmun, North Korea's main newspaper and an apparent mouthpiece for the North Korean government --  \nthe country required ICBMs to augment its self-defense.  The article in Rodong Sinmun also declared that North \nKorea would be a formidable enemy in the face of adversity or any challenge, and warned that there \"can be no \ncompromise in the last fight to herald the victory for independence for humanity.\"  The diatribe also included the \npromise to  \"strike a blow to end imperialism.\"                           \n\nThe North Koreans' efforts to develop  ICBM capacity were apparently  not being undertaken in isolation. According \nto researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there  were suggestions that the Iranians might be assisting the North \nKoreans with the development of a rocket program.  Blog 38  at Johns Hopkins University noted that its analysis of \nsatellite imagery taken in early 2013 showed that  preparations were being made for an impending test of a liquid-\nfueled rocket.  That satellite imagery  further showed that North Korea could conceivably test rockets larger than the \nsize of the rocket deployed in late 2012 from a new launch pad.  As stated in the report published in Blog 38: \n\"Analysis of construction activities around the new launch pad has revealed evidence that Pyongyang's rocket \nprogram may be receiving assistance from Iran.\"\n\nSince Iran was already ensconced its its own controversial nuclear development program -- to the great \nconsternation of the international community -- the news of a possible connection between Pyongyang and Tehran \nwas being  met with alarm across the world.  Indeed, there was a growing sense of anxiety about global security as \na result.  That being said, the general consensus was that North Korea had not, to date,  developed the ability to \ndeploy a nuclear warhead on an ICBM.\n\nIn the last week of February 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University -- via  Blog 38 -- said that satellite \nimagery of the nuclear test facility show possible signs of human activity there, even after the third nuclear test.  \nThey suggested that North Korea might be preparing for a fourth nuclear test.  As stated in Blog 38: \"It remains \nunclear whether renewed activity at the site is normal for the days after a nuclear detonation or if it is an indication \nof Pyongyang's intention to conduct another test in the near future.\"  Sources from the Chinese government \nsuggested that Pyongyang was waiting for possible action from the United Nations Security Council  before it \nmakes a decision on\n\na fourth nuclear test.\n\nWith news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution \nagainst North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, \nNorth Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with \nSouth Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, \nreferring to them as a \"dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.\"  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that \nit would carry out stronger actions  in response to the \"hostile\" policies of the United States and South Korea. It \nwas apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure\n\nClearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its \nstate-controlled media, had urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that \nNorth Korea would pay a \"heavy price\"  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international \njurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which \nhave done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development \nagenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nNorth Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled \nnewspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying \nout  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  \n\"imperialists\"  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal.

On March 5, 2013, \nNorth Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with \nSouth Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and \nSouth Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a \"dangerous nuclear war targeted at \nus.\"  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the \n\"hostile\" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an \naggressive stance in the face of international pressure.                             \n\nOn March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea \nfor its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.   Included in those \nnew sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but \nthere were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade.                             \n\nAs stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, \"The strength, breadth and severity of \nthese sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will \nbite and bite hard.\"  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North \nKorea to \"wake up from its delusion\" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, \"It can either take the right path \ntoward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual \nself-destruction.\"  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the \nresolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by \nthe international community.\n\nIn  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of \ninternational action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was \ncreated to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons \nand goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only \nsymbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security \nimplications.\n\nIt should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the \nUnited States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' \nintent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would \n\"compel\" that country to take \"countermeasures\" in short order.\n\nFurthermore, it declared in a statement: \"Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary \narmed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the \naggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country.\" North Korea even threatened to transform\n\nWashington and Seoul into \"a sea in flames\" with \"lighter and smaller nukes.\"\n\nFor its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United \nStates) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said \non March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate \nfrom tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to \"turn this era of confrontation and \nmistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.\"  Yun further asserted: \"The security situation on the \nKorean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third \nnuclear test.\"\n\n\n\nAs March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and \nartillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast \non the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command \nsaid: \"From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and \nlong-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.\"  The statement further delineated targets in South \nKorea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a \nNorth Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, \"The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force \nBase on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered \nsubmarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.\"  North Korea said \nthat its motivation was driven by the priority \"to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim \nJong Un] through military actions.\"\n\nThe United States responded with its own statement as follows: \"North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow \na pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces \nCommand and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative \nbehavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of \n[South Korea].\"\n\nThen, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a \"state of war\" with South Korea and that its the long-\nstanding truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: \"From this time on, the \nNorth-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be \nhandled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally \nover.\"\n\nIn response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which \nread as follows: \"Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and \nsafety of the people.\"  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  \nthreats from North Korea \"very seriously.\"  She said, \"If there is any provocation against South Korea and its \npeople, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.\"\n\nFor its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  \"North \nKorea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine \ninternational efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\"\n\nMatching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by \ndeploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets \nfrom Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy \nadditional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States \nfrom a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, \nnormally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from \nNorth Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an \nanti-missile system to Guam.\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News \nAgency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon \nand restarting its nuclear reactor there.\n\n\n\nThe Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a \npart of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  \nThe agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil \nas well as humanitarian aid benefits.\n\nThe agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel \nrods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance.\n\nThis 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  \nthe intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing \ndevelopment as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to take increasingly \nprovocative actions.  As a result, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation \nstate of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety.\n\nReflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was \"deeply dismayed\" by North \nKorea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further \ncondemned the provocative actions declaring: \"The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not \na game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability.\"\n\nSecretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  \"the only way to resolve the current crisis.\" \nHowever, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  \nusing the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in \nthe mood for productive diplomatic engagement.\n\nIndeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the \njointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of \ngeopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-\nborder access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development.\n\nBy April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had \"ratified\" an attack \non United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to \ncounteract American aggression with \"powerful practical military counteractions,\" including nuclear weapons, and \ninvolving \"cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.\"  The KCNA statement included the \nfollowing warning: \"The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or \nnot and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.\"  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and \nbelligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to \nanother level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict.\n\nIn a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted \nthat the recent actions of the North Koreans \"present a real and clear danger.\"  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign \nministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the \nnotion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations \nSecurity Council\" as  \"categorically unacceptable,\" and issued the following warning: \"This radically complicates, if it \ndoesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks.\"\n\n\n\nOn April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, \nknown as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a \nthreatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was \ngrowing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be \nnoted that while this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would \nput all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range; however, there was no \ntest history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  \"A \nmissile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat.\" Of course,  a \nmissile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history.\n\nBy April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan \nmid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be \npreparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch \ncould conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder.\n\nMeanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that \nthe scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was \"inching close to a thermonuclear war,\"  and authorities in \nPyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in \nthe United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as \n\"unhelpful.\"  Carney continued, \"This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international \ncommunity and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the \npath of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned \nof consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United \nStates Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying \"If \nKim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be \nchoosing willfully to ignore the entire international community.\"\n\nA day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on \nthe Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both \ncalling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was \nunited in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and \nemphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, \"The United States remains open to authentic \nand credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful \nsteps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of \ninternational behavior.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-\nhye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks \nas a  \"cunning ploy.\"  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international \npressure.\n\n\n\nApril 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of \nthe bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The \nhopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for \nthe moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was \nissued as follows: \"Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.\"                                   \n\nIt should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships \nwith  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense \nsystems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News broadcast on April 16, 2013, United States President Barack Obama said that while \nthe intelligence available does not suggest that North Korea has the ability to successfully arm a ballistic missile \nwith nuclear warheads, he yet believed his country needed to be prepared for all possibilities.  He said,  \"Based on \nour current intelligence assessments we do not think that they have that capacity. But we have to make sure that \nwe are dealing with every contingency out there.  That's why I repositioned missile defense systems: to guard \nagainst any miscalculation on their part.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed the  North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, was mentally unstable, President Obama \nresponded, \"I'm not a psychiatrist. And I don't know the leader of North Korea.\"\n\nHowever, President Obama characterized  North Korea's exposition of bellicose and vituperative war rhetoric as \nbeing similar to a childish tantrum, and unlikely to yield productive results.  He said, \"You don't get to bang your \nspoon on the table and somehow you get your way.\"\n\nPresident Obama seemed cognizant of the fact that the impasse was unlikely to end easily, although he did not \nforeclose the possibility of a diplomatic resolution.  He mused, \"All of us would anticipate that North Korea will \nprobably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks... This is the same kind of pattern that we saw \nhis father engage in, and his grandfather before that. If they want to rejoin the community of nations, that path is \navailable to them.\"\n\nOn April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central \nNews Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw \"all nuclear war making capabilities \nfrom the region,\" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize \nfor its  aggression.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was \ncommitted to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to \"authentic and credible negotiations.\"  \nEarnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea \"actually indicate the opposite.\"  He added, \"We also \nneed to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international \nobligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've \npromised in the past.\"\n\nBy April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved  two short-range missile launchers to the east coast.  \nAccording to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite \nimagery showed the transfer of  two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South \nHamgyeong province.  Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were  place on \nlaunchers on the east coast.  Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- \n\n\n\npossibly to mark the  anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25.  However, that date \npassed without any show of force.\n\nIn the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in  dialogue over the Kaesong \nindustrial complex, which became a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas.  Regarded as a \nsymbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the \njointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy,  and the \nslide towards confrontation.  That slide became more precipitous when  North Korea outright rejected the invitation \nto engage in  talks.  South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the  Kaesong industrial \nzone in the interests of safety.\n\nOn May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the \neast coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed \nabove,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific.\n\nThe movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the \nKorean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members \nof the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort.\n\nRegardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the \nthreat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a \nmobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United \nStates official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was \"premature to celebrate it as \ngood news,\" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a \nPentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as \"a provocation pause.\"\n\nMay 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders \nattempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its \ntwo medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded \nas a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were \nroutine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-\nmoon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and \"resume dialogue.\"\n\nPresumably in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear \nmissile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the \nUnited States Navy on May 16, 2013  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a \ntarget launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to reports from the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic \nmissile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake \nErie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which \nsuccessfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the \nAegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.\n\nIt came as something of a surprise when, in June 2013, North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  \nNorth Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for \n\"serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.\"  The United States responded to this overture by saying it \n\n\n\nlooked towards  \"credible negotiations,\" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations \nresolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.\n\nAt the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-\nnam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take \nPyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and \nNorth Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for \ndiplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  \nChina's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to \"peacefully resolve the \nnuclear issue.\"  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, \nand the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed \ninterest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese \nofficials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing.\n\nSee below for  information on North Korea's nuclear capability and the United States' reaction to the threat posed \nby North Korea to its national security.\n\nNuclear Capability\n\nOf course, the main question is whether or not North Korea could make good on its threats against the United \nStates are its allies.  It was clear that both South Korea and Japan were within range of potential North Korean \nmissile attacks.\n\nNorth Korea's medium-range Nodong 1, a single-stage liquid-propelled weapon based on Soviet \"Scud\" technology, \ncould reach Japanese and South Korean targets, according to an International Institute for Strategic Studies \noverview of North Korea's missile program.  However, that technology was not known for its targeting prowess and \nwas thus not to be regarded as a \"precision strike\" mechanism.\n\nObviously, at an even further distance, the Nodong 1 could not really be regarded as a serious threat against \nGuam. It was possible that North Korea could  deploy its multi-stage intermediate range ballistic missile, the \nTaepodong, against the United States base on Guam, but the record for the Taepodong was not stellar, even failing \nduring flight testing.\n\nAs discussed above,  in the first week of April 2013, North Korea moved a medium-range missile, known as a \nMusudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was  not known if there was a warhead mounted on the missile, or, if the \nmovement of the missile was part of the preparations for yet another missile test. While this Musudan/Nodong B \nmissile has a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan and possibly \nGuam in its range, there was no reliable test history to ensure precision.  A missile launch would ostensibly be \naimed at acquiring that flight test history, thus driving South Korea to deploy warships with missile defense systems \nto the coasts.\n\nIt should be noted that the Kn-o8 missile was believed to have enough range to hit United States terrain such as \nAlaska, Hawaii, and Guam.  This missile was actually displayed at a North Korean military parade within the last \n\n\n\nyear.  However, there were some suggestions that the missile was not yet viable, with some experts even \nsuggesting it was only a \"mock-up\" missile.\n\nThe longer range option for North Korea would likely be the multi-stage rocket, the Unha-3, which was used to \nlaunch a satellite into space  in late 2012. Theoretically,  the Unha  -- with its range of 10,000 kilometers -- could \ndeliver a nuclear warhead-sized payload as far as Alaska or Hawaii or even California.  However,  as noted by the \nCenter for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), previous launches of Unha-based rockets have not been terribly \nsuccessful, raising questions about the technology's reliability.  Moreover,  unlike most intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles (ICMBs) which use  solid fuel, the Unha-3 is powered by liquid fuel, which cannot  be stored for long \nperiods inside the rocket.  Accordingly, the Unha-3 was a liquid-fueled rocket, it would have to sit on a launch pad \nfor lengthy periods of time for fueling, leaving it essentially vulnerable to a strike. For all these reasons, the CNS \nhas concluded that while the Unha was evidence of North Korea's missile capability, it was  not deemed to be \"a \nreliable system capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental United States.\"\n\nStill,  the navy of South Korea obtained first stage debris from the 2012 Unha launch and concluded that North \nKorea had made some technological strides.  Notably, the missile showed a capacity for steering thanks to the use \nof small auxiliary engines instead of jet vanes.\n\nAnother consideration as regards North Korea's progress on nuclear development was the use of uranium versus \nplutonium in nuclear testing.  It is widely believed that North Korea  used plutonium as fissile material for nuclear \ntests undertaken in 2006 and 2009.  But there were suspicions by experts that  North Korea might have used \nuranium in its recent (February 2013) nuclear test. The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to \nexpand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.\n\nNevertheless, the general consensus at the time was that North Korea had not  (yet) developed the technology to \nmanufacture a  miniaturized nuclear device small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, which would be needed to carry \nout a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\nNorth Korea has carried out nuclear weapons tests and has made it clear that future tests were in the offing. But \nproducing a nuclear explosion was not the same as producing a nuclear device small enough to fit on the top of a \nmissile that could be delivered across an extensive range of territory.  Indeed, not only do nuclear warheads have to \nbe small enough to fit on a missile, they also have to be able to durable enough to withstand intense heat, as well \nas the vibration of re-entry, and they need to possess the precision to arrive at their intended targets.  As noted by  \nGreg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, \"Based on the testing we've seen and some other \nassumptions about North Korean abilities, we don't think they're ready to arm an ICBM with a nuclear warhead yet \neven if they had an ICBM, which they don't yet.\"\n\nThat being said, a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability conducted by the Defense Intelligence \nAgency (DIA)  of the Pentagon  concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that North Korea had, for the first time, \nlearned how to manufacture a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered via a ballistic missile.  The precise \nlanguage used by the Defense Intelligence Agency was as follows: \"North currently has nuclear weapons capable \nof delivery by ballistic missiles however the reliability will be low.\"\n\nThe assessment,  portions of which were publicized in a report by the New York Times on April 11, 2013, was a \nsobering and disturbing revelation at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsular.\n\n\n\nRelated to this report was emerging insight derived from debris from the rocket used by the North Koreans to \nlaunch a satellite into space in December 2012.  The United States Navy was able to retrieve the front section of \nthe rocket for study by experts, thus contributing to assessments about possible warhead designs by the North \nKoreans. According to media reports, that front section of the satellite rocket offered scientists evidence that North \nKorea was manufacturing the missile's cone at dimensions suitable for a nuclear warhead, and intended to function \non a long-range missile capable of re-entry to the earth's atmosphere from space.\n\nAnxieties over this possible benchmark by the North Koreans were likely to be assuaged by the general view that \nsuch a nuclear weapon would likely be hampered by low reliability -- a plausible deduction given North Korea's poor \nrecord of developing accurate weapons and its limited test history of missiles in its possession. As well, even if \nNorth Korea did make technological strides and was now able to make a deliverable warhead, it would still have to \nbe able to withstand intense heat and the vibration of re-entry, and would to be sufficiently tested for target \nprecision, as noted above.  To that end, North Korea has no test history of a re-entry vehicle and without that \nfunctional technology, it cannot deliver a warhead.\n\nIt should be noted that in a report to the United States Congress at the start of May 2013,  the United States \nDepartment of Defense made it clear that North Korea was aiming to move closer to its goal of striking the United \nStates  with a nuclear-armed missile.  There was no estimate as to when North Korea might achieve that capability; \nhowever, the report surmised that progress on this front would be dependent on North Korea's degree of \ninvestment in its military program.  And to that end, North Korea was believed to be committed to becoming a \nnuclear powerhouse, irrespective of its domestic challenges of famine, starvation, and economic strife. The report \nemphasized the view that North Korea's key strategic aim was to deploy  \"coercive diplomacy\" to force the \ninternational community to accept its nuclear ambitions.  No reference in this report was made of the \naforementioned conclusions of the DIA.\n\nFor its part, the United States government has long maintained the position that it has the ability to protect the \nhomeland. To that end, in mid-March 2013, the Obama administration in the United States said it would deploy \nadditional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States \nfrom a potential attack from North Korea. The deployment of  additional ballistic-missile interceptors  would \nincrease the number (currently based in California and Alaska) from 30 to 44. As well, the United States  moved its  \nsea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of \nmonitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  The radar system also possesses \nthe capability to search and track targets, as well as communicate with interceptor missiles at overseas bases that \ncan shoot down  missiles.  By April 2013, the United States  decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area \nDefense (THAAD) missile defense system to Guam.\n\nThe anti-ballistic missile interceptor system and the X-Band radar platform  do not  guarantee protection against a \npossible North Korean attack; however, they are intended to deter Pyongyang, which has been known to have only \na limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal.  As noted here, experts have concluded that  North Korea simply \ndoes not have the military capability to carry out a nuclear strike on United States territory.\n\nIn May 2013, in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear \nmissile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the \nUnited States Navy  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in \nthe Pacific Ocean.  According to  the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  \nfrom the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and \ntrack the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  \n\n\n\nUnited States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense \nsystem was fully functional.\n\nShould a confrontation actually emerge, North Korea would be helped by the fact that its  army is the fifth largest in \nthe world; however,  it is also inexperienced having not seen combat since 1953, and having been deprived of the \nsuperior and sophisticated training available to the smaller South Korean military, or the extensive United States \nmilitary industrial complex.  As well, a lot of North Korea's military equipment is outdated in comparison to Western \npowers.  That being said, even outdated military equipment can still (presumably) function and thus North Korea \nposes  a real and serious threat to global security.\n\nRetired United States Admiral Dennis Blair, a former head of the United States Pacific Command and  director of \nnational intelligence in the Obama administration, cautioned against taking a sanguine stance in response to the \nNorth Korean threat.  He said in an interview with Bloomberg News, \"I'm not relaxed about this one...I think this \none's more dangerous.\"\n\nMost experts on North Korea posit the view that Pyongyang is not really prepared to ignite a conflict that would \nensure its own destruction; however, they note that Kim Jong-un's inexperience could lead to misunderstanding and \nmiscalculations with potentially catastrophic consequences.  For example, regardless of its intended target, a \nmissile launched by the North that appears to be headed towards South Korea or Japan -- accidentally or otherwise \n-- would clearly yield a response from those countries or the United States.  That response could itself be a catalyst \nfor a deadly confrontation among players armed with no shortage of conventional weapons,  not to mention nuclear \nbombs.\n\nIndeed, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, the top United States commander in the Pacific, said during testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services committee on April 9, 2013 that while the United States would not opt to to shoot down \na North Korean missile aimed for open waters, interceptors would be used to defend against a North Korean missile \nperceived as threatening the interests of the United States or its allies.  It was an unknown matter as to how a \nparanoid regime like North Korea would itself respond to such defensive action.\n\nMeanwhile, as noted by United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of his country's ability to respond to threats \nposed by North Korea: \"We have every capacity to deal with any action that North Korea would take, to protect this \ncountry and the interests of this country and our allies.\" At the same news conference with Hagel,  General Martin \nDempsey, the chairman of the United States military Joint Chiefs of Staff,  would not say if he believe North Korea \nhad been able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile; however, he warned that the \nUnited States need to be prepared for the worst possible scenarios.  Dempsey said: \"They [the North Koreans] \nhave conducted two nuclear tests. They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches. And in the \nabsence of concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume the worst case, and that's why we're postured as \nwe are today.\"\n\nBoston terror bombings intersects with challenge of Islamic separatistm and extremism in Russia\n\nOn April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded along the path to the finish line of the Boston Marathon in the state of \nMassachusetts in the United States.  NBC News  reported that the bombs were small and crudely-made  explosive  \ndevices.\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombings and  at the time,  authorities indicated that there \nwas no  suspect in custody. That being said, several individuals were being questioned in connection with the \nattacks.\n\nInvestigators were treating the bombings in Boston as a terrorist event, although  in the aftermath of the attacks, it \nwas unknown if the terrorists responsible were domestic or foreign actors. Likewise, it was not immediately know if \nthe bombs were planted by a lone individual or a group of people.  As noted by a White House official, \"Any event \nwith multiple explosive devices as this appears to be is clearly an act of terror and will be approached as an act of \nterror. However we don't yet know who carried out this attack and a thorough investigation will have to determine \nwhether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist group foreign or domestic.\"\n\nIt should be noted that in the period following the two explosions, the Federal Aviation Administration instituted a \nno-fly zone over the Boston area, while security in the United States' capital of Washington D.C. and major cities, \nsuch as New York,  was tightened.  As well, according to United States government sources, federal law \nenforcement  was placed on \"level one mobilization.\" Additionally, CNN was reporting that  teams were on \"stand-\nby\" and ready to search flights leaving the United State, although the teams were not yet  activated to follow this \ncourse.\n\nBecause of the anxieties over the possibility of other explosive devices being planted in Boston,  authorities were \nurging people to remain either at home or indoors at hotels, and to refrain from congregating in large groups until \nthe scene was stabilized.  As stated by Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis during a news conference, \"We \nrecommend to people that they stay home. We want to make sure that we completely stabilize the situation.\"  \nGovernor Deval Patrick echoed this call, saying, \"We are asking that people ... calmly make their way home.\" \nGovernor Patrick also characterized the situation unfolding as  a \"horrific day in Boston.\"\n\nThe explosive devices were believed to have been placed inside  backpacks and detonated remotely. The first \nexplosion  emanated from the north side of Boylston Street, across from the grand stand, just before the bridge that \nmarked the marathon finish line. That first explosion occurred roughly  two hours after the winners crossed the  \nfinish line.  The second explosion occurred  just moments after the first one and along the same stretch of road.\n\nVideotaped footage by NBC news showed the explosion, the smoke from the blast,  the scattering debris, and the \nrunners still on the course falling to the ground from the force of the blasts.  After the explosions, as other runners \napproached the finish line, they were rerouted in another direction for obvious security reasons.\n\nFellow runners, spectators, and other individuals, all reacted to the chaos by trying to assist victims, essentially \nadministering \"make shift\" medical help before emergency responders arrived on the scene. Three people were \nreported to have been killed, and more than 130 people were injured, as a result of these apparent terrorist acts.  \nTragically, one fatality was believed to be an eight year old child.  The other two victims were a young Bostonian \nwoman and a female student from China.  Meanwhile, there were scores of people hospitalized due to the intensely \ngrave nature of so many injuries. It should be noted that due to the placement of the  explosive devices,  many of \nthe victims endured horrific injuries to their lower extremities, with limbs severed as a result. Indeed, the scene of \nthe tragedy displayed a traumatizing scene of dismembered and bloodied body parts along with the injured victims \nand shocked bystanders.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama offered a national address on the day of the Boston bombings, which was \nbroadcast by the media, in the immediate aftermath of the unfolding tragedy in Boston. In that address, the \nAmerican leader promised that those responsible for these violent terrorist attacks would feel the \"full weight of \njustice.\"   Noting that the identity of those responsible were yet unknown, President Obama said: \" We still do not \nknow who did this or why.  But we will find out who did this and we will hold them accountable.\"\n\nPresident Obama earlier spoke with  Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and  Boston Mayor Tom Menino to \nmake it clear that the full weight of federal authority and assistance was at their disposal in dealing with the \nunfolding tragedy.  Vice President Joe Biden offered condolences, saying, \"Our prayers are with those people in \nBoston who have suffered injury.\"\n\n\n\nOne day after the Boston bombings, on April 16, 2013, President Obama again offered nationally-televised \nremarks.  In those remarks, the president again reiterated his commitment to use federal powers to find those \nresponsible and bring them to justice.  He said, \"It will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened.  \nBut we will find out.  We will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice.\"\n\nThe president also made it abundantly clear that the Boston bombings were acts of terrorism.  President Obama \nasserted, \"This was a heinous and cowardly act.  And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is \ninvestigating it as an act of terrorism.  Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror.\"  \nBut he continued by striking a defiant tone, \"We also know this -- the American people refuse to be terrorized.... So \nif you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil -- that's it.  Selflessly.  Compassionately.  \nUnafraid.\"\n\nAs to the matter of those responsible, any suggestions about the identity of the terrorists were exercises in \nspeculation immediately after the bombings.  That being said, some experts pointed to the  use of pressure cooking \nequipment in the manufacture of the explosive devices.  Apparently the Islamic extremist Jihadist publication,  \nInspire, has run stories instructing aspiring Jihadist terrorists to build bombs using such equipment.  Going in \nanother (domestic) direction,  another cadre of observers pointed to the fact that the attacks took place on April 15, \n2013 -- tax day in the United States and Patriots Day in Boston.  Clearly, it would take  more investigation to get a \nbetter sense of the identity of the attacker(s) and the agenda at stake.\n\nBut the pace of revelation was unfolding in a rather rapid manner.  Thanks to the sheer quantity of photographic \nevidence from witnesses at the marathon taking pictures of the day's events, as well as cameras installed on \ncommercial buildings, authorities were able to get a sense of the perpetrators and their actions.  Indeed, on April \n18, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released photographs of two suspects and actively sought the \npublic's assistance in apprehending those responsible.  Richard DesLauriers of the FBI explained that  one of the \nsuspects was believed to have placed one of the explosive devices outside a restaurant close to  the marathon \nfinish line.  Both suspects  -- one in a black baseball cap (referred to in the media as \"black cap\") and the other \nshown in a white baseball cap (referred to in the media as \"white cap\" ) were described as armed and dangerous.\n\nThe night of April 18, 2013 unfolded with unmatched drama of the type one might only see on a television or movie \nscreen.  The action ensued only hours after the photographs of the suspects were released.  Presumably agitated \nby the realization that their pictures were being shared with the world, the two suspects -- \"black cap\" and \"white \ncap\" -- became engaged in a spate of violent activities with deadly consequences.\n\nThe drama began with the killing of a police officer on the campus of MIT University, the motive for which remained \nhazy at the time of writing. \"Black cap\" and \"white cap\" then carjacked a man in a Mercedes-Benz SUV, held him by \ngunpoint, identified themselves as the Boston marathon bombers,  and used his ATM card to withdraw $800 in cash \nfrom the car owner's bank account, before the car owner was able to make an escape at a gas station in \nCambridge.  The search for the carjacked individual's vehicle led to a  car chase that ended in a  vicious battle in \nthe Boston suburb of Watertown.\n\nThe suspects --  \"black cap\" and \"white cap\" -- exchanged gunfire with police, with many stray bullets landing in the \nhomes of people who lived in the hitherto quiet residential neighborhood of Watertown.  As well, one transit officer \nwas seriously wounded in the mayhem.  The situation became even more intense when, during their attempted \ngetaway, the two suspects hurled explosive devices at the police.  Residents of the neighborhood who witnessed \nthe events said in interviews with the media that the devices looked like a combination of grenades and pressure \ncooker bombs.  Bomb detecting robots were soon dispatched to  the scene to determine the security of the area \nsince the two men reportedly hurled an arsenal of weapons and explosive devices on the Watertown residential \nstreet.\n\nMeanwhile, the firefight between the suspects and police was ongoing. The suspect known in the media as \"black \ncap\" ran towards the police and opened fire, only to be rewarded by being shot himself.  That suspect's  prospects \nfor survival took a negative turn when his partner in crime, \"white cap,\" drove over his body in the rush to escape.  It \nshould be noted that an improvised explosives device was reportedly strapped to the body of \"black cap\" indicating \n\n\n\nhis intent to carry out a suicide attack, if he had the chance.  \"Black cap\" was eventually reported to have died at \nthe Beth Israel Medical Center from the lethal combination of injuries, while \"white cap\" was said to be on the run.\n\nAuthorities soon cordoned off large swaths of Watertown, Newton, Arlington, Waltham, Belmont,  and Cambridge, \nas well as  the Allston-Brighton neighborhoods of Boston.  They also suspended mass transit, called on local \nbusinesses to shut down, and ordered residents to remain inside under \"lock down\" conditions.  These measures \nwere undertaken as the police  and Swat teams prepared to carry out a \"house to house\" search for the surviving \nsuspect, known as \"white cap.\"  Authorities warned the public that the surviving suspect was a \"white male\" and a \n\"dangerous terrorist\" with international connections. As stated by Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, \"We \nbelieve this man to be a terrorist. \"We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people.\"\n\nThis disclosure seemed to  foreclose the possibility that the Boston marathon attack was related to domestic \nextremists with anti-government stances.  At the same time, the disclosure pointed towards the possible path of \nJihadist terrorism (although confirmation of that fact was yet to come).\n\nIn the early hours of April 19, 2013, details regarding the identities of the two suspects were beginning to surface.   \nThe suspect seen in the FBI photographs wearing the black cap,  and who had died as a result of the firefight with \npolice, was identified as 26-year old Tamarlan Tsarnaev.   The surviving suspect, who was seen in the FBI \nphotographs wearing the white cap, was identified as his brother, 19-year old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev.  The young \nmen were of  Chechnyan and Avar (Dagestani) ethnicity.  The father of the two brothers had worked in the  former \nSoviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, which is now independent;  the  Tsarnaev brothers spent some of their younger years \nthere.  Anzor Tsarnaev was fired from his government job in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan) when the war \nsparked again in Chechnya in 1999; the general view was that he lost his job due to his Chechen ethnicity.  The \nTsarnaev family then moved to the Russian semi-autonomous region of Dagestan, close to the breakaway Russian \nregion of Chechnya, which has been the site of an extremist separatist Islamic insurgency for about two decades. \nThe entire family emigrated to the United States about ten years ago and settled in the  suburban Boston area of \nSomerville and Cambridge.  Tamarlan Tsarnaev was a legal resident of the United States and Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev \nhad become a United States citizen in 2012.\n\nHours after residents of Boston suburbs were placed under \"lockdown,\" and as the search for the second suspect -- \nDzhokhar Tsarnaev -- yielded no progress, police acknowledged that the trail had gone cold.  Boston authorities \ndecided to lift the de facto curfew and urged residents to remain vigilant.\n\nIronically, it was the lifting of the de facto curfew that led to the discovery of Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev's hiding place.  \nOne resident took advantage of the fact that he was now allowed to  go outdoors and exited  his home to smoke a \ncigarette.  Looking out on his back yard, he  noticed that his boat stored in his yard looked as if it had been \ntampered with and he additionally identified blood stains.  He removed the tarpaulin  covering the boat and found a \nperson covered in blood hiding there.  Authorities arrived on the scene and another gun battle broke out before \nDzhokhar Tsarnaev surrendered and was taken to the hospital where he was being treated for serious gunshot \ninjuries.\n\nBoston Police Department tweeted the news as follows: \"CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The \nterror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody.\" People took to the streets to share their relief that the \nordeal was over and to express appreciation for law enforcement.\n\nBy April 21, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remained in serious condition and under armed guard at the Beth Israel \nMedical Center.  Gunshots to the throat area left him unable to speak, although he was periodically providing some \nwritten responses to questions by investigators.\n\nMore details were meanwhile emerging about the extent of the Tsarnaev brothers' desire to continue their \ncampaign of carnage.  Based on reports of the man who was carjacked by the Tsarnaev brothers, they intended to \nmake their way to New York.  The FBI suggested that the two men intended to detonate their remaining arsenal of \nexplosives in Time Square.\n\n\n\nFormal charges of some sort were expected to be brought against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. These charges would be \nharsh, given the allegations of terrorism and the apparent evidence of participation in a terrorist act. As noted by \nMassachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in an interview with NBC News,  video surveillance footage put Dzhokar \nTsarnaev at the scene of the first bomb explosion. He said, \"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took \nthe backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the \nbackpack in time for the second explosion.\"\n\nOn April 22, 2013,  the United States Department of Justice charged the second suspect in the Boson marathon \nbombings  with using a weapon of mass destruction. While there is no death penalty in the state of Massachusetts, \nthe federal charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill people carries with it a possible death sentence.  At \nthe close of April 2013, Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev was moved from the Beth Israel Medical Center to the Bureau of \nPrisons federal detention hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, some Republican politicians were calling for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to be treated as an enemy \ncombatant, although as a United States citizen, such an action could well be regarded as unconstitutional.  The \nObama administration soon made it clear it was not interested in going down this road.  As noted by White House \nspokesperson, Jay Carney, \"He will not be treated as an enemy combatant. We will prosecute this terrorist through \nour civilian system of justice.\"  Indeed, the sheer wealth of evidence against the  Tsarnaev brothers ensured that \nthe government's case would be a strong one.\n\nWith Tamarlan Tsarnaev dead and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in custody, no doubt questions about motive would \ndominate the public purview. Information about Tamarlan Tsarnaev suggested that he had a difficult time adjusting \nculturally to life in the United States, despite some success with a boxing career.  His decision to stop boxing on \nreligious grounds appeared to have angered and perplexed his father, who had been socialized in the Soviet \nsystem and culture to hold a far more permissive and moderate attitude towards Islam.  Influenced by his mother's \nreligious transformation to Islamic orthodoxy, Tarmalan Tsarnaev reportedly became increasingly hard line in his \nIslamic and extremist views, even alienating some members of his extended family. Ruslan Tsarni,  an uncle to the \nTsarnaev brothers, was on the record with the media saying that as far back as 2009,  Tamerlan Tsarnaev was \nbecoming more of an extremist Muslim, expressing what he described as \"this radical crap.\" This trend appeared to \nhave fueled a break in contact among family members.\n\nAs well, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Tamerlan Tsarnaev's Islamist views grew  so rigid and \nradical that he managed to offend fellow Muslim worshippers at the mosque they attended in Cambridge.  In fact, \nthere were multiple accounts of Tamerlan Tsarnaev confronting speakers giving  sermons at  the mosque.  In  one \ncase, he was angry that the speaker urged worshippers to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed along \nwith American Independence Day, as well as  Thanksgiving and other American holidays.  In his own community, \nhe was angered that a Middle Eastern grocery owner was selling Thanksgiving turkeys, deeming it inappropriate for \nMuslims.\n\nIt should be noted that the Russian government had Tamarlan Tsarnaev  on its radar, having requested that the \nUnited States authorities investigate him as early as 2011, due to suspicions of involvement with Islamic extremists \nand unspecified underground groups.  The FBI confirmed that they interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, as \nrequested, but found no cause for alarm at the time.  Still, Russian intelligence continued to regard Tarmalan \nTsarnaev with suspicion and recorded a telephone conversation in 2011 in which Jihadism was discussed with his \nmother.  Collectively, the corpus of information garnered by both American and Russian intelligence appeared to \nhave indicated concerns about religious extremism, but stopped short of signaling actual terrorist activities in the \nfuture.  Thus, it would be difficult to suggest that the governments of either country could have prevented the \nBoston bombings.\n\nWhile there was no information available at the time to suggest an intent to carry out a terror attack, United States \nauthorities nevertheless placed Tarmalan Tsarnaev on  two government watch lists in 2011. Although those lists did \nnot go as far as the so-called \"no fly list,\" when Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the United States in 2012 for a trip to \nRussia, his reservation triggered a security alert to customs authorities at the time.  Of course, that security alert did \nnot translate into any action by United States authorities that actually prevented the trip from occurring.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Tamarlan Tsarnaev was able to travel out of the country for an extended period of time on this 2012 trip to \nvisit his father who was now living in the Dagestan region of Russia.  However,  the actual time Tamarlan Tsarnaev  \nspent  with his father in Dagestan was limited to one month, leaving the rest of the period a mystery and open for \nspeculation.  It was  possible (although not confirmed) that he attended a terrorist training camp -- perhaps in the \nrestive Caucasus region or elsewhere. But even without such an expedition, Tamarlan Tsarnaev may very well \nhave been radicalized in a less \"official\" manner.  While politicians in the United States were eager to suggest that \nTamarlan Tsarnaev  was radicalized  out of the country, it was apparent that his increasingly extreme Islamic views \nwere part of a personal transformation taking place in the home he shared with his mother.  Still, it was after an \noverseas trip more recently that Tamarlan Tsarnaev created YouTube postings called \"Terrorists,\"  which featured \nvideos from a militant extremist in Dagestan  known as Amir Abu Dudzhan. In one posting, Dudzhan is shown \nholding a Kalashnikov rifle and declaring: \"Jihad is the duty of every able-bodied Muslim.\"  It was apparent that \nTamarlan Tsarnaev  was  ideologically inspired by  Islamic extremism and radicalism, while being sympathetic to  \nthe Chechnyan and Dagestani separatist and Jihadist causes.\n\nOf course, the motivation for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev to join his brother in carrying out terrorist attacks remained \nmore of a matter of debate.  Significantly more well-adjusted to American life  than his brother, the younger \nTsarnaev was a seemingly successful student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, with a number of \nAmerican friends,  an active social life, and hopes for a medical career. It was difficult to determine if Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev shared his brother's Jihadist views, or, if he was simply motivated by his relationship with his brother.  To \nthat end, there were some suggestions that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have  \"brainwashed\" his younger brother into \nparticipating in his terrorist agenda.  For his part, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's  posts on the Russian social media site, \nVkontakt, made clear that he self-identified as Islamic in terms of religion and \"world view,\" and Chechnyan in terms \nof ethnicity and culture.  He also posted  links to Islamic and pro-Chechnyan independence websites.\n\nThere seemed to be bewilderment among United States intelligence circles about the idea that the Chechnyan drive \nfor independence and war with Russia should be transported to American terrain.  But it was not clear that \nChechnyan independence was the driver for the two Tsarnaev brothers to commit acts of terror.\n\nIn fact, it should be noted that Islamic militants  operating under the aegis of the  Caucasian Mujahedeenin denied \nany involvement in the Boston marathon terror attacks, emphasizing that their conflict was with Russia.  However, \nas discussed below, the militant Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus has steadily expanded past Chechnya's \nborders to neighboring territories, such as Dagestan and Ingushetia, and the cause itself has moved past \nestablishing  an independent Chechnya to a broader Jihadist goal in the Caucasus.  It was quite possible that \npersonal transformation to radical Islam meshed with the Jihadist agenda for the older Tsarnaev brother, and he \ndrew the younger one into the fold.\n\nTo be clear, an Islamic insurgency emanating from the North Caucasus has  bedeviled the Russian Federation for \nclose to two decades. Despite successful offensive operations by the Russian military  in the North Caucasus, \nviolence by Islamist separatist militants has been ongoing.  At issue has been the Chechen mandate to create an \nindependent Islamic state and the willingness of the Chechen militants to use terrorism and violence to achieve \ntheir ends.\n\nWhile the mainstream media has focused on this separatist war carried out by  extremist Islamic insurgents from \nChechnya, the neighboring restive provinces in the North Caucasus have also been engulfed in the conflict. The \nepicenter of the Islamic separatist insurgency is, of course,  Chechnya, which has been in  state of war for some \ntime; however, neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia have been intensely affected and  a discussion of Islamic \ninsurgency in Russia can not ensue without including all three territories.  Dagestan is the site of militant activity, \nand a frequent target of terrorism and violent criminality, while Ingushetia is a literal war zone.  Other parts of the \nNorth Caucasus have also seen violence -- North Ossetia is the site of militant activity, while Kabardino-Balkaria is \noften caught in the crossfire of violence between government forces and Chechen rebels.\n\nThe area is beset by daunting poverty and Russian leaders, such as Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, have offered \nthe view that poverty alleviation in the region should be part of the solution aimed at stabilization of the area. \nIndeed, expert analysts have, likewise, noted that poor socio-economic conditions constitute the stimulus for many \n\n\n\nyouth to join extremist Islamic militant groups in the North Caucasus.  At the same time, it must be emphasized that \nrevenge and resistance against the brutal tactics of the Russian military are part of the equation, ultimately serving  \nto augment extremism and militancy, and  create more fertile political soil for radical action.\n\nThe motivation of extremism and militancy aside, it should be noted that terrorism by Islamic extremists on Russian \nterrain is not a new phenomenon. Militant Islamic extremists from  the North Caucasus  have been behind a host of \nterrorist attacks over the years.  In 2002,  Chechen rebels carried out a siege on a theater in Moscow.  The \nChechen militant rebels who took over the theater demanded an end to the war in Chechnya, and threatened to kill \nthe hostages if their demands were not met. The grave situation demanded a rapid and overwhelming response by \nRussian authorities and, indeed, most of the hostages were eventually freed when Russian forces stormed the \ntheater.  However, 116 hostages were killed in the rescue operation, due to the indiscriminate use of an unspecified \nsleep-inducing agent by the Russians to deal with the Chechen rebels. In 2004, Chechen terrorists carried out a \nbrutal and bloody attack on a school in Beslan,  in which hundreds of people were taken hostage.  A two day siege \nended with a bloodbath in which more than 300 people were  killed under the most horrific conditions.  At least half \nthe victims in that case were children.  In  2009, the express train from Moscow to St. Petersburg was hit by North \nCaucasus Islamic terrorists.  In 2010, militant extremists stormed the parliament in Chechnya. That same year, the \nMoscow underground transit system was hit by two female suicide bombers from Dagestan.  In 2011,  a bomb \nattack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport left more than 35 people dead and at least 170 others wounded -- many of \nthem critically. The suicide bomber in that attack was identified as a 20-year-old man from the North Caucasus \nalthough a Chechen warlord, Doku Umarov, had claimed responsibility for orchestrating the attack at the Moscow \nairport.\n\nDoku Umarov, who has been seen as more of a philosophical separatist leader  than a military figure,  has claimed \nresponsibility for a number of terrorist attacks, including the  aforementioned double suicide bombing of the \nMoscow subway system in 2010 and the 2011 Moscow airport attack. In fact,  Umarov has threatened further \nattacks, insinuating that the extremist Islamic insurgency would intensify with more \"special operations\" in the \nfuture if Russia refused to allow the Caucasus to become an independent Islamic state. In a videotaped message in \n2011, he warned, \"Among us there are hundreds of brothers who are prepared to sacrifice themselves.\"  Umarov's \nwarning served as both a clarifier and a reminder.  First, it  was becoming increasingly clear that the ambitions of \nIslamist extremists had expanded from the goal of Chechnya's independence to a broader Jihadist ambition of \ncreating an Islamic state across the Caucasus, governed by Shar'ia law.   This broader objective explained the \nwidening of the Jihadist cause -- from a concentrated geopolitical center in Chechnya to a broader claim  across the \nNorthern Caucasus. Second, and more simply,  it was possible that the Tsarnaev  brothers were the latest actors \nwilling to undertake \"special operations\"  and \"sacrifice themselves\" for that Jihadist cause, thus bringing Chechen \nJihadist terrorism to American terrain.\n\nBut it was also possible that these two young men  -- neither of whom were victims of economic strife as is the case \nfor many Chechens, Dagestanis, and Ingushetians at home -- were motivated for different reasons.  It was possible \nthat they were inspired  by a broader ideological (read: global Islamic Jihadist) sensibility, reminiscent of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, hijackers, or the Nigerian Christmas Day bomber.  All the young men in these cases were \nwell-educated, spent several years in Western countries, quite possibly suffered from cultural alienation to some \ndegree as a result of the experience, thus driving them to take on radicalized Islamic  extremist identities, and \nultimately -- to terrorist actions on the basis of religion.\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev was reported to have told investigating authorities that he and his brother \nacted alone, rather than in concert with an organized Jihadist or terror enclave, and that their actions were \nmotivated by their Islamist beliefs, and inspired by the goal of global Jihadism. By the last week of April 2013, a \nclearer picture of the motivation for the bombings was emerging as reports surfaced about the radicalization of \nTarmalan Tsarnaev as early as 2010 -- a track that seemed to run parallel  with the increasingly religious orientation \nof his mother.  Both mother and son, as noted above, were wiretapped by Russian intelligence and appeared to \nhave discussed the possibility of participating in Jihad.  As such, it was apparent that Islamic extremism within the \nTsarnaev family fueled the terrorist actions of the two brothers.   \n\n\n\nOn May 1, 2013, three friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were arrested in connection with the Boston bombings.  \nAuthorities in the United States made clear that the young men -- two foreign students from Kazakhstan and one \nAmerican student -- were not believed to have assisted with the planning of the bombings.  However, the two \nKazakh students were being arrested for obstruction of justice  due to their decision to remove Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev's backpack filled with the remnants of fireworks explosives and deposit it in a landfill.  The third individual \nwas being arrested for lying to federal agents about the chain of events.\n\nAs to the logistical planning of the terror operation, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev revealed to federal investigators that he and \nhis brother had mulled over the possibility of carrying out suicide attacks before settling on the idea of pressure \ncooker bombs.  He said they made that decision based on the Internet footage of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical \nAmerican cleric who settled in Yemen and died in September 2011 as a result of an United States drone strike. \nAnwar al-Awlaki had advocated Islamist activist make use of home-made bombs to carry out small scale acts in the \nUnited States, in order to terrorize the American people on a sustained basis.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev also said they \nhad initiallt targeted July 4 as the date to carry out their attacks, but because they managed to manufacture the \narsenal of bombs in Tarmaan Tsarnaev's apartment  sooner than that date, they decided to move the date of their \nattack to the Boston Marathon to April 15.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nPresident Obama outlines national security vision  and counter-terrorism policy focusing on the use of drones, \nclosure of Guantanamo prison, and an end to perpetual war\n\nIn Detail --\n\nOn May 24, 2013, at the National Defense University in Washington, United States President Barack Obama \noffered a broad speech outlining his national security vision and counter-terrorism policy.  The president clarified \nhis position on the use of unmanned aircraft, referred to as \"drones,\" in the fight against brutal Islamic extremist \nterrorists.  President Obama also reiterated his call to close the prison for Islamic militants at Guantanamo Bay.  \nFinally, President Obama put to rest the notion of an endless \"war on terror,\" which was spurred in the aftermath of \nthe Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States by the previous Bush administration.\n\nOn the matter of drones, President Obama struck a balance between the vital need to defend the country against \nthe very real threat posed by terrorists, while preventing undue collateral damage in drone strikes.  He noted that \nthere should be  \"near certainty\" that no civilians  die in drone strikes.  At the same time, the president asserted that \nhe had a duty to protect the American people from those who would do them harm, saying: \"We are at war with an \norganization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.\"\n\nHuman rights groups and leftist critics have for some time condemned the use of drones to eliminate terrorists \nfinding safe haven  in remote regions of the world, such as the restive Afghan-Pak borderlands and broad swaths of \nYemen where Islamic extremist militants have strongholds.  These critics have argued against the use of unmanned \naircraft to strike at individuals, sometimes killing United States citizens in so doing, and certainly exacting collateral \ndamage in the form of other human beings in some cases.  They have loudly questioned the legality of killing United \nStates citizens in such a matter and without a trial, and have  viewed the use of drone strikes as an immoral use of \nair power and technology.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the equation, however, geo-strategic experts have noted that the use of drones -- already \npopular with the United States public as an alternative to \"boots on the ground\" by an already overly-extended \nUnited States military -- was a far more efficient and targeted approach to eliminating terrorists with malignant \nintentions.  As well, they have challenged the moral argument of human rights groups, noting that both drones and \n\"on the ground\" warfare inevitably result in the deaths of human beings. Experts also questioned why one form of \nmilitary engagement was so much more subject to criticism than the other.\n\nMoreover,  the United States government could well argue that it was operating within legal bounds by targeting an \nenemy of the state, and a leader of a terror enclave that had declared war on the United States.\n\nFor his part, the president himself addressed the difficult question of deciding whether or not to undertake a drone \nstrike, especially when its execution results in the deaths of United States citizens.  President Obama suggested \nthat drone strikes constituted a necessary -- but complicated -- option for military engagement when capture of a \nterrorist was not possible; however, he said that drone strikes and targeted killings should be used with more \ntemperance.  Explaining his stance, President Obama said, \"America does not take strikes to punish individuals, we \nact against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people.\"\n\nPresident Obama addressed his critics who have condemned targeted strikes against United States citizens \nbelieved to be intent on carrying out attacks against the United States.  The president declared that such \nindividuals should not be shielded by their citizenship from facing the consequences of their actions, just as sniper \nat a local crime scene should not be shielded from police.  To this end, President Obama stated the following:  \n\"When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and \nwhen neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his \ncitizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be \nprotected from a SWAT team.\"\n\nThe president continued by observing that those who might die as collateral damage in a drone strike \"will haunt us \nfor as long as we live.\"  However, he made clear that the death toll from terrorists  was astronomical in comparison \nto the estimated civilian casualties from drone strikes.\n\nThat being said, President Obama explained that the United States had arrived  at a \"crossroads\" in its efforts to \nvanquish extremism and militancy, and that the effort had to be undertaken with greater oversight, more \ntransparency, and stricter rules of engagement.  Accordingly, the controversial drone strike program would be \nshifted from the jurisdiction of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where it has been shrouded in secrecy, to the \njurisdiction of the Defense Department where there would be more oversight and transparency in the execution of \ndrone strikes,  especially with respect to targeted eliminations outside war zones such as Afghanistan.  However, it \nshould be noted that the CIA would retain control over drone strikes in Pakistan.  According to the White House, the \nnew \"presidential policy guidance\" on the use of drone strikes also included provisions to limit circumstances under \nwhich drones could be used in places such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.\n\nThe new presidential policy guidance additionally made clear that the capture of terrorist suspects as the \npreferable \"end game\" although drone strikes would be used in cases of \"continuing\" and \"imminent\" threats to \nUnited States national security where capture was not feasible.  As noted by the president himself,  drone strikes \nshould be undertaken only \"when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat.\"  \nPresident Obama additionally warned there should be \"near certainty\" that no civilians would be killed in a targeted \nstrike.\n\n\n\nRepublican critics  wasted no time in criticizing these moves.  Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee, said, \"The president's policies signal a retreat from the threat of al-Qaida.\"  \nBut the Republicans were not alone in their critique.  Far left voices joined the fray, albeit for decidedly different \nreasons. The American Civil Liberties Union complained that there was \"still insufficient transparency\" regarding the \ndrone strike program.\n\nRegardless of the negative response to President Obama's national security and counter-terrorism policy by his \nconservative and liberal antagonists, it was clear that the international community welcomed the president's vision \nand policy agenda. The government of Yemen said it welcomed the initiatives aimed at transferring detainees to \nthat country while the government of Pakistan was appreciative of President Obama's acknowledgment that  \"force \nalone cannot make us safe.\"  While the Pakistani government reiterated its complaint that drone strikes violated its \nsovereignty, the fact of the matter was that such operations could not ensue without Pakistan's tacit knowledge of \nthese actions.  Perhaps most significantly, the United Nations rapporteur leading an inquiry into  the legality of \nUnited States' drone strikes characterized President Obama's new  guidelines on the use of drones as \"historic.\"  \nBen Emmerson reacted to President Obama's new policy framework as follows: \"It sets out more clearly and more \nauthoritatively than ever before the administration's legal justifications for targeted killing, and the constraints that it \noperates under. The publication of the procedural guidelines for the use of force in counter-terrorism operations is a \nsignificant step towards increased transparency and accountability.\"\n\nOn the matter of the terrorist detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, President Obama embarked  a new \npush to close the controversial facility.  It should be noted that earlier in his presidency, President Obama attempted \nto make good on his campaign promise to close the prison, observing at the time that it was a blight on the \nreputation of the United States in terms of international jurisprudence.\n\nHis efforts to close the detention center at Guantanamo were thwarted by Republicans and Democrats alike,  who \nwere not eager to bear the political burden of dealing with fate of the prisoners, especially in regard to a plan to \nresettle them at maximum security jails in the mainland United States.\n\nAt issue was the concern that some detainees would be released into society and resume their pursuit of terrorism. \nAlso at issue was some concern that terrorism suspects could not be properly or safely held in prisons on the \nUnited States mainland. That latter argument was, at the time, challenged by the president who  pointed to a host of \ndangerous individuals -- from Charles Manson to the first World Trade Center bombers -- who were held in United \nStates prisons, and then tried and sentenced within the United States justice system.\n\nNow in 2013, however, President Obama renewed his advocacy on the closure of the prison at Guantanamo. To \nthis end, he again noted that Americans should not have anxiety over the notion of extremist militant Jihadists being \nhoused at maximum security prisons on American continental terrain. President Obama pointed out that there have \nbeen no escape incidents from such facilities in the United States.  But perhaps with a cognizance that the United \nStates would be reluctant, once again, to act affirmatively on the controversial issue of closing the prison at \nGuantanamo, President Obama made clear that he would use his executive power to advance the process.  To this \nend, President Obama announced that  he had lifted a moratorium on prisoner transfers to Yemen.  This plan was \nrejected by several Republican politicians, with Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia warning that the transfer of \nsome of the  \"meanest, nastiest killers in the world\" would be akin to \"turning them loose.\"\n\nRegardless of such objections, the fact of the matter was that the continuing existence of the prison camp at \nGuantanamo was viewed negatively by the international community, effectively illustrating the perceived erosion of \nAmerican constitutional values and the rule of law.  As noted by President Obama himself: \"Guantanamo has \n\n\n\nbecome a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.\"  Thus the need to close it down and \nuse established methods and facilities of jurisprudence to deal with all individuals threatening United States national \nsecurity, according to President Obama.\n\nAs the president reiterated his desire to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, he was interrupted \nrepeatedly and relentlessly by Medea Benjamin of the ultra-left organization, Code Pink, which has made a habit of \nheckling United States politicians over the course of the last decade.  Undeterred by the interruption, President \nObama incorporated the protester's actions into his speech on a spontaneous basis, saying, \"I'm willing to cut the \nyoung lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth being passionate about.\"\n\nIt should be noted that during his speech, President Obama defined the war against al-Qaida type Islamic extremist  \nterrorists as a \"just war.\"  With the new parameters for drone strikes in effect (now to be administered by the \nDefense Department with more oversight authority), he noted that this war would be waged in a proportionate \nmanner and only for the purpose of self defense.\n\nBut President Obama was also willing to delve into the ethical questions surrounding the very notion of a \"just war\" \nand the self defense justification of it.  He said,  \"And yet as our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate \nclaim of self defense cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to \nsay it is wise or moral in every instance.\"  He continued, \"For the same progress that gives us the technology to \nstrike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it.\"  From a \nphilosophical point of view, President Obama outlined the ethical challenge facing the United States as he said, \n\"From our use of drones to the detention of terror suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the \ntype of nation and world that we leave to our children.\"\n\nFinally, President Obama put to rest the notion of an endless \"war on terror,\" which was spurred in the aftermath of \nthe Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States by the previous Bush administration.  Making clear that his \nforeign policy vision and counter-terrorism orientation would not continue to be marked by the legacy of the \nprevious Bush administration, President Obama  warned against a \"perpetual\"  war on terror, regardless of what \nmilitary tactics were used to prosecute the war.\n\nFrom troop deployments of the type used in Iraq and Afghanistan,  to special forces operations of the type used in \nPakistan to eliminate the terrorism mastermind, Osama Bin Laden, or even drone strikes of the type used in Yemen \nto eliminate  Anwar al-Alwaki, the United States-born terrorist orchestrator and propaganda communicator for al-\nQaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a never-ending war on something as broad as terrorism would be \"self-\ndefeating,\" according to President Obama.  He said: \"I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part \nof a larger discussion about a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. Because for all the focus on the use of \nforce, force alone cannot make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; and in \nthe absence of a strategy that reduces the well-spring of extremism, a perpetual war \u2013- through drones or special \nforces or troop deployments \u2013- will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways.\"\n\nAt a practical level, the president  observed that many of the world's terrorists were now on the run rather than \nsafely situated and comfortably able to plot attacks against the United States and its allies.  Instead, al-Qaida \nterrorists in  Pakistan and Afghanistan were worrying about their own safety,  while the threat posed by extremist \nIslamic Jihadists was more diffuse and amorphous, extending way beyond the area of the Afghan-Pak border to  \nYemen, wide swaths of Africa, parts of Asia,  and even the North Caucasus in Europe.  As such, concentrating on \nthe threat posed by terrorism in a state-based manner was likely outmoded.  Instead, the emerging threat of \nterrorism would come from localized extremist entities, of the type thought to be responsible for the 2012 attack on \n\n\n\nthe United States embassy in Benghazi in Libya, and homegrown terrorists of the type responsible for the 2013 \nBoston terror bombings.\n\nTo meet these evolving threats, President Obama promised to continue the effort against terrorist groups, while at \nthe same time making it vividly clear that the so-called term, \"war on terror,\" should  be transposed to the history \nbooks, and that the war itself should be brought to a conclusion.  He said: \"Our systematic effort to dismantle \nterrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what \nour democracy demands.\"\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nPresident Obama's decision to end the Iraq war, his restrained approach towards conflicts in Libya and Syria, his \nreliance on smart sanctions (or \"soft power\")  with regards to nuclear Iran,  suggest a \"light footprint\" foreign policy \norientation. Furthermore, President Obama's refocus on the Afghan-Pak region, culminating in May 2011 with the \nelimination of Bin Laden and the killing of terrorism and propaganda orchestrator, al-Alwaki, his timeline for ending \nthe war in Afghanistan, and his tactical/targeted approach to deal with al-Qaida havens, collectively  offer a glimpse \nof his anti-terrorism approach.  At the same time, President Obama's decision to voluntarily put the reins on his own \npresidential power by curtailing the use of drone strikes, attempting to close the Guantanamo detention center, and \nbanishing the lexicon of \"war on terror,\"  suggest a complicated -- and perhaps even an ambivalent -- philosophical \nperspective on matters of war and peace.  Indeed, the Obama doctrine has embraced the following elements: (1) \nvigorous diplomatic engagement augmented by strategic military pressure; (2) strategic pragmatism, reliant more \non intelligence and targeted  strikes and operations than excessive boots on the ground; (3) multilateralism, in \nwhich an engaged United States of America works within an international framework to solve global problems;  (4) a \nmixture of restraint and aggression in regards to national security interests, manifest by reticence over further \nmilitary engagement juxtaposed against brazen strikes against terrorists when those actions are deemed to be \nnecessary;  and (5) an embrace of democratic ideals, in which the United States would support self-determination \nof freedom-seeking people, while eschewing the neoconservative vision of American hegemony and empire.\n\nPresident Obama makes personnel changes: Rice to NSA and Power to UN\n\nIn the first week of June 2013, United States National Security Adviser Thomas Donilan stepped down from his \npost, paving the way for President Barack Obama  to make some significant changes in his national security and \nforeign policy team.\n\nWith Donilan vacating the spot at the president's most trusted national security adviser, President Obama \nnominated  Dr. Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, to take over that role.  With Rice \nvacating the role as the United States' top diplomat to the United Nations, human rights advocate Samantha Power \nwas tapped to fill that spot.  Both Rice and Power have been part of President Obama's foreign policy inner circle \nsince the start of his presidential campaign and before he won the White House in 2008.\n\nRice  gained notoriety over her characterization of the events leading to the attack on the Benghazi diplomatic \ncompound in Libya on Sept. 11, 2012.  Her usage of talking points from the Central Intelligence Agency to describe \nthe attack as the result of a spontaneous disturbance sparked criticism from Republicans.  That criticism likely \nderailed the possibility that she would gain Senate confirmation as the new Secretary of State succeeding outgoing \nHillary Clinton.  That job ultimately went to then-Senator John Kerry.  Meanwhile, President Obama was biding his \ntime and was now nominating Rice for the powerful national security position, which would not require Senate \n\n\n\nconfirmation.  Republicans eager to go after Rice could presumably look to Power as a proxy target since the \nUnited Nations position  requires Senate confirmation.  But Power, a Pulitzer Prize winner for her advocacy of \nintervention in cases of genocide, had the backing of the international human rights community thanks to her \nsteadfast and powerful background as one committed to preventing mass atrocities.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nIs NSA hacker Snowden a hero or a threat to United States national security?\n\nMid-2013 was dominated by questions about the fate of Edward Snowden -- a former contract employee of the \nNational Security Agency who leaked classified information to the public and then fled the United States.  The \nrevelations about the United States' secret surveillance program highlighted the post-September 11, 2001, debate \nover privacy rights versus national security interests in the United States.\n\nThe matter emerged in the public purview via an article in the United Kingdom-based Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe Guardian's piece focused on  a phone records monitoring program by the  National Security Agency (NSA), \nwhich gathers millions of phone records in the United States as part of a database for national security purposes.  \nThe phone records or so-called \"meta-data\" theoretically do not include the actual content of conversations.  \nInstead, the meta-data  concentrates on points of contact, frequency of contacts, location data, call duration, and \nother such patterns that could presumably assist in determining whether terror suspects are in communication with \npersons in the United States.\n\nAn article by the Washington Post revealed another surveillance program, known as PRISM, in which the NSA and \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation can garner a broad swath of records of Internet (online) activity in an effort to \ndetect suspicious  behavior, or patterns of behavior,  and determine possible terrorist threats.  It should be noted \nthat while some news articles claimed that the government had the ability to directly \"tap into\" the servers of Internet \ngiants, such Google, in fact, this government actually has to request that information from Internet companies.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned the disclosure of the intelligence-gathering programs \nas reckless and \"gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence \ncapabilities.\"  Accordingly, the NSA  requested that the Justice Department start an investigation into the \nunauthorized disclosure of classified information.\n\nOn June 9, 2013, a 29-year-old intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden, admitted via the Guardian that it was he \nwho disclosed the information about the surveillance programs to the media.  Snowden has said that he  worked as \na contractor with the consulting firm, Booz Allen Hamilton, at a National Security Agency (NSA)  office in Hawaii.  It \nwas later confirmed that he was systems administrator at an NSA Threat Operations Center and responsible for  \ndetecting threats to government computer systems. Before that, Snowden claimed to have worked at the Central \nIntelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nSnowden was cited as saying, \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that \nwhich is done against them.\" Snowden seemed to understand he would likely face prosecution for leaking classified \ninformation to the public. It was certainly possible that Snowden could face a similar fate as Army Private Bradley \nManning who could spend his  life in prison under military law if convicted for releasing classified documents \n\n\n\nthrough Wikileaks.  Snowden said in an interview with the Washington Post that he intended to request asylum \n\"from  any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy.\"  Snowden expected \nto be assisted in his asylum search  by Iceland's International Modern Media Institute.\n\nIt should be noted that Snowden made these remarks from Hong Kong where he believed he was not at risk for \nextradition to the United States.  But Snowden's presence in Hong Kong, which is ultimately under China's \njurisdiction, raised questions about his understanding of free speech, democratic governance, and transparency. \nStated differently, the power center in Beijing is not known to be a center of freedom and openness.\n\nThe identity and plight of Snowden aside, the  news of these surveillance programs raised the ire of civil liberties \nadvocates, while simultaneous earning robust defense from national security experts.  Indeed, the same debate \nthat arose in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States was resurfacing again over how much \nprivacy must be  relinquished in order to ensure national security.\n\nFor example, Congressman Peter King pointed out that the leaks provided terror enclaves, such as al-Qaida, with \ninformation about the United States' telecommunications security apparatus, and were thus gravely harmful to \nnational security.  Congressman Mike Rogers was more scathing in his condemnation of the media's publication of \nthe leaked materials, saying that journalists \"have no clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released \njust enough information to literally be dangerous.\"  Senator Mark Udall acknowledged that the disclosures were \ndisturbing but that it was time for the country  to have a serious discussion about privacy in the age of modern \nterrorism. He said.  \"I am not happy that we've had leaks and these leaks are concerning, but I think it's an \nopportunity now to have a discussion about the limits of surveillance, how we create transparency, and above all, \nhow we protect Americans' privacy.\"\n\nWhile the revelations about the phone and Internet surveillance programs appeared to shock the American public, \nin fact, hints of such measures have been available to the public for about a decade -- ever since the enactment of \nthe Patriot Act, which has been repeatedly re-authorized (in 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2011) with broad and \noverwhelming bipartisan support in both houses of Congress.  It should be noted that the specific surveillance \nprograms at issue were originally part of the former Bush administration's warrant-less surveillance program, \nalthough it was subsequently brought under the aegis of legal jurisdiction via updated versions of the Patriot Act.  \nThe programs are authorized for limited three-month periods at a time, thus facilitating regular court oversight.\n\nAs noted by Senator Dianne Feinstein in an interview with MSNBC News, the provisions of the programs authorized \nunder the Patriot Act were not only legal, but have been available for members of the upper chamber to scrutinize, \nwhile the legislation itself  has been litigated, discussed thoroughly, and overwhelmingly passed into law via  \nCongress. Clearly, despite House Speaker John Boehner's incredulous claim that the revelations about the \nsurveillance programs raised questions about civil liberties, he -- along with all members of Congress -- were aware \nof, and complicit with -- the  development of these programs in the first place.\n\nThat being said, President Barack Obama's administration, which was viewed by civil liberties advocates as a \nwelcome shift from the national security state installed by the previous Bush administration, was taking heat for the \ncontinuation of these (arguably) invasive surveillance programs. Indeed, while the phone surveillance program did \nnot include actual content of phone conversations, the indiscriminate and sweeping collection of the phone data \ncertainly raised eyebrows. Former Vice President Al Gore, who facilitated the development of the Internet, posed \nthe following question via Twitter: \"Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?\"\n\n\n\nFor his part, President Obama defended the surveillance practices, which he emphasized were both legal and \noverseen by a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  (FISA) in the judicial sphere.  He dismissed the notion \nthat American citizens' calls were being monitored or recorded, asserting emphatically, \"Nobody is listening to your \ntelephone calls. That's not what this program is about.\"  President Obama  also noted that tough choices have to be \nmade in democratic societies with complicate landscapes that include serious threats of terrorism.  To this end, the \npresident  said: \"It's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent \nprivacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society.\"\n\nSnowden -- the aforementioned source of the leaks on the secret surveillance programs -- has argued that despite \nthe government's claims that the programs are tightly regulated, circumscribed, and subject to supervision by a \nsecret court,  in fact, analysts can target anyone. He said, \"Any analyst at any time can target anyone. Any selector. \nAnywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of those sensor networks and the \nauthority that that analyst is empowered with.\" Snowden further noted, \"Not all analysts have the power to target \nanything. But I, sitting at my desk, had the authority to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant to a federal \njudge to even the president if I had a personal email.\"\n\nThese claims were strongly challenged by government officials.  As noted by a former NSA official in an interview \nwith the Washington Post, \"When he [Snowden]  said he had access to every CIA station around the world, he's \nlying.\"  That former official noted that such information would only be available to high level executives, thus \nsuggesting that the documents were garnered in a clearly unauthorized manner.  Moreover, the very statement by \nSnowden that he had \"the authority to wiretap anyone\" smacked of exaggeration since all wiretaps actually require \ncourt orders, which obviously was not given in blanket form to Edward Snowden.  Put differently, circumventing the \nlaw to access calls or records is not the same thing as possessing all-encompassing \"authority\" to do so.\n\nSnowden's disturbing claim that he could wiretap anyone, \"including the president,\"  was addressed by  NSA \nDirector Keith Alexander during  Senate intelligence committee hearings. Alexander foreclosed that notion.  He said \nof Snowden's assertion: \"False. I know of no way to do that.\"\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, there was also emerging concern over the fact that Snowden --  a high school \"dropout\" \nwho commanded  a six-figure income job with a private security contractor -- was  offered  a high level of access to \nsensitive government information. Accordingly, intelligence investigators were examining how Snowden was able to \naccess  top-secret NSA documents, given the  highly compartmentalized information structure of the agency. Of \nparticular anxiety was the matter of how a contract employee at a NSA satellite office in Hawaii was capable of \naccessing not simply sensitive documents, but a copy of the highly classified  legal order  (re: the phone records \ncase ) from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA).  As noted by a former NSA official in an article in the \nWashington Post, such court orders are normally available to \"maybe 30 or maybe 40\" individuals in total, most of \nwhom were likely centered in the general counsel's office. Of course, the answer to that question likely resided in \nthe fact that the nature of Snowden's work involved information technology  systems, making it possible for him to \nbypass normal security protocols and illegally access such material.\n\nFrom the perspective of government officials, the fact of the matter  was that Snowden's disclosures  were \ndamaging and likely compromised national security. According to NSA Director Keith Alexander  during Senate \nintelligence committee hearings on June 12, 2013, \"Great harm has already been done by opening this is up and \nthe consequence, I believe is our security has already been jeopardized.\" He added that the United States and its \nallies would \"no longer be as safe as we were two weeks ago.\"\n\nAs troubling as that assertion might seem, it was certainly conceivable that foreign terrorists now had greater insight \nas to how they were being monitored and were thusly better positioned to evade detection.\n\n\n\nAlexander additionally emphasized the fact that the NSA surveillance programs successfully disrupted several \nterror plots.  He said, \"It's dozens of terrorist events that these [programs] have helped prevent.\" Alexander said \nthat in the interests of improved transparency -- one of the central themes at issue -- the NSA would brief the \nintelligence committee on the details of the surveillance programs, and would seek to declassify some aspects of \nthe programs for the public.  He said,  \"We do want to get this right and it has to be vetted across the community so \nwhat we give you, you know, is accurate.\"  But the NSA chief warned that some elements would have to remain \nclassified because \"if we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and \nAmericans will die.\"  Alexander said he was willing to endure public criticism for this decision, rather than \n\"jeopardize the security of this country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Snowden reportedly departed the hotel where he was registered in Hong Kong, leaving his \nwhereabouts a mystery at the time.  Before he departed, Snowden managed to tell a Hong Kong newspaper, the \nSouth China Morning Post, that he had evidence of the United States hacking into Chinese computer networks, and \nadding that there were several cyber spy operations being undertaken by the United States government.  It was \ndifficult to characterize this claim by Snowden as much of a disclosure since the very existence of a clandestine \nservice in the form of the Central Intelligence Agency would suggest that spying on foreign powers was not a new \nor revelatory  development.  That being said, Snowden's presence in China, armed with some of the United States' \nmost sensitive documents, along with the fact that Snowden chose to reveal this strategic information to a foreign \nentity (along with  emphasis on  his possession of such \"evidence\"), were factors not likely to help his cause. \nIndeed, these very factors clearly undermined Snowden's claim that he was acting in the interests of his country.\n\nIntelligence officials soon characterized Snowden's declaration about the United States spying on China to be a \nbetrayal.  In the publication, The Hill, United States Representative Dutch Ruppersberger was on the record \nasserting: \"Some people are saying that he's a hero. He's broken the law. We have laws in the United States for \nwhistleblowers, for people that think there's an injustice being done. All he had to do was raise his hand.  Under the \nwhistleblower law, he is protected. Yet he chose to go to China.\"\n\nAs reported by ABC News on June 13, 2013,  United States intelligence officials were now treating the \nSnowden/NSA leak case as\n\na possible incidence of foreign espionage, given the fact that the Snowden was moving in the direction of acting in a \nmanner blatantly contrary to the interests of the United States.\n\nRegardless of Ruppersberger's claim, supporters of Snowden have argued that he is, indeed, a whistleblower \nattempting to draw attention to the broad sweeping powers of the surveillance activities of the NSA.  The \ncountervailing view has come from some legal experts who have asserted that Snowden does not fall into this \ncategory that  covers persons, such as Daniel Ellsburg, who was responsible for the release of the Pentagon \nPapers decades ago related to the government's decision-making on the Vietnam War.  Of primary relevance was \nthe fact that  Ellsburg did not flee United States jurisdiction with classified intelligence documents; instead, he \nsurrendered to the United States authorities to face the consequences of his actions.\n\nSecondly, whistleblower laws apply to employees who expose  misconduct, such as dishonest or illegal activity \noccurring at an organization. Whistleblowers enjoy protection from such retaliatory actions as wrongful dismissal, \ndemotion, blocked promotions, or barriers to proper compensation. But these whistleblower laws do not apply to \nemployees or contractors working for the intelligence agencies.  Instead, legislation known as the Intelligence \nCommunity Whistleblower Protection Act, applies to persons employed in intelligence positions. However, even this \nparticular law would not classify Snowden as a whistleblower  since he did not reveal any  illegal activity, abuse, \nfraud, or  waste  -- the incidences covered by the act. As discussed above, regardless of the disapproval by civil \n\n\n\nliberties advocates, the fact of the matter was that the sweeping surveillance powers of the NSA  were enshrined \nlegally.\n\nThirdly, even if Snowden had  actual illegalities or abuses to reveal, he would have been compelled to report such \nmatters to either the NSA's inspector general or a member of one of the congressional intelligence committees with \nthe proper security clearances.  Disclosing his concerns to the public was, in and of itself, regarded as a violation.\n\nOn the basis of these parameters, a professor at the Washington College of Law at American University,  Steve \nVladeck, was asked by NBC News if Snowden would have  qualify for whistleblower protection;  Vladeck replied: \n\"None.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on June 16, 2013, the White House chief of staff said that President Barack Obama did not believe that \nthe surveillance of phone records and Internet data  violated the privacy of United States citizens.  In an interview \nwith CBS's \"Face the Nation\" program, Denis McDonough was asked whether President Obama believed that he \nviolated the privacy of Americans.  McDonough replied, \"He does not.\"  Still, McDonough acknowledged that \"the \nexistence of these programs obviously have unnerved many people.\"\n\nMcDonough noted that the president welcomed a public debate on the matter of privacy rights versus national \nsecurity, and  declared, \"we have to find the right balance, and we will not keep ourselves on a perpetual war \nfooting.\"\n\nSenator Mark Udall of Colorado appeared to welcome that debate saying in an interview on \"Meet the Press,\" \"We \nowe it to the American people to have a fulsome debate in the open about the extent of these programs.\"  He \ncontinued, \"My number one goal is to protect the American people, but we can do it in a way that also respects our \ncivil liberties.\"\n\nBut as June 2013 entered its final week, the debate of the domestic surveillance program had shifted to the \nquestion of whether Snowden was acting against the national security interests of the United States for nefarious \nreasons, rather than being driven by his self-proclaimed agenda of sharing information with American citizens.  At \nissue was the revelation that  Snowden allegedly shared the details of the United States's computer network \nintelligence gathering activities on China.  According to the  South China Morning Post, the United States infiltrated  \nthe computer network of China's prominent Tsinghua University,  as well as the computer systems of Pacnet.  \nClearly, by passing on the sensitive operational information about the United States' cyber intelligence activities \nagainst a quasi-adversary, such as China, Snowden was  now acting in a manner that was outright damaging \nUnited States' national security interests.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, it was revealed that the government of the United States was taking legal action against \nSnowden, the former NSA contract employee, for absconding with sensitive intelligence documents and then  \ndisclosing that classified information.  The government of the United States charged Snowden with theft of \ngovernment property, unauthorized communication of national defense information to  someone without a security \nclearance, and willful communication of classified intelligence. The latter two charges were violations covered under \nthe Espionage Act.  Each of the three charges carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\n\nThe charges had actually been issued on June 14, 2013, but the document remained  sealed for a week.  United \nStates officials also formally filed a petition with  Hong Kong, where Snowden was in hiding, asking Hong Kong \nauthorities to  detain him while an indictment and an extradition request were in the preparation stages.\n\n\n\nAt the time, authorities from the United States indicated that the extradition process was expected to be a lengthy \none since Snowden could argue that the charges against him were politically motivated; that condition could \nmitigate the terms of the extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong.  That being said, United \nStates officials said that they were working with Hong Kong counterparts to ensure that the charges filed against \nSnowden were consistent with the terms of the  extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and harmonious with Hong Kong \nlaw. To that end, they filed a  \"provisional arrest warrant\" against Snowden in which Hong Kong police would be \nasked to arrest Snowden, ultimately returning him to United States jurisdiction to face prosecution.\n\nSpeaking of this effort, United States Congressman Peter King said: \"I fully support the efforts of the United States \ngovernment to indict and prosecute Edward Snowden to the fullest extent of the law. He has betrayed his country \nand the government must demand his extradition at the earliest date.\"\n\nBut that possibility of extradition seemed to slip away on June 22, 2013, when news broke that the government of \nHong Kong had allowed Snowden to leave the special administrative region of China.  Hong Kong offered a bizarre \nexplanation for its decision -- suggesting  that Washington improperly filled out the necessary documents  and so \nSnowden was allowed to  depart \"on his own accord.\"\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Hong Kong's  decision to allow Snowden to escape, irrespective of the \nprevailing process of extradition, may have been directed by Beijing.  The New York Times published an article in \nwhich it  suggested that Beijing did not simply grant consent for the decision to allow Snowden to leave; instead, \nBeijing apparently made the final decision.  According to the New York Times, Beijing was making the calculation \nthat the departure of Snowden would ensure that it was not embroiled in a thorny and protracted legal battle with \nthe United States over extradition, while at the same time silencing the Chinese public from their displays of robust \nsupport for Snowden whom the public viewed as a hero. In effect, Beijing jettisoned the Snowden problem. The \nNew York Times also said that Western intelligence sources believed that the Chinese government had managed to \ngarner the contents of Snowden's cache of intelligence data that he brought to Hong Kong.  If that claim proved to \nbe true, there would certainly be no good reason for China to keep Snowden within its jurisdiction since everything \nof value would already be accessible to the Chinese. Of course, the decision to allow Snowden to leave Hong Kong \nwas sure to infuriate Washington D.C., and exacerbate the grim situation at the diplomatic level.\n\nThe attention soon shifted to Russia as news reports surfaced that Snowden departed Hong Kong on  a one-way \nticket aboard Aeroflot, the national airline of Russia, and was expected to land in Moscow on June 23, 2013.  He \nwas reportedly accompanied by representatives of Wikileaks.  Moscow was not expected to be his final destination \nand there were soon suggestions that Snowden would be traveling onto Cuba, with a final destination expected to \nbe somewhere in South America -- either Venezuela or Ecuador.  Venezuela initially loomed large as the final \ndestination but when Snowden landed in Russia, the presence of diplomatic personnel from Ecuador raised the \npossibility that he would ultimately seek asylum in that country. That prospect was confirmed by the foreign minister \nof Ecuador via Twitter.  Of note was the fact that Ecuador has already provided asylum to Julian Assange, the \nfugitive founder of Wikileaks -- a clearing house for stolen classified documents from various government agencies.  \nWikileaks soon issued a statement of its own asserting that Snowden was \"bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a \nsafe route for the purposes of asylum.\"  Wikileaks confirmed that Snowden was being escorted by legal advisers \nand diplomats, and that his asylum request would be formally processed upon arrival in Ecuador.\n\nThe news of Snowden's escape from  Hong Kong and the apparent complicity of several governments evoked \nangry responses from United States members of Congress -- an on a rare bipartisan basis.  Senate Intelligence \nCommittee chair, Dianne Feinstein (D-California), accused China of \"having a role in this.\" Senator Charles \nSchumer (D-New York) accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of \"aiding and abetting Snowden's escape.\" \n\n\n\nSchumer further said:  \"Putin always seems almost eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States -- whether \nit is Syria, Iran and now of course with Snowden.\"  House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers (R) excoriated \nSnowden  for traveling to Russia to avoid extradition to the United States. He said of Snowden: \"If he really believes \nhe did something good, he should get on a plane and come back and face the consequences of his actions.\"\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) had a different view of Snowden, suggesting that the fugitive was a truth teller to \nbe distinguished from the country's national intelligence director, James Clapper.  He said, \"I do think that when \nhistory looks at this, they are going to contrast the behavior of James Clapper, our national intelligence director, \nwith Edward Snowden.\"  Congressman Peter King (R) managed to combine criticism of Snowden's supporters \nincluding Senator Rand Paul (a fellow Republican), with a scathing characterization of the fugitive leaker as a \ntraitor.  He said, \"As Americans we have to support the president. I wish all Americans including Senator Rand Paul \nwould realize Snowden is no hero. I know on CNN today he compared \u2014- Rand Paul compared Snowden to \nGeneral Clapper. You know, this kind of talk \u2014- I don't know what's happening to our country that people are \nmaking this traitor and defector into some kind of hero. At the same time, castigating true American heroes.\"\n\nFor its part, there was restrained reaction from the White House, although the government of the Obama \nadministration made clear that Snowden's passport had been revoked. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki also \nurged governments around the world to prevent Snowden from entry into their countries, saying, \"Persons wanted \non felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other \nthan is necessary to return him to the United States.\"  Of course, it would be up to the leadership of any given \ncountry to decide whether or not they would comply with this declaration from the  United States, and such leaders \ndefinitely had the latitude to decide whether or not they would allow Snowden entry without a valid  passport.\n\nOn June 24, 2013,  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the White House did not accept Hong Kong's \n\"technical paperwork\" explanation for allowing Snowden to leave on a flight for Russia.  Carney also noted that \nHong Kong's decision to allow Snowden to depart from that specially administered territory of China  would have a \n\"negative impact\" on Sino-American relations.  Secretary of State John Kerry entered the fray on June 23, 2013, \nand signaled the anger of the Obama administration when he referred to Snowden as \"a traitor to his country.\" A \nday later on June 24, 2013, Secretary Kerry also warned that there would be \"serious consequences\" if Russia \nallowed Snowden to leave its territory.\n\nMeanwhile, the destinations along Snowden's \"world tour\" of autocratic leftist countries en route to asylum in South \nAmerica received marked attention.  At issue was the circuitous journey of Snowden from Chinese jurisdiction in \nHong Kong, to Russia, and with proposed continued travel via Cuba, onward to a final destination in Venezuela or \nEcuador. Of note was the fact that bilateral relations between the United States and China and Russia have a \nhistory of stress and a particularly loaded Cold War legacy.  Despite thawing relations more recently, China and \nRussia have occasionally enjoyed acting as thorns in the side of the United States.  Meanwhile, Venezuela, Cuba \nand Ecuador are respectively members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America -- a leftist bloc \nfounded on \"anti-imperialist\" (and often anti-American) credentials.  Congressman Mike Rogers said, \"When you \nlook at it, every one of those nations is hostile to the United States. If you could go to North Korea and Iran, he \ncould round out his government oppression tour.\"\n\nRogers' quip about the \"government oppression tour\" may hold particular validity as none of these countries on \nSnowden's itinerary -- China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, or Ecuador -- can be objectively viewed as models of \ndemocracy, transparency, free speech, human rights, and civil liberties.\n\nIndeed, all these countries can legitimately be regarded as semi-authoritarian regimes and pose questions about \nSnowden's intentions given his grievances against the government of the United States.\n\n\n\nWhile Hong Kong is semi-autonomous in many respects, the Chinese government still has ultimate say. As such, \nthe Hong Kong authorities do not investigate claims about Chinese intimidation of its critics in Hong Kong.  In fact, \ntwo Chinese citizens were sentenced to \"re-education\" labor camp for participating in pro-democracy rallies in Hong \nkong. As well, police in Hong Kong use  \"overly restrictive methods\" in controlling assembly, according to Human \nRights Watch.  Snowden's choice to go initially to Hong Kong can be viewed as an ironic selection in some \nrespects.\n\nThe irony of Snowden being charged on espionage grounds and standing safely on Russian ground cannot be \nignored as authorities in Moscow are not restrained in their treatment of individuals accused of the same charges.  \nIn fact, according to Amnesty International, the definitions of treason and espionage in Russia are so all-\nencompassing that they include sharing information with or \"providing miscellaneous assistance\" to foreign states  \nwhose activities are \"directed against security of the Russian Federation.\" Clearly, by Russian standards, \nSnowden's activities against the United States would easily be regarded as treason and espionage.  Human Rights \nWatch has also accused Russia of having a flawed system of jurisprudence that does not meet  international \nstandards of fairness, cracking down on civic action, restricting freedom of expression, and carrying out torture and  \n\"other ill treatment\" against government antagonists.\n\nCuba, which may be an interesting in-transit destination along Snowden's journey, is described by  Human Rights \nWatch as \"the only country in Latin America that represses virtually all forms of political dissent.\"  Human Rights \nWatch further notes that Cuba enacts its repression by using \"short-term detentions, beatings, public acts of \nrepudiation, travel restrictions, and forced exile.\" On a longer term basis, the Cuban government habitually \nsentences dissidents to substantial prison terms following summary trials that are not open to the public.  Again, the \nirony of Snowden touching down in a communist state with a policy of repressing and restricting free speech, and \nof preventing dissidents from recourse for their objections to the government, cannot be overstated.\n\nVenezuela under Chavez saw a precipitous decline into autocracy, and the scenario has been maintained under \nMaduro.  Presidential power was consolidated in such a way as to  \"intimidate, censor, and prosecute Venezuelans \nwho criticize the president or thwart his political agenda,\" according to Human Rights Watch. Members of the \njudiciary, press, media, and human rights groups complain of being intimidated by the government for their \ncriticism.  But perhaps most germane to the Snowden case has been the fact that Venezuela has laws on the books \nthat \"dramatically reduce the public's right to obtain information held by the government,\" according to human rights \nagencies. The original grievance by Snowden against the United States government has been the matter of the \npublic's right to access information held by the government.\n\nFinally, Ecuador -- Snowden's likely destination according to reports at the time of writing -- is ruled by lefist \nPresident Rafael Correa, who holds a clear anti-American orientation, and who gave asylum to Wikileaks founder \nJulian Assange.  In a particularly stunning case of irony, Correa justified his decision to give Assange asylum in the \nembassy of Ecuador, by asserting that there was no room for secrecy in modern times.  He said to Assange: \"We \nbelieve, my dear Julian, that the only things that should be protected against information sharing and freedom of \nspeech are those set in the international treaties... The rest, the more people find out about it, the better.\"  But in \nactual fact, there is 2011 decree from  Correa on the books in Ecuador allowing the government to monitor the \nactivities of all international entities with offices in Ecuador, and rescind their authorizations to operate.  As well, \njournalists critical of the government are subject to \"public denunciation and retaliatory litigation,\" according to \nHuman Rights Watch.  Further, a recent media law authorizes  criminal penalties against journalists and citizens \nwho tarnish Ecuador's \"good name.\" Finally, Ecuador makes liberal use of its \"terrorism and sabotage\" section of \nthe criminal code to crack down on dissent.\n\n\n\nThus, despite the lip service paid by Correa to openness and transparency, governance in Ecuador is marked by \ngovernment monitoring, media repression, restrictions on free speech, and a hardline stance against dissent.\n\nIs Snowden trapped in Russia?\n\nIn the waning days of June 2013, Snowden had not boarded a flight from Moscow to Havana, as anticipated.  \nWikileaks founder Julian Assange said that Snowden was \"healthy and safe\" and awaiting an asylum ruling from \nEcuador; by process of elimination, the general consensus was that Snowden was still in Russia.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed that  Snowden was located at the  \"in transit\" area of Moscow's \nSheremetyevo Airport,  which he [Lavrov] suggested was not technically Russian territory. Lavrov said Snowden \n\"has not crossed the Russian  border.\" At the same time, Russian President  Vladimir  Putin  foreclosed the notion \nof honoring United States requests for to extradite Snowden to the United States, saying the fugitive leaker had not \nbroken  Russian laws.  According to the state-financed Russia Today, Putin asserted that Russian authorities had \nnot been in contact with Snowden saying  \"The Russian special services are not engaged with him and will not be \nengaged.\"\n\nPutin also suggested that Russia was not interested in getting involved in the Snowden case at all, due to the \nunfavorable ratio of political costs to political benefits.  Putin was quoted as saying: \"It's like shearing a pig -- too \nmuch squeaking, too little wool.\"  That being said, there were some reports that irrespective of Putin's public claims, \nRussian secret police had, in fact, questioned Snowden.\n\nRussian interests aside, the fate of Snowden was very much a murky consideration. Since the United States had \nalready invalidated  and revoked Snowden's passport, and presumably  because he did not have either a Russian \nvisa or a final acceptance of asylum status in Ecuador or Venezuela, Snowden was essentially existing in \ndiplomatic limbo.\n\nFor its part, the government of Ecuador said it was considering Snowden's asylum bid but Foreign Minister Ricardo \nPatino warned that it would be a lengthy process, given the fact that his country took two months to grant asylum to \nWikileaks founder Julian Assange. He said, \"It took us two months to make decision in the case of Julian Assange, \nso do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time.\"\n\nNevertheless, Ecuador seemed to entrench into a pro-Snowden position in the last week of June 2013.  At issue \nwas a threat from the United States Congress to block preferential trade benefits to Ecuador if it granted Snowden \npolitical asylum to Snowden.  The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Robert Menendez \nof New Jersey, issued a statement  on the status of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act that \nread as follows: \"Our government will not reward countries for bad behavior. Trade preferences are a privilege \ngranted to nations, not a right.\"  Ecuador reacted with immediacy and defiance to this perceived threat by \nunilaterally withdrawing from the preferential trade pact with the United States.\n\nSecretary of Communications Fernando Alvarado said of President Rafael Correa's decision: \"Ecuador doesn't \naccept pressure or threats from anybody, and it doesn't trade its principles or give them up for commercial interests, \nno matter how important.\"\n\nBut on June 30, 2013, despite its defiant stance outlined above, Ecuador loosened its embrace of Snowden. In an \ninterview with the Associated Press,  Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said that Snowden was \"under the care \n\n\n\nof the Russian authorities\" and  was unable to leave the airport in Moscow without their consent. Correa further \nexplained, \"He doesn't have a passport. I don't know the Russian laws, I don't know if he can leave the airport, but I \nunderstand that he can't. At this moment he's under the care of the Russian authorities. If he arrives at an \nEcuadorean Embassy we'll analyze his request for asylum.\"\n\nThese statements by Correa seemed to indicate that  Snowden's chances of garnering asylum in Ecuador might be \nfading, although the Ecuadorean president did not seem to completely foreclose that possibility.  At issue appeared \nto be President Correa's desire to dispense with the perception that Julian Assange and Wikileaks were the main \ndecision-makers in the Snowden affair, with Correa and the Ecuadorean government simply doing their bidding. \nIndeed, in the same interview with the Associated Press, Correa then seemed to disparage his own diplomatic \nconsulate in the United Kingdom, suggesting that officials there committed \"a serious error\" by producing  \ntemporary \"safe passage\" documents for Snowden without  consulting his government in Quito (but apparently at \nthe behest of Assange and Wikileaks).\n\nAlso at issue for Ecuador was the growing recognition that there might be consequences for going against the will \nof the United States on a lucrative trade deal.\n\nThe renewed appreciation for the American point of view appeared to have been sparked by a conversation with \nUnited States Vice President Joe Biden. Correa said Vice President Biden requested that  Snowden -- a fugitive \nfrom justice -- be returned to the United States if he ever arrived in Ecuador.  Referring to that conversation and the \nrequest from the United States' second-in-command, Correa said of Snowden: \"If he really could have broken North \nAmerican laws, I am very respectful of other countries and their laws and I believe that someone who breaks the \nlaw must assume his responsibilities. But we also believe in human rights and due process.\" Correa also said that \nhe appreciated Biden's \"cordial\" call and noted that it was a marked contrast from the threatening tones levied by \nUnited States lawmakers against Ecuador.\n\nMeanwhile, the motives behind  Snowden's leaking activities were receiving even greater scrutiny.  As discussed \nabove, Snowden expanded his leaking agenda beyond the realm of exposing the NSA's surveillance activities to \nsharing information about the clandestine infiltration of the Chinese computer network intelligence with the Chinese \nthemselves.  Accordingly, it seemed that Snowden crossed the line into the realm of foreign espionage.\n\nSnowden offered a sense of his motivation for this line-crossing during a live online chat with the Guardian \nnewspaper on June 24, 2013.  Snowden declared: \"All spying is wrong.\"  Apparently, from the perspective and \npersonal judgment of Snowden, no covert activities by the United States targeting foreign governments were \nacceptable.\n\nLeft unconsidered for Snowden was the matter of whether or not his fellow Americans concurred with his stance, or, \nif Americans might appreciate the  utility of long-standing clandestine intelligence services in  the interests of \nkeeping the citizenry safe. Still, Snowden believed he was on a mission to expose this \"wrongdoing\" to the world.\n\nThe matter of how to go about accomplishing that goal was revealed in an interview with Snowden that was \npublished by the South China Morning Post on the morning he departed Hong Kong.  In that  South China Morning \nPost interview, the fugitive leaker admitted that he took the job as an NSA contract worker with Booz Allen Hamilton \nfor the specific purpose of acquiring and releasing sensitive classified intelligence.  Snowden was now on the \nrecord stating the following:  \"My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over \nthe world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.\"  This admission was \nunlikely to strengthen his credibility, since it suggested that Snowden did not simply happen upon data he believed \n\n\n\nshould be shared with the citizenry. Instead, he actively sought employment  as a contractor to the NSA for the \nexpressed purpose of acquiring classified intelligence data, which he then illegally released not only to the public -- \nbut also to foreign powers.\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama weighed in on the Snowden affair on June 27, 2013, when he dismissed the \nnotion of personally pressuring his Chinese and Russian counterparts regarding extradition.  Speaking from a news \nconference in Senegal (Africa) where he was on an overseas trip, the president said that he was concerned about \nthe documents Snowden might have in his possession.  \"That's part of the reason why we'd like to have Mr. \nSnowden in custody,\" Obama said. The president continued, said. \"But what I think we're going to continue to do is \nmake sure that we are following the various channels that are well established and the rules that are well \nestablished to get this thing done.\"  President Obama dismissed the notion of using tactics beyond the traditional \noutlets available, saying that he  was \"not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\"\n\nSnowden appeared to draw closer to a future in Russia on July 1, 2013, when the fugitive leaker applied  for \npolitical asylum in Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that the asylum request was made late on June \n30, 2013. The application was delivered by a legal representative of Wikileaks. Noteworthy was the fact that around \nthe same time, Russian President Putin pugnaciously asserted that Moscow had \"no intention\" of handing over \nSnowden to the United States.  The Russian leader opened the door for Snowden to successfully find asylum in his \ncountry, pending one condition.  Putin said: \"If he [Snowden]  wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must \nstop his activities aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners, no matter how strange it may sound coming \nfrom my lips.\"\n\nFor his part, United States President Obama addressed the unfolding imbroglio with Russia over the Snowden affair \nas follows: \"We don't have an extradition treaty with Russia. On the other hand, Mr. Snowden, we understand, has \ntraveled there without a valid passport and legal papers.  And we are hopeful the Russian government makes \ndecisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions law \nenforcement have.\"\n\nThe prospects of a Russian home for the fugitive leaker faded when Snowden withdrew his asylum application in \nthe early hours of July 2, 2013.  The Russian Kremlin indicated that  President Putin's condition that Snowden  stop \nreleasing classified information played into the decision.  As noted by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, \"After \nlearning of Russia's position yesterday, voiced by President Putin... he abandoned his intention [of staying] and his \nrequest to be able to stay in Russia.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Snowden actually issued multiple asylum requests to as many as 20 countries.  Among the \nWestern countries rejecting Snowden's bids for asylum were Norway. Finland, Austria, Poland, Ireland, \nSwitzerland,  and Spain. Most of these countries claimed that their rejections were levied on procedural grounds, \nhowever, the Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski gave a more detailed response saying that Snowden's \napplication \"did not meet the requirements for a formal application for asylum...Even if it did, I would not give a \npositive recommendation.\" On July 2, 2013, India joined the group of countries rejecting Snowden's asylum request, \nwhile Brazil noted that while it had received an asylum application from Snowden, it did not intend to respond to it.\n\nWith asylum from Russia now receding (at least for the moment), and with several Western and non-Western \ncountries foreclosing asylum for Snowden,  possible destinations for the fugitive leaker pointed to South America.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Venezuelan angle was not quite dead at the start of July 2013. The government of Venezuela said it \nwould consider an asylum request from Snowden.  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said,  \"We have not \nreceived an official request. But in the event we were to receive one, we would evaluate it as we understand \nEcuador is doing similarly.\"  Speaking from Russia where he was en route to Belarus, Maduro posed the following \nquestion: \"Who must protect Snowden? This is the question. This young man of 29 was brave enough to say that \nwe need to protect the world from the American imperial elite, so who should protect him?\"\n\nAs well, Bolivia was entering the equation with leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales saying, \"Bolivia is ready to \naccept people who disclose espionage if one can call it this way.\"  Morales, speaking from Russia where he was \nsigning a gas deal with that country, used the occasion to deliver a blistering set-down of the United States' effort to \napprehend Snowden. Saying  in an interview with Reuters News that Snowden  \"deserves the world's protection\" \nfrom the United States, Morales went on to declare:  \"Why are they persecuting him? What has he done? Did he \nlaunch a missile and kill someone? Did he rig a bomb and kill someone? No. He is preventing war.\"\n\nMorales himself was placed at the center of the Snowden affair on July 2, 2013, when his jet was diverted amidst \nsuspicions that the NSA leaker was aboard that aircraft.  France, Spain, and Portugal respectively closed their air \nspace to the flight carrying the Bolivian president from Russia to his home country, based on the belief that \nSnowden might also be on that flight in an effort to avoid extradition to the United States.  The flight was rerouted \nand landed in Austria  where officials from that country said that Snowden was not, in fact,  on that plane.\n\nFrance apologized to Bolivia for refusing to allow Morales' aircraft into its airspace based on what French authorities \ncalled \"conflicting information.\"  But France also made it clear that French President Francois Hollande issued \npermission for the aircraft to fly over French air space once he was informed that the plane was carrying the \nBolivian leader.  Spain also noted that it made its own decision based on erroneous information suggesting \nSnowden was on Morales' plane.\n\nFor its part, the government of Bolivia railed against the West over the incident, referring to the suspicions of \nSnowden being aboard Morales' flight as being \"a lie.\"\n\nBolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said, \"We don't know who invented this lie, but we want to \ndenounce to the international community this injustice with the plane of President Evo Morales.\"  Bolivia also made \nit clear that it  intended to close its American embassy following the international incident. Bolivian President \nMorales was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying,\"My hand would not shake to close the U.S. embassy.\"\n\nFor its part, the United States seemed undeterred by accusations of high-handed tactics against Morales' plane.  In \nfact, the United States Congress seemed eager to make it clear to the international community that there would be \nserious consequences for  those believed to be assisting Snowden.  Indeed, there was bipartisan support for the \nidea of re-assessing trade policies and aid to any country granting asylum to Snowden.  In an interview with CNN, \nHouse Intelligence Committee, Representative Mike Rogers, said the United States should \"send a very clear \nmessage that we won't put up with this kind of behavior.\" Striking  a similar note, Senator Robert Menendez, \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during an NBC interview: \"Clearly such acceptance of \nSnowden to any country ... is going to put them directly against the United States, and they need to know that.\"\n\nSnowden himself continued to attempt to issue asylum bids to various countries.  The incident involving Bolivian \nPresident Morales' official aircraft acted as a catalyst for a handful of leftist-ruled Latin American countries to accept \nSnowden's asylum request.  Indeed, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua all made offers of political asylum to \nSnowden.\n\n\n\nDuring a speech marking Venezuela's Independence Day, President Nicolas Maduro said: \"As head of state and \ngovernment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young U.S. \ncitizen Edward Snowden so he can  come to the fatherland of Bolivar and Chavez to live away from the imperial \nNorth American persecution.\" Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, a central leader in the left-wing Sandinista \nmovement which was opposed by the United States' Reagan administration, seemed pleased to offer Snowden a \nhome in his country.  He said: \"We are open, respectful of the right to asylum, and it is clear that if circumstances \npermit it, we would receive Snowden with pleasure and give him asylum here in Nicaragua.\"\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Snowden's hope that he might end up in Iceland -- his first choice -- died a quick \ndeath when the country's parliament refused to debate the issue of Icelandic citizenship for the NSA leaker.  \nAlthough the proposal to grant Snowden citizenship (brought by Wikileaks) was tabled before parliament, the vast \nmajority of members of parliament in Iceland voted against  the citizenship request being placed on the agenda.  \nNote that the Icelandic citizenship bid was intended to circumvent the fact that an actual asylum bid has to be made \nwhile on Icelandic soil.\n\nRussia seemed eager to end its association with Snowden, and effectively end its Snowden problem.  Alexei \nPushkov, a well-known Russian member of parliament and the chairman of the  the international affairs committee,  \nurged Snowden to take Venezuela's asylum offer.  He said via Twitter: \"Venezuela is waiting for an answer from \nSnowden. This, perhaps, is his last chance to receive political asylum.\"\n\nOf course, the logistics of Snowden actually reaching the soil of another country remained a challenge as he would \nneed valid travel documents and the ability to fly on an aircraft with a route capable of gaining entry into foreign air \nspace en route to his new home country.  The international incident involving Bolivian President Morales' plane \nwas, in and of itself, a warning of what was to come in terms of logistical challenges for Snowden.\n\nEarlier, in a statement released via Wikileaks, Snowden had argued that the United States condemned him to a life \nof \"the extra-legal penalty of exile\" as a punishment for his crimes.  He continued, \"Although I am convicted of \nnothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.\"  Left unstated by Snowden was the \nfact that on June 21, 2013, the United States government levied legal charges of theft of government property and \ntwo violations covered under the Espionage Act.  Clearly, in so doing, there was nothing \"extra-legal\" being \nundertaken by the United States government.  It should also be noted that the revocation of a passport is standard \nprocedure for persons charged with crimes and deemed to be flight risks. According to federal law,  an American \ncitizen's passport can be revoked due to \"an outstanding federal warrant of arrest for a felony\" as provided under \nTitle 22 of the U.S. Code. Thus, despite Snowden's claim that he was now left a stateless person due to the \nrevocation of his passport, in truth, he remained a citizen of the United States, retaining all constitutional rights as a \nUnited States citizen, while at the same time being subject to prosecution on United States soil for his violations  of \nthe law.\n\nIt should be noted that Snowden soon reversed his decision not to seek asylum in Russia, and in mid-July 2013 \nwas indicating that he would pursue temporary refuge in that country. Until he could be guaranteed \"safe passage\" \nto an unspecified Latin American country, Snowden was hoping to remain in Russia.\n\nSnowden made this announcement while meeting with human rights activists  and politicians at Moscow's \nSheremetyevo airport where he also condemned the West for preventing him from reaching his ultimate destination \nin  Latin America.  This was an apparent reference to the fact that the Bolivian president's aircraft was denied \n\n\n\naccess to certain European countries' air space on suspicion that Snowden was aboard.  Snowden said, \"Some \ngovernments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the \nlaw, and this behavior persists today... This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America \nand enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.\"  In fact,  sovereign states  are fully within \ntheir rights to control access to their air space,  even if the outcome produces diplomatic imbroglios.\n\nLeft unsaid by Snowden was whether or not he would be meeting the conditions of the Russian government that he \nrefrain from further harming the interests of the United States if he wanted to take refuge in Russia. It was not \nknown how Russia intended to respond to this request from Snowden, given an impending meeting between \nRussian President Vladimir Putin and United States President Barack Obama at a summit in Russia in September \n2013.  Obviously, by granting Snowden even temporary asylum in Russia, there would be a deleterious effect on \nrelations with the United States.  Indeed, the decision to allow Snowden to meet with human rights activists and \npolitical figures at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport was already raising the ire of the United States.\n\nAs noted by the White House itself,  the prospect of Russian asylum would violate Moscow's own stated position \nthat Snowden should avoid  further damage to American national security.  White House Press Secretary Jay \nCarney said: \"Providing a propaganda platform for Mr. Snowden runs counter to the Russian government's previous \ndeclarations of Russia's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport.  It's also \nincompatible with Russian assurances that they do not want Mr. Snowden to further damage U.S. interests.\"\n\nOf course, Russia made it clear that while it did not welcome Snowden's presence, it would nonetheless maintain \nits refusal to hand the fugitive leaker over to the United States.  Without a feasible means of moving from the \nMoscow's in transit area and onto a flight that will not encounter the air space of the United States or its allies en \nroute to Latin America,  Snowden's prospects were limited.  This scenario likely led to Snowden's aforementioned \ndesire to apply for temporary asylum in Russia.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Russian President Putin responded to this scenario when he said that United States authorities \nhad effectively trapped Snowden in Russia. As before, Putin did not seem eager to display any alliance with \nSnowden or his plight.  When asked about Snowden's future, the Russian leader replied, \"How should I know? It's \nhis life.\"  He added, \"He came to our territory without invitation. And we weren't his final destination... But the \nmoment he was in the air... our American partners, in fact, blocked his further flight... They have spooked all the \nother countries, nobody wants to take him and in that way, in fact, they have themselves blocked him on our \nterritory.\"\n\nNSA leaker finally escapes Russian airport purgatory and accepts asylum in new homeland of Russia     \n\nOn Aug. 1, 2013,  Edward Snowden was finally able to leave Russian airport purgatory and enter asylum in new \nhomeland of Russia. Snowden's Russian lawyer said that his client received the legal documents necessary to exit \nthe Sheremetyevo Airport's in-transit zone and enter Russian territory.   Anatoly Kucherena declined to comment on \nthe details of Snowden's Russian living arrangement, saying,  \"His location is not being made public for security \nreasons, since he is the most pursued man on the planet.\"  He did, however, disclose that Snowden would be \nstaying in a private home of American expatriates. Kucherena also acknowledged that Snowden intended to \"build \na new life in Russia\"  and  noted that the NSA fugitive leaker was looking forward to learning about Russian \nculture.  Kucherena added that while Snowden's legal permit allowed him temporary asylum for one year, the \nfugitive leaker did not foreclose the possibility of pursuing Russian citizenship in the future.      \n\nThe movement of Snowden into Russian territory, and with Snowden's activities indicating a clear pursuit of a life in \nhis new Russian homeland, marked a shift in Snowden's status.  Indeed, it reflected Russia's official decision to \n\n\n\nsupport the NSA leaker wanted by the United States government.  The move would invariably and deleteriously \naffect United States relations with Russia.     \n\nYury Ushakov, foreign policy adviser to President Putin, tried to make light of the situation, saying the Snowden \naffair was \"rather insignificant\" and should not negatively impact relations with the United States.  However, the \nUnited States seemed to be taking  Russia's decision to grant asylum to  Snowden quite seriously. White House \nPress Secretary Jay Carney said: \"We're extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step \ndespite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the United \nStates to face the charges against him.\"     \n\nWith United States President Barack Obama due to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit, the fact of the \nmatter was that the Snowden affair could potentially cause  the United States leader to cancel his  planned private \nmeeting with Putin, his Russian counterpart.  As noted by  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, \"We're \nevaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues.\"  Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer was more \nforthright in his assessment of the situation.  He said Russia's decision to grant Snowden asylum was a \"stab in the \nback\" and recommended that President Obama consider relocating the G-20 summit  to a country other than \nRussia.     \n\nNot surprisingly, in the first week of August 2013, President Obama cancelled his meeting with President  Putin, \nalthough the United States president did intend to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. A \nstatement from the White House read as follows: \"We have reached the conclusion that there is not enough recent \nprogress in our bilateral agenda with Russia to hold a U.S.-Russia Summit.\" The White House statement continued, \n\"We believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared \nagenda.\"     \n\nThe Russian Kremlin expressed disappointment over President Obama's decision.  As before, Putin's foreign \npolicy adviser, Ushakov, tried to downplay the situation  and move toward more productive ground, saying,  \n\"Russian representatives are ready to continue working together with American partners on all key issues on the \nbilateral and multilateral agenda.\" But at home in the United States, it seemed that White House national security \nadvisers had unanimously backed the decision to cancel the meeting with Putin.     \n\nMultilateral Tensions     \n\nMeanwhile, the fate of Snowden aside, the United States was facing criticism over revelations that the NSA may \nhave spied on embassies and offices of European Union allies.  The office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel \nobserved that \"bugging friends is unacceptable... We are no longer in the Cold War.\" The office of French President \nFrancois Hollande was more outspoken in its reaction, warning that a major trade deal between the United States \nand the European Union might be at risk unless Washington could offer assurances that its surveillance of the \nEuropean Union was over. French President Francois Hollande further called on the European Union to take a \nunified  stand in response to the United States' spying efforts on its European allies. As well, the  European \nCommission demanded \"clarity and transparency\" from Washington.  But even European countries were coming \nunder fire themselves as new revelations showed that British and French intelligence agencies were operating \nsmiliar data collections gathering schemes to that of the United States.      \n\nSpecial Entry\n\nRelations with Afghanistan ahead of withdrawal of United States troops    \n\nIn mid-2013, dissonance between Afghan President Karzai and United States President Obama led the Obama \nadministration to consider a complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan  ahead of the scheduled timeline to exit \n\n\n\nAfghanistan in 2014.  The Obama administration was also considering whether or not to bypass the option of \nretaining a residual presence past the 2014 deadline.    \n\nNote that peace talks were on the agenda in Afghanistan  a month earlier -- in June 2013 --  between the Afghan \ngovernment and the Taliban.  However, less than 24 hours after the Taliban opened an office in Qatar, and before \nthe discussion could ever commence, the Afghan government walked away from the negotiating table.  It should be \nnoted that Afghanistan also  broke off talks with the United States on future military cooperation beyond 2014 -- \nwhen United States forces were scheduled to fully withdraw from Afghanistan.    \n\nUnited States and NATO officials have been consistent advocates of bilateral negotiations between the government \nof Afghanistan and the Taliban, as they believe that some sort of ceasefire agreement must be forged between the \ntwo sides if Afghanistan hopes to have a stable future.  But previous proposals for peace have ended in failure, and \nthis effort was already on the rocks.    \n\nAfghan President Karzai said he was protesting the United States' outreach to the Taliban, which apparently Karzai \nviewed as objectionable.  Of particular concern to Karzai was the title of the Taliban office in  Qatar, as well as the \nTaliban flag flying over the office compound.  A spokesperson for President Karzai said \"We oppose the title -- the \nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- because such a thing doesn't exist.\" The spokesperson continued, \"The U.S. was \naware of the president's stance.\" From the point of President Karzai, the Taliban was attempting to portray itself as \na government in exile.  Accordingly, the Afghan president made clear that the country officials would not be \nengaging in peace talks unless those activities were \"Afghan-led.\"    \n\nContinued dissonance between Afghan President Karzai and United States President Barack Obama  in July 2013 \nled the Obama administration to  consider a complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan  ahead of the \nscheduled timeline to exit Afghanistan in 2014.  The Obama administration was also considering whether or not to \nbypass the option of retaining a residual presence past the 2014 deadline.  Increasing tensions between President \nBarack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai appeared to be at the heart of the matter.    \n\nThose tensions were sparked by Karzai's reaction to the United States outreach to the Taliban and the coordination \nof formal peace talks in Qatar. However, the tensions increased following a particular fractious telephone call \nbetween the two leaders.  The result was that President Obama was not looking into a \"zero option\" that would  \nwithdraw all forces from Afghanistan, including residual counter-terrorism and advisory force  that were expected to \nremain  in Afghanistan even after the exit of United States military troops in 2014.    \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted that President Obama had not yet made a decision on the matter \nand was in no hurry to do so.  Carney said, \"I want to make clear, today's story notwithstanding, that this is not a \ndecision that is imminent.  And we are talking about a residual force, a potential residual force, in a year and a half.  \nSo these are ongoing conversations.\"    \n\nIt should be noted that earlier in the year,  the president's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said that \nthe \"zero option\" would be considered if all the United States' goals in Afghanistan were met.  To that end, Rhodes \nsaid: \"The objective of the bilateral security agreement negotiations is not to accomplish a number of U.S. troops in \na country.  It is to accomplish the two goals of denying a safe haven to al-Qaida, and training and equipping Afghan \nnational security forces.\"    \n\nPresident Obama himself addressed the fact that those objectives when he said, \"We achieved our central goal, \nwhich is -- or have come very close to achieving our central goal, which is to de-capacitate al-Qaida, to dismantle \nthem, to make sure that they cannot attack us again.\"    \n\n\n\nThat being said, in the last week of July 2013, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began closing down its \nclandestine bases in Afghanistan. The move coincided with the United States' military withdrawal from Afghanistan, \nas well a shift in focus as the United States was now likely to concentrate its counter-terrorism efforts in more \nactive hotspots, such as Yemen and North Africa where al-Qaida is more active, and possibly look towards \nmonitoring the complicated landscape in Syria.  The closure of CIA bases in Afghanistan also indirectly exemplified \nthe transition over the last decade of the spy agency being a predominantly -- and classically -- espionage entity to \none with military capability at its disposal, such as the use of bases and drones.     \n\nIn November 2013, the governments of Afghanistan and the United States were forging a security deal.  At issue \nwas  an agreement for United States military forces remaining in Afghanistan beyond the 2014 deadline when most  \nNATO-led international forces, including those from the United States, were due to officially withdraw.  Of particular  \nconcern was a key provision that would give United States military personnel immunity from prosecution in \nAfghanistan. In the last week of November 2013, the council of tribal elders who make up  Afghanistan's Loya Jirga \nconvened a meeting to decide whether to approve the  Bilateral Security Agreement with the United States.  At the \nconclusion of the meeting, the Loya Jirga approved the document and urged that the deal  be signed at the end of \nthe year (2013), as requested by the United States. The declaration read as follows: \"Given the current situation in, \nand Afghanistan's need... the contents of this agreement as a whole is endorsed by the members of this Loya Jirga. \nThe Loya Jirga requests the president to sign the agreement before the end of 2013.\"     \n\nPresumably to show that he was an independent actor and not beholden to the United States, which was ironically  \nensuring the safety of Afghanistan for more than a decade, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was toying with \nthe idea of waiting until 2014 to sign the agreement.  The United States reacted to this move by Karzai by warning \nthat there would be no delay.  United States Department of  State spokesperson Jen Psaki, said: \"We believe that \nsigning sooner rather than later is essential to give Afghans certainty about their future before the upcoming \nelections, and enable the United States and other partners to plan for U.S. presence after 2014. It is neither \npractical nor possible for us to further delay because of the uncertainty it would create.\"    \n\nAs November 2013 came to a close, President Karzai maintained his stance in refusing to sign the security deal \nwith the United States until 2014, when a new president was elected to power in Afghanistan.  The United States \nwarned that delay on a matter of such importance could result in the \"zero option\" of withdrawing all United States \ntroops from Afghanistan in 2014.    \n\nIn a meeting with United States National Security Advisor Susan Rice in Kabul, Karzai also added further conditions \nto the deal, demanding that the United States immediately end military raids on Afghan homes. He also called for \nthe United States to return any Afghan detainees currently being held at Guantanamo Bay.  The Obama \nadministration responded to these new  demands by nothing that  Karzai  was making it clear that he was not \nprepared to sign the bilateral security agreement.  A statement by  National Security Advisor Rice warned, \"Without \na prompt signature, the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there \nwould be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan.\"    \n\nThe continuing violence at the start of 2014 highlighted the security challenges facing Afghanistan.  Of concern was \nthe matter of how the country would deal with the violence  when international forces exited Afghanistan at the \nclose of the year (2014).  To that end, there was the pending security agreement  (discussed above) under \nconsideration to be forged between Afghanistan and the United States.    \n\nThat proposal would mean that as many as 10,000 United States troops would be remain in Afghanistan after the \n2014 deadline for a withdrawal of international forces; that remaining contingent would be responsible for counter-\nterrorism and training of Afghan forces.  President Karzai has not been quick to sign the agreement and the United \nStates has made it clear that without a signed agreement, it would fully exit Afghanistan at the close of 2014, as \nplanned to this point.  To date, relations between the United States and the Karzai government in Afghanistan have \n\n\n\nbeen decidedly conflicted, with the United States frequently frustrated by Karzai's erratic and unstable behavior, \nmarked occasionally by Karzai's threats to \"join the Taliban.\"    \n\nIn February 2014, the United States made clear that it was entertaining the possibility of withdrawing all its troops \nfrom Afghanistan unless the security agreement is soon signed. Indeed, on Feb. 12, 2014,  White House \nspokesperson Jay Carney emphasized that the Obama administration had no intention of   renegotiating the \nBilateral Security Agreement (BSA).  At a White House briefing, he said, \"Planning has to place around the \ncontingencies that exist -- with either a signed BSA or a BSA that is not signed. And as time progresses into this \nyear, it becomes more difficult to plan for a post-2014 troop presence.\"    \n\nMeanwhile, around the same period in February 2014, reports were emerging from Afghanistan about talks \nbetween President Karzai's government and the Taliban.    A spokesperson for the Karzai government, Aimal Faizi, \nsaid in an interview with the New York Times, \"I can confirm that ... Taliban are willing more than ever to join the \npeace process. Contacts have been made and we are also in touch with them.\"    \n\nThe United States issued a statement supportive of such overtures of reconciliation.  Jen Psaki of the United States \nDepartment of State said, \"It's important to note here that we've long strongly supported an Afghan-led \nreconciliation, which would, of course, be Afghans talking to Afghans. So the notion that we wouldn't support that \ndialogue is inaccurate.\"  That being said, she made it clear that the United States was not involved in any peace \ntalks with the Taliban.    \n\nThe United States was not so sanguine about the news that Karzai allowed the release of  65 detainees from the \nhigh-security Bagram prison to the north of Kabul.  The United States had strenuously urged Afghanistan not to \nrelease these  detainees, warning that there were extremist  Taliban fighters who were responsible for the deaths of \ninternational forces, including both Afghan and  American soldiers, as well as   civilians.  But Karzai went forward \nwith the release of these extremists in defiance of the United States' expressed request.  The move was sure to \nfurther complicate already dismal relations between the governments of the two countries.    \n\nSpecial Entry    \n\nUnited States orders closure of embassies in Middle East, Asia, and Africa amidst security worries    \n\nAt the start of August 2013, the Obama administration in the United States ordered the closure of several of its \nembassies in the Middle East and North Africa  due to threats of a possible  terrorist attack by militant extremists.  \nAt issue were interceptions of messages from the senior leadership of the terror enclave, al-Qaida, indicating that a \nmajor terrorist attack was in the works.  The messages involved conversations between  al-Qaida leader, Ayman \nal-Zawahiri, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing a plan to carry out \na major terrorist attack on an embassy. The closures were initially supposed to be enforced for a few days but were \nextended in many cases for up to a week with the United States authorities noting there was a strong possibility of \nan al-Qaida inspired attack in the Middle East and North Africa.    \n\nMeanwhile, the United States Department of State issued a global travel alert, which it said would remain in effect \nuntil the end of the month.  Like the embassy closures, the travel alert was also issued due to security concerns.  \nExplaining the rationale for the travel alert, the United States Department of State said: \"Current information \nsuggests that al-Qaida and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, \nand that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August.\" The travel \nalert urged American citizens to be vigilant and warned against \"the potential for terrorists to attack public \ntransportation systems and other tourist infrastructure.\"    \n\n\n\nGiven this guidance, several other Western countries moved to close select diplomatic missions in the region of the \nMiddle East and North Africa, with the United Kingdom  (and the United States) paying particular attention to \nYemen.  The United Kingdom Foreign Office was advising British nationals to leave that Middle Eastern country and \nurging its citizens to avoid travel to Yemen, noting that there was \"a high threat from terrorism throughout Yemen.\" \nSeveral European countries  also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. The United States had itself withdrawn its   \ndiplomatic staff from Yemen and urged United States citizens to depart that country amid concerns over security \nthreats.  At issue were emerging concerns that al-Qaida operatives were arriving in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, \nand were preparing for a major terror incident that would target both the Yemeni military and international diplomatic \ninterests.    \n\nSeparately, Yemeni authorities were claiming success in foiling al-Qaida plot to seize two of the country's main \nports and blow up oil pipelines. This foiled plot was being described as distinct from the security alert on diplomatic \nmissions across the Middle East and North Africa.  That being said, a spokesperson for the Yemeni government, \nsaid in an interview with international media that the al-Qaida plot involved taking over two ports in the south of the \ncountry used in exporting Yemeni oil, seizing control of the Canadian-administered al-Dhaba oil terminal, and  killing \nor kidnapping foreign workers.  The plot also involved plans to bomb and destroy oil pipelines at Balhaf. The entire \nplot appeared to be driven by revenge for the killing of senior al-Qaida figure, Said al-Shihri, in a drone strike \nmonths prior. Meanwhile, the United States appeared to be stepping up its drone attacks on Yemen with seven \nsuspected Islamic extremist militants reported to have been killed in one strike in the south eastern part of the \ncountry.  It was one of several strikes in a two-week period.    \n\nPakistan was also the focus of particular scrutiny when the United States withdrew its diplomatic staff from the \noffice of the consulate-general in the city of Lahore. The United States Department of States said the evacuation \nmove was being made  in response to a \"credible threat\" to the consulate.  The United States Department of States \nadditionally warned its citizens against non-essential travel within Pakistan.  The travel warning included this \nexplanation: \"The presence of several foreign and indigenous terrorist groups poses a potential danger to United \nStates citizens throughout Pakistan.\"    \n\nSpecial Report on Syrian Crisis:    \n\nReport of chemical weapons usage surfaces and exacerbates Syrian Crisis; has the \"red line\" been crossed and \nwill international powers now involve themselves in the Syrian civil war?    \n\nSummary:    \n\nSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an \naddition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding \nthe resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end \ncorruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting \nthe emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised \nKurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over \ntime, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hard line crackdown on dissent, tensions \nescalated between the government and the protesters.    \n\nIn mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the \nviolence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the \nviolent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, \ngiven the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters. As of 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad \nregime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in \nplaces such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security \n\n\n\nResolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United \nNations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered \nby the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further \nbloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United \nNations monitoring mission ended in failure.    \n\nSyria has, meanwhile, been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the \ninternational community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and \nmost recently, suspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed, it \nwas increasingly clear that Syria had slipped into a state of civil war and was facing a devastating humanitarian \ncrisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August 2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack \non the outskirts of Damascus.  Was this the clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's \"red line\" had \ndefinitively been crossed? And would the international community become more involved in the Syrian crisis?  The \nanswers to those questions were yet to be determined.    \n\nChemical weapons issue resurfaces:    \n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, Syrian opposition activists and rebels said that chemical weapons had killed hundreds of people \non the outskirts of Damascus. They said that government forces launched a major bombardment on rebel forces in \nthe area of Ghouta using rockets with toxic agents.  The Syrian government dismissed the accusations as  \"illogical \nand fabricated.\"  The Syrian military further said that rebel forces were suffering major defeat and were using claims \nof chemical attacks to draw attention away from the fact that they were losing the war.    \n\nThe claims and counter-claims set up rival theories that could not be verified simply by looking at the videotaped \nfootage of victims that immediately surfaced online.  Stated differently, while the international media was able to \nobtain visual evidence of victims who had died, that footage could not prove whether they died as a result of \nconventional military bombardment or due to exposure to toxic substances.  However, there was an increasing \nchorus of disturbing assertions by medical staff that the victims, particularly children, appeared to have suffered \nsuffocation and blurred vision.  As well, further videotaped footage was starting to surface about the purported \nattacks, this time showing  victims enduring convulsions or distinctly encountering breathing problems.  In an \ninterview with BBC News, Professor Alexander Kekule of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Halle University in \nGermany, admitted that the videotaped images of the victims certainly suggested they had been subject to  a \nchemical agent of some kind.  However, he made a point of noting that none of the victims showed signs that they \nhad been exposed to  chemicals such as  sarin or organophosphorous nerve agents.    \n\nThe international community seemed initially wary to accept the claims of chemical attacks, perhaps with the \nmemory of the inconclusive chemical weapons claims so fresh in their minds from earlier in the year (2013).  Only \nrecently, United Nations investigators traveled to Syria to look into those earlier claims.  In August 2013, the United \nNations convened an emergency meeting to discuss the newest chemical attack claims and its immediate \nresponse was to seek clarification on the situation in Syria.  As noted by  Maria Cristina Perceval, Argentina's \nUnited Nations Ambassador, \"There is a strong concern among council members about the allegations and a \ngeneral sense that there must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed closely.\"    \n\nThat being said, individual countries -- such as France  and the United Kingdom-- were going further and \ndemanding that United Nations inspectors who were already investigating the earlier allegations of  chemical \nattacks in Syria now look into these fresh claims.  The United States echoed their call via White House \nspokesperson Josh Earnest, who said: \"The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian \ncivilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons, near \n\n\n\nDamascus earlier today. We are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. \nThe United Nations investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with \nits purpose and mandate.\"  Both the European Union and the Arab League entered the fray, adding their own \nvoices to the call for United Nations inspectors to go look into the matter.    \n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Russia had a different view and noted that the timing of the fresh claims of chemical \nattacks came just as United Nations inspectors were in Syria to investigate the chemical claims from earlier in \n2013  The Russian foreign ministry said, \"This makes us think that we are once again dealing with a premeditated \nprovocation.\"  Indeed, there was a legitimate question as to why the Syrian government would choose to use \nchemical weapons at a time when United Nations inspectors were \"in country\" and especially given United States \nPresident Barack Obama's 2012 famous statement that his country would not be involving itself in the Syrian crisis \nunless the Assad regime used chemical weapons -- essentially crossing a vital \"red line\" -- that could augur \ninternational military action.    \n\nThere was incremental movement in that direction  on Aug. 22, 2013, when  the United Kingdom, France, and \nTurkey all demanded that the  international community take a strong stand against the Syrian regime, if the \nchemical weapons attack was verified.   France went further with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius saying \nthat if  the claims of a chemical attack proved to be true, a \"reaction of force\" would result. The United Kingdom \nissued a similar threat via the British Foreign Office, noting,  \"We believe a political solution is the best way to end \nthe bloodshed\"  but also warning  that the government of Prime Minister David Cameron \"has said many times we \ncannot rule out any option that might save innocent lives in Syria.\"  Meanwhile, Turkey goaded the United Nations \nabout its symbolic \"foot dragging\" as Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu declared: \"All red lines have been \ncrossed but still the United Nations Security Council has not even been able to take a decision.\"    \n\nOn Aug. 23, 2013, United States President Barack Obama offered comments on the alleged use of chemical \nweapons in Syria saying that the claims constituted a \"big event, of grave concern.\"  In an interview  with  CNN, \nPresident Obama noted that the conflict in Syria would have a bearing on United States national interests \"both in \nterms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our \nallies, our bases in the region.\"  Nevertheless, the United States leader struck a cautious note, reminding journalists \nthat his country  was still in the process of seeking confirmation on the matter of chemical weapons usage; \nhowever, he asserted that if the allegations proved to be true, the crisis would \"require America's attention.\"  Left \nunsaid was the nature of that attention.  For his part, President Obama urged prudent action, tacitly reminding \npeople of the consequences of  the reckless military intervention of his predecessor, George W. Bush, into Iraq.  \nThe United States president said: \"Sometimes what we've seen is that folks will call for immediate action, jumping \ninto stuff, that does not turn out well, gets us mired in very difficult situations, can result in us being drawn into very \nexpensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region.\"    \n\nAround this time, Russia maintained its belief that the use of chemical agents might be a provocation by the \nopposition.  Still, Russia  was now urging Syria to cooperate with an  \"objective investigation\" by United Nations \nchemical weapons experts.  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague indirectly addressed this suggestion \nthat the use of chemical agents was a provocation by rebel forces saying, \"I know that some people in the world \nwould like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in Syria. I think the chances of that \nare vanishingly small and so we do believe that this is a chemical attack by the Assad regime on a large scale.\"    \n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon demanded an immediate investigation to clear up the matter.  He \nsaid: \"I can think of no good reason why any party -- either government or opposition forces -- would decline this \nopportunity to get to the truth of the matter.\"  Ban also emphasized the fact that  any use of chemical weapons -- by \nany actor or party -- would be a violation of international law, which would inevitably result in \"serious \nconsequences for the perpetrator.\"    \n\n\n\nUnited States weights its options:    \n\nMeanwhile, even as the evidence was increasing to support the claim of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, the \npolitical will to build an international coalition to act against Syria was eroding.  At issue was a parliamentary vote in \nthe United Kingdom's House of Commons urging an international response to the Syria chemical  weapons crisis.  \nThe vote came amidst British Prime Minister David Cameron's vociferous condemnation of Syria's apparent use of \nchemical weapons, and his suggestion that the United Kingdom would join the United States and France in \ndelivering some kind of punitive action against Syria. But when the parliamentary vote went down to defeat in the \nHouse on Commons on Aug. 29, 2013,  it was apparent that the United Kingdom would not be a player in any kind \nof military intervention.    \n\nIrrespective of the political developments across the Atlantic, in the United States, President Barack Obama on \nAug. 30, 2013, made clear that he was  still considering  the full range of options in response to Syria's use of \nchemical weapons against its own citizens.   Referring to the aforementioned report on the suspected chemical \nweapons usage in Syria released by Secretary of State Kerry, President Obama said, \"As you've seen, today we've \nreleased our unclassified assessment detailing with high confidence that the Syrian regime carried out a chemical \nweapons attack that killed well over 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. This follows the horrific images \nthat shocked us all.\"    \n\nWith an eye on showing why the use of chemical weapons required a response, President Obama said, \"This kind \nof attack is a challenge to the world. We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians \nare gassed on a terrible scale.\"  He continued, \"So, I have said before, and I meant what I said that, the world has \nan obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons.\"   In this way, the \nUnited States president was making it clear that the international community had an obligation to respond to Syria's \nuse of chemical weapons -- an act that was undertaken in defiance of international law and in contravention to \ninternational norms.    \n\nPresident Obama indicated that several options were under review, as he noted, \"Now, I have not made a final \ndecision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm. But as I've already said, I have had \nmy military and our team look at a wide range of options.\"   That being said, President Obama noted that a long-\nterm campaign involving a ground force in Syria (reminiscent of Iraq) were not among those possibilities. He \nexpressly said, \"We're not considering any open-ended commitment. We're not considering any boots on the \nground approach. What we will do is consider options that meet the narrow concern around chemical weapons.\" \nEvidently, although President Obama  believed there was a moral obligation to act against Syria for its use of \nchemical weapons, he was not eager to see the United States mired in another war in the world's most volatile \nregion.  Stated differently, it was through the prism of the Iraq debacle that the United States leader was viewing his \noptions for dealing with Syria.    \n\nSyria's stance:    \n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly denied that his forces launched  any chemical attacks. The \nSyrian leader has warned of a wider Middle Eastern war if  foreign countries decide to move forward with military \naction against Syria.  That wider war could occur if Assad decided to react to a yet-to-occur military strike by \ninternational powers on Syria.  Some of the possibilities available to Assad would include retaliatory attacks on pro-\nWestern allies of the United States, such as Israel, Jordan, and Turkey.  But the reality was that Syria's military \nalready had its hands full fighting the civil war at home.  Moreover, Syria likely could not risk sparking the ire of \nIsrael,  with its own well-armed military, or Jordan, which hosts United States fighter jets, missiles and troops, or \nTurkey -- a NATO member state.  Indeed, an attack on any NATO country, such as Turkey, would prompt a \nresponse from the entire security alliance.    \n\n\n\nNote on Russia's position:    \n\nRussia has maintained the view that the notion of a  chemical attack by the Syrian government was inconceivable.  \nRussia has also indicted that it would block a resolution in the United Nations Security Council authorizing a use of \nforce against Syria.  However, in early September 2013, Russian President Putin indicated some softening of his \nstance as he noted that he could be persuaded to change his mind if provided with clear evidence of a chemical \nattack.  Russia has also long advocated for a negotiated or diplomatic settlement to the Syrian crisis.    \n\nStatus update:    \n\nOn Sept. 8, 2013, the European Union called for no action to go forward with regard to Syria until the findings on \nthe chemical agents were made available by the United Nations investigative team.  As well, plans for a full vote in \nthe United States Congress authorizing use of force against the Syria regime were cancelled.    \n\nAt issue was an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough that emerged when United States Secretary of State John \nKerry uttered a (seemingly) off-hand remark during a  news conference in London on Sept. 9, 2013 with British \nForeign Secretary William Hague.  Secretary of State Kerry said that President Assad could prevent a military strike \non  Syria if he  handed over \"every single bit\" of his chemical weapons to the international community.  At the time, \nSecretary of State Kerry said that he did not expect Assad to respond to this call; but, in fact, the remark appeared \nto have sparked fresh possibilities for a diplomatic solution with Russia championing the idea of subjecting Syria's \nchemical weapons stockpile to international auditors, and then placing them under the aegis of international \njurisdiction. Syria -- Russia's client state in the Middle East -- was almost immediately scrambling to say that it \nwould be willing to move in this direction. That stance by Syria functioned also as an admission by the Syrian \nregime that it was, in fact, in possession of chemical weapons.  Until that moment, the Assad regime would not \neven acknowledge that reality.    \n\nOn Sept. 10, 2013, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem offered a public admission of the Assad regime's \nchemical weapons stockpile when he said:  \"We are ready to inform about the location of chemical weapons, halt \nthe production of chemical weapons, and show these objects to representatives of Russia, other states and the \nUnited Nations.\" He continued, \"Our adherence to the Russian initiative has a goal of halting the possession of all \nchemical weapons.\"    \n\nOn the night of Sept. 10, 2013, United States President Obama delivered a national address on the Syrian issue.  \nOriginally, the speech had been regarded as an opportunity for the president to build congressional support -- then, \nat anemic levels -- for authorizing strikes against Syria, and assuring a war-weary and skeptical  nation that such \naction was necessary. Now, however, the speech had a two-fold purpose -- to bolster that aforementioned case \nagainst Syria, but also to address the emerging diplomatic channel.    \n\nAs regards the former objective, President Obama presented a succinct case for acting against Syria.  President \nObama emphasized his conviction that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical toxins attack that \nensued around Ghouta on Aug. 21, 2013, characterizing the scene of death as  \"sickening,\" reminding the global \ncommunity that such an  attack was  a violation of international law, and warning Americans that it  posed a threat \nto United States national security.    \n\nBut the president also opened the door to a negotiated settlement on the issue of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal \nand usage. He said that the Russian plan to report Syria's chemical weapons arsenal and place them under the \naegis of international jurisdiction constituted \"encouraging signs\" and announced that he would pursue a \"diplomatic \npath.\"  The president said that his top diplomat, Secretary of State Kerry, would travel to Geneva in Switzerland to  \n\n\n\nmeet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, with an eye on pursuing a negotiated settlement on the issue of \ndealing with Syria's chemical weapons.    \n\nPresident Obama offered cautious support for this path forward, saying, \"It's too early to tell whether [the plan] \nwould succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments. But this initiative has \nthe potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one \nof Assad's strongest allies.\"  President Obama defended his decision to consider military strikes against Syria, \narguing that the current diplomatic opening was only possible as  a result of the credible threat of military force by \nthe United States.  Accordingly, the United States leader made it clear that his country's armed forces would \nmaintain their posture, saying: \"Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture, to keep the \npressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\"    \n\nOn Sept. 11, 2013, Russia officially handed over its plan for  placing Syria's stockpile under international control to \nthe United States.  Discussion over its contents was expected to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, between \nUnited States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.   Those negotiations would be of a \nbilateral nature.   The Obama administration announced that in addition to Secretary of State Kerry's meeting with \nForeign Minister Lavrov, the United States' top diplomat would also  meet with the United Nations-Arab League \nspecial envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi.    \n\nThe diplomatic path was not without serious obstacles.  Russia was demanding that the United States withdraw its \nthreat of force, while France -- the United States' ally on the issue of action against Syria -- was crafting a United \nNations Security Council resolution that would include a provision for precisely such action, should Syria fail to \ncomply with the dictates of the plan.  At issue was France's inclusion of a Chapter VII provision (of the United \nNations charter), which would effectively authorize  the use of force if Syria failed to adhere to its stated \nobligations.   For its part, Russia advocated for a non-binding declaration supporting its initiative.    \n\nAt stake  in that initiative was a  demand for Syria to provide a full audit of its chemical weapons -- including \nvarieties of toxins and storage locations -- within 15 days, as well as procedures facilitating the transfer of control  \nover those chemical substances, and ultimately, their destruction.  Of course, the issue of destruction itself \npresented a disagreement between Russia and Syria with the latter not keen on that aspect of the plan.  Still, with \nthe client state of Syria reliant on Russia to save the regime from United States strikes, it was likely that the arsenal \nof chemical toxins would ultimately be set for elimination.    \n\nComplicating the diplomatic  path was an opinion editorial piece penned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which \nwas published  by the New York Times.  At the more conventional level, the piece included a fulsome plea for \ndiplomacy by Putin as follows:  \"The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition \nfrom many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent \nvictims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders.\"    \n\nPutin also urged international action via global instruments of jurisprudence, noting that any actions should go \nthrough the United Nations Security Council, which stood as \"one of the few ways to keep international relations \nfrom sliding into chaos.\" Putin also offered the reasonable argument that the United Nations could go down the road \nof obsolescence as its precursor, the League of Nations, if \"influential countries bypass the United Nations and take \nmilitary action without Security Council authorization.\"   Left unstated by the Russian leader, however, was the fact \nthat his country's penchant for United Nations authorization for the use of force was not at play during the Soviet \nUnion's invasion of Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Afghanistan, or even  its limited engagement in the \nGeorgian territory of South Ossetia most recently.    \n\nThe most incendiary element in  Putin's editorial was perhaps his chastisement of President Obama's declaration \non United States' exceptionalism.  Putin argued against that claim, stating: \"And I would rather disagree with a case \n\n\n\nhe made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is What makes America different...it's \nwhat makes us exceptional. It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, \nwhatever the motivation.\"  This statement was a stunning example of irony coming from a world leader who \ndeclared to his fellow Russians in February 2013:  \"We are a victorious people! It is in our genes, in our genetic \ncode!\"    \n\nThe Obama administration responded to this provocative opinion piece by Putin a day later on Sept. 12, 2013 with \nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney  saying, \"It's worth also pointing out there's a great irony in the placement \nof an op-ed like this, because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition of this country of freedom of expression.\"  \nCarney then went on to note that freedom of expression and free speech were \"on the decrease in Russia.\"  Carney \nalso used the occasion to place the burden of the success of a diplomatic path on Russia, noting that the Russian \npresident had placed his \"prestige and credibility on the line\" in offering a proposal to Syria to turn over its chemical \nweapons.    \n\nThe Putin versus Obama contretemps aside, the diplomatic channels remained open.  On Sept. 12, 2013, the \nUnited Nations announced that it had  received documents from Syria, effectively acceding to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons. Syrian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations,  Bashar Ja'afar, said, \"Legally speaking Syria has become, starting today, a full member of the \n(chemical weapons) convention.\"    \n\nMeanwhile, negotiations were ongoing in Geneva (Switzerland) between the top diplomats from the United States \nand Russia respectively -- Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov -- with leaks indicating that the two \nmen enjoyed good rapport.  The negotiations were being characterized as \"constructive\" and went late into the wee \nhours of Sept. 14, 2013, suggesting that climate was ripe with the possibility of forging a deal.    \n\nChemical Weapons Deal    \n\nOn Sept. 14, 2013,  United States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov announced that a \nbreakthrough agreement had been reached and that diplomacy had won the day. Speaking at a joint news \nconference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the \nconcord: \"If fully implemented, this framework can provide greater protection and security to the world.\"    \n\nThe agreement , titled \"Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons,\"  calls for a full accounting of its \nchemical weapons stockpile within one week, the destruction of all  production equipment  by November 2013, and \nthe elimination  or transfer of the arsenal of chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. Achieving the objectives of \nthe agreement promised to be difficult.  A one week deadline for a full audit of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal \nwas strenuously aggressive.  As well, the destruction of production equipment and chemical toxins by 2014 was \nconsidered unprecedented since previous processes of this nature have typically taken several years to complete.  \nMoreover, there would be complicated questions yet to address, such as how to ensure the safety of international \ninspectors in Syria.    \n\nIt should also be noted that agreement on a United Nations Security Council resolution mandating Syrian \ndisarmament on chemical weapons still promised to be potentially fractious.  Russia was reluctant to the notion of \nadding a Chapter VII provision (authorizing the use of force if Syria reneged on its obligations) to the resolution, \nalthough Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov intimated that the provision could be added in the future in a worse case \nscenario.  As such, the United States was not expected  to press for that particular inclusion at this time.    \n\nThe diplomatic breakthrough and the  agreement itself were thus  being lauded by all veto-wielding members of the \nUnited Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China), as well as the \nbroader United Nations and NATO.  But with the same lack of diplomatic restraint shown by Russian President \n\n\n\nPutin in his opinion editorial in the New York Times, Syria's Assad regime hailed the breakthrough agreement as a \n\"victory\" for that country. Syrian Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar declared in an interview with Russian media, \"It's \na victory for Syria achieved thanks to our Russian friends.\"    \n\nUnited States Secretary of State Kerry quelled Assad regime's bravado warning on Sept. 15, 2013 that the United \nStates retained its right to carry out punitive strikes against Syria, if that country did not meet its publicy stated \ninternational obligations. Secretary of State Kerry said, \"If diplomacy has any chance to work, it must be coupled \nwith a credible military threat.\"  \"We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs,\" Kerry added.    \n\nAlready, President Obama in the United States had reminded the Syrian regime that while the agreement was \"an \nimportant step\" in the right direction,  his country reserved the right to act against Syria for failing to meet its \nobligations.  The United States leader said, \"If diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act.\"  Indeed, \nthe United States Pentagon noted that the United States military remained in a posture poised for military strikes \nagainst Syria.    \n\nWithin the rebel ranks, the agreement was being regarded with scorn and bitterness.  Indeed, the military leader of \nthe anti-Assad Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, dismissed the deal as irrelevant, saying, \"All of this initiative \ndoes not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people.\" Idriss also cast the deal as a \nRussian plan intended to gift the Assad regime with more time, and as such, he  vowed to keep up the fight.    \n\nSpecial Report:\n\nU.S. special forces carry out terrorist raids  in Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan   \n\nIn October 2013, United States special forces raided terrorist enclaves in Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan.     \n\nIn Libya, the action by United States special forces  ended in the capture of a senior al-Qaida official -- Nazih Abdul-\nHamed Nabih al-Ruqai'I,  also known as Anas al-Libi -- a stalwart of the notorious terrorist Jihadist leader, Osama \nBin Laden.  Al-Libi has long been regarded as the orchestrator of the 1998 bombings of the United States \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania,  and has thus been on the radar of United States anti-terrorism officials for \nsome time. Now, in 2013,  he was captured from the Libyan capital of Tripoli.    \n\nFollowing his capture, al-Liby was detained on a United States vessel in the Mediterranean for a week during which \nhe was interrogated by intelligence officials.  He was then transferred to the United States to face justice for his \nalleged role in the United States embassy bombings in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi and the Tanzanian capital of \nDar-es-Salaam in 1998. It should be noted that al-Liby has denied having a role in the two embassy bombings in \n1998. In a New York federal court on Oct. 15, 2013, he  entered a plea of not guilt.  The hearing was then \nadjourned until Oct. 22, 2013. In Libya, the government demanded an explanation for the raid that resulted in al-\nLiby's capture. In the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry defended the actions of his country saying that \nthe actions of al-Liby made him  a \"legal and appropriate target.\"   \n\nThere was less information available on a separate raid on the Somali town of Barawe.  There, commandos were \ntargeting a \"high value\" terrorist from al-Shabab -- the Somali terror group that is allied with al-Qaida.  Because al-\nShabab fighters responded with heavy fire, United States commandos chose to retreat from the scene although \nthere was some suggestion that one al-Shabab terrorist was killed.  It was not known if the person killed was \nMukhtar Abu Zubeyr, also known as Ahmed Godane -- the leader of al-Shabab.  It was later revealed that the target \nof that action was Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, a Kenyan al-Shabab commander also known by the name \n\"Ikrima.\"  It should be noted that the al-Shabab, which is aligned with the terror enclave al-Qaida, claimed \nresponsibility for the horrific terrorist attack on the  Westgate shopping mall in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.   \n\n\n\nA third  United States raid by special forces was carried out in eastern Afghanistan, ultimately ending in the capture \nof a senior Pakistan Taliban commander, Latif Mehsud.   Few details  were made available following this operation, \nalthough Afghan officials admitted that Latif Mehsud was seized as he was returning from negotiations over a prison \nexchange deal in  the eastern Afghan province of Logar and transferred to the Bagram base close to the Afghan \ncapital of Kabul. The incident apparently raised the ire of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, however, the United \nStates seemed undeterred and confident in the wisdom if its action. The United States Department of State noted \nthat  Latif Mehsud was a \"terrorist leader,\" a stalwart of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, and the  \nPakistani Taliban was believed to be responsible for the attempted bombing of Times Square in New York in 2010.  \nFurthermore, around the same time that  Latif Mehsud  was seized,  Hakimullah Mehsud said in an interview that \nthe Pakistani Taliban would continue to target \"America and its friends\" in its campaign of terror.      \nSpecial Report   \n\nDrone strike kills leader of the Pakistani Taliban   \n\nReports emerged at the start of November 2013 confirming that Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani \nTaliban, was killed in a drone strike on his vehicle in  the northwestern region of North Waziristan.  Four other \nindividuals were killed in the strike, including two of Mehsud's bodyguards.   \n\nThe elimination of Hakimullah Mehsud  occurred in the aftermath of a raid by United States special forces in eastern \nAfghanistan,  which ultimately ended with the capture of a senior Pakistani Taliban commander, Latif Mehsud. Few \ndetails  were made available following that October 2013 operation, although Afghan officials admitted that Latif \nMehsud was seized as he was returning from negotiations over a prison exchange deal in  the eastern Afghan \nprovince of Logar and transferred to the Bagram base close to the Afghan capital of Kabul.  It should be noted that \nwhile both held leadership positions in the Pakistani Taliban, Latif Mehsud was no relation to the terrorist entity's \nleader, Hakimullah Mehsud, whose death was confirmed at the start of November 2013, as discussed here.   \n\nTo that end, senior United States officials confirmed that Hakimullah Mehsud's vehicle was struck in  Dande \nDarpakhel, a few miles to the north of the region's main town of Miranshah.  Hakimullah Mehsud came to the fore of \nthe Pakistani Taliban in 2009 following the death of the previous terrorist leader,  Baitullah Mehsud, who was \nhimself killed in a United States  drone strike  in South Waziristan.   \n\nFor its part, the Pakistani Taliban vowed revenge against the United States for the death of Hakimullah Mehsud. A \nspokesperson for the terrorist Islamist group, Azam Tariq, promising: \"Every drop of Hakimullah's blood will turn into \na suicide bomber.  America and their friends shouldn't be happy because we will take revenge for our  martyr's \nblood.\"   \n\nNot surprisingly, the government of Pakistan condemned the drone strike, asserting via a statement that such \naction constituted a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"  Pakistani officials also lamented \nthat the elimination of Hakimullah Mehsud via a drone strike likely spelled the end of hopes for a peace deal with \nthe Taliban -- a goal of newly-elected Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  As noted by Pakistan's Interior \nMinister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, \"This is not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts.\"  \nInterior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan further accused the United States of \"scuttling\" overtures to commence \npeace negotiations with the Tlaiban and warned that \"every aspect\" of Pakistan's bilateral relationship with the \nUnited States would thus be placed under review.   \n\nThese two arguments -- the violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and the death knell to yet-to-be launched  peace \neffort -- were unlikely to find resonance by the Obama administration in the United States.  First, the Obama \nadministration has made it clear it was willing to penetrate Pakistan's sovereign territory in order to target Islamist \nextremist terrorists whom the Pakistani government has been unwilling to bring justice.  Indeed, United States \nPresident Barack Obama had already in 2011 ordered the killing or capture of terrorist leader, Osama Bin Laden, \nwho had taken refuge at a compound in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad -- the very city that housed the Pakistani \nMilitary Academy.  Accordingly, it strained credulity that some faction of the Pakistani government was completely \n\n\n\nunaware that something suspicious was afoot at a multi-level building in the town.  President Obama has also \nincreased drone strikes against terrorists in the Pakistani tribal region, irrespective of rising criticism about the \ncollateral damage in such strikes.  For the Obama administration, the capture and/or killing of terrorists was the \nparamount consideration, the hopes of a non-existent peace deal notwithstanding.   \n\nSpecial Note   \n\nNSA leaks case and revelations about spying causes bilateral tensions across the globe   \n\nIn late October 2013,  the German publication, Der Spiegel, reported that according to leaked clandestine \ndocuments from the National Security Agency (NSA) dispersed by former contractor Edward Snowden,  the United \nStates had been spying on Germany.  Of primary interest was the suggestion that that United States had been \nspying on Angela Merkel  -- the German head of government -- via her mobile phone. The report indicated that the \nUnited States' surveillance of Merkel dated back to 2002 -- before she became Chancellor of Germany.     \n\nThe revelations have spurred outrage in Germany and even caused Chancellor Merkel to call United States \nPresident Obama to register her disapproval.  There was also an announcement that German  intelligence officials \nwould be sent to the United States to seek answers on the news of spying. President Obama reportedly apologized \nto Chancellor Merkel for the phone monitoring but assured his German counterpart that he would have stopped the \npractice, had he known about it.  Another German publication, Bild, disputed this claim by the United States \npresident, citing intelligence sources who said President Obama had been briefed about the operation that included \nmonitoring of Merkel. However, the National Security Agency in the United States issued a statement maintaining \nthat the matter was never discussed with President Obama.  Regardless, the issue soured bilateral relations \nbetween the two countries.     \n\nGerman intelligence officials traveled to the  United States  to seek answers regarding the  allegations of phone-\ntapping Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone. A meeting between Germany's national security adviser, Christoph \nHeusgen, and the German chancellery intelligence coordinator, Guenter Heiss on one side -- and -- White House \nnational security adviser, Dr. Susan Rice,  and United State Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on the \nother side -- sought to calm the rising bilateral tensions on the matter.  One possible path to resolution being \nconsidered by President Obama was a ban on eavesdropping on leaders of allied countries.     \n\nDiplomatic relations between the United States and other countries have already been compromised as  result of \nNSA revelations. Indeed, Spain was demanding answers about the news that millions of Spanish phone calls were \nintercepted by the NSA.  As well,  the Spanish government summoned the United States  ambassador to Spain to \nanswer questions about the United States' espionage practices. Already, the governments of France, Brazil, and \nMexico had reacted in anger over news that the United States' espionage targets involved their countries.    \n\nSoon thereafter, despite international outrage over the United States eavesdropping  program, new revelations in \nNovember 2013 indicated that many other countries were also conducting similar spying programs themselves.  For \nexample, Brazilian  President Dilma Rousseff was supposedly so concerned about the news that the NSA had \ninfiltrated the computer network of state-run oil company, Petrobras,  that she cancelled a state visit to the United \nStates in protest.  But months later, it was revealed that Brazil had its own spying program.  Under fire for the \ninconsistency on the matter, Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardoso insisted that his country's \nsurveillance program was \"completely different\" from that of the United States, and asserted that his country's \nclandestine agents who gathered information on diplomats from the United States, Russian, and Iran  were acting \nlawfully.  Likewise, Germany was reminded  that many friendly countries -- other than the United States -- had their \nown clandestine service .  At issue was the discover that the British embassy in Berlin housed  sophisticated \napparatus for eavesdropping and other covert surveillance activities.  Thus, Germany summoned the British \nambassador for an explanation on the matter.    \n\n\n\nThese diplomatic grievances aside, the fact of the matter was that revelations of this sort could taint bilateral \nrelations and cooperation that could assist in detecting and fighting against acts of terrorism.  As noted by British \nPrime Minister David Cameron, such clandestine information could assist terrorists in  understanding \"how to evade \nand avoid detection.\"  He continued, \"It is going to make our world more dangerous.\" In an interview with CBS \nNews, deputy director and acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) echoed this anxiety, noting that \nthe  leaked NSA documents  damaged efforts to track possible terror threats. He said, \"What Edward Snowden did \nhas put Americans at greater risk because terrorists learn from leaks, and they will be more careful, and we will not \nget the intelligence we would have gotten otherwise.\"   \n\nWhile President Obama said  he was initiating a review of the surveillance gathering  operations,  the intelligence \ncommunity in the United States was defending its tactics.  In testimony before the intelligence panel of the United \nStates House of Representatives,  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper asserted that the United States \ndid not \"indiscriminately\" spy on  other countries but that it was a \"kind of a basic tenet\" of intelligence-gathering to \ndetermine the intentions of other world leaders and to cross-check  that \"what they are saying gels with what's \nactually going on.\" Clapper explained that the goal was to  discern foreign leaders' intentions, saying, \"Leadership \nintentions is kind of a basic tenet of what we collect and analyze.\"     \n\nClapper also put into words what should have already been known by most students of world affairs -- that the \nUnited States' allies also spy on United States officials and that clandestine activities of this type was routine.   As \nstated by Clapper, \"It [reciprocal spying] is one of the first things I learned in intelligence school in 1963... It's a \nfundamental given.\"  Stated in pedestrian terms -- most countries with intelligence services spy on one another.  \nThe difference, of course, was that few countries have the vast array of clandestine intelligence technologies or \nhuman assets when compared to the United States.  Clapper was unapologetic regarding the United States' \nsurveillance program    \n\nIt should be noted that National Security Agency (NSA) director, General Keith Alexander,  who also testified at the \nHouse hearing characterized claims that the NSA  gathered data on millions of telephone calls  across Europe as \n\"completely false.\" In response to a Wall Street Journal report that intelligence services in France and Spain had \ncollected phone records of their citizens and turned them over to the NSA, General Alexander said, \"This is not \ninformation we collected on European citizens. It represents information that we and our NATO allies have collected \nin defense of our countries and in support of military operations.\" In fact, General Alexander implicated European \ngovernments  in its surveillance activities, noting that  large swaths of data cited by international news organizations \nhad actually been gathered by European intelligence services and  shared with the NSA.  General Alexander also \nechoed Clapper's unapologetic tone as he declared, \"It is much more important for this country that we defend this \nnation and take the beatings than it is to give up a program that would result in this nation being attacked.\"   \n\nU.S. and Japan fighter jets fly through China's newly declared defense zone in East China Sea   \n\nIn late November 2013, China tested the patience of the international community by declaring a new defense zone \nin the  East China Sea.  To that end, China  announced it was deploying warplanes in the new  air defense \nidentification zone (ADIZ)  for surveillance purposes.  However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang \nnoted that if disputes occurred in the region, his country hoped to resolve them through \"peaceful means via friendly \nnegotiation.\"   \n\nChina's self-declaration of dominion over the territory and its warning that all airplanes passing through the area \nwere to  file flight plans and identify themselves or  be prepared to deal with \"defensive emergency measures\" likely \nraised the ire of neighbors. Indeed,  the new  air defense identification zone (ADIZ) included contested territory \nclaimed not only by China, but also Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.  Of particular note were uninhabited but \ndisputed islands in the area known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu by the Chinese.  Their significance has, in the \npast, focused on fishing rights and shipping lanes; however, there was also the possibility of fossil fuel reserves in \nthe area.    \n\n\n\nThe United States Department of State characterized China's  newly declared defense zone as \"an attempt to \nunilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea\" and accordingly warned that it would \"raise regional \ntensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents.\"  In defiance of China's decision to  \ndeclare the new ADIZ, the United States and Japan respectively ordered fighters jets to be flown through this area \nof the East China Sea. China was  thus prompted to  scramble warplanes to monitor those American and Japanese \nfighter jets crossing through the ADIZ.    \n\nFor both Japan and the United States, the message was clear: they did not officially recognize  China's newly \ndeclared defense zone in East China Sea.  That being  said, the United States was quick to note that its decision to \nfly fighter jets through the ADIZ was not intended to be a provocative act.  An official for the United States military \ntold CNN News that its aircrafts and a number of other Japanese military aircraft flew through the ADIZ  without \nincident and as part of scheduled routine operations.  The military official was quoted as saying, \"This is status quo. \nWe are not changing what we are doing. We are not trying to make a point with China. We fly U.S. aircraft daily in \ninternational airspace in the region. This is normal.\"     \n\nSouth Korea also reportedly dispatched a military aircraft  on a routine patrol flight into the ADIZ and did not alert \nChina of its flight plan. An official from the South Korean Defense Ministry said the flight was routine and  carried \nout twice a week; the South Korean official said the patrols would continue irrespective of China's newly declared \ndefense zone in East China Sea.    \n\nStill, several commercial airlines, such as Qantas Airlines and Singapore Airlines, were not prepared to take any \nchances of their own and made it clear that they intended to act in accordance with China's new regulations.  As \nwell, the United States advised American commercial carriers to comply with China's new requirements for filing \nflight plans  when they traverse the newly declared ADIZ over the East China Sea for obvious security reasons.  It \nwas to be seen if the matter would spark a dispute, especially since at least two Japanese airlines announced they \nwould not be complying with the new Chinese-dictated regulations.    \n\nComplicating matters was an announcement from South Korea on Dec. 8, 2013 that it was expanding its  own air \ndefense zone, which that area partially overlapping  with China's zone.  At issue was the Ieodo rock claimed by \nboth countries and controlled by South Korea.  As noted here, South Korea was already challenging China's ADIZ \nby flying its military aircraft through that zone. The moves were expected to raise already-heightened tensions in \neastern Asia.    \n\nMeanwhile, in the first week of December 2013, while United States Vice President Joseph Biden was on a trip to \nAsia, the matter of China's self-declare air defense zone was a matter of discussion.  In a joint appearance with \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Vice President Biden said, \"We, the United States, are deeply \nconcerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea. This action has raised \nregional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation.\" Biden said the United States was \nmonitoring the situation with  Japan and South Korea and noted that \"we will remain steadfast in our alliance \ncommitments.\"  He continued, \"The United States has an interest in the lowering of tensions in this vital region. This \nunderscores the need for crisis management mechanisms and effective channels of communication between China \nand Japan to reduce the risk of escalation.\"   \n\nVice President Biden then engaged in \"very direct\"  talks regarding the ADIZ  with Chinese officials.   While China \nasserted its view that its self-declare air defense zone was consistent with \"international law and practice,\"  Vice \nPresident Biden pointed out that the move had caused \"apprehension\" in Asia and he noted that  China had \n\"increasing responsibility to contribute positively to peace and security.\" But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman \nHong Lei said: \"During the talks the Chinese side repeated its principled position, stressing that the Chinese move \naccorded with international law and practice.\"  Thus, it was clear -- at least in the public purview -- that neither the \nUnited States nor China were prepared to step back from the expressly-stated stances.      \n\nSpecial Note: Israel announces arrest of Palestinian al-Qaida cell with plans to attack U.S. embassy   \n\n\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2014, Israel announced it had foiled a terror plot by a  Palestinian al-Qaida cell in East Jerusalem.  \nIsraeli authorities from the Shin Bet security service said that they had arrested three Palestinians who were \nrecruited  in the Gaza Strip  and the West Bank and  were planning terror attacks.  Those planned attacks included \nan operation against the United States embassy in Tel Aviv, an attack on  a  conference center in Jerusalem, and \nthe abduction of Israeli soldiers from a Jerusalem's bus station.  The Islamist extremist Hamas movement, which \ncontrols the Gaza Strip, dismissed Shin Bet's allegations, casting them as  \"silly fabrications,\" and suggesting that \nIsrael was just trying to find justifications for its military strikes in Gaza.  However, Shin Bet had fairly detailed claims \nagainst the cell saying that the operative were headed to Syria  for weapons training and were in possession of fake \nRussian documents.  As well, Shin Bet also noted that the Palestinian operatives used their Israeli resident cards to \nprocure intelligence on  their intended terrorism targets.   \n\nU.S. prepared full withdrawal from Afghanistan following Karzai's failure to sign security agreement    \n\nContinuing violence in the first part of 2014 has highlighted the security challenges facing Afghanistan.  Of concern \nwas the matter of how the country would deal with the violence  when international forces exited Afghanistan at the \nclose of 2014.  To that end, there was a pending security agreement under consideration to be forged between \nAfghanistan and the United States.   \n\nThat proposal would mean that as many as 10,000 United States troops would be remain in Afghanistan after the \n2014 deadline for a withdrawal of international forces; that remaining contingent would be responsible for counter-\nterrorism and training of Afghan forces.  President Karzai has not been quick to sign the agreement and the United \nStates has made it clear that without a signed agreement, it would fully exit Afghanistan at the close of 2014, as \nplanned to this point.  To date, relations between the United States and the Karzai government in Afghanistan have \nbeen decidedly conflicted, with the United States frequently frustrated by Karzai's erratic and unstable behavior, \nmarked occasionally by Karzai's threats to \"join the Taliban.\"   \n\nIn February 2014, the United States made clear that it was entertaining the possibility of withdrawing all its troops \nfrom Afghanistan unless the security agreement is soon signed. Indeed, on Feb. 12, 2014,  White House \nspokesperson Jay Carney emphasized that the Obama administration had no intention of   renegotiating the \nBilateral Security Agreement (BSA).  At a White House briefing, he said, \"Planning has to place around the \ncontingencies that exist -- with either a signed BSA or a BSA that is not signed. And as time progresses into this \nyear, it becomes more difficult to plan for a post-2014 troop presence.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, around the same period in February 2014, reports were emerging from Afghanistan about talks \nbetween President Karzai's government and the Taliban.    A spokesperson for the Karzai government, Aimal Faizi, \nsaid in an interview with the New York Times, \"I can confirm that ... Taliban are willing more than ever to join the \npeace process. Contacts have been made and we are also in touch with them.\"   \n\nThe United States issued a statement supportive of such overtures of reconciliation.  Jen Psaki of the United States \nDepartment of State said, \"It's important to note here that we've long strongly supported an Afghan-led \nreconciliation, which would, of course, be Afghans talking to Afghans. So the notion that we wouldn't support that \ndialogue is inaccurate.\"  That being said, she made it clear that the United States was not involved in any peace \ntalks with the Taliban.   \n\nThe United States was not so sanguine about the news that Karzai allowed the release of  65 detainees from the \nhigh-security Bagram prison to the north of Kabul.  The United States had strenuously urged Afghanistan not to \nrelease these  detainees, warning that there were extremist  Taliban fighters who were responsible for the deaths of \ninternational forces, including both Afghan and  American soldiers, as well as   civilians.  But Karzai went forward \nwith the release of these extremists in defiance of the United States' expressed request.  The move was sure to \nfurther complicate already dismal relations between the governments of the two countries.    \n\n\n\nAs February 2014 came to a close, the White House in the United States announced that President  Barack Obama \nhad ordered the Pentagon to prepare to withdraw all United States troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year.   \nPresident Obama issued the order in the face of Karzai's dithering over the Bilateral Security Agreement that would \nallow the United States to keep  a limited contingent of troops in Afghanistan after 2014.  President Obama \napparently delivered the news directly to President Karzai during a telephone call.   \n\nAround the same period, the violence continued in Afghanistan; a suicide bomb attack in the southern province of \nOruzgan left several people dead and at least a dozen others injured.  With the aforementioned withdrawal in the \noffing, the United States was intensifying its operations to damage the terror networks, such as the Taliban and \nHaqqani network, which were operating in the Afghan-Pak region.   \n\nSpecial Report:     \n\nPope Francis, Politics, and Poverty   \n\nAt the start of 2014, it was announced that United States President Barack Obama would meet for the first time \nwith  Pope Francis  in March 2014.  It should be noted that it would not be the United States leader's first meeting \nwith his counterpart in the Holy See as  President Obama met with Pope Benedict in 2009. This meeting in 2014 \nbetween Pope Francis and President Obama would focus on the shared interest of the two leaders  in fighting \ninequality.  Of concern to both Pope Francis and President Obama has been the ever-increasing chasm between \nrich and poor in countries across the world.   \n\nPresident Obama's meeting with Pope Francis would be part of a spring visit to Europe that would also include \nmeetings with  Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Rome, as well as his \nattendance at a Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Dutch government.  President Obama would also be \npresent at a European Union summit in  Brussels;  indeed, it would be President Obama's first official visit to \nEuropean Union institutions.   \n\nRegarding President Obama's upcoming meeting with Pope Francis, White House spokesperson Jan Carney, said: \n\"The president looks forward to discussing with Pope Francis their shared commitment to fighting poverty and \ngrowing inequality.\"   \n\nWhereas Pope Francis' pastoral interest in poverty alleviation finds its roots in his background as a priest in Buenos \nAires,  President Obama's socio-political interest in poverty and inequality can likely be linked to his time as a \ncommunity organizer in Chicago.  Francis has received accolades for his impassioned calls for Catholics to attend \nless to social issues such as abortion and birth control, and more to caring for the  struggling and the impoverished.  \nMeanwhile, President Obama's attention to income inequality in the United States has been criticized by rival \nRepublicans who have, in many states, even attacked persons requiring government assistance to make ends \nmeet.   \n\nIn  an 84-page apostolic exhortation, titled \"Evangelii Gaudium\" (The Joy of the Gospel),  which was published in \nNovember 2013, Pope Francis invited secular leadership on the matters of poverty and inequality, writing:  \"I beg \nthe Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society, the people, the lives of the \npoor.\"   \n\nJust over a week later, President Obama offered a landmark speech on  economic strife in the United States, \ncharacterizing the fight against inequality \"the defining challenge of our time.\"  In fact, President Obama even \nreferenced Pope Francis' poverty alleviation stance, saying, \"Some of you may have seen just last week, the pope \nhimself spoke about this at eloquent length.\"  He went so far as to evoke Pope Francis' poignant challenge: \"How \ncan it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock \nmarket loses two points?\"   \n\n\n\nFor his part, Pope Francis has made quick work of establishing himself of something of a papal maverick if not an \noutright radical. He was willing to address the claims of corruption at the Vatican Bank by  naming a special \ncommission to investigate the entity, and delved into the disturbing sex abuse scandals that have long plagued the \nchurch by naming a  new commission to investigate the matter.  He has made international news for exemplifying \nausterity by carrying his own luggage, dressing in plain robes rather than papal garb, living in a Vatican guest house \nrather than the Apostolic Palace, and even suspending  a bishop in Germany  for spending lavishly on church \nresidences rather than ministering to the poor.   \n\nFrom his willingness to pose for photographs with youth visitors to the Vatican, to washing the feet of female \nconvicts, and embracing a man with a deformed face, Pope Francis has softened the image of the Catholic Church, \nmaking it a more accessible and inclusive venue to many who viewed it as a distant and aging institution.  On social \nissues that often  resonate quite differently with younger generations (vis a vis the church establishment), Pope \nFrancis has moderated the actual message of the Catholic Church.  He has said  of women who consider abortion \ndue to poverty or rape, \"Who can remain unmoved before such painful situations?\" On the matter of homosexuality, \nhe has said, \"If a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God, I am no one to judge.\"   \n\nBut  it has been his passionate criticism of the capitalist paradigm -- the very economic system that defines most of \nthe West -- that marks Pope Francis as a trailblazer of sorts.  Returning to his November 2013 exhortation \nmentioned above, Pope Benedict struck at the heart of the free market capitalist structure  (also known as supply \nside economics or trickle down economics by conservatives).  He declared the following: \"Some people continue to \ndefend trickle down theories, which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably \nsucceed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion has never been confirmed by \nthe facts.\"   \n\nFor those unwilling to believe that the head of the Catholic Church and the leader of the Holy See would actually \nimpugn the global free market system, Pope Francis removed all doubt by outright attacking \"unfettered \ncapitalism,\"  which he cast as  \"a new tyranny.\"  Indeed, he emphasized the church's obligation  \"to eliminate the \nstructural causes of poverty.\"  As noted by veteran Vatican analyst, John Thavis, Pope's Francis' views -- as \nexpressed verbally and via  \"Evangelii Gaudium\"  -- could well be regarded as a \"Magna Carta for church reform.   \n\nPerhaps it was not surprising that at the close of 2013, the pope who took the name of a humble saint --  Francis of \nAssisi, the 13th century patron saint of the poor -- was named as Time magazine's \"Person of the Year.\"   \n\nPope France and President Obama finally met for the first time in the heart of the Vatican in the last week of March \n2014.  President Obama's meeting with the pontiff occurred as part of a series of meeting with European leaders in \nthe Netherlands and Belgium.   Upon meeting Pope Francis, President Obama  said, \"It is a great honor. I'm a great \nadmirer. Thank you so much for receiving me.\"  President Obama also presented him with a variety of fruit and \nvegetable seeds used in the White House garden and invited the pope to visit that venue.  Pope Francis responded \naffirmatively to the invitation saying, \"For sure.\"  For his part, Pope Francis gifted President Obama with  two \nmedals and a leather-bound copy of his aforementioned book, Evangeli Gaudium.  President Obama received that \nparticular gift, saying, \"I actually will probably read this when I'm in the Oval Office, when I am deeply frustrated, \nand I am sure it will give me strength.\"   \n\nIn addition to poverty -- a \"simpatico\" issue for the United States and Holy See leaders, the two men also discussed \nmore contentious social issues, such as abortion and birth control, where the Obama administration is at odds with \nthe Catholic Church.  Also on the agenda were discussions of immigration reform and human trafficking where the \ntwo sides found far more concurrence.      \nSpecial Entry   \n\nU.S. refuses visa request for Iranian diplomat involved in 1979 hostage crisis   \n\n\n\nIn April 2014, Iran put forth a controversial candidate -- Hamid Aboutalebi -- as its selection to be that country's \nambassador to the United Nations.  Aboutalebi was reported to be one of  the individuals who stormed the United \nStates embassy in Tehran in 1979, and then held 52 United States hostages for 444 days. It should be noted that \nAboutalebi has insisted that he simply acted as a translator during the hostage  crisis; however there was little \nlikelihood that the United States was prepared to distinguish between \"levels\" of involvement in one of the darkest \nchapters of modern foreign relations history.   \n\nGiven this background, the Obama administration in the United States  made clear that Iran's  choice  of Aboutalebi \nto be  ambassador to the United Nations was not acceptable.  As stated by White House press secretary, Jay \nCarney, \"The U.S. government has informed the government of Iran that this potential selection is not viable.\"   \n\nAdding to Aboutalebi's woes was a bill in the Senate that barred him from entering the United States due to his \nactive involvement in the Iranian hostage crisis.  Carney noted that the Senate bill was reflective of the White \nHouse's concerns, as he said, \"We share the Senate's concerns regarding this case and find the potential \nnomination extremely troubling.\"  A similar bill in the House of Representatives also barred Aboutalebi from entering \nthe United States due to his role in the Iranian hostage crisis.   \n\nThere were some hopes that the White House's stated  position on Aboutalebi, augmented by the legislation in the \nUnited States Senate and House of Representatives, would together place pressure on Iran to withdraw the \nappointment.  However, it was also possible that Iran would hold steady, thus placing the United States in the \nposition of possibly refusing to process Iran's application for a visa for Aboutalebi.   \n\nTo that end, Iran insisted that Aboutalebi had been selected for the post at the United Nations because of his \ndiplomatic credentials and stood by his appointment.  In response to Iran's intransigence, the Obama administration \nin the United States  refused to grant Aboutalebi a visa, emphasizing its position that it would be impossible to grant \ndiplomatic protection to a person who was involved in the flagrant deprivation of protection to American diplomats.   \n\nThe move effectively prevented Aboutalebi from taking the post of ambassador at the United Nations, since its \ndiplomatic offices are based in New York  and on United States soil.  Iran's mission to the United Nations \ncondemned the move, casting it as \"regrettable,\" and noting that the refusal to process Aboutalebi's visa was not in \nkeeping with international law.  Indeed, a 1947 agreement requires the United States  to approve visa requests for \ndesignated diplomats from United Nations member states.   \n\nNevertheless, as April 2014 entered its last week, the United Nations' Committee on Relations with the Host \nCountry opted to take no action against the United States for its refusal to grant a visa to  Aboutalebi.  At home in \nthe United States, President Barack Obama  underlined his country's stance on the matter of individuals who act \nagainst the United States.  He signed into law a bill that would prohibit anyone from entering the United States as a \ndiplomatic representative  who carried out espionage or terrorist activity and who may pose a threat to national \nsecurity.   \n\nNote:  It was to be seen if the dissonance over the United States' refusal to issue the Iranian diplomat a visa would \naffect the Iranian nuclear deal.   \n\nSpecial Entry   \n\nMiddle East Peace Plan Falters   \n\nSummary   \n\nSince mid-July 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry  has been traveling to the Middle East in another \neffort of \"shuttle diplomacy\" as he attempted to revitalize the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.  The \n\n\n\nprocess has been beset by challenges although Kerry's diligence has kept the peace process moving along through \nthe spring of 2014. But by April 2013, the peace process hit significant obstacles and United States Secretary of \nState Kerry cancelled a scheduled trip to the Middle East.  As the month was drawing to a close, the two rival \nPalestinian factions -- the Fatah wing of the Palestinian Liberation Organization  and the extremist Islamist entity \nHamas  -- forged a reconciliation deal, essentially dooming the prospects of progress on peace.  Indeed, Israel \nmade it clear that it would exit the peace process unless the Palestinians abandoned their arrangement with \nHamas.    \n\nBackground   \n\nGoing back to mid-2013 when the United States-sponsored attempt to pursue Middle East peace began, Israel's \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Secretary of State Kerry's efforts,  and noted that the re-\nengagement with the Palestinians was of \"vital and strategic interest\" to Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu intimated \nthat challenges in the region from Iran and Syria demanded that the Israeli-Palestinian issue be settled for the long \nrun.  He said, \"It is important in itself to try and end the conflict between us and the Palestinians and it is important \nin light of the challenges we face from Iran and Syria.\"   \n\nAs part of an apparent good faith agreement, Israel announced plans to  release a number of high value Palestinian \nprisoners who had been in  jail for decades.  The actual release of the prisoners would ensue on a phased basis. \nOn the other side of the equation,  the Palestinians  committed to participating in \"serious negotiations\" over the \ncourse of a  minimum nine-month period.   \n\nContentious issues, such as the matter of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, did not appear \nto be part of the immediate agreements.  However, they found their way into the initial discussions anyway.  A \nsenior Palestinian official was reported to have said, \"Our position remains clear: resumption of negotiations should \nbe based on the two-state solution and on the 1967 borders.\" But Israel made clear that it would not be accepting \nthe Palestinians' demands that a future Palestinian state be crafted on the basis of 1967 borders. Israeli Strategic \nAffairs Minister Yuval Steinitz asserted: \"There is no chance that we will agree to enter any negotiations that begin \nwith defining territorial borders or concessions by Israel, nor a construction freeze.\"   \n\nAs well, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu promised to subject any future peace deal with the Palestinians to a \nreferendum. He said there was a need for a potential peace deal to be ratified directly by Israelis in order to \n\"prevent a rift among the people.\" He continued, \"Any agreement that is not approved by the people is not worthy of \nbeing signed.\"  That being said, Netanyahu noted that peace was the ultimate objective for his country.  He said, \n\"Achieving peace is a crucial goal for Israel.\"  Critics of Netanyahu said that subjecting such a major policy decision \nto a popular referendum would be akin to tacitly sabotaging the peace process; however, the actual proposition for \na referendum (which was approved by the Israeli cabinet), would relate to a peace deal involving territorial \nconcessions.   \n\nSecretary of State Kerry noted that both Israelis and Palestinians had an important foundation for the resumption of \ndirect peace talks after an impasse that had lasted three years. Secretary of State Kerry's peace agenda was also \nsupported by the Arab League, which indicated that it would also be interested in moving forward with some variant \nof its earlier \"land for peace\" deal that did not really gain traction about a decade earlier.  The actual peace talks \nwere set to begin at the end of July 2013. The White House said the task head would be \"an enormous challenge.\"   \n\nOn July 28, 2013, the United States Department of State announced that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would \nresume peace talks on July 29, 2013.  After those talks, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced \nthat the two  sides had agreed to remain engaged in sustained peace negotiations for at least a  nine-month period, \nwith the goal of forging a peace treaty.   Secretary Kerry explained:  \"The parties have agreed here today that all of \nthe final-status issues, all of the core issues, and all other issues are all on the table for negotiation, and they are on \nthe table with one simple goal: a view to ending the conflict, ending the claims.\"  Speaking of the difficulty of the \ntask at hand, Secretary Kerry said, \"We all appreciate -- believe me, we appreciate the challenges ahead.  But even \n\n\n\nas we look down the difficult road that is before us and consider the complicated choices that we face, we cannot \nlose sight of something that is often forgotten in the Middle East, and that is what awaits everybody with success.\"   \n\nThe next round of talks would resume in mid-August 2013. Before those talks resumed, the contentious issue of \nJewish settlements emerged when Israel approved the construction of close to 1,200 new Jewish  homes in east \nJerusalem as well as the West Bank.  Palestinian negotiators said the move undermined Israel's good faith  in the \npeace process. In an interview with Reuters, chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said, \"If the Israeli \ngovernment believes that every week they're going to cross a red line by settlement activity, if they go with this \nbehavior, what they're advertising is the unsustainability of the negotiations.\" But Israeli Housing Minister Uri Ariel \ndefended the move saying that no country in the world would take orders on where its citizenry could build its \nhomes. He said:  \"No country in the world takes orders from other countries [about] where it can build and where it \ncan't.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, some political analysts have suggested that the settlement move had less to do with the government's \nattitude to the peace process, and was more about satisfying the right-wing base of the Likud-led Israeli coalition \ngovernment. That hardline base has been outraged over the Israeli government's concession to release Palestinian \nprisoners.  Rather than flagrantly undermining the peace process, the Israeli government  very well may have been \nthrowing the hard-right flank a proverbial \"bone\" ahead of the resumption of peace talks and just as 26 of the 100 \nPalestinian prisoners were released from captivity.   \n\nThe peace process was challenged in mid-August 2013 when Hamas militants fired rockets from the Gaza Strip into \nIsraeli territory, spurring the Israeli military to respond by launching an airstrike on Gaza. There were no casualties \nin either incident but the scenario was a reminder of the ongoing tensions on both sides at a time when peace talks \nwere set to resume in Jerusalem.   \n\nIt should be noted that on Aug. 22, 2013,  militants fired rockets from southern Lebanese territory into Israel, \nyielding damage at a kibbutz close to the coastal town of Nahariya.  One rocket was intercepted using the Iron \nDome missile defense system.  Israel did not place the blame on Lebanon-based Hezbollah,  with whom Israel was \nengaged in a short war in 2006, but instead on global jihadists.  It was unknown if this incident was in response to \nongoing peace efforts.   \n\nMonths of shuttle diplomacy by United States Secretary of State John Kerry followed but  in November 2013, United \nStates-brokered Middle East peace talks  hit a snag. Palestinian negotiators resigned over a lack of progress and in \nprotest over Israel's continued settlement in Palestinian areas.   \n\nAs noted by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, \"In reality, the negotiations stopped last week in light of the \nsettlement announcements.\" At issue was the news that Israel announced plans for new Jewish settler homes in \nthe  West Bank and East Jerusalem.  Palestinian negotiators reacted negatively to that development by walked \naway from the peace negotiations.   \n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry entered the fray to note that the settlement plan undermined the peace \nprocess, and he urged Israel to limit its settlement activity in the interests of creating \"a climate for these talks to be \nable to proceed effectively.\" Secretary of State even went so far as to move away from the usual stance by the \nUnited States in characterizing settlement expansion as \"unhelpful.\" In this case, the United States top diplomat \ncast the settlement activity as \"illegitimate.\"  He said, \"Let me emphasize that the position of the United States is \nthat we consider now, and have always considered, the settlements to be illegitimate.\"   \n\nPerhaps cognizant of the negative effect on the peace process that the settlement activity might have on \nnegotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intervened into the brewing crisis.  He said that he has no \nknowledge of the Israeli Housing Ministry's decision to grant construction permits and  called for a halt on the \nsettlement projects.  That being said, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for the current \nobstacle to the peace process, accusing them of creating \"artificial crises.\"   Prime Minister Netanyahu nevertheless \n\n\n\nindicated his hopes that the talks could return to more positive footing thanks to the presence of  United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry.   \n\nFor his part, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  made clear that the resignation of his negotiating team did not \nsignal a death knell to the peace process, and that he would be willing to appoint a new team, if needed.  He said,  \n\"Either we can convince it to return, and we're trying with them, or we form a new delegation.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that the Palestinian leader had his own problems in trying to meet the needs of a Palestinian \npeople lacking a sense of political unity. The goal for the Palestinian political establishment has been the formation \nof an independent Palestinian state in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip; however, Gaza has long been under the \ncontrol of the Islamist militant group, Hamas, which is hostile to the Jewish state  and opposes peace with Israel.  \nHamas could hardly be regarded as a partner in the peace process.   \n\nBy the first week of December 2013,  United States Secretary of State John Kerry was back in Israel for peace \ntalks. The United States' top diplomat, Secretary of State Kerry noted that progress had been made and security \nproposals were under consideration with an eye on addressing Israel's main concerns.  He said,  \"We are closer \nthan we have been in years in bringing about the peace and prosperity and security that all the people in this region \ndeserve and have been yearning for.\"  Striking a positive tone during a news conference with Secretary of State \nKerry,  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel was ready for historic peace with the Palestinians based on \na two-state solution.   \n\nIn an ironic twist, despite the positive tone taken by the Israeli prime minister,  the Israeli foreign minister suggested \nthe peace talks were at a \"dead end.\" Avignor Lieberman argued that no deal was in sight, even indicating that the \ntwo sides were at an impasse as he said, \"We are at a dead end.\" Although Lieberman was not playing a part in \npeace negotiations, he suggested that there was simply not enough trust between the two sides to hold credible \nnegotiations.  He said, \"...Something simple like trust and reliability. The trust between the two sides is non-existent. \nIt is hard to make peace when you don't believe the other side.\"  On the issue of the prospects of a peace deal, \nLieberman said,  \"My feeling is that there is great desire but I don't think it's possible. It is not easy to bridge the \ngaps. We are not even close to a deal, not even an interim one. That is my estimate.\"   \n\nPeace Process Falters   \n\nBy mid-December 2013,  the \"mixed\" report on the progress of peace negotiations continued.  Palestinian \nnegotiators accused  United States Secretary of State Kerry of dooming the peace process by adopting the Israeli \nposition on security arrangements, which they said would short-circuit all the other issues under consideration.   \n\nAt issue was the Israeli demand that it retain a security presence along the Jordan River -- something the \nPalestinian Authority has rejected as a non-starter.  One possible compromise might be the notion of an Israeli \nJordan River presence  for a limited period of time for 10 to 15 years.   \n\nNevertheless, Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Israel's chief negotiator, said  that progress was being made \nalthough the process would be difficult and laborious.  She also made it clear that Israel should not take positions \nthat would impair the peace process -- such as the construction of settlement.  During an address to students at Tel \nAviv University, Livni said: \"My choice is clear -- peace and security, and not settlements and isolation.\"  She \ncontinued by noting, \"We are capable of making a decision that will lead to two states,\" but the process \"will be \ngradual, and its implementation will be gradual.\"   \n\nDisagreements over measures and obstacles to the peace process have continued to crop up at the start of 2014.  \nThe decision by Israel to continue to build Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem raised the ire \nof Palestinians, who questioned Israel's commitment to a long-term \"two-state solution,\" given these moves.  But \nIsrael has also questioned the  proposed security arrangement in the Jordan Valley between a future Palestinian \n\n\n\nstate and Jordan (discussed above) charging that there remained a serious security demand for Israeli forces to \nretain its military presence in flashpoint areas.   \n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the Israelis' demand that it retain a military presence in \nthe West Bank for decades into the future on the basis of security reasons. Abbas said the Palestinian Authority \nwould prefer a three-year transition period.  Abbas said, \"A transitional period cannot exceed three years, during \nwhich Israel can withdraw gradually. We are willing to allow a third party to take Israel's place, during and after \nwithdrawal to soothe our concerns and Israel's.\"  The vast distance between three years and several decades \nsuggested that there was a major negotiating chasm yet to be bridged.    \n\nMeanwhile, bilateral tensions flared between Israel and its closest ally, the United States in January 2014.  At issue \nwere what the United States called the \"offensive\" comments of Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon regarding \nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry.  For his unrelenting efforts to advance peace between  the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians,  Secretary of State Kerry was rewarded with insult instead of accolades.   \n\nAccording to Israel's Yediot Ahronot newspaper, Israeli Defense Minister Yaalonn said, \"John Kerry -- who has \ncome to us determined and is acting out of an incomprehensible obsession and messianic fervor -- cannot teach \nme anything about the conflict with the Palestinians.\"  Yaalon further disparaged the security plan recommended by \nKerry saying,  the proposal presented to Israel was \"not worth the paper it was written on.\"   \n\nThe United States -- the one country that has stood steadfastly by Israel as most of the Western world moved to \nsupport the Palestinians' bid for recognition at the United Nations, and which has provided unrelenting security \nsupport to Israel for decades -- reacted with outrage.   The White House in the United States condemned Yaalon's \ncomments, characterizing them as \"offensive\" and rebuking Israel for this \"inappropriate\" stance, given the Unites \nStates' support to Israel's security.  White House spokesman Jay Carney, speaking on behalf of the government of \nthe United States, further added the following condemnation: \"Secretary Kerry and his team have been working \nnon-stop in their efforts to promote a secure peace for Israel because of the deep concern the United States has, \nand the deep commitment the United States has for and to Israel's future and the Israeli people....To question his \nmotives and distort his proposals is not something we would expect from the defense minister of a close ally.\"   \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, perhaps realizing the extent of the bilateral damage, distanced himself \nfrom his own defense minister, saying, \"Even when we have disagreements with the United States, they always \npertain to the matter at hand, and are not personal.\"  However, the Israeli defense minister was forced to issue an \napology of his own.  A  statement issued by Yaalon's office read as follows: \"The defense minister... apologizes if \nthe secretary was offended by words attributed to the minister.\"  Yaalon further added  that he had no intention of \n\"causing offense\" and expressed gratitude for the United States' top diplomat's work in advancing peace, saying \nthat Israel and the United States shared \"a common goal\" of advancing peace talks with the Palestinians and  that \nhis country appreciated \"Secretary Kerry's many efforts towards that end.\"   \n\nIsrael withdraws from peace process   \n\nBy April 2014, the peace process was was not simply faltering- it was on its symbolic \"death bed.\" At issue was the \ndecision by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to sign 15 international conventions pertaining to the \nPalestinians' attempt to be recognized as an independent country by the United Nations.  The attempt to bypass the \npeace process and seek independent recognition at the United Nations has long been a contentious issue and one \nthat the United States has opposed in favor of a negotiated settlement with both Israelis and Palestinians as \nstakeholders.  For his part, Abbas said he was reacting to Israel's decision to issue 700 new tenders for settlements \nin the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo across the so-called  Green Line (i.e. sometimes referred to as the \"pre-1967 \nborders\" but actually the line of demarcation set out in the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and its \nneighbors following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  Throughout, Israel's intermittent decisions to move forward with \nJewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have been cause for consternation among Palestinians, \nand have frustrated the United States as it attempts to broker peace.   \n\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the United States, which was acting as the peace negotiations broker, both the Israelis \nand Palestinians were acting in bad faith .  As such, Secretary of State Kerry signaled his outrage over their actions \nby cancelling his visits to Jerusalem and Ramallah respectively.  He stopped short of casting the renewed Middle \nEast peace effort as being in a state of crisis, and instead issued the following call: \"We urge both sides to show \nrestraint.\"  Secretary of State Kerry also indicated that the peace effort would continue for a month as he said, \n\"Abbas has given me his word that he will continue to negotiate until end of April.\"  However, Kerry also intimated \nthat there was no hope for peace without the commitment of the Israelis and  the Palestinians, as he added,  \"It is \nup to the parties to make decisions.\"  Israel itself was making its stance known  as it decided not to go forward with \na planned release of Palestinian prisoners -- a central element of the confidence-building measures in the larger \npeace process.   \n\nThe  fate of the peace process moved in a negative direction on April 4, 2014, when Secretary of State Kerry noted \nthat the Obama administration in  Washington was evaluating whether or not to continue its role as a broker in the \nMiddle East peace talks.  During a visit to Morocco, Kerry warned there were limits to his country's efforts.  He said, \n\"This is not an open-ended effort, it never has been. It is reality check time, and we intend to evaluate precisely \nwhat the next steps will be.\"   \n\nEfforts were underway to try to rescue the peace process as April 2014 moved into its second week, although \nhopes for a breakthrough remained limited since the negotiations schedule was set to expire on April 30, 2014.   \n\nThose remaining hopes for a breakthrough were dimmed on April 23, 2014, when the  Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (largely dominated by the more moderate Fatah wing of Palestinian President Abbas) decided to enter \ninto a reconciliation agreement with the extremist Palestinian entity, Hamas, which has refused to recognize the \nright of Israel to exist and has been responsible for countless terror attacks against Israel.  The agreement would \nfacilitate a unity Palestinian government.   \n\nFor several years, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Hamas have been at odds with one another.  The so-\ncalled \"seven-year schism\" resulted with the Palestine Liberation Organization  holding sway in the more moderate \nWest Bank and Hamas controlling the more extremist Palestinian elements in the Gaza Strip.  Peace talks between \nPalestinians and Israelis have been involved the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with Hamas \nessentially left out of the equation and uninterested in pursuing peace with a country it has expressly sought to \ndestroy.  Now, however, rapprochment between the two Palestinian sides was sure to augur further stress and \npressure on an already fragile United States-sponsored peace process.   \n\nNot surprisingly, on April 24, 2014, one day after the announcement of the reconciliation deal between the Palestine \nLiberation Organization and Hamas, the government of Israel decided that it would suspend the  peace talks. \nFollowing a six hour meeting of select members of the cabinet, Israel made it clear that under no circumstances \nwas it prepared to negotiate with a Palestinian administration backed by a terrorist organization, such as Hamas.   \n\nA statement dispatched by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu read as follows: \"Whoever \nchooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace.\"  The government of Israel also warned that there would be  \nretaliatory measures implemented  against the Palestinians for forming a unity government with the Gaza-based \nHamas, which has made no secret of its rejection of the State of Israel.  That statement read as such: \"Israel will \nrespond to unilateral Palestinian action with a series of measures.\"   \n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Netanyahu observed that the reconciliation deal between the Palestinians \" was signed \neven as Israel is making efforts to advance the negotiations with the Palestinians.\"  Regarding that move as a \nbetrayal of the peace process, Netanyahu added, \"It is the direct continuation of the Palestinians' refusal to advance \nthe negotiations.\"  In interviews with both BBC News and MSNBC News, Netanyahu emphasized the fact that there \nwould be no resumption of peace talks unless Abbas abandoned his pact with Hamas.  On MSNBC News, during \n\n\n\nan interview with Andrea Mitchell, Netanyahu outlined the parameters for future talks with the Palestinians, saying, \n\"I hope (Abbas) changes his mind...I will be there in the future if we have a partner that is committed to peace. Right \nnow we have a partner that has just joined another partner committed to our destruction. No-go.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that  earlier in the month of April 2014, the peace process was plunged into a stalemate when the \nPalestinians signed 15 United Nations conventions and Israel decided not to move forward with the prisoner \nrelease.  There were some suggestions that Palestinian President Abbas' decision to refocus on rapprochment with \nHamas was a tactic intended to revitalize negotiations  and force Israel into concessions.  However, Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu instead seized upon Abbas' move as a legitimate rationale for exiting the peace process \nentirely.  It was no secret that Netanyahu and the right-wing flank of the political spectrum in Israel had little \nenthusiasm for the peace process as exemplified by the \"offensive\" comments by Israeli Defense Minister Moshe \nYaalon regarding United States Secretary of State John Kerry's peace efforts (discussed above).    \n\nOn the other side of the equation, there was no sign that the Palestinians were willing to acknowledge the \ndestructive impact of the reconciliation agreement with Hamas on the peace process. Instead, Wasel Abu Yousef, a \nPalestine Liberation Organization official, rejected what he called \"Israeli and American threats.\"   \n\nA day later on April 26, 2014, Palestinian President Abbas issued a collection of confusing statements that only \nadded to the perception that he had bungled the Palestinian side of the negotiations.  He suggested that he was still \nprepared to move forward with peace talks with Israel, and insisted that his new unity government partner, Hamas, \nwould renounce violence and recognize the state of Israel.  But Hamas quickly refuted this claim, declaring that the \nmilitant entity  \"will not give any cover for any negotiations with the enemy.\" It was hardly the language of a group \ninterested in a peace process with Israel and suggested that Abbas himself was not sufficiently cognizant of the \nactual political dynamics at play.    \n\nMeanwhile, the United States appeared to be weary of the tactics and bad faith employed by both Israel and the \nPalestinians in this latest peace effort, with President Barack Obama saying that it was time for a \"pause.\"   \n\nThe collapse of the peace process was thus to be regarded as an unfortunate blow to United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry and his peace envoy, Martin Indyk, who have diligently attempted to bridge the gaps between the \ntwo sides.  At the start of the process, there was cautious optimism about the cause of advancing the peace agenda \nin the Middle East, and inching closer to achieving a two-state solution with Israel living peacefully beside an \nindependent Palestine.  Now, however, that mixture of anticipation and optimism had given way to anxiety and \ndespondency.   \n\nSpecial Report   \n\nPresident Obama announces all combat troops will withdraw from Afghanistan in 2016; outlines doctrine of \nmultilateralism and restraint on foreign policy; U.S. prisoner of war released in exchange   \n\nPresident Obama announces all combat troops will withdraw from Afghanistan in 2016; outlines doctrine of \nmultilateralism and restraint on foreign policy; U.S. prisoner of war released in exchange   \n\nOn May 27, 2014, United States President Obama announced that a complete withdrawal of American combat \ntroops from Afghanistan would be completed at the end of 2016.  That new \"date-certain\" timeline would be an \nextension of a previous 2014 exit schedule announced by President Obama in the past, but would nevertheless \nbring a conclusion to the United States military engagement in Afghanistan, which commenced following the Sept. \n11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington D.C.    \n\n\n\nPresident Obama's new schedule would call for a pullout of the majority of United States troops from Afghanistan at \nthe end of 2014, but would leave in place 9,800 troops in that country through 2015, when that number would be \nreduced by half.  The remaining troops would then be withdrawn in 2016. The new schedule, including the decision \nto keep in place a select number of combat troops through 2016 was due to the fact that President Obama wanted \nto see further training for Afghan security forces along with the ability to launch counterterrorism missions in the \ninterests of maintaining the progress made in a war that has gone on for more than a dozen years and left more \nthan 2,000 United States troops dead.   \n\nOf course, this plan would be contingent upon the signing of a new bilateral security agreement between the United \nStates and Afghanistan.  With the increasingly eccentric President Hamid Karzai at the helm in Afghanistan, there \nhas been no progress in forging such an agreement.  However, with fresh leadership in the offing following the \nconclusion of the 2014 presidential elections in Afghanistan, there were indications that a new Afghan government \nwould be highly interested in signing onto such an agreement.   \n\nIt should be noted that while liberals in the United States were frustrated that a complete exit from Afghanistan -- \nand an end to a war that had been ongoing for more than a decade -- would not come at the end of 2014, some \nRepublicans in Congress criticized President Obama's exit schedule from Afghanistan.  For conservatives, such \nas  Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte, issuing a date-certain deadline was tantamount to \nsurrender. The three Republicans issued a statement that read as follows:  \"The president's decision to set an \narbitrary date for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan is a monumental mistake and a triumph of politics \nover strategy.\"   \n\nBut President Obama was vociferous in his stance that the engagement of United States military forces in \nAfghanistan was coming to an end, and the specific mission in Afghanistan was on the verge of being completed.  \nAccording to the United States president, it was time for Afghans to take responsibility for their country. As noted by \nPresident Obama in his drawdown announcement from the White House's Rose Garden, \"We have to recognize \nthat Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America's responsibility to make it one.\"   \n\nPresident Obama made clear that significant progress had been made in the years since the 2001 terror attacks -- \na time when Afghanistan was the locus of  the terrorist Islamist group, al-Qaida.  Indeed, United States military \nforces since that time have carried out a relentless assault on the terrorist group, eliminating its leadership, and \npreventing Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven and a base for attacks against the United States.  With \nthe death of Osama bin Laden -- a perilous operation authorized by President Obama himself in 2011 -- the United \nStates president could conceivably argue that the time to exit Afghanistan had come.   However, the president was \nclearly looking towards a phased withdrawal, and one on a somewhat more protracted timeline than he had \nindicated in recent years. To this end, he said: \"Now we're finishing the job we've started.\"   \n\nAnother bone of contention for Republicans came as a result of a deal that secured the release of a United States \nprisoner of war -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl -- from Afghan militants.  Because Bergdahl was released in exchange \nfor five Afghan detainees from Guantanamo,  several Republican lawmakers attacked the administration for \n\"negotiating with terrorists.\"   \n\nHowever, as noted by National Security  Advisor Susan Rice in an interview with CBS News, Bergdahl was not \nactually a \"hostage,\" but a \"prisoner of war, taken on the battlefield,\" and that the United States had a \"sacred \nobligation\" to free such prisoners of war. In an interview with CNN, Rice also clarified that the United States did not, \nin fact, negotiate  with the Haqqani network, but with the government of Qatar, which  was responsible for holding \nthe five Afghans for a period of one year.  Rice also addressed Republicans' complaint that the Obama \nadministration did not provide Congress with the required 30-day notice required for releasing prisoners of war, \nnoting that Congress had already been notified that negotiations intended to secure Bergdahl's release were in \n\n\n\nprocess. Several member of Congress -- from across party lines -- complained that limited communications years \nprior on the matter of a prisoner exchange did not constitute a proper notification.   \n\nIt should be noted that the questionable circumstances of Begdahl's disappearance in Afghanistan fueled \naccusations that he was a military deserter and thus, undeserving of the efforts to bring him home.  In truth, \nhowever, the precise circumstances remained murky and would be the subject of military investigation, with the \npossibility of court martial, dishonorable discharge, or other legal measures in the offing.    \n\nThose pathways were yet to be taken since the immediate discussion in the American political purview was whether \nthe return of one prisoner of war was worth the release of five Afghan detainees (albeit into Qatari custody for one \nyear).  Also in the political purview was the question of  whether the negotiations brokered by the government of \nQatar, which led to the prisoner exchange deal, constituted \"negotiations with terrorists\" as alleged by many \nRepublicans.    \n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama made no apologies for the deal, saying \"I make absolutely no apologies for \nmaking sure we get a young man back to his parents.\" He continued, \"We had a prisoner of war whose health had \ndeteriorated and ... we saw an opportunity and we seized it, and I make no apologies for that.\"  In answer to the \nquestion of whether  the price of a prisoner exchange was worth the security risks posed,  especially if Bergdahl did \nturn out to be a deserter,  President Obama pointed to a guiding principle of the United States that \"we do not leave \nanybody wearing the American uniform behind\" and emphasizing, \"We don't condition whether we make the effort \nto get them back.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, with his Afghanistan exit schedule announced, President Obama used a speech to graduates at the \nUnited States Military Academy at West Point to outline his foreign policy for the remainder of his second term in \noffice.  The two key principles of the Obama doctrine of foreign policy ensconced in that speech could be \nunderstood by the words: restraint and multilateralism.    \n\nLooking to the future, President Obama wanted to see the United States work through international frameworks to \nsolve global problems, saying, \"Skeptics often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action. For them, working \nthrough international institutions, or respecting international law, is a sign of weakness. I think they're wrong.\" \nPointing to progress in using harsh international sanctions to drive Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear \nprogram, President Obama could certainly show evidence of success in this realm. While the crisis in Ukraine was \nyet to see the effects of international action, President Obama made note of the international community's largely \nunified condemnation of Russia's annexation of Crimea.   \n\nPresident Obama had a more difficult time showing how international action and multilateral venues had done much \ngood to resolve the civil war in Syria. Indeed, the United Nations -- one of the two international institutions praised \nby President Obama (the other being NATO) -- has proven to be largely ineffectual in addressing the Syrian conflict \ndue to the competing political agendas of its veto wielding permanent members of the Security Council. \nNevertheless, as noted by President Obama, multilateral negotiations and international action compelled Syria to \ndestroy its arsenal of chemical weapons.   \n\nWhile not foreclosing unilateral force in situations where vigorous diplomacy might be exhausted, President Obama \nemphasized  the strength of multilateral action and  international consensus.  He declared: \"We must broaden our \ntools to include diplomacy and development; sanctions and isolation; appeals to international law and -- if just, \nnecessary, and effective -- multilateral military action.\"  The United States president continued, \"We must do so \nbecause collective action in these circumstances is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, and less \nlikely to lead to costly mistakes.\"  Those \"costly mistakes\" were being interpreted as a reference to the Iraq war \nwaged by the previous Bush administration. Indeed, that war raised the ire of many countries across the world, was \nlargely condemned as a tragic episode of American adventurism abroad, and damaged the United States standing \ninternationally.    \n\n\n\nExplaining the United States' continued interest in Afghanistan, President Obama noted that extremism and \nterrorism remained key concerns on the national security front.  He said, \"The most direct threat to America at \nhome and abroad remains terrorism.\"  However, President Obama called for multilateral and international approach \nto addressing the threat posed by terrorism saying, \"I believe we must shift our counter-terrorism strategy -- \ndrawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan -- to more effectively partner \nwith countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold.\" He continued, \"We need a strategy that matches this \ndiffuse threat; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military thin, or stir up local \nresentments.\"   \n\nIn a rebuke to neoconservatives at home intent on going after all extremists globally, President Obama said,  \"A \nstrategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is na\u00efve and unsustainable.\"  He \ncontinued that such a heavy-handed strategy likely fueled further terrorism. As noted by President Obama,  the \nUnited States \"must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield.\"   \n\nClearly, the Obama doctrine's internationalist orientation, marked by military restraint, was a sharp departure from \nthe neoconservative path, with its hegemonic ambitions that seeks to imprint the United States stamp on the larger \nworld.  It was to be seen if his doctrine of restraint and multilateralism would present a continuing influence past \n2016 when President Obama left office, especially in a world where extremists and Jihadists continue to pose \nserious threats.  Conversely, it was to be seen if the Obama doctrine would be transposed into a fleeting \nconception, such as the Bush doctrine of \"regime change,\" which in the aftermath of that administration  has been \neschewed by a war-weary United States citizenry, tired of costly and lengthy engagements across the world.   \n\nSpecial Report:    \n\nUnited States captures top suspect in Benghazi embassy attack   \n\nIn mid-June 2014, as the result of a secret operation ordered by President Barack Obama, United States  Special \nOperations forces captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, the suspected leader of the 2012 attack on the United States' \ndiplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that  resulted in the death of  Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and other \nAmericans.  Khattala was removed from Libya and would ultimately face justice in the United States.   \n\nThe capture of Khattala was the culmination of a two-year long investigation, which was made more difficult as a \nresult of the politically tumultuous landscape in Libya.  At home in the United States, Republicans have long \nsought to make political hay of the Benghazi tragedy, trying to link it to poor handling of embassy security by the \nObama White House and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  It should be noted that a commission led by \ndiplomatic veteran, Thomas R. Pickering, and Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nconcluded that while there were \"systemic failures\" and \"management deficiencies\" by State Department officials in \nprotecting the Benghazi diplomatic mission, there was simply no evidence of a cover-up by the Obama \nadministration, as alleged by some Republicans.   \n\nThe plans for the capture of Khattala was in the works for some time but required approval from President Obama \nwhose administration wanted to ensure that all the evidence and witness testimony was intact for a successful \nprosecution in the future.  Also of concern to the Obama administration was the question of whether a United States \ncommando operation on Libyan soil would present complications for the fragile Libyan government dealing with \nongoing political chaos.  Now, however, in June 2014, President Obama made the decision to go forward with the \noperation, which -- much like the operation to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in a raid into Pakistani territory -- also \nended in success. This time, however, the suspect was apprehended alive and would face justice in the United \nStates.    \n\n\n\nA statement from the United States Pentagon made it clear that all special operations personnel had departed Libya \nsafely with Khattala in custody.  That statement read as follows:  \"All U.S. personnel involved in the operation have \nsafely departed Libya.\"    \n\nPresident Obama, for his part, noted that the capture of Khattala was a partial fulfillment of his promise to locate \nthose responsible for the attack on the United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi, and bring them to justice.  He \nsaid, \"Since the deadly attacks on our facilities in Benghazi, I have made it a priority to find and bring to justice \nthose responsible for the deaths of four brave Americans.\" Speaking of the effort by United States intelligence, law \nenforcement, and military personnel to locate and seize, President Obama said, \"Because of their courage and \nprofessionalism, this individual will now face the full weight of the American justice system.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that Dr. Susan Rice -- part of President Obama's national security team and the ambassador to \nthe United Nations at the time in 2012 -- was pilloried by Republicans for saying during interviews that the \nBenghazi embassy attack was motivated by the (aforementioned) video  that raised the ire of Muslims across the \nMiddle East.  Republicans said she was not casting the attack as terrorism even though President Obama himself \ncharacterized the Benghazi attack as such during a speech in the White House rose garden shortly after the \nbloodshed.    \n\nFast-forward two years to 2014, and in a report by the New York Times, Khattala was on the record describing the \nreasoning for the attack as being anger over the infamous video that mocked Islam.  The New York Times article \nnoted the following:  \"On the day of the attack, Islamists in Cairo had staged a demonstration outside the United \nStates Embassy there to protest an American-made online video mocking Islam, and the protest culminated in a \nbreach of the embassy's walls \u2014 images that flashed through news coverage around the Arab world. As the attack \nin Benghazi was unfolding a few hours later, Mr. Abu Khattala told fellow Islamist fighters and others that the \nassault was retaliation for the same insulting video, according to people who heard him.\"   \n\nThe article continued with this other assertion by Khattala that he was not only responsible for the attack but had \nbeen driven to take revenge for the insulting video: \"But Mr. Abu Khattala told other Libyans in private \nconversations during the night of the attack that he was moved to attack the diplomatic mission to take revenge for \nan insult to Islam in an American-made online video.\"   \n\nFor Republicans, this news would likely blunt their continued attacks on Rice, who was now President Obama's \nnational security adviser; instead, their  attention remained on lingering accusations that the White House had \nconcealed key details related to the Benghazi attack, along with displeasure that Khattala was being brought to the \nUnited States to face justice instead of being isolated at Guantanamo Bay.   \n\nU.S. general killed in Afghanistan ahead of  departure of United States troops   \n\nOn Aug. 5, 2014, an Afghan army soldier opened fire on international troops at the well-fortified  British military base \nto the west of Kabul.  The attack at Camp Qargha  resulted with the killing of a United States army general, injuries \nto a German general, and the wounding of several other soldiers.  The assailant was ultimately killed by a \nbodyguard but not before he was able to carry out his bloody assault.  While the Afghan army recruit who opened \nfire on coalition officers was not revealed to be carrying out a Taliban operation, the Islamic extremist group \nnonetheless congratulated him post-humously for his efforts to hurt coalition forces operating in Afghanistan.   \n\nThe general who died was identified as General Harold Greene --  the deputy commanding general for the \nCombined Security Transition Command, who was tasked with preparing for the withdrawal of coalition troops from \n\n\n\nAfghanistan. The death of General Harold Greene marked the highest level fatality of a member of the United \nStates military since the start of the war in Afghanistan.   \n\nSpecial Entry   \n\nU.S. strike killes leader of al-Shabab terrorist group; African peacekeeping forces make gains   \n\nJoint African peacekeeping and Somali forces were making gains against Islamist terrorist group, al-Shabaab, in \nthe southern town of Bulamareer, located close to the Islamist terrorists' stronghold of Barawe.  The joint operation \nalso saw success by recapturing territory in the surrounding areas of the Lower Shabelle region.   \n\nThe effort in late August 2014 in Bulamareer -- about 50 miles to the north of Barawe --  and the surrounding region \nwas part of an overall operation that started earlier in 2014 and had been aimed at repelling al-Shabab from towns \nwhere they have held sway.  Of particular concern had been the southern part of the country, which was largely \nbeen under al-Shabab's control.    \n\nIn recent times, al-Shabab has transformed from being a Somalia-focused Islamic insurgency into an extremist \nJihadist entity that carries out brutal terrorist attacks both at home and  in neighboring countries.  While \ninternational forces operating in Somalia have placed pressure on al-Shabab, it has aligned itself with al-Qaida, \ntaken advantage of Somalia's weak government,  and  relentlessly worked to destabilize Somalia the Horn of Africa.   \n\nAt the start of September 2014, the United States carried out air strikes in Somalia targeting the leader of al-\nShabab, Ahmed Abdi Godane. The operation used both manned and unmanned aircraft. Days after the United \nStates Pentagon confirmed the operation, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby confirmed that the \nprimary target -- Godane -- had been successfully eliminated in the strikes on an encampment and convoy of \nvehicles to the south of Mogadishu.      \n\nFor several years, Godane -- also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubair -- has stood near the top of the United States \nDepartment of State's most wanted list. He was radicalized in Sudan and Pakistan, and reportedly fought in \nAfghanistan, before becoming the al-Shabab's leader in 2008.  A year later, he officially announced al-Shabab's \nalliance and allegiance to the notorious terror enclave, al-Qaida. In 2012, the United States placed a $7 million \nbounty on his head.  In recent years, al-Shabab's activities have expanded beyond Somalia's borders to \nneighboring countries with an increasingly Islamist Jihadist agenda. Of note was the horrific terror attack at a \nKenyan shopping mall in 2013.   \n\nWhile the United States has not been known to be actively involved in operations in Somalia, it has nonetheless \nsupported African Union forces tasked with repelling al-Shabab from Mogadishu.  As well, the United States has \ngone after high value al-Shabab targets in Somalia before.  To that end,  in October 2013, United States special \nforces raided terrorist enclaves in Somalia, with the objective of going after  a  \"high value\" terrorist from al-\nShabab.  Because al-Shabab fighters responded with heavy fire, United States commandos chose to retreat from \nthe scene although there was some suggestion that one al-Shabab terrorist was killed.  It was later revealed that \nthe target of that action was Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, a Kenyan al-Shabab commander also known by the \nname \"Ikrima.\"    \n\nNow, in September 2014, the United States could claim victory for eliminating one of the world's most important \nterrorists, and specifically, the leader of al-Shabab -- Godane.  In this way, the successful strike operation struck a \nheavy blow to the al-Shabab terror group, which did not have an obvious successor to Godane.   \n\nIn Somalia, President  Hassan Sheikh Mohamed used the opportunity to urge al-Shabab to lay down arms.  He \nannounced a 45-day amnesty for terrorists aligned with the group  to renounce their association in al-Shabab.  It \nwas to be seen if al-Shabab would respond affirmatively to the offer, or simply regroup and re-emerge once again.      \n\n\n\nLast British combat troops exit Afghanistan and U.S. forces begin phased withdrawal even as Taliban continues its \nwave of violence   \n\nOn Oct. 13, 2014,  a suicide car bomber struck a convoy carrying foreign nationals along the Jalalabad Road -- a \nmajor thoroughfare in  Afghanistan's capital of Kabul upon which a United Nations housing compound and a United \nStates military base were located.  At least one person was reported to have died and several others were injured \nas a result of the attack.  The Taliban, via a spokesperson Zabihullah Majahid,  soon claimed responsibility for the \nbloodshed.  The violence was evidence that security in Afghanistan continued to be a challenge, especially given \nthe proposed exit of international troops from Afghanistan.   \n\nLess than a week later on Oct. 18, 2014, those security challenges were illustrated by two deadly attacks by the \nTaliban  in Afghanistan.  Logar province in eastern Afghanistan was the site of one incident of violence where \nTaliban terrorists targeted security posts, killing at least four soldiers. Ghor province in central Afghanistan was the \nvenue for the second incidence of bloodshed when as many as 500 Taliban terrorists attacked two villages.  The \nlevel of casualties were unknown at the time of writing but promised to be disturbing. The attacks underlined the \nchallenges posed in rescuing Afghanistan from the threat of terrorism, especially with a withdrawal of United States \ntroops from the country in the offing.   \n\nIn late October 2014, United States and United Kingdom forces exited their main military bases in Helmand \nprovince, effectively turning security over to Afghan forces.  While the complete withdrawal of United States forces \nwould not ensue until 2016, a phased draw-down was certainly taking place and would continue over the course of \nthe next year.  At the same time, this particular exit from Helmand  was significant for the United Kingdom as it \nmarked the withdrawal of the last British combat forces from Afghanistan after being in the Afghan combat zone for \nmore than a decade.  For its part, the Afghan military said that it was prepared to take responsibility for the security \nof the country, pointing to the fact that increasingly, support from United States and United Kingdom forces had \nbecome more psychological than in the battlefield.   \n\nU.S. and South African hostages killed after failed rescue attempt in Yemen   \n\nIn the latter part of 2014, United States and South African hostages were killed following a failed rescue attempt by \nUnited States SEAL Team 6 special forces in the  southern province of Shabwah in Yemen.  The rescue operation \nwas actually launched to rescue  Luke Somers, a United States photojournalist, who was being held by al-Qaida in \nYemen.  United States forces were unaware that Somers was being held along with a South African national, Pierre \nKorkie.  Both men were killed by their al-Qaida captors as the rescue effort unfolded.   \n\nSouth African sources said that the timing was unfortunate since there was a clandestine effort underway to pay a \nransom to secure Korkie's release.  However, United States sources noted that they were unaware of that Korkie \nwas being held with Somers, or that there was a South African relief organization's plan afoot to secure his release \nby paying a ransom.  Instead, they were focused on the rescue operation, which was authorized by President \nBarack Obama because of prevailing fears that Somers' life was in \"imminent danger.\"   \n\nWhile the operation by United States special forces ended in failure and the loss of life, the United States defended \nits policy of trying to rescue hostages held by Islamic militants.  The United States also defended its policy of \nneither  negotiating with terrorists, nor paying ransoms to kidnappers, both of which the United States has said only \nfacilitates further acts of terrorism.  A statement by President Obama read as follows: \"As this and previous hostage \nrescue operations demonstrate, the United States will spare no effort to use all of its military, intelligence and \ndiplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely, wherever they are located.\"   \n\nU.S. air strike kills al-Shabab militant   \n\n\n\nNote that at the end of December 2014, United States air strikes in Somalia reportedly targeted and  killed an al-\nShabab leader. Abdishakur, who was  also known as Tahliil, led the Amniyat  unit of the terror group deemed to be \nresponsible for a spate of suicide attacks in Mogadishu.   \n\nNATO formally ends its 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan   \n\nThe close of 2014 marked the conclusion of NATO's 13-year long combat mission in Afghanistan, which began in \nlate 2001 following the horrific terror attacks by al-Qaida on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United \nStates.  While the NATO combat mission had come to an end, a residual force of approximately 12,000 NATO \ntroops were expected to remain in Afghanistan as part of a non-combat operation.  The new operation, referred to \nas \"Resolute Support,\" was set to begin on Jan. 1, 2015, and  was aimed at supporting local Afghan troops. As the \nNATO flag for the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) was lowered during a ceremony marking the \noccasion in the Afghan capital of Kabul, mission commander General John Campbell paid tribute to the United \nStates-led NATO effort, saying, \"We have lifted the Afghan people out of the darkness of despair and given them \nhope for the future.\"  Meanwhile,  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg released a statement that read as \nfollows: \"The security of Afghanistan will be fully in the hands of the country's 350,000 Afghan soldiers and police. \nBut Nato allies, together with many partner nations, will remain to train, advise and assist them.\" The task ahead for \nlocal Afghan troops would be formidable with 2014 being marked as a particularly bloody year in the war against the \nTaliban and other Islamist extremists in the region.      \n\nUnited States slaps sanctions on North Korea in response to alleged cyber-attack on Sony   \n\nAt the start of 2015, the United States imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to an alleged cyber-\nattack on  Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Of note was the fact that United States sanctions against North Korea \nwere already in place as a result of Pyongyang's provocative and dangerous nuclear program.  This new tranche of \nsanctions was being imposed as a retributive  measure promised by the Obama White House in response to a \ncyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government charged was carried out by agents of North \nKorea. While some cyber-experts have cast doubts on the claim that North Korea was behind the cyber-attack, the \nUnited States government has held steadfastly to that claim.    \n\nThe cyber-attack on Sony Pictures began when the so-called Guardians of Peace hacked and released data from \nSony's computers, exposing embarrassing electronic mail correspondence. The group soon took its attack to new \nheights, threatening theaters intending to screen Sony's satirical comedy, The Interview, which featured a \nhumorous assassination plot against the leader of North Korea. Those threats caused Sony to cancel its cinema \nrelease of the movie, ultimately earning the rebuke of United States President Obama who suggested that decision \nby Sony was \"a mistake.\"  To that end, Sony later reversed its decision and   \nreleased the film in some theaters and in online formats.   \n\nMeanwhile, North Korea's response to the hacking drama plaguing Sony was confusing.  Powers in that country at \nfirst praised the cyber-attack, casting it as a \"righteous deed,\"  and even implying it might be the work of its own \nagents; later,  they denied culpability altogether.  However, as noted above, the United States made clear that it \nplaced the blame for the Sony cyber-attack on North Korea, with Obama administration officials warning of  a \n\"proportional response\" in the offing.   \n\nBy late 2014, there was speculation that a disruption or \"blackout\" of Internet service in North Korea may have been \npart of the package of consequences promised by the Obama administration against North Korea.  However, the \nUnited States government refused to acknowledge whether or not it was responsible for cutting off Internet \nconnectivity in North Korea.    \n\n\n\nBy contrast, at the start of 2015, the Treasury Department in the United States was utterly forthright  when it publicly \nnamed  three entities as well as 10 North Korean government officials in its  sanctions announcement.  The United \nStates Treasury's list of targets included  individuals working in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia. The three \nentities covered by the sanctions were as follows: The Reconnaissance General Bureau -- North Korea's primary \nintelligence organization; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid) -- North Korea's primary \narms dealer; and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation -- a defense research  agency.  It should be noted that the \ntargets of the new sanctions were not necessarily linked to the cyber-hacking attack on Sony Pictures.  Instead, it \nappeared that the United States was simply augmenting its sanctions regime already in place against North Korea.  \nThe intent was to isolate North Korea's defense industry as a deterrent against future cyber-attacks.   \n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Jan. 2, 2015, officializing the sanctions, while \nthe White House released a statement that read as follows:  \"We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to \ncreate destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of \nrestricting their right to free expression. Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.\"  The White House \nadded,  \"This step reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to hold North Korea accountable for its \ndestabilizing, destructive and repressive actions, particularly its efforts to undermine U.S. cyber-security and \nintimidate U.S. businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech.\"    \n\nU.S. President delivers annual State of the Union address to joint session of Congress   \n\nPresident Barack Obama delivered his annual State of the Union address on Jan. 20, 2015. For the first time since \nbecoming president,  Barack Obama was able to say in his annual report to a joint session of Congress that the \nstate of the union was strong.  His opening remarks were as follows:   \n\n\"Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since \n1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating \nthan ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as \nwe've been in almost 30 years. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six \nyears ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And \nwe salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us \nsafe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard \nwork required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the \nState of the Union is strong.\"   \n\nOn the economy, the president took something of a victory lap, reminding Americans that the United States was in \nbetter shape than its allies across the Atlantic and elsewhere.  To this end, he said, \"Since 2010, America has put \nmore people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.\"  Still President Obama \nargued for key moves in the economic arena including the need for need affordable, high-quality childcare, which \nhe insisted was not a woman's issue but a \"national economic priority.\" The president also demanded that the \nminimum wage be raised, saying, \"I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on \nless than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\"   \n\nOn energy security, the president paid homage to significant energy strides, saying: \"And today, America is number \none in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power \nas we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year \nshould save $750 at the pump.\"   \n\nOn foreign policy, in a rebuke to the neoconservative policy of his predecessor George W. Bush, which landed the \nUnited States in a protracted war in Iraq, President Obama advocated for a smart approach.  He said, \"When we \nmake rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads... then we risk getting drawn into \nunnecessary conflicts... I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military \n\n\n\npower with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind \nus to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That's exactly what we're doing right now \u2013 and around the \nglobe, it is making a difference.\"   \n\nChampioning his smart sanctions approach to dealing with Russian aggression, President Obama delivered a \nreproach to his Republican critics, saying, \"Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along \nwith our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, \ntoday, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in \ntatters.\"   \n\nPresident Obama also highlighted his landmark shift in policy towards Cuba, as the United States persued re-\nengagement with that country, saying, \"In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  \nWhen what you're doing doesn't work for fifty years, it's time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has \nthe potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; \nstands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.\"   \n\nThe president also reserved the right to continue to go after terrorists across the globe, asserting the following: \"We \nwill continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as \nwe've done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.\"    \n\nOn the environment, President Obama swept away the conservative objections to addressing climate change as he \ndeclared: \"2014 was the planet's warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does \u2013 14 \nof the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I've heard some folks try to \ndodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists; that we don't have enough information to act.  Well, I'm not a \nscientist, either.  But you know what \u2013 I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major \nuniversities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we \ndo not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, \nand massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon \nsays that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.\"   \n\nThese aspects aside, the line of the night came when President Obama noted that he would not be running again \nfor office.  Republicans reacted with laughter, cheers and applause , but the president ad libbed a zinger that was \nnot included in the transcript, as prepared for delivery. The president quipped: \"I have no more campaigns to run... I \nknow because I won both of them.\"   \n\nA full transcript of the State of the Union -- as prepared for delivery -- can be found at the White House website: \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov /the-press-office/2015/01/20/remarks-president-state-union-address-january-20-2015   \n\nNote: Freshman Senator Jodi Ernst of Iowa delivered the Republican response.   \n\nUnited Kingdom and United States announce plans for counter-terrorism cooperation   \n\nDuring a state visit to the United States, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron  joined his American \ncounterpart, President  Barack Obama, in announcing a plan for counter-terrorism cooperation.  Among the \nmeasures to be implemented were the establishment of a counter-terrorism  task force and the deployment of more \ndrones aimed at targeting the terror group, Islamic State. In the effort to track terrorists, the two leaders were \nadvocating greater cooperation with technology companies, with an eye on accessing encrypted communications \nthat terrorists may use to plot attacks.   \n\n\n\nThe leaders of the two countries emphasized the closeness of the trans-Atlantic partnership, with both men offering \nfulsome assurances of their personal friendship as well as the strength and depth of the United Kingdom-United \nStates alliance.  Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama made clear that their two countries were committed \nto sharing information, intelligence, and expertise in the effort to prevent Islamist radicalism and to address \"violent \nextremism\" in their respective countries.   \n\nSpeaking of the threat posed by Islamist terrorists in the wake of the Paris attacks, Prime Minister Cameron noted \nthat his country, along with the United States,  faced a \"poisonous and fanatical ideology.\"  He said: \"We face a \npoisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert one of the world's major religions, Islam, and create conflict, \nterror and death. With our allies we will confront it wherever it appears.\"  President Obama struck a similar tone, \nsaying that his country would work with the United Kingdom and other allies \"seamlessly to prevent attacks and \ndefeat these terrorist networks.\"  Explaining the challenge posed by radicalized extremists who carry out acts of \nterror, he said \"This is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction. But it is one that \nultimately we are going to defeat.\"   \n\nU.S. President Obama and Indian PM Modi announce new era in bilateral friendship and cooperation   \n\nDuring his official visit to the world's largest democracy -- India -- United States President Barack Obama planted a \ntree and  laid a wreath at  the memorial for Mahatma Gandhi at Raj Ghat in New Delhi.  Paying his respects to the \nfather of independent India, President Obama paused for contemplation at Gandhi's memorial, and placed  two \nhandfuls of rose petals on top. President Obama  also was the main guest at India's Republic Day celebrations \nwhere he was warmly received by the enthusiastic Indian people.   \n\nIt should be noted that Indian Prime Minister Modi broke protocol to personally receive President Obama and First \nLady Michelle Obama as they arrived at the airport in New Dehli.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed  President \nObama's historic visit, noting that India and the United States were now  embarking on a \"new journey\" of \ncooperation.  President Obama struck a similar tone, saying that his country welcomed its friendship with India.   \n\nIn the realm of foreign relations, on Jan. 25, 2015, President Obama issued a joint announcement with Indian Prime \nMinister Modi on  civilian nuclear cooperation.  At issue was a  breakthrough pact that would facilitate the supply of \nAmerican civilian nuclear technology to India.  Also on the agenda were new renewable energy options.  United \nStates Ambassador  Richard Verma said: \"It opens the door for US and other companies to come forward and \nactually help India towards developing nuclear power and support its non carbon-based energy production.\"  The \nUnited States and India also agreed to cooperate on fighting terrorism.   \n\nAt the start of February 2015, Indian oficials said that the \"breakthrough\" civilian nuclear deal could be finalized later \nin the year. United States officials have said that two items were pending before the agreement could be finalized:  \n1. India would have to ratify a United Nations nuclear convention -- the International Atomic Energy Agency's \nConvention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC); and 2. An insurance concord would have \nto be established preventing suppliers from being subject to draconian lawsuits in the event of nuclear disasters.   \n\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Johnson warns of threat to Western shopping centers by Somalia-based terror \ngroup al-Shabab   \n\nOn Feb. 22, 2015, United States Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a warning to Westerners \nregarding possible attacks on shopping centers by the Somalia-based terror group, al-Shabab.  At issue was the \nemergence of a videotaped message from al-Shabab urging its supporters to carry out attacks at shopping malls in \nthe United States, Canada, and the United States.  An al-Sahab terrorist with a British accent specifically mentioned \nthree large shopping malls -- the Mall of America in Minnesota, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, and Oxford \nStreet in London -- as desirable targets of attack.    \n\n\n\nOf significance was the fact that al-Shabab had already carried out a horrific and brutal massacre at the Westgate  \nshopping mall in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi in 2013, killing close to 70 people.  Given this record of bloodthirsty \nviolence, the United States homeland security chief was taking this new threat from al-Shabab seriously.  In an \ninterview with CNN, Secretary Johnson said, \"Anytime a terrorist organisation calls for an attack on a specific \nplace, we've got to take that seriously.\"  He further noted that there was a  \"new phase\" of terrorism looming in \nwhich attacks would increasingly come from \"independent actors in their homelands.\"   \n\nFBI  arrests two Uzbeks and one Kazakh national of seeking to join Islamic State and plotting to kill President \nObama   \n\nIn the last week of February 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in United States arrested and charged \nthree foreign nationals with  conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.  According to \nthe criminal compaint,  the three men sought to join the notorious terror group, Islamic State.  The criminal \ncomplaint also alleged that the  three men had determined that if they were unable to travel to Syria to join Islamic \nState,  they would shift their focus and carry out attacks in the United States, including the attempted \nassassination of  President Barack Obama.    \n\nThe men -- Abdurasul Juraboev and Abror Habibov of Uzbekistan, and Akhror Saidakhmetov of Kazakhstan, came \nto the attention of federal authorities due to their postings on a Uzbek language website.  Federal agents said that \nJuraboev purchased an airplane ticket to travel from New York to Istanbul, presumably with the intent of traveling \non to Syria where he intended to join Islamic State.  But Juraboev was also accused of conspiring to carry out the \npossible assassination of the United States leader, as illustrated by his posting to an Uzbek-language website, \nwhich read as follows: \"I am in USA now but we don't have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as \ndedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? \nThat will strike fear in the hearts of infidels.\"  Meanwhile,  Saidakhmetov was likewise accused of intending to join \nthe notorious terror group, while also plotting attacks on the United States homeland.   In a conversation with an \ninformant, Saidakhmetov was reported to have said, \"We will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot \none police officer. Boom ... Then we will go the FBI headquarters, kill the FBI People.\" Saidakhmetov  was  arrested \nat John F Kennedy International Airport in New York  as he tried to board a flight bound for Turkey, allegedly en \nroute to Syria where he would join Islamic State. The charges against Habibov involved providing material \nassistance  to Saidakhmeto.   \n\nEach of the three defendants, if convicted, faced  a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.  In her announcement \nof the arrests, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Loretta Lynch, warned that the threat of \nforeign nationals posing a threat to the United States and its allies was a growing one.  Lynch, who was President \nObama's nominee to replace outgoing Eric Holder as the United States new attorney general, said, \"The flow of \nforeign fighters to Syria represents an evolving threat to our country and to our allies.\"   \n\nSpecial Entry: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea brutally attacked; North Korea calls the violence justified   \n\nIn the first week of March 2015, United States Ambassador Mark Lippert was brutally attacked by a pro-North \nKorean activist in the South Korean capital of Seoul.    \n\nAmbassador Lippert, who was serving as the United States envoy to South Korea, was attending a breakfast aimed \nat a discussion of the reunification of the two Koreas. During the breakfast, the assailant pushed Lippert onto a \ntable and slashed his face with a knife, seriously injuring him.  The ambassador was then rushed to the hospital and \n\n\n\nendured 80 stitches and several hours of surgery to close his facial wound. South Korean doctors later said that \nLippert narrowly survived the injury.   \n\nThe assailant was soon identified as as pro-North Korean activist,  Kim Ki-jong, who was known to authorities due \nto a previous attempt to attack Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie, for which he received only a suspended \nsentence. As well, there was a long record of Kim Ki-jong's participation in anti-American protests.   In South Korea, \nactivists with pro-Pyongyang sensibilities are few in number; however, they hold passionate beliefs about the \ncontribution of foreign powers to the divisions between the Koreas.      \n\nSouth Korean  President Park Guen-hye condemned what she cast as an \"attack on the South Korea-U.S. \nalliance.\"  However, the incident did not reflect well on her, the South Korean government, or South Korean security \nauthorities. Indeed, there were vital questions arising about (1) the level of security at the high-level breakfast, and \n(2) the fact that the assailant -- with his known history -- was not only free, but permitted to attend a diplomatic \nbreakfast attended by high ranking officials.   \n\nMeanwhile, North Korea entered the fray, lauding the act of violence and characterizing it as \"just punishment for \nU.S. warmongers.\"  On behalf of the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that his country  would \nnot be \"intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.\"  For his part, \nAmbassador Lippert exhibited great resilience, writing after surgery via the social media outlet, Twitter,   \"Doing well \nand in great spirits... Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!\"      New exit schedule \nfrom Afghanistan announced    \n\nOn a visit to the United States to meet with President Barack Obama in the spring of 2015, Afghan President Ashraf \nGhani signaled a sea change in relations between the two countries as he visited the tomb of the unknown soldier \nto pay tribute to the lives of American soldiers lost in the war in Afghanistan.  Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai \ngained notoriety for his sharp criticism for  United States troops in Afghanistan who ironically helped to liberate his \ncountry from the Taliban. Indeed, it was only as a result of international intervention and support that the path was \npaved for the very democratic government in Afghanistan that Karzai  would eventually lead.  Karzai often displayed \nerratic behavior, attacking the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan to stabilize his country, threatening to join \nthe Taliban, and refusing to sign a  bilateral security  agreement  with the United States.   \n\nIn a joint news conference with President Obama, President Ghani -- who immediately signed the bilateral security  \nagreement upon coming to power in 2014, made a point of thanking United States soldiers for their efforts to secure \nAfghanistan. President Ghani also went so far as to thank United States tax payers for their contributions to the \nstabilization of Afghanistan.  Moreover, President Ghani  thanked Secretary of State John Kerry, working on behalf \nof the Obama admin, for his unflagging diplomatic efforts to reach a reconciliation deal after the controversial \nelections of 2014. Those elections left Ghani in a power struggle with his rival, Abdullah Abdullah.  However, a \nKerry-forged agreement that officialized GHani as president and Abdullah as chief executive was credited for \nrescuing Afghanistan from the brink of political crisis, and has since left Afghans regarding the United States' top \ndiplomat as a hero of sorts.   \n\nThe visit by Ghani was also marked by foreign policy business, as President Obama announced an adjustment to \nthe United States' existing withdrawal schedule from Afghanistan. President Barack Obama's stated (read: existing) \nexit schedule called for a withdrawal of the majority of United States troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014, but \nleft in place 9,800 troops in that country through 2015, when over the course of that year,  the number would be \nreduced by half to 4,900.  The remaining troops would then be withdrawn in 2016.  Now, in March 2015, President \nObama was  responding for a request by President Ghani for continued United States engagement in Afghanistan.  \nThat new adjusted schedule  would hold the current deployment of 9,800 troops in place in Afghanistan through the \nend of 2015, and would outline a new phased withdrawal schedule through 2016, with any remaining troops at the \n\n\n\nend of 2016 tasked with securing the Kabul embassy.  In effect, the \"bones\" of the 2016 exit schedule remained in \nplace, but the pace of withdrawal was now changed, with the lion's share of the movement occuring in 2016.   \n\nA White House statement on the matter read as follows: \"Based on President Ghani's request for flexibility in the \nU.S. drawdown timeline, the U.S. will maintain its current posture of 9,800 troops through the end of 2015. The \nspecific trajectory of the 2016 U.S. troop drawdown will be established later in 2015 to enable the U.S. troop \nconsolidation to a Kabul-based embassy presence by the end of 2016.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that on March 25, 2015, while President Ghani was in the United States, a suicide attack rocked \nthe Afghan capital of Kabul.  The blast occurred in the Muradkhani district of Kabul close to the presidential palace, \nthe defense ministry, and the finance ministry.  Seven people were reported to have died and more than 20 others \nwere wounded as a result of the attack.   \n\nEditor's Note   \n\nPresident Barack Obama's blueprint for the exit of United States troops in Afghanistan called for the withdrawal of \nthe majority of troops at the end of 2014,  but left in place 9,800 troops in that country through 2015, when over the \ncourse of that year,  the number would be reduced by half to 4,900.  The remaining troops would then be withdrawn \nin 2016.   \n\nIt should be noted that while liberals in the United States were frustrated that a complete exit from Afghanistan -- \nand an end to a war that had been ongoing for more than a decade -- did not come at the end of 2014, some \nRepublicans in Congress criticized President Obama's exit schedule from Afghanistan.  For conservatives, such \nas  Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte, issuing a date-certain deadline was tantamount to \nsurrender. The three Republicans issued a statement that read as follows:  \"The president's decision to set an \narbitrary date for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan is a monumental mistake and a triumph of politics \nover strategy.\" But President Obama was vociferous in his stance that the engagement of United States military \nforces in Afghanistan was coming to an end, and the specific mission in Afghanistan was on the verge of being \ncompleted.  According to the United States president, it was time for Afghans to take responsibility for their country. \nAs noted by President Obama in his drawdown announcement from the White House's Rose Garden, \"We have to \nrecognize that Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America's responsibility to make it one.\"   \n\nPresident Obama made clear that significant progress had been made in the years since the 2001 terror attacks -- \na time when Afghanistan was the locus of  the terrorist Islamist group, al-Qaida.  Indeed, United States military \nforces since that time have carried out a relentless assault on the terrorist group, eliminating its leadership, and \npreventing Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven and a base for attacks against the United States.  With \nthe death of Osama bin Laden -- a perilous operation authorized by President Obama himself in 2011 -- the United \nStates president could conceivably argue that the time to exit Afghanistan had come.   However, the president was \nclearly looking towards a phased withdrawal, and one on a somewhat more protracted timeline than he had \nindicated in recent years. To this end, he said: \"Now we're finishing the job we've started.\"   \n\nIn October 2014, progress was being made in the effort to \"finish the job\" as United States and United Kingdom \nforces exited their main military bases in Helmand province, turning security over to Afghan forces.  While the \ncomplete withdrawal of United States forces would not take place until 2016, a phased drawdown was certainly \ntaking place. Meanwhile, this particular exit would mark the withdrawal of the last British combat forces from \nAfghanistan.   \n\nIn November 2014, President Obama  authorized United States troops to continue their combat operations against \nTaliban and other Islamist terrorist militants in Afghanistan, if they threatened either American forces or the Afghan \ngovernment. The order also authorized the use of United States air support for  Afghan combat missions.  \n\n\n\nMoreover, the United States made clear that it would deploy an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan to deal with \nthe security threat if needed.   \n\nIn March 2015, President Obama  responded to a request by the newly-elected President Ghani for continued \nUnited States engagement in Afghanistan, under the aegis of a new bilateral security agreement, and  with an \nadjusted withdrawal schedule.  That new adjusted schedule  would hold the current deployment of 9,800 troops in \nplace in Afghanistan through the end of 2015, and would outline a new phased withdrawal schedule through 2016, \nwith any remaining troops at the end of 2016 tasked with securing the Kabul embassy.  In effect, the structure of the \n2016 exit schedule  would be maintained, but the pace of withdrawal was now changed, with most redeployment \noccuring in 2016.   \n\nThe schedule, including the decision to keep in place a select number of combat troops through 2016, was due to \nthe fact that President Obama wanted to see further training for Afghan security forces along with the ability to \nlaunch counterterrorism missions in the interests of maintaining the progress made in a war that had gone on for \nmore than a dozen years and left more than 2,000 United States troops dead.   \n\nNote: To date, more than 2,000 American and approximately 450 British soldiers have died in the war in \nAfghanistan that began in late 2001.    \n\nCrisis in Ukraine: Pro-Russians consolidating territory while Ukrainian forces  under pressure; fresh attempt at \ndiplomatic resolution   \n\nSummary:   \n\nTurbulence and turmoil has characterized the landscape in Ukraine. Tensions initially flared in late 2013 in \nresponse to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision not to move forward with a pending association \nagreement with the European Union.  That decision brought more than 100,000 protesters to the streets to rally \nagainst what they saw as Ukraine's movement towards greater control by Russia.  Indeed, the general consensus \nwas that President Yanukovych had bent to pressure by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to step away from the \nEuropean Union Association Agreement and instead embrace a customs union with Russia.   \n\nBy the start of 2014, another flare of protests ensued in Ukraine in response to legislation passed by members of \nparliament loyal to President Yanukovych. The laws at stake were intended to curb the free expression of political \nopposition and curtail public protests.  The passage of such legislation raised the ire of Ukrainians, particularly \nthose aligned with the opposition, and alarmed the West  with the United States and European Union worried about \nthe Ukraine's slide into autocracy under Yanukovych.  In a twist of irony, the very laws intended to suppress mass \naction actually spurred exactly that end as mass protests attracting tens of thousands of  people once again rocked \nUkraine.  As January 2014 entered its final week, concessions by President Yanukovych to include members of the \nopposition in government yielded no positive results.  Instead, the unrest spread to the eastern part of the country.  \nWith the situation deteriorating, the prime minister and the government resigned, and the Ukrainian parliament \nrepealed the controversial anti-protest laws.   \n\nIn mid-February 2014, the turmoil re-ignited as police tried to clear the main protest camp.  Ukraine was again \nthrust into a renewed state of turbulence and turmoil. A truce was forged on Feb. 19, 2014, but only after more than \ntwo dozen people died.  That truce collapsed a day later, effectively returning the capital city of Kiev to a battle zone \nand leading to an increasing death toll.  Yet another agreement was forged in which the president conceded to \nmany of the demands of the opposition.  But the deal appeared to have come to late to appease an enraged \npopulace.  By Feb. 22, 2014,  President Yanukovych had fled to the eastern part of the country while his party \nabandoned him and joined the opposition to officially impeach him, while his political nemesis - former Prime \nMinister Tymoshenko - was freed from captivity.   \n\n\n\nThe move was a clear message to Moscow that Ukraine would not be controlled by Russia and that Ukraine instead \nwas looking toward Europe as it charted its future path.  Indeed, to the chagrin of Russia, the new interim president \nof Ukraine declared the country would pursue closer ties with the European Union.  The winds of change had swept \nacross Ukraine with the \"Maidan\" or Independence Square stamped in the history books as \"Ground Zero\" of \nUkraine's 2014 battleground.   \n\nBut the celebration in Ukraine did not last long. The battleground terrain shifted eastward at the start of March 2014 \nwhen the Russian parliament granted Russian President Putin authorization to use force in Ukraine, and Russian \nforces annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.  Clearly, Putin and Russia felt entitled to reclaim their foothold in \nUkraine, thus recalling alarming memories  for the rest of the world of the Soviet invasion of then-Czechoslovakia in \n1968  to subdue the independence-minded Prague Spring.  Adding to the crisis was the perplexing decision by \nRussian President Putin to refuse to acknowledge that Russian troops were even in Crimea.   \n\nIn response to Russia's actions against Ukraine, and particularly in the direction of controlling Crimea, the G7 \ncountries (G8 minus Russia) pulled out of preparations for the G8 summit set to take place in Russia and the United \nStates  instituted targeted sanctions against Russian officials.   \n\nTalks aimed at resolving the crisis yielded no results.  Indeed, an East-West conflict was intensifying as  Crimea \nscheduled a referendum  for mid-March 2014 when residents would decide whether or not to join Russia.  A \nmeeting between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Kerry  ended in failure. \nBecause Russia viewed the overthrow of Yanukovych as illegal, and because the West viewed Crimea's decision to \njoin Russia was in violation of international law,  an impasse was at hand.   \n\nThe United States  and the European Union respectively warned that such a unilateral action would run counter to \ninternational law, and thus they would not recognize the likely ratification of Crimean unification with Russia.  For its \npart, Ukraine insisted that it would not accept the fracturing of its territorial integrity.   \n\nMeanwhile, the West attempted to condemn Crimea's secession referendum, and issue its support for Ukraine's \nsovereignty,  by moving forward with a resolution in the United Nations Security Council.  As expected, Russia -- as \na veto-wielding permanent member -- vetoed the draft.  Every other Security Council member voted in favor of the \nmeasure, with the exception of China, which abstained from the vote.  The inaction at the Security Council was \nreminiscent of the Cold war era in which both sides habitually vetoed the other's measures, essentially creating a \nstate of diplomatic paralysis.   \n\nOn March 16, 2014, ethnic Russians in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and unite with \nRussia.  Crimea then officially requested that the \"Republic of Crimea\" be admitted as a new subject to the Russian \nFederation.   On the Russian side of the equation, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign entity.  Russian \nPresident Putin soon responded by officially annexing Crimea.   \n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed  personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials.  This \npunitive action was intended as a rebuke against the actions in Crimea; however, there was no sign that Russia \nwas even slightly daunted by its decision to seize control of a territory belonging to Ukraine under the established \nsystem of international jurisprudence.  As stated above, Russia justified its moves by asserting that the interim post-\nYanukovych government in Ukraine was illegitimate.   \n\nRussian ambitions to regain territory lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union soon entered into the equation.  \nOf note was the fact that in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russian attention was glancing towards \nother parts of eastern Ukraine.  Eruptions of unrest in this Russian-speaking part of Ukraine were blamed on \nRussia, and reminiscent of what had transpired in Crimea.  Indeed, Ukraine was accusing Russia of carrying out its \nCrimea formula by  orchestrating unrest further into Ukrainian territory.   \n\n\n\nIt was to be seen if the landscape in eastern Europe in the spring of 2014 represented the foundation for a renewed \nCold War between the East and West.  It was also possible that President Barack Obama of the United States was \ncorrect in dismissing such a notion on the basis of the fact that Russia was no longer a super power and, instead, a \nregional power acting as a bully against its neighbors.   \n\nNote that a presidential election was held in Ukraine on May 25, 2014. Petro Poroshenko claimed victory in \nUkraine's  presidential contest but turmoil continued to rock Ukraine.  Entering the fray at the start of June 2014, \nNATO moved to bolster its security presence in eastern Europe as a deterrent against Russian aggression.   \n\nIn June and July 2014, Ukrainian forces made some progress in retaking the rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine, \nwhile the United States intensified its sanctions against Russian companies as a punitive measure against Russia \nfor failing to de-escalate the conflict.   \n\nThe landscape in eastern Ukraine took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft \ntraveling from Netherlands to Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 \nairliner perished when Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed in the rebel-held territory of Donesk close to the Russian \nborder. That event augured a geopolitical landmine as Ukraine said the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down and \nplaced the blame on pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces.  The tragedy of the Malaysian Airlines flight \noccurred one day after the Obama administration in the United States unveiled harsh punitive sanctions against \nmajor Russian firms aligned with Russian President Putin.   \n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, and because the majority of the victims with \nDutch nationals, Europe's stance against Russia hardened.  Accordingly,  the West -- including the United States \nand the European Union --  intensified its sanctions regime against Russia.   \n\nMeanwhile, in August 2014,  Ukrainian forces at first held the momentum in the fight to regain control over the pro-\nRussian eastern part of the country, particularly in separatist strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.  However, \nRussian-backed separatists were vigorously defending what they viewed as their own territory later in the month.  \nBy the close of August 2014,  NATO said that Russian forces had violated Ukraine's territory while the Ukrainian \npresident warned that his country was on the brink of war with Russia.   \n\nAt the start of September 2014, NATO announced a rapid reaction force as well as military exercises in eastern \nEurope.  Pressure from NATO and the threat of fresh sanctions by the European Union appeared to have spurred \npro-Russian separatists to go to the negotiating table with Ukrainian authorities.  There, a fragile truce was soon \nestablished but sporadically violated as fighting continued in Donetsk and Luhansk, and as Ukrainian forces fought \nto hold the port city of Mariupol.   \n\nIn September 2014, with the ceasefire still in effect, Ukraine concentrated on the process of trying to retain its \nterritorial integrity while meeting the needs of the pro-Russian separatists. To that end, Ukraine unveiled a proposal \nthat would convey \"special status\" for eastern part of country, conveying greater autonomy.  Meanwhile, the \nUkrainian parliament advanced its pro-Western orientation by ratifying the Association Agreement with European \nUnion (the basis of the uprising that caused the ousting of Yanukovych in the first place), while Ukrainian President \nPoroshenko unveiled a package of reforms aimed at securing membership in the European Union.   \n\nBy October 2014, Russian President  Putin was calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian border.  \nHowever, NATO was warning that there was no sign of Russian troops actually retreating from the border in any \nsignificant fashion; as well, Russian forces remained active within Ukraine in violation of that country's sovereignty.  \nUkrainian President Poroshenko viewed the strong election performance of allied pro-Western parties as a \nratification of, and a mandate for, his security plans for eastern Ukraine.  However, that eastern portion of the \ncountry was moving forward with illegal elections of their own, which were rejected by Ukraine and the larger \ninternational community, but which were (unsurprisingly) being backed by Russia.   \n\n\n\nBy November 2014, fighting had erupted in the east, there were reports of a build up of pro-Russian reinforcements \nthere, and it was fair to say that the fragile ceasefire that had been in place since September 2014 was on the brink \nof collapse.   \n\nDecember 2014 saw a prisoner exchange occur between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. \nAs well, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that he intended to meet with his Russian, French, and German \ncounterparts in early 2015 for discussions on the restoration of peace in the eastern part of the country.  These \nactions were regarded as positive steps in the arena of regional relations.  However, Ukraine's decision to revoke \nits neutral status -- a move that could potentially facilitate future NATO membership -- was likely to raise the ire of \nRussia, which has opposed Ukraine's westward drift from the onset.  Ironically, it was Russia's own aggressive \ninterventions in eastern Ukraine, particularly marked by the annexation of Crimea, that actually catalyzed Ukraine's \nhaste to move out of Russia's orbit.   \n\nAt the start of 2015, the Minsk ceasefire agreement was effectively dead as fighting resumed around Donetsk and \nas pro-Russian separatists carried out an assault on the strategic port city of Mariupol, prompting Ukrainian \nPresident Poroshenko to warn that his forces would not bend to pro-Russian rebels and that Ukraine would protect \nits sovereignty.  Fighting had extended to other areas in Ukraine's east as pro-Russian separatists aggressively \nsought to consolidate control over what they have termed \"New Russia.\"   \n\nAs the month of February 2015 began, there were reports that the Obama administration in the United States was \nconsidering additional support for Ukrainian forces in protecting Ukraine from the pro-Russian offensive.  As well, \nNATO was considering the establishment of special command units in eastern Europe to respond rapidly to threats \nin the region.   \n\nNote that on Feb. 12, 2015, a new Minsk ceasefire agreement and a roadmap for peace were forged. But later in \nFebruary 2015, peace in eastern Ukraine remained elusive as pro-Russians took control over the town of \nDebaltseve and forced  Ukrainian forces into retreat.  Pro-Russian forces were reportedly attacking government-\nheld positions in eastern Ukraine -- including the area around the strategic port of Mariupol -- while Ukraine accused \nRussia of dispatching more troops and tanks to the region, specifically in the direction of the town of Novoazovsk on \nthe southern coast.   \n\nMeanwhile, a year after the original Maidan uprising in Kiev ousted former pro-Russian President Yanukovych from \npower, Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv was struck by a bomb attack as demonstrators marched in a \nnational unity rally.  Despite the existence of the second Minsk ceasefire agreement, Ukraine was still occasionally \nmired by war and bloodshed.  Europe warned of further sanctions to come if violations to the truce occurred and, \nindeed, a fragile peace appeared to take hold in the region. Juxtaposed against this background came a surprising \nadmission from Russian President Putin that he had long-standing ambitions to regain Russian control over Crimea.   \n\nSpecial Report on U.S.-led global coalition fight against the Jihadist terror group known as \"Islamic State\"  \n(alternatively referred to as  Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or \nISIS)   \n\nSummary:   \n\nSunni Islamic extremist militants, under the aegis of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL (also known as \nthe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS), have seized control over wide swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory.  In \nIraq, ISIL held sway -- from Fallujah and Ramadi in Anbar province, to Mosul in Nineveh, as well as Tikrit -- the \nhometown of the ousted and late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Across the border in Syria, ISIL was proving to be \nthe most successful anti-government force in that country.  It was consolidating territory held either by the Assad \nregime or by rival rebel entities, even ousting other Islamist insurgent and terrorist groups in the process. These \n\n\n\ngains collectively constituted  a spectacular victory  for ISIL, which seeks to establish a Sunni Islamic Caliphate in \nterritory that includes Iraq and Syria.   \n\nAs Syria and Iraq respectively grappled with the tumultuous security landscapes within their borders, their political \nspheres were also mired by turmoil.  In Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's treatment of the Sunni minority, \nincluding his persecution of former Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni, and raids on anti-government protest \ncamps, had alienated even the more moderate Sunni elements in that country.  As a result, Salafist Sunni Jihadists \nfrom home and abroad were answering the call to fight on Iraqi soil.  At the same time, the power vacuum from the \nSyrian civil war had provided fertile ground for ISIL to take root, not simply challenging the Assad regime but also \nattracting Jihadists from across the world seeking a \"cause\" upon which to concentrate. ISIL's ascendancy, thus,  \nmitigated Assad's control over wide swaths of Syrian territory while simultaneously delivering a remarkable blow \nacross the border to the Iraqi leader at the time, Shi'a Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.   \n\nThe year 2014 saw Iraq rocked by the worst violence and bloodshed  in recent years.  The violence in Iraq was the \nresult of the aforementioned ethno-sectarian dissonance between Sunni Muslims and Shi'a Muslims, and the  \ndramatic and escalating political conflict between the Shi'a dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \nand the increasingly alienated Sunni opposition. In the month of June 2014 alone, more than 2,000 people -- mostly \ncivilians -- had been killed in the violence rocking Iraq, according to the United Nations. It was the bloodiest and \nmost deadly month in Iraq since the peak of ethno-sectarian warfare in Iraq in 2007.   \n\nGiven this restive and volatile landscape,  the United Nations  envoy to Iraq, Martin Kobler,  warned that \"systemic \nviolence\" was about to explode \"at any moment\" in that country. Kobler called on  Iraq's political leaders to \"engage \nimmediately to pull the country out of this mayhem.\"  As stated by Gyorgy Busztin, the United Nation's Iraq \nrepresentative, \"The impact of violence on civilians remains disturbingly high.\"  He also called on Iraq's leadership \nto take steps to end the violence saying, \"Iraq's political leaders must take immediate and decisive action to stop \nthe senseless bloodshed.\"   \n\nThe summer of 2014 was marked by devolving chaos in Iraq as ISIL expanded their control from Fallujah and \nRamadi in Anbar province, to Mosul in Nineveh, as well as Tikrit -- the hometown of the  ousted and late Iraqi \nleader, Saddam Hussein, making significant territorial gains.   \n\nAcross the border in Syria, the Assad regime had been grappling with an ongoing uprising that started in the Arab \nSpring of 2011.  President Bashar al-Assad's brutal tactics aimed at quelling that uprising against various rebel \nfactions served only to create an even more tumultuous landscape, and eventually set the path for a full-blown civil \nwar.  That civil war pitted the Assad forces, backed by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, against  a disparate cabal of anti-\ngovernment entities, ranging from the rebel Free Syrian Army to several Islamist terrorist enclaves. As noted above, \nthe power vacuum from the Syrian civil war provided a breeding ground for extremism that ISIL could exploit and \nuse to both challenge the Assad regime and function as a recruitment tool for Jihadists.   \n\nThe result was a series of strategic victories across Syria and Iraq for ISIL. Then, at the start of July 2014, the \nsecurity crisis in the region was at acute levels as ISIL had declared itself to be the sovereign power over a \n\"caliphate\" ranging from Syria to Iraq and renamed itself the \"Islamic State.\"   \n\nThroughout, the United  States-trained Iraqi forces proved themselves to be ineffectual in fighting ISIL. In fact, Iraqi \ntroops abandoned their positions, thus  allowing the terrorists to make off with heavy military equipment provided to \nthe Iraqi military by the United States.  Indeed, the only defense being provided against ISIL in Iraq were the Kurds \nwho were now having to face ISIL terrorists armed with stolen American weaponry. While Kurdish peshmerga \nforces were far more engaged in the fight to save Kurdistan, they were nonetheless no match for ISIL, which now \nhad in its possession United States-provided weapons  that had been abandoned by Iraqi forces.   \n\nPresident Barack Obama of the United States was not eager to re-enter into a military engagement in Iraq, and as \nsuch, he advocated that leaders in Iraq work towards a political solution.  That political solution remained elusive as \n\n\n\nPrime Minister Maliki refused to form an inclusive national unity government and as members of parliament failed to \nagree on a new government.  Given the frustration over the failure of the Iraqi government in Baghdad  to address \nthe political and security crisis facing Iraq, the Kurdish president called for an independence referendum.  The \nKurds were also taking advantage of the power chasm by seizing control over the  oil-rich city of Kirkuk.   \n\nBut the scene in Iraq took an ominous turn in  August 2014 as Islamic State was now pushing Kurdish peshmerga \nfighters into retreat.  ISIL (or the so-called Islamic State) was exerting its self-declared power and authority as it \ncarried out a rampage of barbaric violence, brutally targeting some of Iraq's historic minority communities.  \nCertainly, Islamic State's persecution of Iraq's minority populations, particularly Christian and Yazidis, could be \nunderstood as nothing less than gross human rights abuses, even as it triggered a humanitarian crisis.   \n\nInitially, United States President Barack Obama  dispatched military advisers to Iraq but ruled out renewed military \nengagement in that country; instead, as noted above, he called for a political solution.  As the author of the \nwithdrawal of United States troops from Iraq, President Obama was not keen to be drawn back into the Iraqi \nquagmire.  But having recognized the dire landscape for religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq, on Aug. 7, 2014, the \nUnited States  President Barack Obama ordered limited strikes in northern Iraq, released a supply of arms to \nKurdish peshmerga fighters resisting Islamic State, and  provided humanitarian relief supplies to civilians forced to \nflee their homes.   \n\nThe presence of Maliki at the helm of Iraq had stood as another obstacle, as the United States was unwilling to be \nthe unofficial military support of a Shi'a government known to have persecuted the Sunni minority population of \nIraq.  But the subsequent replacement of the Maliki government with a more inclusive Abadi government set the \ntone for an improved domestic scenario in Iraq, to the relief of the United States and the wider world. It also \nprovided a more hospitable climate for increased United States' engagement in Iraq to fight ISIL.   \n\nThat being said,  the barbaric beheadings of two American journalists by ISIL  fundamentally changed the calculus \nboth for the war-weary American public as well as the American president.  As a consequence, on Sept. 10, 2014,  \nPresident Barack Obama  outlined a counter-terrorism strategy to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" ISIL -- not only \nin Iraq where the United States was already engaged in a limited manner, but also in Syria. To that end, the Obama \nadministration was rallying a coalition of Western and Middle Eastern partners -- including Jordan -- to take on the \nthreat posed to global security by ISIL.   \n\nIn truth, the advance of ISIL in not only Iraq but also Syria had compounded the geopolitical crisis facing the Middle \nEast.  Suddenly, anti-Assad countries in the region were finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of sharing \nwith Syria the goal of eliminating ISIL. For their part, Arab countries in the region were slow to respond to ISIL.  \nNevertheless, the Arab League was slowly coming to terms with the fact that it would have to have to engage in the \nregional security crisis  and that its objectives would likely, at times, overlap with that of the Assad regime. Indeed, \nin September 2014, the Arab League endorsed the effort to confront Islamic States at a time when the United \nStates was rallying allied countries to join the effort to repel and eradicate ISIL.   \n\nFor his part, United States President Barack Obama made clear that his country was committed to eliminating the \nleadership of Islamic State (also known as ISIL or ISIS), while noting that a coalition of NATO allies and Middle \nEastern partners was prepared to join the campaign against the brutality of these extremist Islamist Jihadists, and \nto take on the threat posed to global security by this dangerous terrorist group.   \n\nAccordingly, on Sept. 22, 2014, international coalition forces, led by the United States and including both European \nand Arab partner countries, commenced a campaign of air strikes against Islamist terror groups in Syria.   \n\nBy October 2014, despite the active international air campaign over Iraq and Syria, ISIL continued to carry out its \ncampaign of terror -- even extending the battlefield to  Kurdish areas bordering Turkey.  Irrespective of the fact that \nthe town of Kobane (alternatively called Kobani and predominantly inhabited by Kurds) on the Turkish border was \nunder siege, and regardless of legislation passed in Turkey's parliament authorizing action against ISIL, Turkey -- a \n\n\n\nNATO country -- showed little interest in joining the fight against ISIL, even with the protection of its own territory at \nstake.   \n\nNevertheless,  the United States-led global coalition was intensifying its strikes against ISIL targets; it was also  air \ndropping weapons and military supplies to Kurdish forces.   \n\nThe latter part of 2014 saw an intensification of the active air campaign over Iraq and Syria against ISIL by United \nStates-led coalition forces.  As well, United States President Obama called for more troops to be deployed to the \nregion to assist with the training and advising of Iraqi forces.   \n\nAt the start of 2015, Japan and Jordan were beset by tragedy when citizens of their countries that were being held \nby ISIL, were brutally killed.  As has become a pattern, ISIL proudly released videotaped footage depicting their \nvicious acts of murder.   In response,  Japan promised to do its part in the international fight against ISIL while \nJordanian King Abdullah warned of a \"relentless war\" on the Islamist terror group as it commenced a campaign of \nair  strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.   \n\nIn February 2015, the horrific killings of more than 20 Egyptian  Christians working in  Libya marked a new front in \nthe war against Islamic State. Post-Arab Spring Libya was on the brink of political collapse with Islamist extremists \ntaking advantage of the power void. The result was an emerging satellite Islamic State venue in Libya.  However, \nEgypt -- like Jordan -- was prepared to respond to the threat posed by these Islamist Jihadists to its citizens and \ncommenced its own air strike campaign against ISIL targets in Libya.   \n\nIt was to be seen if the Jordanian and Egyptian responses would mark a turning point for the Arab and Islamic \nworlds, regarding the international effort to degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamist terror group, known in \nderogatory Arabic parlance as \"Daesh.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, in February 2015, President Barack Obama of the United States called on the legislative branch of \ngovernment in that country to advance new legislation authorizing military action against the terror group calling \nitself Islamic State.  It was to be seen if partisan rivalries in the United States Congress would impede the process \nof passing a new authorization intended to carefully circumscribe the United States' military effort to degrade and \ndestroy Islamic State.   \n\nAlso at stake was a looming effort to retain control over the key Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State.  To that end, \nUnited States military advisers were training joint Iraqi and Kurdish forces to achieve this end in what was expected \nto be a spring offensive operation. But before the Mosul offensive could move forward, the United States-led \ncoalition continued to carry out air strikes in Iraq, supporting Kurdish fighters, with the goal being to drive Islamic \nState from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.   \n\nIn mid-April 2015, the United States Pentagon confirmed that Islamic State lost more than a quarter of the territory \nin Iraq it held prior to the air campaign that was launched in August 2014.  With the intent to build on this success, \nIraqi Prime Minister Abadi traveled to the United States to request more assistance in the air campaign against \nIslamic State.  However, before the United States could even process this request, in mid-April 2015, on the heels \nof their victory in Tikrit,  Islamic State was carrying out an advance on the city of  Ramadi, ultimately seizing control \nof that city in May 2015.  It was apparent in the spring of 2015 that even if Islamic State was under pressure, it was \nstill a functional and aggressive terrorist entity.   \n\nBy the start of June 2015, with Islamic State still posing a threat in Iraq and Syria, as well as to the wider Middle \nEastern region, and even the global community,  United States President Barack Obama acknowledged that his \ncountry's strategy to  defeat the terror group remained \"incomplete.\"  He indicated that a comprehensive strategy \ncould only be advanced with the concurrence of the government of Iraq, and intimated that there was a need for \nIraqi to commit to the process of saving their own country.   \n\n\n\nIt should be noted that whereas some progress had been noted in Iraq, the prevailing dynamics remained in place \nin Syria where Islamic State continued to hold sway over large swaths of that country.    \n\nEditor's Note on Islamic State   \n\nIslamic State (alternatively referred to as  ISIL and ISIS), has gained notoriety for its particularly brutal tactics, \nranging from the abductions and mass murders of religious and ethnic minorities, which they view as apostates, \nand their beheadings of soldiers and journalists.  The group has said that it aims to establish an Islamic  \"caliphate\" \nthat would be ruled according to Islamic  Shari'a law.  Its ambitions are Jihadists and not simply limited to Iraq and \nSyria; in fact, ISIL has made clear that it intends to extent its control to Jordan and Lebanon.  A satellite venue of \nIslamic State has opened up in post-Arab Spring Libya as extremists have taken advantage of the power chasm \nthere.  Another ambition for ISIL is the cause of Palestine. Adherents are required to  swear their allegiance to the \nISIL leader, Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai, known in the public sphere as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  \nBaghdadi's appeal has, to some degree, been fed by his mystery as he has only rarely been seen in public.   \n\nIn terms of legacy, ISIL is actually an outgrowth of al-Qaida in Iraq, led by the Jordanian-born terrorist, Abu Musab \nal-Zarqawi. After  Zarqawi's death in 2006, al-Qaida in Iraq transposed itself into Islamic State in Iraq.  Although it \nwas weakened by the United States-led \"surge\" in Iraq to deal with the Sunni insurgency, and which included the \ninvolvement of Sahwa (Awakening) councils by Sunni Arab tribesmen ,  Islamic State in Iraq experienced a \nresurgence in 2010 under Baghdadi.  Once Syria was embroiled in a civil war in 2011,  Islamic State was able to \nestablish a foothold in Syria, essentially uprooting other extremist and terror groups, such as al-Nusra Front and al-\nQaida, by 2013, and ultimately holding control over wide swaths of territory from Syria to Iraq as of 2014, and \nextending to Libya as of 2015.  ISIL's ability to take over Anbar province and then the northern city of Mosul in Iraq \nin 2014 were key developments in the entrenchment of ISIL in the region.   \n\nISIL's genocidal practices have been characterized most acutely by their infamous and gruesome beheadings of \nforeign nationals and apostates, but have also included other revolting and repugnant means of execution, such as \ncrucifixions, immolations, and mass shootings.  These bloodthirsty techniques of terror and tactics of murder, which \nare professionally videotaped and disseminated for maximum effect, have been so ghastly that other militant \nIslamist movements have sought to distance themselves from ISIL.  Indeed, the Yemeni wing of al-Qaida (known as \nal-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula) went so far as to note that beheadings, and the videotaping of decapitations, \nwere to be regarded as un-Islamic. Meanwhile, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which has been deemed to be a terrorist \norganization by some countries of the West, made clear that ISIL's tactics of terror were inhumane.  These stances \nby  al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and Hezbollah suggested that even among extremists, militants, Jihadists, \nand Islamist terrorists, there remained some degree of a \"code\" that ISIL had apparently violated.   \n\nIt should be noted that ISIL's barbarism and brutality has had a double effect. First, the brutality appears to have \nfunctioned as a recruitment tool for other murderous Islamist extremists across the world. To date, it is not known \nhow many ISIL fighters exist in the Middle East although estimates suggest that as many as 30,000 Islamic State \nfighters are in the Iraq-Syria region. These fighters come from across the world although, as Libya has slipped \nfurther into failed state status, it is believed to be the largest single source of terrorists to the cause.  That being \nsaid, ISIL has attracted disgruntled youth from Europe and the Americas as well, with recruits often traveling \nthrough Turkey to enter ISIL-controlled territory. Second,  even as ISIL's barbarism has been a recruitment tool, it \nhas simultaneously  stimulated the reluctant engagement of a United States-led international coalition in an anti-\nIslamic State mission.   \n\nSocio-economic strife is a popular -- and often facile -- explanation for extremism and activism.  It certainly applies \nto the roots of the Arab Spring and specifically the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, for example, but does not apply \nto ISIL.  Yes, the power chasms created in the wake of the Arab Spring -- specifically in Libya but also in other \ncountries in the region -- certainly created the conditions for recruitment.  But creating fertile ground for recruitment \nstill does not address the reason why people would be attracted to ISIL.  Likewise, the call for more education may \nhave resonance in countries where young people are educated  only about Islam in Madrassas, or in impoverished \n\n\n\nregions where people  simply have no access to education at all. But these cases do not properly apply to ISIL \nrecruits and symathizers. The problem is not a lack of education -- most of these recruits are computer savvy and \nwere recruited via the Internet while using their own laptops or in Internet cafes.  Indeed,  many youth ISIL recruits \nwere from middle class or even wealthy families -- certainly not backgrounds  without  marked by socio-economic \nhardship.  Recruits and sympathizers are also not necessarily from strict Muslim  families;  indeed, there were \nreports that many ISIL recruits were actually fairly new to hardline Islam with translations of instructional \nintroductory texts on Islam being a particularly popular purchase for them.   \n\nIt would seem that many recruits to ISIL appeared to be the same type of profile as vulnerable youth likely to join  \ngang or cults, susceptible to brainwashing,  and thus excellent candidates for adherence to Islamic State's religious \nideology.   \n\nThat being said, to properly understand the attraction of ISIL, it is imperative to address the ideological appeal of \nhardline and  regressive Islam, which embraces barbaric practices of execution, such as beheadings and \ncrucifixion, while integrating socio-governing practices such as conquest and  the enslavement of women.  Well-\nmeaning public figures have cast these tactics of terror and abuses of humanity as \"perversions\" of Islam. Left \nunsaid is that fact that they are actually clear dictates that come from historic Islam, and which have been \nembraced by ISIL as the \"true\" path to salvation, irrespective of the fact that their pratices are a violation of modern \nunderstandings of human rights.   \n\nIndeed,  Islamic State must be an apocalyptic and millenarian death cult, with a strict Medieval interpretation of \nIslam at the core and a gruesome theatre of murder as  the main attraction.  Relying on apocalyptic prophesies of \nIslamic Jihadist ascendancy and an ultimate \"Day of Judgement,\" the expansion of Islamic State territory in Iraq and \nSyria, and even Libya,  was being understood as  a sign of \"victory.\" Stated differently, the rapid rate of expansion \n(read: victory) by ISIL in Iraq and Syria in 2014 functioned to empower sympathizers and recruits to the ISIL cause.   \n\nGiven this paradigm, the only prescription for  defeat would be the disruption of what looks like  an unstoppable \njuggernaut by ISIL. That being said, the texture of that defeat would have to be carefully -- and globally -- crafted \nsince ISIL militants believe in the apocalyptic prophesy of a \"final\" confrontation with the West.  Rather than \nfacilitating that end, international stakeholders have noted that the preferable path would be to target this Islamist \nJihadist terror entity as part of a global coalition. With United States-led air strikes only going so far to destroy ISIL, \nthere would ultimately be a need for ground forces.  An effective strategy against ISIL would be one that looks to \nArab \"boots on the ground\"  rather than feeding the hunger by Islamists for a Crusades-style war with the West.   \n\nIt should be noted that Islamic State is sometimes  pejoratively referred to as \"Daesh.\"  Islamic State rejects this \nterm of reference, which sounds roughly in Arabic to the words \"Daes\" which means \"one who crushes something \nunderfoot\" and \"Dahes\" which means \"one who sows discord.\" For precisely these negative associations,  the \nenemies of Islamic State  have increasingly used  the term \"Daesh\" to describe the terror group in defiance.    \n\nSpecial Report:  United States-Israeli relations at new low due to Israeli PM Netanyahu's address to Congress on \nIranian nuclear program   \n\nHighlights:   \n\n- President Obama and PM Netanyahu at odds over Iranian nuclear negotiations   \n- Key Democrats boycott speech in protest of Speaker Boehner's invitation to Israeli PM only weeks ahead of \nelection and in violation of White House protocols   \n- Mossad report differs from Netanyahu's claims in United Nations speech about timing of Iran nuclear breakout \nthreat   \n\n- 47 Republican senators dispatch letter to leader of Iran in attempt to put curbs on diplomatic process   \n\n\n\n- Despite diplomatic contretemps between U.S. and Israel, progress still being made during multilateral nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran   \n\nIn detail:   \n\nA diplomatic contretemps was brewing between the United States and Israel in the latter part of January 2015 when \nUnited States  House Speaker John Boehner (Republican) invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu to \naddress Congress without first consulting the White House, as is normal practice. Even with this breach of protocol, \nNetanyahu accepted Boehner's irregular invitation.   \n\nAt the heart of Boehner's overture to Netanyahu was President Obama's State of the Union warning that he would \nveto any legislation from Congress for new sanctions against Iran while tough multilateral negotiations were still \nongoing. At issue was the effort to forge a deal with Tehran that would prevent that country from manufacturing \nnuclear weapons. Those multilateral negotiations were advanced precisely with the understanding that the United \nStates would not introduce fresh sanctions while talks continued. President Obama noted that new sanctions would \ndeliver the message to the international community that the United States was operating under bad faith. But \nknowing that the Israeli prime minister has long opposed the talks with Iran in the first place, Boehner was making \nthe calculation that Netanyahu could influence members of Congress to act on sanctions in contravention to \nPresident Obama's stance.   \n\nThat very calculation to undermine the United States president by calling on a foreign leader to offer a \ncountervailing foreign policy view in the chambers of Congress soon erupted into a foreign relations fracas. \nBoehner's irregular invitation to Netanyahu without first seeking concurrence from the White House was already a \nsource of controversy.  However, the situation devolved further when it was revealed that the Israeli Ambassador to \nthe United States, Ron Dermer, planned the invitation in concert with Boehner, believing that it would boost \nNetanyahu's prospects at the polls in Israeli elections set for March 2015.  The sordid nature of that blatantly \npolitical move was intensified when it was revealed that Dermer did not notify United States Secretary of State John \nKerry of the move during a meeting with the United States' top diplomat.   \n\nSuch machinations have been regarded at best as suspect, and at worst, as duplicitous. Indeed, the moves evoked \ncondemnation from the opposition Labor bloc in Israel, which warned that Netanyahu's address would damage \nrelations with the Obama White House. The possible consequences to United States-Israeli ties appeared to be a \nreal risk and was being discussed among the Israeli cognescenti. In Israel's leading daily newspaper, Yedioth \nAhronoth, former diplomat Alon Pinkas wrote: \"These relations are the greatest strategic asset that Israel has had \nsince its establishment. Netanyahu has harmed, weakened, and finally destroyed the interpersonal channel (with \nthe U.S. president) and created an unprecedented rift in the relations between president and prime minister.\"   \n\nAt home in the United States, former United States Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, entered the fray, warning:  \n\"Netanyahu is using the Republican Congress for a photo-op for his election campaign....Unfortunately, the U.S. \nrelationship will take the hit. It would be far wiser for us to stay out of their politics and for them to stay out of ours.\"   \n\nThee situation devolved even further when Netanyahu asked Boehner to change the date of the proposed address \nto Congress from February 2015 to March 2015 -- only weeks ahead of the Israeli elections the prime minister \nhoped to win.   \n\nIn a rebuke to Israel, the Obama White House soon announced that United President Obama would not meet with \nNetanyahu while the Israeli Prime Minister was in the United States at Capitol Hill in March 2015.  The White House \nmade clear that such a meeting would be entirely inappropriate, given the proximity to the Israeli elections. A more \nvivid view of the Obama White House's outrage  was illuminated with the release of an anonymous quote by a \nUnited States official, which was published by Israel's Haaretz newspaper.  That newspaper quoted the unnamed \n\n\n\nUnited States official as saying, \"We thought we've seen everything. But Bibi managed to surprise even us. There \nare things you simply don't do. He spat in our face publicly and that's no way to behave. Netanyahu ought to \nremember that President Obama has a year and a half left to his presidency, and that there will be a price.\"   \n\nNote that in the first week of February 2015, Israeli Ambassador Dermer met with key Congressional Democrats in \nan effort to smooth tensions that had arisen over Netanyahu's irregular speech to be given before Congress.  \nDermer appeared to place the blame on House Speaker Boehner for the diplomatic crisis, suggesting that the \nspeaker of the House of Representatives had misled Israel into believing the invitation was a bipartisan one.  At the \nend of the day, those meetings did not appear to have yielded positive results for Dermer.  Instead, Jewish \nDemocrats in Congress blasted Dermer for his part in the brewing fiasco, while  House Minority Leader Nancy \nPelosi urged that the speech be postponed, noting under the current conditions it would be \"inappropriate.\"   \n\nExacerbating the situation was the news that  Congressman John Lewis -- a known civil rights icon -- would be \nboycotting the Nentanyahu address.  In the House of Representatives,  Representative John Clyburn, one of the \nhighest ranking Democrats in the lower chamber, along with Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the head of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus, Representative Jim McDermott and others all said they would not be attending \nthe Netanyahu address. Representative Earl Blumenauer went so far as to write an artice in The Huffington Post \nexplaining his decision. In that piece, he said that the Constitution \"vests the responsibility for foreign affairs in the \npresident.\"   \n\nThe list of prominent Democrats boycotting the Netanyahu speech grew  with Senator Bernie Sanders casting the \nevent as \"wrong,\" and saying he would skip it.  Senator Patrick Leahy not only announced his own boycott of the \nspeech, but paired it with a searing rebuke of the Republican-led Congress.  He said: \"They [House leaders] have \norchestrated a tawdry and high-handed stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself. It has \nlong been an unwritten rule and practice through the decades that when it comes to American foreign policy, we \nspeak and act thoughtfully, with one voice when we can, with the national interests of the United States as our \nuppermost consideration, and with caution about the unintended consequences of unilateral actions like this. They \nhave diminished that valuable precedent.\"  Also of note was the decision by Senator Brian Schatz -- a Jewish \nDemocrat from  the president's home state of Hawaii --  who said he would not attend the Netanyahu speech \n\"because it does more harm than good to the bipartisan U.S.-Israel alliance.\"  Schatz also added that he believed \nthe House Speaker issued the invitation to the Israeli prime minister for \"the apparent purpose of undermining \nPresident Obama's foreign policy prerogatives.\"   \n\nDuring a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Obama was asked about the \nNetanyahu speech and, at first issued a diplomatic response, noting that it would be inappropriate to meet with any \nleader so soon ahead of an election.  He said, \"I think it's important for us to maintain these protocols \u2014-- because \nthe U.S.-Israeli relationship is not about a particular party.\"  But he added that as much as he loved the German \nleader, his White House would not have extended an invitation to her ahead of a general election in Germany, and \nhe added, \"And I am sure she would not have asked for one.\"  Chancellor Merkel responded with an emphatic \"no\" \nheadshake, making clear that she tacitly agreed that such a move would be a break in proper protocol.   \n\nThe Obama White House also delivered its own more direct message to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the \ngovernment of Israel when it announced that Vice President Joe Biden -- typically a guaranteed presence at events \ninvolving foreign leaders -- would not be in attendance.  The Obama White House said that Vice President Biden \nwould be traveling on the day set for the Netanyahu address; the news could only be regarded as a snub by the \nadministration to the current Israeli government.   \n\nA CNN poll released in February 2015, indicated that the vast majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- did not approve \nof House Speaker Boehner's move to sidestep President Obama  and invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to \nspeak before Congress, by-passing normal protocol. For his part, Netanyahu appeared to be undeterred by \ncriticisms of his speech, perhaps calculating that whatever ill will he was building in the United States would be \nvitiated by his political and nationalist gains at home just ahead of elections in Israel.   \n\n\n\nThe rift between the United States and Israel deepened as February 2015 came to a close, reaching a new nadir \njust as Netanyahu was set to address to Congress in the first week of March 2015.   \n\nOf note was Israeli Prime Minister Netanhayu's claim that the United States and other world powers had abandoned \ntheir vow to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb.  Speaking from Israel, Netanhayu accused the multilateral \nbloc, including the United States, of \"accepting that Iran will gradually, within a few years, will develop capabilities to \nproduce material for many nuclear weapons.\"  Netanyahu continued, saying, \"I respect the White House and the \npresident of the United States but on such a fateful matter, that can determine whether or not we survive, I must do \neverything to prevent such a great danger for Israel.\"   \n\nKey members of the United States government hit back against Netanyahu forcefully and aggressively. United \nStates  Secretary of State John Kerry responded to the accusation from the Israeli leader by questioning \nNetanyahu's judgement on the issue.  Indeed, Secretary of State Kerry issued a rebuke of Netanyahu, saying, \"He \nmay have a judgment that just may not be correct here.\"  Expanding on his point after the latest round of \nnegotiations in Europe, the United States' top diplomat said, \"The president has made clear -- I can't state this more \nfirmly -- the policy is Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.\"   \n\nSecretary of State Kerry went further by reminding the world of Netanyahu's questionable geopolitical acumen and  \nstrategic perspicacity when he noted that the Israeli leader \"was profoundly forward-leaning and outspoken about \nthe importance of invading Iraq under (President) George W. Bush, and we all know what happened with that \ndecision.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, another official in the United States government -- this time,  National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- \ncast the impending visit to the United States by Netanyahu as \"destructive to the fabric of the [bilateral] \nrelationship.\"  In an interview with Charlie Rose on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), National Security \nAdviser Rice said, \"We want the relationship between the United States and Israel to be unquestionably strong, \nimmutable... regardless of which party may be in charge in either country.\"  Her implication was that Netayahu's \nspeech, imbued now with political elements, could not be understood as anything other than partisan, and as such, \nwould have a negative impact on the bilateral ties between the United States and Israel.   \n\nThe White House itself highlighted the problem in reducing the bilateral relationship to partisanship when \nspokesperson, Josh Ernest, said: \"The president has said the relationship between the United States  and Israel \ncan't just be reduced to a relationship between the Republican party and the Likud party.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, for Netanyahu, it was apparent that he was making the calculation that deteriorating ties with the leader \nof the free world might be worth the risk if he saw gains at the polls at home in mid-March 2015.  But on the issue of \na pending deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, it was difficult to see what achievement Netanyahu hoped \nto make.  Even  if he were to deliver a tour de force of a speech on Capitol Hill, replete with repeated standing \novations from Republicans in Congress anxious to show their solidarity with the hardline conservative Israeli prime \nminister, the multilateral talks in Europe on the Iranian nuclear deal were still going to move forward. Even if some \nsort of legislation was advanced in the United States Congress aimed at sabotaging such a deal (for example via \nfresh sanctions against Iran), the president of the United States would have the power of the veto to counteract \nsuch a move.   \n\nNetanyahu himself appeared cognizant of this reality as he said, \"Can I guarantee that my speech in Congress will \nprevent a dangerous deal with Iran from being signed? Honestly, I don't know. But I do know this -\u2014 it's my sacred \nduty as prime minister of Israel to make Israel's case.\"   \n\n\n\nTo that end, the Israeli leader went to Capitol Hill on March 3, 2015, to give his address to Congress. In that \nspeech, he warned that the nuclear deal being negotiated by global powers and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, would \nactually herald a nuclearized Iran.  To this end, he said, \"This deal doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb, it paves \nIran's path to the bomb.\" Disparaging the efforts being carried out by United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nand his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China,  Netanyahu said: \"We've been \ntold that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal.\"   \n\nOf course, the Israeli leader had harsh words regarding Iran, reminding the chamber -- and the worlds -- that \"Iran's \nregime is as radical as ever, the ideology is deeply rooted in militant Islam... it will always be an enemy of U.S.\"  He \nalso noted that the Iranian imprint was growing in the Middle East, as it meddled in the affairs of countries such as \nIraq and Yemen, while backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  To this end, Nentanyahu said that Iran was on a \"march \nof conquest, subjugation and terror.\"   \n\nNetanyahu's speech, despite the boycott by as many as 60 Democrats, was well-received by the Republican-\ndominated Congress.  Indeed, Republicans in Congress made a point to giving the Israeli leader a far warmer \nreception, with more boisterous applause than had been conveyed to President Barack Obama at the State of the \nUnion less than two months earlier.   \n\nFor its part, the White House blasted the Israeli prime minister's address as being filled by rhetoric and short of \ngood ideas. As noted by President Obama himself after the Netanyahu visit to Capitol Hill, \"On the core issue, \nwhich is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the prime \nminister [Netanyahu] did not offer any viable alternatives.\"   \n\nNevertheless, the fact of the matter was that Netanyahu's address was a political success that would likely help him \nwith hardline voters at home, while currying favor with hardliners across party lines in the United States.  Of course, \nit was harder to say if the Netanyahu speech was necessarily in the best interests of the United States.   \n\nThe reality was that without an agreement of some sort, Iran would likely move forward with the pursuit of its \nnuclear program, which could potentially involve bomb production. Indeed, it was only the interim nuclear deal (set \nto expire in mid-2015), which created the space for nuclear negotiations to take place, that had brought any halt to \nIranian nuclear acitivites.  Before the interim agreement was forged, despite the imposition of harsh sanctions, Iran \nwas producing centrifuges and fissile material. Without a nuclear accord going forward, Iran would be free to \nresume unfettered nuclear activities.   \n\nOf note was the fact that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have viewed the Iranian nuclear problem \ndifferently.  For President Obama, the imperative has always been the same: To prevent Iran from producing a \nnuclear bomb.  But for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the objective has been to prevent Iran from having nuclear \ncapability.  While the two respective goals overlap, they must be understood distinctly.   \n\nA good deal for President Obama would be one in which Iran's nuclear program is curtailed, regulated, and \nmonitored to the extent that its breakout time for creating a bomb would be lengthy and difficult.  No deal would \nlikely be acceptable to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was determined to see Iran's nuclear capability ended in \ntotality, and all of its nuclearfacilities dismantled.  Short of military action, it was difficult to see how Netanyahu's \ngoals would be accomplished.  But even military strikes would  be risky since multiple sites -- from the uranium \nenrichment plants at Natanz and Fordo, to the heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak, not to mention an array of \nlaboratories and mines at stake.   \n\nOf significance was the fact  that the very case by Israel (at least, as conveyed by Netanyahu) was being tarred by \nquestions of credibility.  At issue was the release of a cache of confidential intelligence documents that appeared to \ncontradict Netanyahu's claims about Iran being imminently positioned to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Leaked \ncables -- reportedly from South African intelligence. but which were shared with certain news outlets -- indicated \n\n\n\nthat in an address before the United Nations in 2012, the Israeli leader misrepresented Iran's progress on nuclear \ndevelopment, and even contradicted Israel's own Mossad secret service to make that claim.   \n\nGoing back to 2012, Netanyahu famously stood before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon \ndepiction of a bomb with a red line and declared that Iran would be positioned to build a nuclear weapons the \nfollowing year.  As such, he demanded global action to prevent Iran from achieving that end.  Now, however, in \n2015, the leaked documents, whch were shared with Al-Jazeera and published by The Guardian newspaper,  \nincluded conclusions from Israel's own Mossad intelligence agency that Iran was \"not performing the activity \nnecessary to produce weapons.\"  The Mossad briefing did note that Iran appeared to be moving in a direction \n\"which will reduce the time required to produce weapons.\"  However, the Mossad briefing also asserted that Iran \n\"does not appear to be ready\" to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons.  (The \nmanufacture of a nuclear bomb would require enrichment of 90 percent.)   \n\nIt should be noted that in response to the revelations ensconced in these leaked documents, the Israeli government \nsaid there was little difference in Netanyahu's claims as compared with Mossad's findings.  Both agreed  that Iran \nwas indeedseeking to manufacture a nuclear bomb.   \n\nRegardless of Iran's actual intent or the actual timeline at stake, the difficult diplomatic work of trying to forge an \nagreement that would prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon was ongoing.   \n\nIt should be noted that in the aftermath of the Netanyahu speech, United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nwarned that simply demanding Iran's capitulation was unlikely to compel that country to voluntarily halt its nuclear \ndevelopment program.  Kerry's remarks intimated criticism for the muscular language emitted by the Israeli leader, \nwhich were heavy on rhetoric but unlikely to achieve actual results. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry noted that the \ndiplomatic path presented a serious path forward.  He said,  \"No one has presented a more viable, lasting \nalternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. So folks, simply demanding that Iran \ncapitulate is not a plan. And nor would any of our P5+1 partners support us in that position.\" At the same time, \nSecretary of State Kerry made clear that the while the hard work of diplomacy was yielding results, there remained \n\"significant gaps and important choices that need to be made\" by Iran.   \n\nIn Iran, President Hassan Rouhani emphasized his country's position. Rouhani indicated that Iran was prepared to \nsubject itself to greater scrutiny, in order to satisfy the international community's concerns about nuclear weapons \nproduction.  But at the same time, he reiterated Iran's long-standing stance that it was entitled to nuclear \ndevelopment.  Rouhani said, \"If the basis of these negotiations is for increased transparency, we will accept greater \ntransparency. But if the negotiations are trying to prevent the people of Iran from their inalienable right, in other \nwords advancement in science and technology, it is very natural that Iran will not accept such an understanding or \nagreement.\"   \n\nOf course, concerns about Iranian nuclear development, and a potential nuclear deal, extended not only to Israel \nbut also to the Sunni Arab world.  Of note was the ever-increasing sectarian divide between Shi'ites and Sunnis in \nthe Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring in 2011. With this schism only deepening, \nSunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia, were increasingly concerned about an ascendant Shi'ite Iran.  Indeed, Iran \nalready had its imprint in the Syria-Lebanon area due to tacit support of Hezbollah, and had tightened its alliance \nwith Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era, and was now believed to be clandestinely backing the Shi'ite Zaidi \nrebellion (known as the Houthi rebellion) in Yemen.  The notion of a nuclearized Iran, already with its tentacles \nstretching across the region, was not regarded positively by several Arab countries. Accordingly, Secretary of State \nKerry traveled to Saudi Arabia to calm the anxieties of several Sunni Arab countries, including  Bahrain, Kuwait, \nOman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia itself, regarding a potential Iranian nuclear deal.   \n\nSpeaking to this issue, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"For all the objections that any country has to Iranian activities \nin the region, and believe me, we have objections and others in the world have objections, the first step is to \n\n\n\nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\"  At stake was the goal of reaching the \"right deal,\" which Kerry said \nwould  \"close off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon.\"   \n\nTo that end, the diplomatic track was continuing and the latest round of multilateral talks -- involving the United \nStates, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany,  Russia, and China -- appeared to be making progress, with all \neyes on late March 2015 as a possible timeline for a deal, with the details ironed out and solidified by a mid-2015 \ndeadline.   \n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the negotiations were productive, saying to the media: \n\"We made progress.\"  His Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,  said they were forging \"a \nbetter understanding\" at the negotiating table.   \n\nThe comprehensive pact appeared to be geared towards constraining Iran's nuclear breakout capability, and \nrestricting Iran's nuclear activities for a 10-year period, with an easing of restrictions on nuclear development after \nthat time. Under consideration was a plan to deal with most of Iran's enriched uranium externally, or to convert it to \na form that would not be easily used in weapons development.  Overall, there would be strict curbs on Iranian \nnuclear development for a decade, particularly with regard to the handling of enriched uranium and the number of \ncentrifuges at stake.  But there would also be \"rewards\" of sorts  for Iranian compliance and cooperation in the form \nof gradually eased restrictions and the lifting of sanctions.  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, would play a central role in any proposed deal, and  would have the primary \nresponsibility of monitoring Iran's compliance and cooperation.   \n\nIn the second week of March 2015, in the wake of the controversial Netanyahu address to Congress, 47 \nRepublican senators published an open letter to Iran.  The  signatories to that document sought to instruct the \nIranian goverment about United States constitutional law, which they suggested the Iranians might not \"fully \nunderstand.\" The letter, which was spearheaded by freshman Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, made \nthe claim that  any nuclear deal that might emerge from the negotiations in Switzerland would be \"nothing more \nthan an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,\" and thus require congressional \napproval while being subject to revocation by a future president.  To this end, the letter included the following \nsentence: \"The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future \nCongresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.\"   \n\nIt was difficult to interpret the missive as anything other than a transparent attempt to undermine President Barack \nObama's leadership in the realm of foreign policy. Indeed, editorials from more than 22 cities across the country \nexcoriated the 47 Republican senators for their action, which they characterized as a reckless and partisan stunt. \nSome newspaper boards even argued that by dispatching that missive, te 47 Republican senators were marching \nthe country down the road of war.  Almost all the editorials vociferously criticized the 47 Republican senators for \nbetraying the national interests of the United States, whose constitution, accords broad authority to the president to \nconduct foreign policy.   \n\nFrom the Senate,  Minority Leader Harry Reid -- the top Democrat in the upper chamber -- minced no words as he \ndeclared: \"Let's be clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.\" \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in \n2016, entered the fray, saying that the letter's signatories could only be motivated by one of the following two \nrationales. She said, \"There appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the \nIranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer \ndoes discredit to the letter's signatories.\" White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said the letter was intended to \nundermine diplomacy and could spur a \"rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option.\"   \n\n\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama responded to the infamous letter by accusing the 47 Republican senators of \n\"interfering\" in nuclear negotiations -- an arena typically reserved for the executive branch of government.  He also  \nsardonically noted that the 47 signatories constituted an \"unusual coalition\" with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, \nwho have also opposed the nuclear negotiations.  As noted by President Obama: \"I think it's somewhat ironic to see \nsome members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It's an unusual coalition.\"  \nVice President Joe Biden -- a former Senator himself and the official president of the upper chamber -- was more \nvituperative in his condemnation. Vice President Biden said that the letter from the 47 Republicans was \"beneath \nthe dignity of an institution I revere.\" He added, \"In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another \ninstance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that \nthe president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,\"   \n\nOf significance was the reaction by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif, who dismissed the letter as a \n\"propaganda ploy.\" Zarif said, \"In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.  It is very \ninteresting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political \npressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, \nunprecedented in diplomatic history.  This indicates that like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential \nthreat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.\"   \n\nEducated in the United States himself, the Iranian foreign minister did not shy away from showing his own \nconstitutional chops, intimating that the Republican Senators who signed onto the letter may not been fully \nconversant with the United States Constitution. To this end, Zarif said, \"A change of administration does not in any \nway relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible \nagreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.\"  Zarif also noted that a move by a future president to dismantle \na yet-to-be-achieved nuclear agreement would be in contravention to international jurisprudence, saying, \"I wish to \nenlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, \nit will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"   \n\nTo be sure, the letter from the 47 Republican senators emphasized the view that any deal would have to be ratified \nby the upper house of the Congress.  However, both Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry pointed out that the vast majority of international agreements forged in recent decades have been  \nexecutive measures and not treaties requiring ratification by the Senate.   \n\nMoreover, any deal emerging from the nuclear talk would be neither a bilateral agreement nor a conventional treaty \nbetween nation state.  Instead, it would be a multilateral accord, forged by the P5+1 countries, including all \npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The accord would likely activated as a Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, then sealed under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council, and thus would \nin fact not be subject to modification by Congress. In this regard, it would be follow on the heels of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, and 1929 that have also dealt with Iran's nuclear \nprogram.  Neither a Republican-controlled Senate  nor a future president would be positioned to unilaterally  \nreverse the terms of a potential accord of this sort.   \n\nCongress, with its power of the purse, could certainly  place certain limits on President Obama or any future \npresident as regards sanctions to be levied upon Iran (or any other country).  However, Congress cannot summarily \noverride international obligations forged in a multilateral frame, and which would be structured as an international \nmeasure, without  being in  flagrant breach of international law.   \n\nBeyond the legal perils at stake, there were political perils to consider. The fact of the matter was that any post-\nObama president would be placed in a precarious position within the world community for violating an agreement \nreached and understood as a matter of international consensus.   \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there were rumblings in regards to violations of domestic law when some observers noted that the letter \nto Iran could be regarded as a violation of the 18th century Logan Act.   To be precise, the Logan Act prohibits any \n\"Private correspondence with foreign governments\" and reads; \"Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may \nbe, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence \nor intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or \nconduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies \nwith the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned \nnot more than three years, or both.\"  In truth, it was unlikely that a law dating back to 1799 would be used to \nprosecute the 47 senators; however, its discussion has only added to the level of scandal and drama surrounding a \npotential landmark multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program.   \n\nReturning to the issue of the prevailing nuclear negotiations -- the fact of the matter was that nuclear talks continued \nin Switzerland in the third week of March 2015. The principal parties acknowledged that progress was being made, \nparticularly with regard to technical provisions.  Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, \nexpressed delight over his productive meetings with United States Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz, saying, \"We \nhave made progress on technical issues. One or two issues remain and need to be discussed.\"  For his part, \nSecretary of State Kerry said, \"We're pushing some tough issues but we made progress.\"   \n\nHowever, other Western representatives had a different view. A State Department official told Reuters News, \"We \nare pretty far away. There are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. The Iranians must make substantial \nconcessions.\"  Moreover, as reported by Reuters News, an anonymous European negotiator said: \"Contrary to \nwhat the Iranians are saying with regard to 90 percent of an accord being done, that's not correct.  We are not close \nto an agreement.\"   \n\nClearly, another round of talks was anticipated to resolve a slate of remaining issues.  Of note was the West's \ninsistence that Iran's nuclear activities be curtailed and its nuclear breakout time be circumscribed to one year.  \nStated differently, an arrangement had to be made whereby Iran would need a full year to garner enough fissile \nmaterial (either high enriched uranium or plutonium before it could produce a nuclear weapon.  On the agenda for \ndiscussion was a plan to limit the  number of enrichment centrifuges Iran would be allowed to keep; other \nconsiderations included limits of the size of uranium stockpiles.   \n\nNote that on March 21, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated that progress was being made in nuclear \ntalks, setting the stage for a final deal.  He was quoted by Iranian state media as saying. \"There is nothing that \ncannot be resolved.\"  Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, emitted a very different tone from that of Iran's more \nmoderate president, Rouhani. In reference to President Obama's Persian Nowruz message to the Iranian people, in \nwhich the United State leader said a deal on Iran's nuclear program presented \"an historic opportunity to resolve \nthis issue peacefully,\"  Ayatollah  Khamenei  said that his country should not submit to the demands of the global \npowers. Khamenei noted, \"Basically, what he [Obama]  says in his message is that you must accept the terms we \ndictate in the nuclear talks so that jobs, investment, and economic activities will blossom in your country... this view \nwill never lead to any conclusions for us.\"  In many senses, Obama and Rouhani were in similar positions -- both \nwere pragmatic presidents, both were eager to improve bilateral relations between their countries, while meeting \nglobal security goals, yet both men were also politically at odds with the conservative and hardline elements in their \nown countries.   \n\nDays later, the landscape for negotiations could only be understood as uncertain.  The various sides appeared to \nbe deadlocked over certain sticking points. France was looking for more stringent restrictions on the Iranians -- a \nposition by France that was at odds with the other P5+1 countries.  Also at issue was the fact that France was not \nkeen on the notion of a quick suspension to United Nations sanctions against Iran -- a demand being made by the \nIranians.  Meanwhile, the United States was advocating that restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place \nfor at least 10 years, while France was looking for a 15 year timeline, along with 10 years of rigorous IAEA \nmonitoring. Other contentions centered on Iran's demand that it be allowed unfettered research and development of \n\n\n\nadvanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors, and ultimately are linked with \nweapons production.   \n\nThe fact of the matter was that  significant issues remained unresolved with Iran and the P5+1 countries far apart in \nsome regards.  Still, the consequences of not reaching a deal would likely destablize the world; as such, the \nimpetus for forging an agreement was strong and all expectations were that the March 2015 deadline would be \nextended again.   \n\nThe nuclear negotiations aside, relations between the United States and Israel continued to be poor in the \naftermath of the Israeli election, which were decisively won by Netanyahu's Likud party.  Netanyahu's victory was at \nleast partially attributed to his controversial remarks warning Jewish voters that Arab Israelis would be \"turning out \nin droves\" at the polls, and asserting that there would be no Palestinian state under his watch.  In the wake of that \nlatter statement, the Obama administration in the United States warned Israel that it would be \"reassessing\" its \nrelationship and its stance on Middle East diplomacy.   \n\nFor his part, Netanyahu attempted to reverse the clear political damage made by these two statements. First, he \napologized publicly to Arab Israelis for the divisive rhetoric. Then, he insisted to the United States that he still \nsupported a \"two-state solution\" (i.e. an independent Palestinian state living side by side the Jewish state of Israel \nin peace and security), but claimed that he intended to simply point out that the conditions for the peace process \nwere not optimal. As stated by Netanyahu in an interview with MSNBC News: \"I haven't changed my policy. I never \nretracted my speech in Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes \nthe Jewish state. What has changed is the reality.\"   \n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States made clear it was not prepared to accept Netanahu's \nprevarication.  JOsh Earnest, the White House spokesperson, warned of \"consequences\" for Israel.  In his \nconference with the White House press corps, Earnest said, \"He [Netanyahu]  walked back from commitments that \nIsrael had previously made to a two-state solution.  It is ... cause for the United States to evaluate what our path is \nforward.\"   \n\nOn the radar could be the United States' stance at the United Nations.  To date, it has only been the United States' \nveto at the Security Council that has prevented Palestinians from successfully garnering official recognition as a \nnation state.  The United States has insisted that Palestinian statehood should be arrived at diplomatically, and via \nthe established peace process, predicated on a two state solution.  But with Netanyahu making the bold claim that \nthere would be no Palestinian state so long as he remained prime minister, the entire foundation of the two state \nsolution was now damanged.  Thus, the door was now open for the United States to change its calculus -- and \naccordingly, its behavior at the Security Council.  White House spokesperson Earnest addressed this very issue, \nsaying, \"Steps that the United States has taken at the United Nations had been predicated on this idea that the two-\nstate solution is the best outcome. Now our ally in these talks has said that they are no longer committed to that \nsolution.\"   \n\nNote: On April 2, 2015, after marathon talks in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran issued a joint statement \nannouncing that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a historic framework \nagreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached.  As stated by the European Union foreign policy chief, \nFederica Mogherini,  \"We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.\"  A \nrigorous program of verification would remain in place  to  corroborate Iran's adherence to the terms of the \nagreement  and to ensure that Iran meets its obligations.  Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   concluded \nthat the deal  needed additional measures included, such as  a \"clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of \nIsrael's right to exist.\"   However, United States President Obama himself entered the equation, insisted that  the \nframework agreement would be good for global security, as it would \"cut off every pathway that Iran could take to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon.\"   \n\n\n\nNote: It was yet to be determined if the nuclear negotiations would actually end in a viable and enduring deal.   \n\nSpecial Entry   \n\nSaudi King's decision to skip meeting in U.S. sparks speculation of rift with Washington D.C.   \n\nRelations between Saudi Arabia and the United States have been strained in 2015 due to ongoing nuclear \nnegotiations between the global powers and Iran.  Already, Saudi Arabia was alarmed by Iran's increasing \nascendancy in the region in Iraq and Yemen, and dismayed at the United States' eagerness to forge an Iranian \nnuclear deal.  The United States' reticence about getting involved in Yemen where Iranian-backed Houthis have \nusurped the authority of the Sadi-allied and democratically-elected President Hadi has been regarded as another \npressure point on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States.    \n\nGiven this background, the decision in mid-May 2015 by the new Saudi monarch, King Salman, to skip a security \nsummit Gulf leaders  at Camp David in the United States sparked speculation of a growing rift with Washington \nD.C.  That speculation was particularly high since King Salman had initially accepted the invitation by United States \nPresident Barack Obama to the leaders of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to attend the Camp David \nsummit;  however, King Salman announced his decision to skip the meeting only a few days ahead  of time.   \n\nFor its part,  the Obama administration in the United States was certainly banking on a successful meeting with \nGCC leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain,  and Oman.  The United \nStates president certainly hoped he would be able to argue in the future that the nuclear deal with Iran had the \nsupport of Arab countries in the region.  This summit was intended to focus on regional security and reassure GCC \ncountries that only a robust nuclear agreement with Iran would be accepted.   \n\nWith rumors percolating on the eve of the summit of a snub by the Saudi monarch, the White House in the United \nStates was eager to set the record straight.  White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, dismissed notions of a rift \nwith Saudi Arabia and made clear that officials from that country had not conveyed any concerns over the agenda \nfor the summit.  Earnest also emphasized the White House's confidence that any leaders or officials attending the \nsummit would be fully capable of representing their countries' interests and moving forward with any decisions \nmade at the meeting.  Saudi Arabia also entered the fray to shut down speculation of an imbroglio with the United \nStates. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir emphatically declared, \"This idea that this is a snub because the King \ndid not attend is really off-base.\"   \n\nIn fact, Saudi Arabia's decision to send the newly-named   Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef to Washington D.C. \nin King Salman's stead could be interpreted as a positive development.   Of significance was the fact that \nMohammed bin Nayef was named as the new Crown Prince only a week prior.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin \nNayef held extraordinary security credentials as Saudi Arabia's Minister of the Interior and also enjoyed a close \nrelationship with the United States. In fact, Washington warmly applauded King Salman's decision to name \nMohammed bin Nayef as his heir apparent.   \n\nAlso attending the summit would be Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the  son of King Salman and the \ncountry's  defense minister.  Of note was the fact that Mohammed bin Salman was leading Saudi Arabia's effort \nagainst the Houthi rebellion in Yemen. His attendance at the summit was not only relevant, it would also likely help \nseal a close working relationship between the United States and the younger generation of the Saudi royal family.     \n\nNote:  At the time of writing, reports were emerging of Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats firing on a \nSingaporean-flagged  cargo shipping vessel in the Persian Gulf.  That vessel transited from international waters into \nwaters under jurisdiction of the United Arab Emirates when the Iranian boats retreated. This act of aggression by \nIran in the strategic Persian Gulf area was likely to exacerbate regional tensions and bolster Arab countries' \ncomplaints about Iranian behavior on the global scene.   \n\n\n\nSpecial Entry   \n\nSpecial Report: P5+1 multilateral negotiations result in historic framework deal on Iran's nuclear program; \nagreement marks a significant achievement in  diplomacy for the benefit of global security    \n\nSummary:   \n\nThe international community has been focused on aggressive multilateral negotiations  between Iran and the P5+1 \ncountries of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, aimed at arriving at a \nlandmark nuclear deal.  At issue was the goal of forging an accord that would regulate Iran's nuclear program, its \nstockpile of enriched uranium, and curtail Iran's ability to develop a nuclear bomb.  For Iran, the objectives were \ntwofold.  First, Iran hoped to  prove that its nuclear development was for peaceful purposes and not aimed at \nweaponization, as charged by the West. Second, Iran was keen to end a painful international  sanctions regime that \nhas badly damaged Iran's economy.   \n\nGoing back to January 2014,  an interim Iranian nuclear deal went into force. Under the terms of that interim \nagreement, Iran began the process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium \nexpected to be eliminated within a six-month period. There were also provisions for  inspections  at the Arak heavy \nwater reactor and the Fordo uranium enrichment site close to Qom.  While the interim deal constituted only a first \nstep in the diplomatic track, it was certainly a significant development in that process aimed at establishing an \nenduring accord. Indeed, it represented a sea change in Iran's relationship with the United States, which was \nactively evolving from one singularly marked by hostility to one of (albeit limited) engagement. Now, with a final \nnuclear deal at stake, it was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.   \n\nAt the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a \nlong-term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend \nthe negotiating process. Finally, in April  2015, after marathon talks, the P5+1 countries and Iran announced that \nthe hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a framework agreement on Iran's nuclear \nprogram had been reached. The agreement presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final \n\"hard\"  deadline on June 30, 2015.  The prevailing question  continued to dominate:  Could a final accord on Iran's \nnuclear program be forged?  Nevertheless, the framework agreement  marked a massive breakthrough in the realm \nof international diplomacy for the purpose of global security.   \n\nPolitical resistance from rival Republicans and skeptical Democrats in the United States Congress and from Iran \nitself could upend the deal.   Nevertheless, new rounds of nuclear negotiations commenced later in the spring of \n2015 with an eye on forging  a sustainable final accord.  That final agreement  finally emerged on July 14, 2015, \nand, as expected,  evoked passionate resistance from hardliners at home in Tehran, and in other capitals across \nthe world, including Washington D.C.   \n\nOver the course of the rest of July 2015 and then through August 2015, the Obama administration in the United \nStates was busy lobbying members of Congress to support the deal.  The goal was to gain enough support to \nsustain the expected presidential veto on a so-called \"disapproval resolution\" being advanced by Republicans in \nthe legislative chambers, with support from skeptical Democrats. Of course, the detrators of the deal were also \ndoing their part to garner enough support to override the expected presidential veto.  But by the start of September \n2015, all signs posted to a political victory for President Obama and his administration's diplomatic efforts.  Indeed, \nthe Obama administration garnered enough Congressional support for the deal. Debate and voting on the \n\"disapproval resolution\"  commenced in the second week of September 2015, with Democrats successfully blocking \na vote in the Senate.   \n\nNote: Regardless of the political dimensions, the Iranian nuclear accord was being celebrated as a historic \ndevelopment in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.   \n\n\n\nSee below for the major developments leading up to the deadline for a proposed landmark accord.   \n\nEconomic Imperatives for Iran:   \n\nThere were serious economic imperatives that could nudge Iran in the direction of productive negotiations.  Due to \nthe harsh international sanctions regime,  Iran has had to overcome steep obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving \npayments for its oil  exports. In places where Iran was still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds \ndue to prevailing sanctions, especially those levied by the United States. But if Iran was not able to sell its typical  \n2.6 million barrels of oil a day, or, if it was forced to  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue \ninevitably had a debilitating effect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.   \n\nIn 2013, United States data sources indicated that the crippling sanctions imposed by the Western countries on \nIran  were exacting a heavy toll.  Indeed, these United States statistics showed Iranian oil exports tumbling to a 26-\nyear low.  The United States Department of Energy estimated that Iran's oil exports earned less than $70 billion \nbillion in 2012 -- a  27 percent decrease as compared with  $95 billion in 2011.  As well, the  International Energy \nAgency -- a  watchdog entity --  estimated Iran lost more than $40 billion in export revenues in 2012.   \n\nWhile Iran was mitigating the effects of devolving oil exports via higher oil prices (at the time), and despite trying to \ncircumvent the sanctions on Iran's central bank by trading oil for goods, there were reports that Iran was storing an \nunusually large volume of oil in supertankers in the Persian Gulf.  This was due to dwindling purchasers from Asian \nmarkets.  As noted by the Financial Times, all expectations were that Iran would eventually have to  cut its already \nlow production, which would exacerbate its burgeoning economic crisis.  With Iranians feeling the pain of the \nsanctions  in the form of inflation, the sliding  value of its currency (the rial),  and high unemployment,  economic \nanxieties and public discontent characterized the socio-economic climate in Iran.   \n\nIt was, thus, not surprising that the  newly-inaugurated President Rouhani's first speech at the helm included a call \nfor an end to the crippling sanctions against Iran. Of course, Rouhani had to be aware that those sanctions were not \nabout to dissipate without diplomatic progress and measurable policy changes as regards Iran's nuclear program.   \nIt was to be seen how far Rouhani would be willing to go -- in terms of serious diplomatic engagement over its \nnuclear program --in order to lift Iran out of its dismal  state of international alienation.   \n\nDemands of the West:   \n\nIt should be noted that the P5+1 countries have called on Iran to stop its production and stockpiling  of 20 percent \nenriched uranium (a capacity en route to the degree of enrichment needed to develop a nuclear weapon).  They \nhave also asked that Iran close its underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, close to the city of Qom, \nwhere most of the higher-grade enrichment is produced. Another demand entailed Iran ending its construction of a \nnuclear reactor in Arak. The United States was looking for verifiable evidence that Iran was taking action on such \nmeasures.  Should these actions be taken, the P5+1 countries said they would entertain the possibility of easing the \ncrippling sanctions regime that has terribly damaged Iran's economy.  That being said, it is worth noting that without \nthe pressure of this very crippling sanctions regime, it was hard to imagine that President Rouhani would have been \nelected to power in Iran in the first place, or that he would be engaging in diplomacy at all.  As such, the success of \nthe Obama administration's soft power approach of \"smart sanctions\" have to be acknowledged as the mean by \nwhich Iran was compelled to return to the diplomatic table.   \n\nMain Developments from 2013 through 2014 --   \n\nAn interim breakthrough deal was  forged on Iranian nuclear program in November 2013. The central provisions of \nthe interim deal were as follows:   \n\n\n\n- Iran would  curtail its nuclear activities for an initial six-month period   \n- Iran's uranium enrichment activities would be limited to levels below five percent purity -- the level needed to make \na nuclear bomb   \n- Iran would neutralize its stockpile of near-20 percent enriched uranium (via dilution to less than five percent or \nconversion to a form that cannot be further enriched)   \n- Iran would refrain from installing further centrifuges used to enrich uranium   \n- Iran would ensure that at least half of the centrifuges at the Natanz and Fordo enrichment facilities were \ninoperable   \n- Iran would halt work on the construction of its heavy-water reactor at Arak and refrain from  plutonium production \nthere   \n- Iran would provide access to its nuclear facilities to international inspectors in order to verify that it was keeping its \ncommitments   \n- In return for these moves, Iran would garner limited relief from sanctions and would not be subject to further \nsanctions for a period of six months   \n\nThe  accord represented a sea change in Iran's relationship with the United States in particular,  which was actively \nevolving from one marked by hostility  to one of engagement. On the issue of engagement, it should be noted that \nthe United States and Iran had been carrying out clandestine face-to-face meetings over the course of the year -- \nbeginning prior to the election of President Rouhani.   According to a report by the Associated Press,  William Burns \n-- the United States Deputy Secretary of State --  and Jake Sullivan -- the senior foreign policy adviser to Vice \nPresident Joe Biden -- convened meetings with Iranian officials several times earlier in 2013, with some of their \ntalks taking place in the country of Oman.  These meetings, which were authorized by United States President \nBarack Obama,  were kept hidden from United States allies, including Israel, until September 2013.   \n\nOf key importance was the realization that this agreement with Iran was not simply a sudden development resulting \nfrom marathon negotiating sessions only in the month of November 2013.  Instead, the accord was the fruit of \nPresident Obama's vision of outreach to Iran, matched by time-consuming diplomacy, and  marked by several key \nconfidence-building steps aimed at dispelling the doubt, dissonance, suspicion, and even enmity that had, until this \ntime, characterized United States-Iranian relations. Indeed, the revelations about secret meetings with the Iranians \ngave weight to the view that Barack Obama had been serious when he advocated for direct negotiations with Iran \nback in 2008 during his campaign  for the presidency of the United States.  Barack Obama's outreach towards Iran \nwas pilloried by hardline factions in the United States in 2008, although it was this policy of vigorous diplomacy that \ngained him support during the primary election process from a United States citizenry weary from wars already \ntaking place at the time in Iraq an Afghanistan.  Since becoming president, Barack Obama's \"smart sanctions\" \napproach to pressuring Iran was also subject to complaint and criticism from conservatives in the United States \npolitical sphere, who were calling for a military solution instead.   \n\nIdeological differences aside, there was no debating the fact that it was the Obama administration's  imposition of \n\"smart sanctions\" that compelled Iran to come to the negotiating table in 2013.  In fact, \"smart sanctions\" may have \neven driven the Iranian  populace --  now tired of economic pressures such as inflation wrought by these punishing \nsanctions --  to select the most moderate of the presidential candidates  in that country's 2013 election.  Certainly, \nthe election of Rouhani in Iran appeared to have acted as an imprimatur for diplomacy and engagement by the \nIranian political establishment.   \n\nIn January 2014,  a date was set for the Iranian nuclear deal to go into force.  On Jan. 20, 2014, the landmark \nnuclear deal went into effect with Iran starting the process of curbing uranium enrichment.  On that day, Iran would \nbegin the process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium expected to be \neliminated within a six-month period.   As well, there would be provisions for monthly inspections  at the Arak heavy \nwater reactor, and daily access made available to nuclear inspectors to the Fordo uranium enrichment site near the \nholy city of Qom.   \n\n\n\nA day later on Jan. 21, 2014, the IAEA said that  the first round of inspections went well and, as such,   there was a \nneed to  double the size of the inspection team used to monitor nuclear activity.  It should be noted that  the IAEA \nconfirmed that  Iran had ceased enriching uranium above five percent purity mark at both the Nantaz and Fordo \nfacilities.  Meanwhile, the Iranian media was reporting that the centrifuges used for enrichment at the Natanz plant \nwere disconnected.    \n\nMoving forward to February 2014, the attention was on the negotiations aimed at finding a permanent resolution to \nIran's controversial nuclear program.  For the West, that hypothetical agreement would delineate the parameters of \nan acceptable  nuclear program for Iran and  alleviate their suspicions about Iran's ambitions to build a nuclear \nbomb.  For its part, Iran has consistently insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only; however, \nIran has had a poor record of cooperating with the IAEA,  and its secretive activities at clandestine nuclear facilities \nhave only added to the West's anxieties.   \n\nThe IAEA noted at the start of March 2014 that although much work remained, Iran was nonetheless meeting its \nobligations to reduce its nuclear stockpile as required by the prevailing nuclear deal.  Of particular note was the \ndilution of its stock of higher-enriched uranium to a lower fissile concentration that would be unsuitable for making \nan  atomic bomb.  Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, said that Iran had made enough progress to warrant \nreceipt of a March 1, 2014, installment of  funds previously blocked by sanctions (the total in this case would be \nabout $450 million).   \n\nAt the same time, the West continued to pressure Iran to address its  suspicions over the design and manufacture \nof an atomic bomb -- activity Iran has insisted was not occurring.  The United States warned that Iran would have to \nsatisfy the West's doubts on this matter if they were to forge a final settlement over Tehran's nuclear program.   \n\nMultilateral talks in March 2014 were marked by a willingness to negotiate, juxtaposed against tensions due to \ndisagreements on the future of the Arak heavy water reactor that could potentially produce plutonium for the \nmanufacture of atomic bombs.  Another source of contention centered on the level of uranium enrichment to be \nconducted in Iran. There were no resolutions forged on these matters and the two sides simply agreed to meet \nagain in April 2014.   \n\nMeanwhile, as the March 2014 talks were taking place, revelations emerged about  Iran's continued purchase of \nprohibited components links with the country's nuclear program.  According to Vann Van Diepen,  the Principal \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation, said Iran was still forming front \ncompanies that were being used to conceal their nuclear procurement activities.   \n\nIn April 2014, the world's nuclear watchdog group -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- announced  \nthat Iran had \"reduced its stockpile of higher enriched uranium by  half, in keeping with a prevailing nuclear \nagreement aimed at easing the harsh sanctions regime against Iran.  To be specific, Iran diluted half of its higher \nenriched uranium reserves to a fissile levels unsuitable for nuclear proliferation. As well, Iran has continued to \nconvert the other half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium into oxide for making reactor fuel.   \n\nAt the start of July 2014, United States Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns was expected to participate in \nmultilateral negotiations in the Austrian capital of Vienna aimed at finalizing a long-term nuclear deal  by July 20, \n2014.  Burns' participation indicated the possibility of bilateral negotiations  between the United States and Iran on \nmatters beyond the nuclear politics, quite possibly touching upon the security crisis rocking Iraq at the hands of \nSunni extremist terrorists.   \n\nWith an eye on facilitating a productive path, it was  soon announced that United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, along with the foreign ministers from  the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China, would be \njoining the negotiating table.  The presence of the six foreign ministers from the P5+1 nation states was not \nnecessarily a sign that a long-term deal to resolve concerns over Iran's nuclear could be reached by the July 20, \n2014, deadline. Instead, the conventional wisdom remained that  an extension of the existing deal was likely \n\n\n\nnecessary, but to even reach that point, the distance between negotiating positions had to be narrowed.  The \nparticipation of the top diplomats from the P5+1 nation states  was more than likely aimed at narrowing that gap.   \n\nBy July 14, 2014, following the conclusion of this round of nuclear talks in Vienna, United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry made clear that if Iran wanted to secure a long-term agreement with the world powers and bring an end \nto damaging sanctions, it would have to reduce  its capacity to make nuclear fuel. In an address to the media, \nSecretary of State Kerry said, \"We have made it crystal clear that the 19,000 (nuclear centrifuges) that are currently \npart of their program is too many.\"   \n\nFor its part, Iran was attempting to advance an alternative path with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad \nZarif suggesting that Iran might keep its enrichment program at existing levels  for a few years (essentially an \nextended \"pause\"), while also holding onto the 19,000 centrifuges it had installed for an industrial-scale uranium \nenrichment program.  However, the P5+1 countries were not as interested in that type of concession as they were \nseeking to ensure that Iran simply did not pursue nuclear fuel needed for the manufacturing of a nuclear bomb.  In \nfact, as noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the  very notion that Iran  would be able to keep all of \nits existing centrifuges was simply \"out of the question.\"   \n\nAs expected, on July 18, 2014, it was announced that the deadline for reaching a deal on Iran's nuclear program \nwould be extended for four months until November 2014.   The extension would provide all parties with more time to \nengage in nuclear negotiations, with the goal of achieving a final deal by Nov. 24, 2014. A joint statement issued by \nthe European Union foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton,  and Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, \nread as follows: \"There are still significant gaps on some core issues which will require more time and effort.\"   \n\nDuring the four-month extension period, most sanctions against Iran would remain in place; however, Iran would be \npermitted to access an additional $2.8 billion of its frozen assets.  United States Secretary of State John Kerry said \nthat in exchange for the access to these funds, Iran would continue to use its most problematic stores of uranium \n(those enriched to a level of 20 percent) for  a research reactor that is used to make medical isotopes. Kerry also \naddressed the contentious issues requiring more negotiations as he said, \"There are very real gaps on issues such \nas enrichment capacity at the Natanz enrichment facility. This issue is an absolutely critical component of any \npotential comprehensive agreement. We have much more work to do in this area, and in others as well.\"   \n\nNOTE: As of 2015, a negotiations extension remained in place with an eye on finally forging a deal or at least at \nending the negotiations process aimed at a final agreement.   \n\n2015 Update on Nuclear Negotiations:   \n\nAs of March 2015, despite a diplomatic contretemps between the United States and Israel over multilateral nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran, the diplomatic process was ongoing.   \n\nThat contretempts reached new heights on March 3, 2015, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  went \nto Capitol Hill in the United States to give an address to Congress. In that speech, he warned that the nuclear deal \nbeing negotiated by global powers and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, would actually herald a nuclearized Iran.  To \nthis end, he said, \"This deal doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb, it paves Iran's path to the bomb.\" Disparaging \nthe efforts being carried out by United States Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterparts from the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China,  Netanyahu said: \"We've been told that no deal is better than a bad \ndeal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal.\"   \n\nNot surprisingly, the Israeli leader had harsh words regarding Iran, reminding the chamber -- and the worlds -- that \n\"Iran's regime is as radical as ever, the ideology is deeply rooted in militant Islam... it will always be an enemy of \nU.S.\"  He also noted that the Iranian imprint was growing in the Middle East, as it meddled in the affairs of countries \n\n\n\nsuch as Iraq and Yemen, while backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  To this end, Nentanyahu said that Iran was on \na \"march of conquest, subjugation and terror.\"   \n\nNetanyahu's speech, despite the boycott by as many as 60 Democrats, was well-received by the Republican-\ndominated Congress.  Indeed, Republicans in Congress made a point to giving the Israeli leader a far warmer \nreception, with more boisterous applause than had been conveyed to President Barack Obama at the State of the \nUnion less than two months earlier.   \n\nFor its part, the White House blasted the Israeli prime minister's address as being filled by rhetoric and short of \ngood ideas. As noted by President Obama himself after the Netanyahu visit to Capitol Hill, \"On the core issue, \nwhich is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the prime \nminister [Netanyahu] did not offer any viable alternatives.\"   \n\nNevertheless, the fact of the matter was that Netanyahu's address was a political success that would likely help him \nwith hardline voters at home, while currying favor with hardliners across party lines in the United States.  Of course, \nit was more difficult to ascern whether the Netanyahu speech was necessarily in the best interests of the United \nStates.   \n\nThe reality was that without an agreement of some sort, Iran would likely move forward with the pursuit of its \nnuclear program, which could potentially involve bomb production. Indeed, it was only the interim nuclear deal (set \nto expire in mid-2015), which created the space for nuclear negotiations to take place, that had brought any halt to \nIranian nuclear acitivites.  Before the interim agreement was forged, despite the imposition of harsh sanctions, Iran \nwas producing centrifuges and fissile material. Without a nuclear accord going forward, Iran would be free to \nresume unfettered nuclear activities.   \n\nOf note was the fact that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have viewed the Iranian nuclear problem \ndifferently.  For President Obama, the imperative has always been the same: To prevent Iran from producing a \nnuclear bomb.  But for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the objective has been to prevent Iran from having nuclear \ncapability.  While the two respective goals overlap, they must be understood distinctly.   \n\nA good deal for President Obama would be one in which Iran's nuclear program is curtailed, regulated, and \nmonitored to the extent that its breakout time for creating a bomb would be lengthy and difficult.  No deal would \nlikely be acceptable to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was determined to see Iran's nuclear capability ended in \ntotality, and all of its nuclearfacilities dismantled.  Short of military action, it was difficult to see how Netanyahu's \ngoals would be accomplished.  But even military strikes would  be risky since multiple sites -- from the uranium \nenrichment plants at Natanz and Fordo, to the heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak, not to mention an array of \nlaboratories and mines at stake.   \n\nOf significance was the fact  that the very case by Israel (at least, as conveyed by Netanyahu) was being tarred by \nquestions of credibility.  At issue was the release of a cache of confidential intelligence documents that appeared to \ncontradict Netanyahu's claims about Iran being imminently positioned to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Leaked \ncables -- reportedly from South African intelligence. but which were shared with certain news outlets -- indicated \nthat in an address before the United Nations in 2012, the Israeli leader misrepresented Iran's progress on nuclear \ndevelopment, and even contradicted Israel's own Mossad secret service to make that claim.   \n\nGoing back to 2012, Netanyahu famously stood before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon \ndepiction of a bomb with a red line and declared that Iran would be positioned to build a nuclear weapons the \nfollowing year.  As such, he demanded global action to prevent Iran from achieving that end.  Now, however, in \n2015, the leaked documents, whch were shared with Al-Jazeera and published by The Guardian newspaper,  \nincluded conclusions from Israel's own Mossad intelligence agency that Iran was \"not performing the activity \nnecessary to produce weapons.\"  The Mossad briefing did note that Iran appeared to be moving in a direction \n\n\n\n\"which will reduce the time required to produce weapons.\"  However, the Mossad briefing also asserted that Iran \n\"does not appear to be ready\" to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons.  (The \nmanufacture of a nuclear bomb would require enrichment of 90 percent.)   \n\nIt should be noted that in response to the revelations ensconced in these leaked documents, the Israeli government \nsaid there was little difference in Netanyahu's claims as compared with Mossad's findings.  Both agreed  that Iran \nwas indeed seeking to manufacture a nuclear bomb.   \n\nRegardless of Iran's actual intent or the actual timeline at stake, the difficult diplomatic work of trying to forge an \nagreement that would prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon was ongoing.   \n\nIt should be noted that in the aftermath of the Netanyahu speech, United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nwarned that simply demanding Iran's capitulation was unlikely to compel that country to voluntarily halt its nuclear \ndevelopment program.  Kerry's remarks intimated criticism for the muscular language emitted by the Israeli leader, \nwhich were heavy on rhetoric but unlikely to achieve actual results. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry noted that the \ndiplomatic path presented a serious path forward.  He said,  \"No one has presented a more viable, lasting \nalternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. So folks, simply demanding that Iran \ncapitulate is not a plan. And nor would any of our P5+1 partners support us in that position.\" At the same time, \nSecretary of State Kerry made clear that the while the hard work of diplomacy was yielding results, there remained \n\"significant gaps and important choices that need to be made\" by Iran.   \n\nIn Iran, President Hassan Rouhani emphasized his country's position. Rouhani indicated that Iran was prepared to \nsubject itself to greater scrutiny, in order to satisfy the international community's concerns about nuclear weapons \nproduction.  But at the same time, he reiterated Iran's long-standing stance that it was entitled to nuclear \ndevelopment.  Rouhani said, \"If the basis of these negotiations is for increased transparency, we will accept greater \ntransparency. But if the negotiations are trying to prevent the people of Iran from their inalienable right, in other \nwords advancement in science and technology, it is very natural that Iran will not accept such an understanding or \nagreement.\"   \n\nOf course, concerns about Iranian nuclear development, and a potential nuclear deal, extended not only to Israel \nbut also to the Sunni Arab world.  Of note was the ever-increasing sectarian divide between Shi'ites and Sunnis in \nthe Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring in 2011. With this schism only deepening, \nSunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia, were increasingly concerned about an ascendant Shi'ite Iran.  Indeed, Iran \nalready had its imprint in the Syria-Lebanon area due to tacit support of Hezbollah, and had tightened its alliance \nwith Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era, and was now believed to be clandestinely backing the Shi'ite Zaidi \nrebellion (known as the Houthi rebellion) in Yemen.  The notion of a nuclearized Iran, already with its tentacles \nstretching across the region, was not regarded positively by several Arab countries. Accordingly, Secretary of State \nKerry traveled to Saudi Arabia to calm the anxieties of several Sunni Arab countries, including  Bahrain, Kuwait, \nOman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia itself, regarding a potential Iranian nuclear deal.   \n\nSpeaking to this issue, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"For all the objections that any country has to Iranian activities \nin the region, and believe me, we have objections and others in the world have objections, the first step is to \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\"  At stake was the goal of reaching the \"right deal,\" which Kerry said \nwould  \"close off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon.\"   \n\nTo that end, the diplomatic track was continuing and the latest round of multilateral talks -- involving the United \nStates, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany,  Russia, and China -- appeared to be making progress, with all \neyes on late March 2015 as a possible timeline for a deal, with the details ironed out and solidified by a mid-2015 \ndeadline.   \n\n\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the negotiations were productive, saying to the media: \n\"We made progress.\"  His Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,  said they were forging \"a \nbetter understanding\" at the negotiating table.   \n\nThe comprehensive pact appeared to be geared towards constraining Iran's nuclear breakout capability, and \nrestricting Iran's nuclear activities for a 10-year period, with an easing of restrictions on nuclear development after \nthat time. Under consideration was a plan to deal with most of Iran's enriched uranium externally, or to convert it to \na form that would not be easily used in weapons development.  Overall, there would be strict curbs on Iranian \nnuclear development for a decade, particularly with regard to the handling of enriched uranium and the number of \ncentrifuges at stake.  But there would also be \"rewards\" of sorts  for Iranian compliance and cooperation in the form \nof gradually eased restrictions and the lifting of sanctions.  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, would play a central role in any proposed deal, and  would have the primary \nresponsibility of monitoring Iran's compliance and cooperation.   \n\nIn the second week of March 2015, in the wake of the controversial Netanyahu address to Congress, 47 \nRepublican senators published an open letter to Iran.  The  signatories to that document sought to instruct the \nIranian goverment about United States constitutional law, which they suggested the Iranians might not \"fully \nunderstand.\" The letter, which was spearheaded by freshman Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, made \nthe claim that  any nuclear deal that might emerge from the negotiations in Switzerland would be \"nothing more \nthan an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,\" and thus require congressional \napproval while being subject to revocation by a future president.  To this end, the letter included the following \nsentence: \"The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future \nCongresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.\"   \n\nIt was difficult to interpret the missive as anything other than a transparent attempt to undermine President Barack \nObama's leadership in the realm of foreign policy. Indeed, editorials from more than 22 cities across the country \nexcoriated the 47 Republican senators for their action, which they characterized as a reckless and partisan stunt. \nSome newspaper boards even argued that by dispatching that missive, te 47 Republican senators were marching \nthe country down the road of war.  Almost all the editorials vociferously criticized the 47 Republican senators for \nbetraying the national interests of the United States, whose constitution, accords broad authority to the president to \nconduct foreign policy.   \n\nFrom the Senate,  Minority Leader Harry Reid -- the top Democrat in the upper chamber -- minced no words as he \ndeclared: \"Let's be clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.\" \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in \n2016, entered the fray, saying that the letter's signatories could only be motivated by one of the following two \nrationales. She said, \"There appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the \nIranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer \ndoes discredit to the letter's signatories.\" White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said the letter was intended to \nundermine diplomacy and could spur a \"rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option.\"   \n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama responded to the infamous letter by accusing the 47 Republican senators of \n\"interfering\" in nuclear negotiations -- an arena typically reserved for the executive branch of government.  He also  \nsardonically noted that the 47 signatories constituted an \"unusual coalition\" with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, \nwho have also opposed the nuclear negotiations.  As noted by President Obama: \"I think it's somewhat ironic to see \nsome members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It's an unusual coalition.\"  \nVice President Joe Biden -- a former Senator himself and the official president of the upper chamber -- was more \nvituperative in his condemnation. Vice President Biden said that the letter from the 47 Republicans was \"beneath \nthe dignity of an institution I revere.\" He added, \"In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another \n\n\n\ninstance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that \nthe president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,\"   \n\nOf significance was the reaction by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif, who dismissed the letter as a \n\"propaganda ploy.\" Zarif said, \"In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.  It is very \ninteresting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political \npressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, \nunprecedented in diplomatic history.  This indicates that like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential \nthreat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.\"   \n\nEducated in the United States himself, the Iranian foreign minister did not shy away from showing his own \nconstitutional chops, intimating that the Republican Senators who signed onto the letter may not been fully \nconversant with the United States Constitution. To this end, Zarif said, \"A change of administration does not in any \nway relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible \nagreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.\"  Zarif also noted that a move by a future president to dismantle \na yet-to-be-achieved nuclear agreement would be in contravention to international jurisprudence, saying, \"I wish to \nenlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, \nit will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"   \n\nTo be sure, the letter from the 47 Republican senators emphasized the view that any deal would have to be ratified \nby the upper house of the Congress.  However, both Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry pointed out that the vast majority of international agreements forged in recent decades have been  \nexecutive measures and not treaties requiring ratification by the Senate.   \n\nMoreover, any deal emerging from the nuclear talk would be neither a bilateral agreement nor a conventional treaty \nbetween nation state.  Instead, it would be a multilateral accord, forged by the P5+1 countries, including all \npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The accord would likely activated as a Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, then sealed under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council, and thus would \nin fact not be subject to modification by Congress. In this regard, it would be follow on the heels of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, and 1929 that have also dealt with Iran's nuclear \nprogram.  Neither a Republican-controlled Senate  nor a future president would be positioned to unilaterally  \nreverse the terms of a potential accord of this sort.   \n\nCongress, with its power of the purse, could certainly  place certain limits on President Obama or any future \npresident as regards sanctions to be levied upon Iran (or any other country).  However, Congress cannot summarily \noverride international obligations forged in a multilateral frame, and which would be structured as an international \nmeasure, without  being in  flagrant breach of international law.   \n\nBeyond the legal perils at stake, there were political perils to consider. The fact of the matter was that any post-\nObama president would be placed in a precarious position within the world community for violating an agreement \nreached and understood as a matter of international consensus.   \n\nMeanwhile, there were rumblings in regards to violations of domestic law when some observers noted that the letter \nto Iran could be regarded as a violation of the 18th century Logan Act.   To be precise, the Logan Act prohibits any \n\"Private correspondence with foreign governments\" and reads; \"Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may \nbe, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence \nor intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or \nconduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies \nwith the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned \nnot more than three years, or both.\"  In truth, it was unlikely that a law dating back to 1799 would be used to \n\n\n\nprosecute the 47 senators; however, its discussion has only added to the level of scandal and drama surrounding a \npotential landmark multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program.   \n\nReturning to the issue of the prevailing nuclear negotiations -- the fact of the matter was that nuclear talks continued \nin Switzerland in the third week of March 2015. The principal parties acknowledged that progress was being made, \nparticularly with regard to technical provisions.  Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, \nexpressed delight over his productive meetings with United States Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz, saying, \"We \nhave made progress on technical issues. One or two issues remain and need to be discussed.\"  For his part, \nSecretary of State Kerry said, \"We're pushing some tough issues but we made progress.\"   \n\nHowever, other Western representatives had a different view. A State Department official told Reuters News, \"We \nare pretty far away. There are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. The Iranians must make substantial \nconcessions.\"  Moreover, as reported by Reuters News, an anonymous European negotiator said: \"Contrary to \nwhat the Iranians are saying with regard to 90 percent of an accord being done, that's not correct.  We are not close \nto an agreement.\"   \n\nClearly, another round of talks was anticipated to resolve a slate of remaining issues.  Of note was the West's \ninsistence that Iran's nuclear activities be curtailed and its nuclear breakout time be circumscribed to one year.  \nStated differently, an arrangement had to be made whereby Iran would need a full year to garner enough fissile \nmaterial (either high enriched uranium or plutonium before it could produce a nuclear weapon.  On the agenda for \ndiscussion was a plan to limit the  number of enrichment centrifuges Iran would be allowed to keep; other \nconsiderations included limits of the size of uranium stockpiles.   \n\nNote that on March 21, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated that progress was being made in nuclear \ntalks, setting the stage for a final deal.  He was quoted by Iranian state media as saying. \"There is nothing that \ncannot be resolved.\"  Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, emitted a very different tone from that of Iran's more \nmoderate president, Rouhani. In reference to President Obama's Persian Nowruz message to the Iranian people, in \nwhich the United State leader said a deal on Iran's nuclear program presented \"an historic opportunity to resolve \nthis issue peacefully,\"  Ayatollah  Khamenei  said that his country should not submit to the demands of the global \npowers. Khamenei noted, \"Basically, what he [Obama]  says in his message is that you must accept the terms we \ndictate in the nuclear talks so that jobs, investment, and economic activities will blossom in your country... this view \nwill never lead to any conclusions for us.\"  In many senses, Obama and Rouhani were in similar positions -- both \nwere pragmatic presidents, both were eager to improve bilateral relations between their countries, while meeting \nglobal security goals, yet both men were also politically at odds with the conservative and hardline elements in their \nown countries.   \n\nDays later, the landscape for negotiations could only be understood as uncertain.  The various sides appeared to \nbe deadlocked over certain sticking points. France was looking for more stringent restrictions on the Iranians -- a \nposition by France that was at odds with the other P5+1 countries.  Also at issue was the fact that France was not \nkeen on the notion of a quick suspension to United Nations sanctions against Iran -- a demand being made by the \nIranians.  Meanwhile, the United States was advocating that restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place \nfor at least 10 years, while France was looking for a 15 year timeline, along with 10 years of rigorous IAEA \nmonitoring. Other contentions centered on Iran's demand that it be allowed unfettered research and development of \nadvanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors, and ultimately are linked with \nweapons production.   \n\nNegotiations in mid-March 2015 abruptly ended when the Iranian delegation announced they were returning to \nTehran because President Hassan Rouhani's 90-year-old mother had died.  The break in negotiations was not \nbeing regarded as problematic; instead, all sides seemed to agree that talks would resume at the end of March \n2015.   \n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter was that  significant issues remained unresolved with Iran and the P5+1 countries far apart in \nsome regards.  Still, the consequences of not reaching a deal would likely destablize the world; as such, the \nimpetus for forging an agreement was strong and all expectations were that the March 2015 deadline would be \nextended again to give the negotiations process further time and space.  For all the players, the March 30, 2015, \ndeadline to reach a political framework agreement was not one to be held in stone.  Instead, they were looking at \nthe June 30, 2015, deadline for a final deal as being more pertinent.   \n\nBroken negotiations or breakthrough deal?   \n\nAt the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a \nlong term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend \nthe negotiating process.   \n\nAt issue were freshly emerging objections by Iran to the notion that it would ship its enriched uranium out of the \ncountry, where it would be unavailable for potential weaponization purposes.  Since a potential Iranian nuclear deal \nhas -- for years -- rested on this provision, Iran's insistence that its enriched uranium reside in Iranian possession \ncould be an unresolvable obstacle in the negotiations process.  Meanwhile, the other unresolved issues (discussed \nabove) -- from  the pace of lifting sanctions to strict monitoring restrictions --continued to pose challenges.  One \nIranian negotiator, Majid Takhteravanchi, signaled some intransigence as he said in an interview with the  Iranian \nFars news agency that the lifting of sanctions on Iranian terms was essential.  He said, \"There will be no agreement \nif the sanctions issue cannot be resolved. This issue is very important for us.\"   \n\nStill, the P5+1 parties agreed to continue the conversation.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, \"There still remain some difficult issues. We are working very hard to work those through.\"  Russian Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov sounded an optimistic note, saying that the chance of resolving the issues was high.  He \nsaid, \"The chances are high. They are probably not 100 percent but you can never be 100 percent certain of \nanything. The odds are quite doable  if none of the parties raise the stakes at the last minute.\" Of course, the \nIranians' objections to the removal of its enriched uranium could well be regarded as \"raising the stakes at the last \nminute.\"   \n\nLengthy and difficult talks continued at the Beau-Rivage Ralace hotel in the Swiss city of Lausanne. The March 31, \n2015, \"soft\" or self-imposed deadline actually passed, with all parties set on extending the negotiations.  All eyes \nwere now focused on the first week of April 2015 as a new target date to forge consensus on the structure of a final \naccord.   \n\nOn April 2, 2015, after marathon talks in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran issued a joint statement \nannouncing that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a historic framework \nagreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached.  As stated by the European Union foreign policy chief, \nFederica Mogherini,  \"We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.\"   \n\nThe terms of the agreement would ensure that a longer time horizon -- of one year -- needed by Iran  to enrich \nenough uranium for one nuclear weapon. This breakout period of one year would be held in place for a decade.  Of \nnote was the fact that Iran's existing breakout time was estimated to be only two months.   \n\nThe agreement would reduce the number of installed centrifuges from around the 19,000 Iran currently  has in its \npossession to 6,000;  all the centrifuges would be the less efficient  first-generation IR-1 enrichment models  while \nnewer-model centrifuges would be out of commission.  Of those 6,000 centrifuges, about 5,000 would be allowed to \nenrich uranium for 10 years. The remaining centrifuges would be moved to storage and controlled by the United \nNations'  nuclear watchdog group, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).   \n\n\n\nThe joint comprehensive plan of action would also ensure that Iran's actual stockpile of uranium would be reduced \nfrom 10,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms along a 15-year time horizon. As well,  Iran would \ncease construction on new uranium enrichment facilities for a 15-year period.   \n\nAlso central to the joint comprehensive plan of action were provisions to curtail Iran's enrichment facilities to the \nNatanz nuclear site, and convert the nuclear facilities at Fordo and Arak for purely research purposes.   \n\nAccording to a fact sheet from the Government of the United States, Iran would gain sanctions relief only if it \n\"verifiably abides by its commitments.\" That sanctions relief would apply to those nuclear-related measures \nintroduced by the United States and the European Union and not include sanctions related to terrorism and human \nrights abuses.  There would be a \"snap back\" measure so that the sanctions could be re-imposed  if Iran was not \ncompliant with the provisions of the deal.   \n\nAlso at stake would be prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iran's nuclear activities.  A new \nresolution would be introduced that would hold in place certain key provisions  relevant to \"sensitive\" nuclear \nactivities, while also addressing the new measures outlined above.   \n\nA rigorous program of verification would remain in place  to  corroborate Iran's adherence to the terms of the \nagreement  and to ensure that Iran meets its obligations.  For example, Iran would have to provide the IAEA with \nunfettered access to its nuclear facilities, uranium mines, and  centrifuge storage facilities, ensuring the IAEA \ninspectors could investigate any suspicious sites or covert activities.   \n\nIn an interview with Radio Free Europe, Kelsey Davenport, the director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms \nControl Association, explained that the non-proliferation parameters of the agreement were \"very strong.\"  \nDavenport said, \"This deal effectively blocks Iran's pathways to a weapon using both uranium and plutonium, and it \nputs in place stringent monitoring and verification to ensure that any deviation from the agreement or any covert \nprogram will be immediately detected.\"   \n\nMark Fitzpatrick, the director of the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for \nStrategic Studies, came to a similar conclusion.  In his interview with Radio Free Europe that the agreement would \nresult in a rigid nuclear verification regime.  Fitzpatrick explained that under the verification infrastructure, violations \nof the agreement at any point along the \"supply chain\" would be easy to discern.  He said, \"It would be detected \nvery quickly if Iran were to use any of its declared facilities.  If Iran were to try to hide something, that would also \nvery likely be detected because this deal -- the parameters -- include a lot of verification measures that go beyond \nthe normal IAEA monitoring.\"   \n\nThe successful framework agreement reached on April 2, 2015, marked a massive breakthrough in the realm of \ninternational diplomacy for the purpose of global security.   \n\nThe agreement  presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final \"hard\"  deadline on June 30, \n2015.  The prevailing question continued to dominate:  Can a final accord on Iran's nuclear program be forged?  \nThe answer to that question remained the same at the time of writing:  It was yet to be determined if the nuclear \nnegotiations would actually end in a viable and enduring deal.   \n\nPolitical Complications:   \n\nIn the initial aftermath of the framework announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed that his country \nwould abide by the terms of the agreement, saying in a national address, \"The world must know that we do not \nintend to cheat.\"  He warned of consequences if the partner states did not do their own part, saying, \"If the other \nside acts on its promises, Iran will abide by its promises. If, however, they one day decide to follow a different path, \nour nation too will be always free to make [another] choice.\"   \n\n\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, United States President Barack Obama was set to embark on a political campaign \nof sorts, as he hoped to persuade skeptical members of Congress that the Iranian nuclear deal was the best way of \nensuring Iran did not develop a nuclear weapon.  But he was immediately stymied by Israeli  Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu  who concluded that the deal  needed additional measures included, such as  a \"clear and \nunambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist.\"   \n\nThe Obama  administration, though, noted that the purpose of the agreement was carefully circumscribed to deal \nwith preventing Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. President Obama himself entered the equation, insisting that  \nthe framework agreement would be good for global security, as it would \"cut off every pathway that Iran could take \nto develop a nuclear weapon.\"  He added, \"We will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security and \nto do so peacefully.\"  It was to be seen if Obama would gain concurrence in the United States Congress, or, if \nhardliners would be able to cull together a veto-proof majority to force the president of the United States to seek \nCongressional approval of the deal.   \n\nAn additional complication was emanating from Iran itself, as that country demanded  immediate sanctions relief as \npart of the agreement.  To be precise, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that not only would all \nsanctions  have to be lifted on the day any deal is signed, but that military sites would be not be open to \ninternational nuclear inspectors. Clearly, immediate sanctions relief was not part of the blueprint unveiled on April 2, \n2015, while a rigorous program of verification stood as the bulwark of the very deal.  As such, the Ayatollah's \nstatements  raised questions as to whether or not a viable agreement was actually on the table.   \n\nAnother challenge was presented in the form of Russia's decision to lift a ban on missile deliveries to Iran while \ncommencing an oil-for-goods exchange.  These moves were  being met with concern from the Obama White House \nin the United States.  For Russia, though, it was evident that the plan was to immediately reap economic benefits \nfrom the cessation of sanctions against Iran.   United States Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to bring up \nthe subject for discussion with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.   \n\nSecretary of State Kerry, meanwhile, had his hands full at home in the United States, as he lobbied members of \nCongress to hold off on any legislation that might curtail his abilities to forge a solid final nuclear deal by the June \n30, 2015, deadline mentioned above.  At issue was the fact that hardliners in Congress have been eager to enter \nthe realm of foreign relations, and force any deal signed by the president to be subject to review by the legislative \nbranch of government.  While Congress' hand could not stop the president from signing onto the deal being \nnegotiated, the president would still have to gain cooperation from Congress to modify the sanctions regime against \nIran. President Obama has made clear that he would veto moves intended to blunt or undermine the ability of his \nadministration to negotiate  a final deal with the Iranians.   \n\nThe reality, however, was that President Obama could well be could be faced with a veto-proof super majority of \nbipartisan senators, who could conceivably impact his administration's negotiations.  As such, Secretary of State \nKerry, along with reasury Secretary Jack Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, were  eager to assure \nRepublicans and Democrats of the substance of the agreement, and gain their cooperation in allowig him more \ntime to finalize an acceptable nuclear deal with Iran.  Ahead of these key meetings with legislators, Kerry said, \"We \nhope Congress will listen carefully ... but also give us some space so we will be able to complete a very difficult \ntask.\"   \n\nNote that on April 14, 2015, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee crafted a compromise bill that include a \nmodest review period of 30 days for a final Iran nuclear deal.  The bill would also specify that sanctions relief  would \nbe dependent on  an end to Iran's support for terrorism, but it would do so in more malleable language.  It seemed \nthat the committee was hoping to avoid a showdown with the executive branch of government.  President Obama \nmade it known that he would support the compromise legislation in this new form.  According to White House \nspokesperson Josh Earnest, the president was \"not thrilled\" with the bill; however, he concluded that the new \nproposal was a more acceptable measure.  It was conceivable that the White House could change its stance if \n\n\n\nobjectionable amendments were attached to the compromise bill. The bill passed by the committee and would be \ntaken up by the full Senate.   \n\nMeanwhile, the negotiations process was ongoing, with a new round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 powers \nresuming in the last week of  April 2015.  United States  Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that serious \ndifferences remained between Iran and the global powers, but added that they were nonetheless closer than ever to \nforging a sustainable agreement with Iran.  Secretary of State Kerry said,  \"We are, in fact, closer than ever to the \ngood, comprehensive deal that we have been seeking, and if we can get there, the entire world will be safer.\" He \nadded, \"If finalized and implemented, (an agreement) will close off all of Iran's possible pathways to the nuclear \nmaterial required for a nuclear weapon and give the international community the confidence that it needs to know \nthat Iran's nuclear program is indeed exclusively peaceful.\"   \n\nAt the start of May 2015, those negotiations concluded, with emphasis on key sticking points --  namely the re-\nimposition of United Nations sanctions, should Iran violate the agreement, and the potential purchase of nuclear \ntechnology' known as a \"procurement channel.\"  The sanctions issue was being regarded as a particularly \nchallenging one, with concerns centering on crafting parameters that would allow for the automatic re-imposition of  \nUnited Nations sanctions (referred to as\"snapback\" provision),  thus by-passing the potential hazard of a veto by \neither China or Russia.  Western negotiators have made it clear that without the implementation of a snapback \nmechanism, there would be no final Iranian nuclear deal.  Meanwhile, the procurement channel issue was being \ntaken seriously, given the United Kingdom's report to the United Nations on a spurious Iranian nuclear procurement \nnetwork, which was linked  with two blacklisted companies.   \n\nA fresh round of negotiations commenced in Austria in mid-May 2015.   \n\nRecent Nuclear Negotiations Developments   \n\nAs May 2015 came to a close, the six P5-1 international powers were able to reach an agreement aimed at \nrestoring United Nations sanctions if Iran was found to be in non-compliance  a complex issue as intimated just \nabove.   \n\nUnder the agreement, suspected breaches by Iran would be addressed by a  dispute-resolution panel.  As well,  \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring Iran's nuclear program, IAEA reports would be used \nto assess compliance.  If Iran was found to be  in violation of the terms of the deal, then United Nations sanctions \nwould effectively be \"snapped\" back into place.   \n\nThe \"snapback\" provision meant that a significant hurdle had been crossed in reaching a comprehensive nuclear \ndeal with Iran.   Still,  Iran had to concur with this measure for the deal to go forward, and  Iran was itself suggesting \nthat it would immediately resume its nuclear activities if the six P5-1 international powers  did not meet their own \nobligations under the terms of the deal.   \n\nMoving forward, there was more diplomatic work to be done regarding access to sensitive Iranian military sites in \norder to verify Iran's compliance with the new nuclear development parameters.   Of particular concern was the \nmatter of the inspection of non-nuclear sites and military installations in  Iran, presumably to ensure no clandestine \nnuclear operations were taking place in violation of the terms of any future permanent agreement.  Iran has been \ncold to the idea of inspections to such facilities while France has threatened to block any   \nfinal nuclear settlement without a provision for that type of intrusive inspections regime.   \n\nThe start of June 2015 was marked by the resumption of negotiations between the six P5-1 international powers \nand the Iranian delegation in Austria. Of note was the  absence of United States Secretary of State John Kerry  as \nhe recovered from a broken leg; however,  the talks went on with  United States negotiator Wendy Sherman \nrepresenting the interests of her country.   \n\n\n\nThe June 30, 2015, deadline loomed ahead for a final and sustainable agreement to be reached on Iran's nuclear \nprogram.   The challenge of the task was aptly described by Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi , who \nwas quoted as saying in an interview with Iranian media, \"There has been progress but still we have a difficult way \nahead of us.\"   \n\nBy mid-June 2015, all reports from Vienna in Austria were that the nuclear talks between  the delegations from Iran \nand the six P5-1 international powers had stalled and, as such,  the deadline for the final agreement might have to \nbe pushed past June 30, 2015.  Indeed, with only days to go until that deadline, it was announced that nuclear \nnegotiations  between Iran and the six P5-1 international powers would extend beyond June 30, 2015.  There were \nreports that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif  was heading home to Tehran -- quite likely for \ndiscussions with the government in Iran regarding the difficult final status issues, such as access to IAEA nuclear \nmonitors and  the timing of sanctions relief.   \n\nAt the start of July 2015,  Iran and the six P5-1 international powers  remained deadlocked and a breakthrough had \nnot been made in the negotiations process.  However, representatives from the various delegations noted that \nprogress was being made, and that the \"bones\" of a final agreement were slowly taking shape.  As indicated \nabove,  particular sticking points included the matter of sanctions relief and the inspections and monitoring of \nIranian compliance.  That latter issue took on greater relevance when Iran's Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei declared that \nthere would be no sustained freeze of sensitive nuclear development, and that  military sites would not be open to \ninspectors.  This absolutist stance by Iran's Supreme Leader could potentially upend the deal that so many \ndiplomats had worked diligently to forge.   \n\nStill, the diplomatic work continued with all parties suggesting that a final agreement might be advanced by  a new \ndeadline of  July 7, 2015.    In an interview with the media, United States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated \nthat a deal was possible in that timeframe as he said, \"If hard choices get made in the next couple of days and \nmade quickly, we could get agreement this week.\"  But Kerry also acknowledged that negotiations had not yet \nyielded breakthrough results on the key technical issues, as he added that Iran and the  six P5-1 international \npowers  were \"not where we need to be on several of the most difficult issues.\"  If no progress was made with Iran \non those matters, then the United States was ready to walk away -- regardless of the herculean effort to date in the \nnegotiating arena.     That deadline of June 7, 2015 was extended  yet again and negotiations were set to continue \nwith negotiators looking for a final deal.  The new goal was to reach a nuclear agreement by mid-July 2015.   \n\nIn the days leading up to the middle of July 2015, Iran accused the West of complicating the negotiations process \nby introducing new demands, while countries of the West warned that progress was now slow and difficult.  There \nwere also reports of loud arguments between Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of State \nKerry.   For his part, Secretary of State Kerry was signaling that he would be prepared to walk away from the \nnegotiating table as he said, \"We can't wait forever. If the tough decisions don't get made, we are absolutely \nprepared to call an end to this.\"  On the other side of the equation,  Iran responded bitterly with Iranian Envoy Ali \nAkbar Velayati referring to  Kerry's  statement as \"part of America's psychological warfare against Iran.\"   \n\nBut by July 12, 2015, tensions were calming and there were reports that the foundations of an agreement were \nemerging.  To this end,  Secretary of State Kerry suggested progress was being made as he said,  \"I think we're \ngetting to some real decisions.\"  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius offered a similar mesage as he said: \"I \nhope we are finally entering the final phase of these marathon negotiations. I believe it.\"   \n\nIn the early hours of July 14, 2015,  reported were emerging that a final deal was in the works.  some elements of \nthe final deal were being leaked in the public sphere.  Those elements of the nuclear draft included provisions for \nthe United Nations  inspectors to have access to all suspicious Iranian nuclear sites, including military compounds.   \nThe agreement would also have to be adopted by the United Nations  Security Council in the form of a  resolution, \nand then the the work on limiting and regulating Iran's nuclear activities, as well as the measured related to  \nsanctions relief,  would be put into effect in 2016.    \n\n\n\nFinal Iran Nuclear Deal Reached:   \n\nOn July 14, 2015, Iran and the so-called P5+1 world powers officially reached a historic accord on Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program.  The accord was formally announced in the Austrian capital of Vienna where the \nfinal slate of difficult negotiations had taken place.  As presaged in the previous sections of this report, the \nagreement would limit Iran's nuclear activity and development, essentially preventing the production of a nuclear \nbomb.  The agreement was also aimed at extending Iran's nuclear weapons \"breakout\" time from its current \ntimeline of  a month to a year.   The deal was not intended to address issues related to state-sponsorship of \nterrorism or human rights abuses. In exchange, the West would lift its international oil and financial sanctions \nimposed on Iran.   \n\nIn a separate but related development, Iran and the the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the  world's \nnuclear watchdog entity --  said they had signed a roadmap to resolve outstanding issues. Already, under the aegis \nof the 2013 interim temporary accord, the IAEA verified that Iran had eliminated its known stockpiles of 20 percent \nenriched uranium.  This 20 percent grade uranium can be used  (1) to produce medical isotopes and  (2) to fuel \nresearch reactors,  but (3) it  can also be  purified to weapons-grade levels.  The IAEA has already verified that Iran \nmet this demand dating back to 2013.   \n\nCentral elements of the final deal were as follows -   \n\n-  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent   \n-  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period   \n-  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period   \n( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )   \n-  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years   \n( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible \njudgement that it is in violation)   \n-  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil   \n-  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear \ncurbs   \n-  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years   \n-  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years   \n_  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related \ntechnology   \n\nThe complete  implementation of the provisions of the deal would be contingent on Iran's commitment  to meeting \nits obligations to curtail its nuclear program and satisfy the world's concerns over the  possible military dimensions \nof its  nuclear development activity.  To this end,  a breach of the terms of the accord by Iran would generate a \n\"snapback\" provision, essentially snapping highly punitive sanctions back into place.   \n\nUnited States President Barack Obama touted the agreement as a good one, noting the following:   \"This deal \nmeets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework this spring. Every \npathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off, and the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that \nobjective will be put in place.\"   President Obama also noted that the deal would make the world \"safer and more \nsecure.\"  He additionally addressed his critics  saying that the terms of thee agreement  provided for a rigorous \nverification regime.   He added, \"This deal is not built on trust -- it is built on verification.\"  Furthermore, the \npresident emphasized  that there would be immediate consequences if Iran was found to be in violation of the terms \nof the agreement, as he said, \"If Iran violates the deal, all these sanctions will snap back into place.\"   \n\nFor his part, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the accord, saying that  the prayers of Iranians had \"come \ntrue.\"  Rouhani -- who was being celebrated in the streets of Tehran as a hero -- said the deal opened a \"new \nchapter\" in Iran's relationship with the rest of the international community.  But the Iranian leader was also realistic \n\n\n\nin his assessment of the agreement, noting that it was \"not perfect,\"  but that it was the \"best achievement possible \nthat could be reached.\"   \n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon championed the pact finalized in Vienna, casting it to be  \"historic,\" \nand paid tribute to the onerous and difficult work of diplomacy, which he said was  a \"testament to the value of \ndialogue.\" The United Nations chief conveyed his hopes that  the deal would contribute to \"a greater mutual \nunderstanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the Middle East.\"   \n\nA similar view came from Federica Mogherini, the  European Union foreign policy chief,  as she expressed \nsatisfaction with the final accord.  She said, \"This is a sign of hope for the entire world. And we all know this is very \nmuch needed in these times.\"   \n\nEven with the formal announcement of this historic nuclear  agreement, the process was not over.  There would \nhave to be a vote at the United Nations Security Council.  As well, the deal would still have to find concurrence in \nthe capital cities of Tehran, Washington D.C., London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, and Beijing where it would face the \nchallenges of hardline domestic politics.   \n\nHinting towards the Republicans' opposition would have to any agreement forged by the Obama administration in \nthe United States, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in an interview with Fox News,  \"I think it's going to \nbe a very hard sell, if it's completed, in Congress. We already know it's going to leave Iran as a threshold nuclear \nstate.\" Upon hearing the announcement of the landmark deal, and before actually reading the details of the \nagreement, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, denounced the deal, declaring \nthat it would  only \"embolden\" Iran.  He said, \"Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, \nthis deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world.\"  But perhaps the most vituperative feedback came \nfrom Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas who pugnaciously suggested military consequences for Iran as follows: \"Iran \nis an anti-American, terrorism-sponsoring outlaw regime. Iran should have faced a simple choice: they dismantle \ntheir nuclear program entirely, or they face economic devastation and military destruction of their nuclear facilities.\"   \n\nClearly, Republicans in the United States Congress, helped by certain factions of Democrats, would do their part to \nresist, curtail, and even halt the United States' participation in the agreement.  To this end, under a special \narrangement made with the president, they would have 60 days to consider the Iranian agreement in Congress and \neither sanction or reject it.     \n\nNote:  Because the Iranian nuclear deal was not a formal treaty between the United States and Iran, there was \nactually no need for a ratification vote by two-thirds of the Senate.  However, in the interests of some degree of \nnational consensus on so sensitive a subject as Iran's nuclear ambitions,  the United States Congress and \nPresident Obama agreed to an arrangement by which legislators would be allowed to either approve or reject the \nagreement by a simple majority.   Since Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress, it was highly likely they \nwould be successful in their efforts to defeat the accord.  However, President Obama would himself have the \nopportunity to veto any legislation passed in Congress that aimed to kill the deal.  Warning Republicans and their \nDemocratic allies of this course of action, President Obama said,  \"So I will veto any legislation that prevents the \nsuccessful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict. And we certainly \nshouldn't seek it. And precisely because the stakes are so high this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough \ntalk from Washington does not solve problems.\"   \n\nIn Iran,  despite the positive reception by pro-Rouhani  and other moderate elements, the agreement was \nguaranteed to spark the antagonism of hardliners and conservatives.  As expected, Iranian hardliners and \nconservatives immediately launched their opposition campaign to the nuclear deal, with even  Supreme Leader \n\n\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei warning that  some of the world powers that signed on to the agreement were \n\"untrustworthy.\"  In this way, there was no guarantee that Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei would \"bless\" the deal.   \n\nIn the United States, there was a parallel process of opposition and acrimony unfolding as hardliners and \nconservatives warned that Iran would find ways to cheat and violate the terms of the agreement.   Of particular \nconcern to United States lawmakers was the provision allowing Iran 24 days before allowing nuclear inspectors into \nsuspect Iranian military sites, with many of them complaining that the length of time would allow Iran to cover its \ntracks were it to carry out clandestine nuclear activities  at these sites.   However, nuclear experts have noted that \ncurrent technology would be able to detect traces of sustances used for nuclear development activities, making it \nimpossible for Iran to actually hide any \"bad behavior.\"   As noted by the head of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, Yukiya Amano: \"We are confident we can detect any diversion or misuse of nuclear material in a timely \nmanner.\"   \n\nThere were also objections to the lifting of sanctions and access to frozen assets, which could be used to fund \nrogue actors across the world.  However, even if the United States held in place its own unilateral sanctions against \nIran, the other world powers were eager to end the sanctions regime against Iran.  Thus, the United States would \nbe left isolated in its effort to keep the sanctions pressure on Iran.   \n\nIn Israel, which has been adamantly against an agreement with Israel, the response was rapid and bitter.  Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cast the deal as a \"stunning historic mistake.\"  He also noted  that sanctions \nrelief  would provide Iran with \"hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its \nexpansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe.\"  Netanyahu also made clear that \nIsrael had no intention of abiding with the agreement -- regardless of its eventual enshrinement as a United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution -- as he warned, \"\"We will always defend ourselves.\"   \n\nBut the objective arbiters of the agreement expressed cautious optimism over the successful negotiations process.   \nYukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the world's nucear watchdog entity -- \nsaid that the landmark nuclear agreement  constituted a \"significant step forward,\"  and noted that now the IAEA \nwould be better positioned to   \"make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's \nnuclear program by the end of 2015.\"   \n\nAs well, the conservative publication, The Economist, made the following conclusion:  \"The concern of critics of \nBarack Obama, both in Washington and beyond, was that the president's perceived desperation to burnish his \nlegacy with an historic deal would result in dangerous compromises surrendered at the last minute to the wily \nIranians. However, that was never likely (Iran's need for a deal has always been much greater than America's) and \nit is not borne out by the details of what has appears to have been agreed... But judged by more pragmatic \nstandards, the deal, while not perfect, appears much better than any of the plausible alternatives.\"   \n\nEllie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations,  gave  the agreement fulsome \npraise, declaring, \"This is probably going to go down in history as one of the biggest diplomatic successes of the \ncentury.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that nuclear nonproliferation experts have largely endorsed this agreement.  As reported by Max \nFisher at Vox.com regarding an interview with  Aaron Stein, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Royal United \nServices Institute, the Iranian nuclear deal  \"exceeds in all areas.\" Under this agreement, according to Stein, if Iran \nwere to attempt to build a bomb, \"the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent.\"  He added,  \"It makes the \npossibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote.\"  Stein explained his \nassessment further as follows: \" I think the U.S. hand is actually strengthened in this, to be honest with you. A full \naccounting of where everything is [gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring] is a wonderful targeting \nmechanism for the Pentagon. If we know where all of their stuff is, you can make far more accurate, detailed maps \nabout where to put a cruise missile. Iran knows what it's doing going into this. They know the consequences if they \n\n\n\nscrew up here, and the provisions are very tight, the inspection regime is very robust. The likelihood of getting \ncaught is near 100 percent.  The consequences are far more than just having your sites bombed. It's that they will \nhave reneged on the agreement that basically the whole world supports, except for the Republicans and the \nIsraelis and the Saudis.\"   \n\nUnited Nations Security Council lifts sanctions on Iran:   \n\nGoing forward, the United Nations Security Council would have to adopt a resolution that would lift international \nsanctions related to Iran's nuclear program.  Of course, as has been discussed here, the sanctions  would be \nsubject to the so-called \"snapback\" provision and could be re-imposed if Iran was deemed to be in violation of the \nnew accord.  A vote at the United Nations Security Council ws expected to occur early as the third week in July \n2015.  To that end, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said she would submit the \ndraft resolution on behalf of the P5+1 world powers and the European Union, which would then be taken up for a \nvote.   That vote on a resolution endorsing the agreement was set to take place during the following week.  Since \nthe veto-wielding permanent  members of the  United Nations Security Council  were all parties to the negotiations, \nthere was no doubt that the resolution would be adopted.   \n\nIndeed, on July 20, 2015, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing the \nIranian nuclear deal, thus clearing the path for sanctions imposed since 2006 to be lifted.  The United Nations \nSecurity Council  also enshrined its nuclear watchdog agency,   the International Atomic Energy Agency,  with the \nauthority to \"undertake the necessary verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear commitments.\"   \n\nOther measures would have to be undertaken by various governments.  Primarily, Iran's  parliament would have to  \nreview  and ratify the agreement, which was reported to have been \"blessed\" by Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei.   At the start of September 2015, Khamenei returned to the political purview in Iran to say that he \nfavored a parliamentary vote on its nuclear deal.  To this end, Khamenei said,  \"Parliament should not be sidelined \non the nuclear deal issue ... I am not saying lawmakers should ratify or reject the deal. It is up to them to decide.\"   \nWhile Khamenei has neither opposed nor endorsed the agreement, his praise of the diplomatic process has been \ninterpreted by some observers as a tacit blessing of sorts.  It was to be seen if an actual vote would ensue in the \nIranian Majlis, however, President Rouhani's government had not yet even advanced legislation for members of \nparliament to consider.   \n\nA similar process would have to ensue in the United States where the Republican-led Congress would have 60 \ndays to review and ratify the agreement, but where it was more likely to be rejected.  The fight in the United States \nwould be to secure enough votes to maintain a presidential veto.   \n\nNote on Political Landscape in the United States --   \n\nAs discussed above,  if the United States Congress was able to disapprove of the Iranian nuclear deal, President \nObama would enact his veto authority. The main question would be whether or not there was enough support in \nCongress to override a presidential veto.  (In the Senate and the House of Representatives, there would have to be \na 2/3 super-majority in each of the two chambers to vitiate a presidential veto.)  Of note was the fact that even a \nvote to \"disapprove\" of the nuclear deal by the United States Congress would do little to actually upend the \nagreement since a United Nations Security Council  resolution had already approved it in the realm of international \njurisprudence.   \n\nAssuming the United States president's veto would be enough to halt Republicans' objections to the deal, there \nwould be few options left for hardline conservatives determined to kill any agreement with Iran.   One of the \nremaining courses of action for Republicans would be for them to capture the White House in 2016.  Then, with a \nnew administration at the helm in 2017, the new president could conceivably begin the process of scapping the \naccord and re-imposing sanctions against Iran.  But that would be a unilateral pathway unlikely to gain support from \n\n\n\nthe other P5+1 countries, whose diplomats also worked hard to forge this pact, and who were not eager to see \nmilitary engagement with Iran.   Moreover, by 2017, most of the pressing sanctions would have been removed \nanyway, and the re-imposition of them promised to be a herculean task.  As noted by the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Republican Senator Bob Corker,  \"The next president can start from scratch.  What \nwould have happened, though, is the international sanctions process would have been totally dismantled.\"   \n\nIn the six weeks following the decision by the United Nations Security Council to lift its sanctions against Iran,  \ngroups hostile to the Iranian nuclear agreement launched an aggressive and expensive advertising campaign  \nintent on securing enough support to kill the deal.  As well, Israeli Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu \nrepeated his dire warnings of geopolitical calamity sure to visit the Middle East were the deal to go forward.  But \neven as these forces placed their own pressure on lawmakers in the United States, the Obama administration was \nbusy are work trying to rally support for the deal in Congress.   The main argument from the White House was that \nthe agreement accomplished its objective of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  As stated by \nPresident Obama himself, the agreement eliminates \"every pathway to a nuclear weapon\" for Iran.   \n\nWith most of the Democratic representatives in the lower chamber in relatively safe seats, and since many of them \nalready shared the president's internationalist foreign policy, there was a sense of confidence that House Minority \nLeader Nancy Pelosi would be able to bring together enough Democratic votes to deny the House Republicans the \n2/3 majority needed to uphold a disapproval measure.  The real action was in the Senate where some Democrats, \nsuch as Senator Charles Schumer of New York, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, had already \nsignalled their skepticism regarding the Iranian nuclear deal, and as exepected, ultimately opted to vote to \ndisapprove of the accord.   Since a total of 34 votes would be needed to deny the Republican-led Senate their 2/3 \nmajority, the job of gaining support for President Obama's Iran agenda would be difficult, and the final tally was \nexpected to be tight.   \n\nBut on Sept. 2, 2015, President Obama secured the support of 34 Democratic senators regarding the Iranian deal, \neffectively foreclosing any sgnificant action from the Republicans to stymie the United States' full participation in \nthe landmark Iranian nuclear curtailment deal.   Most of the senators  expressed similar sentiment, noting that no \ndeal was perfect, that the Iranians were not be trusted, but that the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the \nlegislative title for the Iranian nuclear deal as it is discussed and debated in the Congress) was the best available \noption to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, \nwho did the strenuous work of vigorous diplomacy to make the deal a reality, \"The benefits of this agreement far \noutweigh any potential drawbacks.\"   \n\nThe disapproval resolution related to  the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  would be on the legislative agenda \nfor debate when members of Congress returned to the Capitol in Washington D.C. after the August recess on Sept. \n8, 2015.  A vote was expected  later in the month when the resolution would be presumably be passed, and then be \nsubject to a presidential veto.   \n\nOn the United States political landscape, there remained a small possibility in the Senate that the disapproval \nresolution would not even be voted on if Democrats in the upper chamber were able to hold together 41 votes to \nsustain a filibuster, thus preventing a vote of cloture cutting off debate.  In such a case, the bill would not be able to \nbe brought to the floor for a full vote and President Obama would not have to use his veto power.  While all \nexpectations were that there would, in fact, be a full vote where the bill would be approved, the landscape changed \non Sept. 8, 2015, when the Democratic tally was complete.  On that day, it was clear that   42 senators had opted to \nsupport the deal -- more than the 34 needed to sustain a veto but also more than the 41 needed to filibuster the bill \nfrom even going to a vote on the floor of the Senate.  Still to be determined was the matter of whether or not at \nleast  41 senators would be willing to go down the filibuster path.   \n\nThat question was answered on Sept. 10, 2015, when Democrats in the Senate delivered a major victory to \nPresident Obama by successfully holding together 42 votes to filibuster the disapproval resolution, thus denying a \n\n\n\nvote on the legislation.   All 42 Democratic senators who had expressed support for the nuclear agreement stood in \nsolidarity on the procedural vote after several hours of debate, effectively preventing the bill from even going to a \nvote, and thus insulating the president from having to exercise his veto authority.    \n\nMeanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership was trying to alter its political calculus \nrelated to the disapproval resoluton by dividing it up into three separate bills, in the hopes that it would delay -- if not \noutright stop -- the nuclear deal from going into effect. Now, one measure centered on the claim that President \nObama  did not comply with the Iran nuclear review act; a second measure was a motion of approval of the nuclear \ndeal; the third measure sought to prevent President  Obama from waiving sanctions against Iran. All three pieces of \nlegislation were cleared for debate, where they were expected to pass due to the fact that Republicans controlled \nthe lower chamber.  However,  the fate of the Iranian  nuclear deal was no longer in doubt  given the outcome in the \nSenate.   \n\nThe political victory for President Obama at home in the United States ensured that the nuclear deal would go into \nforce -- irrespective of the objections from Republicans and a handful of Democrats in Congress, and certainly \ndespite the disapprobation of Israel.  Democratic Senator Schumer of New York, who was part of the four-vote \nDemocratic contingent parting ways with the president conceded that the Obama administration had secured a \npolitical victory as he declared: \"Regardless of how one feels about the agreement, fair-minded Americans should \nacknowledge the president's strong achievements in combating and containing Iran.\"   \n\nInternational Dimensions:   \n\nThe Iranian nuclear deal certainly had support in Europe where the leaders of the United States' allied countries -- \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- expressed support for it.  In fact, United Kingdom Prime Minister \nDavid Cameron,  French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint opinion \neditorial titled \"Why we support the Iran deal,\" which was published in the Washington Post on Sept. 10, 2015.   \n\nIn that piece, the three Western world leaders acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations process, noting, \"The \nlong history of fruitless nuclear talks with Iran did not give strong grounds for optimism.\"  But they also noted that \ntheir efforts ended in success, as they declared, \"Nevertheless, two years of tough, detailed negotiation have \nproduced an agreement that closes off all possible routes to an Iranian nuclear weapon in return for phased relief \nfrom nuclear-related sanctions.\"   \n\nCameron, Hollande, and Merkel repeated what United States Secretary of State John Kerry has long argued -- that \nthe agreement was not based on blind trust.  To this end,  they wrote: \"This is not an agreement based on trust or \non any assumption about how Iran may look in 10 or 15 years. It is based on detailed, tightly written controls that \nare verifiable and long-lasting. Iran will have strong incentives not to cheat: The near certainty of getting caught and \nthe consequences that would follow would make this a losing option.\"   \n\nAs such, Cameron, Hollande, and Merkel  reached the following conclusion: \"We fully support this agreement \nbecause it achieves the goals we had set ourselves. It deals with the uranium enrichment route to a bomb by \nrequiring Iran to reduce by 98 percent its stockpile of enriched uranium; to lower by two-thirds the number of its \ncentrifuges; to limit uranium enrichment levels; and to stop using the deep Fordow site for enrichment. It closes the \nplutonium route through changes to the Arak reactor so that it does not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it \nensures the IAEA enhanced access not only to Iran's nuclear facilities and the entire nuclear fuel cycle but also, \nwhere needed, to any undeclared site.\"   \n\nPolitical legacies:   \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing, this landmark accord was \nbeing celebrated as a historic development in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.  For good of \nfor ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community would inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the \nMiddle East.  Moreover, both President Rouhani in Iran and President Obama in the United States had made \nhistory with this landmark nuclear accord by moving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting \nthe path of diplomacy, and traversing   along the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define \ntheir respective political legacies.  Whether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive \nhardline domestic politics at home in Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama \ncould take heart in the fact that they had respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful \nresolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.   \n\nSpecial Entry   United States and Cuba announce landmark shift in policy as they move to normalize relations    \nSummary:   \n\nThe year 2015 was marked by the historic re-engagement of ties between the United States and Cuba, as the two \ncountries moved to normalize their diplomatic relations and move along the path of rapprochement.   \n\nGoing back to  Dec. 17, 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced a landmark policy shift aimed at \nnormalizing  diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years of animosity.  At the start of 2015, the \ngovernments of the United States and Cuba commenced negotiations aimed at achieving re-engagement. In April \n2015,  there was a  historic thaw in bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba as United States \nPresident Barack Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas in Panama. It was \nthe first meeting of the leaders of the two countries in decades.  Historians noted that the meeting was part of the \nlegacy that would likely define the respective presidencies of Obama and Castro, essentially underlining the reality \nthat the Cold War was officially over.   \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the historic meeting, the Obama administration in the United States announced it was \nremoving Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.  That move was formalized at the end of May 2015 and  \nsolidified Cuba's re-integration into the full international community. The action also  augmented the process of \nrapprochement between  the United States and Cuba.   July 2015 was the date set for the official opening of the \ntwo countries' embassies in Washington D.C., and Havana.  The Cuban flag thus flew for the first time in 50 years \naloft the Cuban embassy in Washington D.C. in July 2015.   United States Secretary of State John Kerry  traveled \nto Cuba in August 2015 to attend a formal ceremony marking the raising of the United States flag at the American \nembassy in Havana.   \n\nStill to be determined was the matter of the economic sanctions, which would have to be removed via legislation in \nthe United States Congress.   \n\nUnited States and Cuba announce landmark shift in policy as they move to normalize relations:   \n\nThe year 2015 was marked by the historic re-engagement of ties between the United States and Cuba.  Going back \nto  Dec. 17, 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced a landmark policy shift aimed at \nnormalizing  diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years of disengagement. President Obama made \nthe historic announcement following a shared telephone call with Cuban President Raul Castro.  In his remarks, \nPresident Obama noted that the diplomatic breakthrough occurred partially due to action by Pope Francis as well as \nthe government of Canada. Indeed, the effort to forge this historic agreement was ongoing for 18 months via  \nclandestine talks facilitated by the government of Canada and thanks to endorsement and support from Pope \nFrancis, the leader of the Holy See.   \n\n\n\nAs noted by a senior Obama administration official in remarks to Reuters News ahead of the president's historic \nmoves, \"These steps will be the most significant changes to our Cuba policy in more than 50 years.\"  The official \ncontinued, \"We will be immediately initiating discussions with Cuba to re-establish diplomatic relations that have \nbeen severed since 1961. If there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S. Cuba \npolicy.\"   \n\nAs stated by President Obama in a nationally broadcast  landmark announcement: \"We will end an outdated \napproach that for decades has failed to advance our interests and instead we will begin to normalize relations \nbetween our two countries.\" President Obama continued, \"These 50 years have shown that isolation has not \nworked. It's time for a new approach.\"  He added that the agreement would herald \"a new chapter among the \nnations of the Americas\" and move beyond a \"rigid policy that's rooted in events that took place before most of us \nwere born.\"   \n\nAt the diplomatic level, the expected  outcome of the new United States-Cuba policy would be the opening of \nembassies in the respective capitals of Washington D.C. and Havana.   \n\nMeanwhile, United States Secretary of State John Kerry would have to  review his country's classification of Cuba \nas a state sponsor of terrorism, and also negotiate the terms of this policy of re-engagement.  These terms could \nnot simply reverse the prevailing embargo against Cuba since that would take Congressional action.  However, the \npresident could -- and would -- impose exceptions to the embargo that would open up new pathways for cultural \nand commercial interactions between the United States and Cuba.  Down the line, all expectations were that there \nwould be improved circulation of  commerce between the United States and Cuba.   \n\nAlso on the agenda was the easing of  travel restrictions between the United States and Cuba, including  travel \nauthorized for family visits, official visits, journalistic, professional, educational and religious visits, as well as trips \nintended for public performances. Tourism, however, was not yet on the agenda for easing of travel restrictions.   \n\nAnother tangible outcome was the release of Alan Gross, a United States national held in a Cuban jail for five \nyears, and an anonymous United States intelligence agent who was held in Cuba for 20 years.  Gross, along with \nthe intelligence agent, were freed as part of a prisoner exchange deal in which three Cubans held by the United \nStates would also be released from American custody.   \n\nGross was arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned in Cuba in 2009 for delivering satellite telephone equipment \ncapable of obfuscating Internet connections and deemed to by a spy.  Despite high profile calls for his release, the \nGross case seemed to be unresolvable until Dec. 17, 2014, when he was freed. Meanwhile, the release of the \nanonymous intelligence agent was described by United States authorities as follows: \"In light of his sacrifice on \nbehalf of the United States, securing his release from prison after 20 years -\u2013 in a swap for three of the Cuban spies \nhe helped put behind bars \u2013- is fitting closure to this Cold War chapter of U.S.-Cuban relations.\"   \n\nIn the hours after the United States leader Barack Obama made his historic remarks on the policy shift with Cuba, \nAlan Gross was on a flight returning from captivity, accompanied by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), Senator \nJeff Flake (R-Arizona), and Congressman Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland).   \n\n\n\nDespite that diplomatic delegation being bipartisan in composition, some Republicans were outraged by the \ndecision to engage with Cuba and to go forward with a prisoner exchange. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) \nvociferously condemned the president's decision, saying, \"This whole new policy is based on an illusion, on a lie, \nthe lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for \nthe Cuban people. All this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the \nopportunity to manipulate these changes to stay in power.\"   \n\nNevertheless, President Obama addressed those critics, declaring that while he shared their commitment to \nfreedom, there were differing ways of achieving it. He said, \"The question is how do we uphold that commitment. I \ndo not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.\"   \n\nIn Cuba, President Raul Castro made his own national address that was broadcast across the island.  Castro's \naddress came with no preamble and went directly into an announcement that he had spoken with President \nObama.  The call, which  lasted 45 minutes, was the first direct conversation between a United States president and \na Cuban president in more than 50 years.  President Castro said they had agreed to a policy change and a \nprisoner swap.  He said, \"We have been able to make headway in the solution of some topics of mutual interest for \nboth nations.\"  President Castro also paid tribute to the American leader -- a historic moment after decades of \nmutual hostility -- as he said,  \"President Obama's decision deserves the respect and acknowledgment of our \npeople.\"   \n\nFrom the Holy See, the Vatican authorities released a statement hailing the historic agreement.  That statement \nread as follows: \"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the \ngovernments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of \novercoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history.\"   \n\nNegotiations on Normalization of Relations   \n\nAt the start of 2015, the Obama administration in the United States said it would dispatch a delegation to attend \ntalks in the Cuban capital of Havana on Jan. 21 and 22, 2015, aimed at normalizing relations between the two \ncountries.   Meanwhile, Cuba was making good on its promise to release detainees as part of the process of \nrapprochement.  As a result, there was a positive landscape in place within which the bilateral takes on normalizing \nrelations could take place.   \n\nAhead of the negotiations in Havana, some new measures were being put into place allowing United States citizens \nto use credit cards in Cuba and also to take into the United States up to $100 worth of Cuban alchohol and \ntobacco.  This would mean that it would legal to bring Cuban cigars to the United States after a five-decade long \nban. Other new measures included the relaxation of rules for United States businesses to export technologies, such \nas software, Internet, and telecommunications technologies to Cuba. There would also be opportunities for United \nStates investment small businesses and agricultural operations in Cuba.   \n\nHeralding the changes, United States Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said, \"Today's announcement takes us one \nstep closer to replacing out-of-date policies that were not working and puts in place a policy that helps promote \npolitical and economic freedom for the Cuban people.\"   \n\nAlso of note was the fact that in mid-January 2015, the Obama administration also relaxed rules on travel to Cuba.  \nWhile so-called \"ordinary tourism\" remained restricted, there was a relaxation of the travel ban to Cuba, providing \npotential travelers with a wide range of rationales for travel to Cuba without having to obtain a special license. The \nnew rules would allow Americans to travel to Cuba for  family visits, government business, journalism, research, \n\n\n\nand religious activity. With travel between the United States and Cuba opening up, United Airlines in mid-January \n2015 announced it would offer  regular commercial flights between the United States gateways of Houston and \nNewark to Cuba.   \n\nOn Jan. 21, 2015, a United States diplomatic delegation. led by Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson,  \narrived in the Cuban capital of Havana to commence negotiations aimed at restoring diplomatic relations, and \nadvancing the eventual opening of trade and travel ties between the two countries. For Cuba, whose delegation \nwas being led by Josefina Vidal, director of United States  affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, a key demand \nduring negotiations would be the removal of Cuba from the United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism.  Cuba \nwas also demandind that the United States end is practice of granting safe haven to Cuban under special status, \nnoting that it encouraged Cubans to defect and contributed to the country's \"brain drain.\" For the United States, the \nkey demand would be improved respect for human rights by Cuba.   \n\nDuring his annual State of the Union address the day before (Jan. 20, 2015), President Barack Obama of the \nUnited States of America said, \"We are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're \ndoing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new.\" He also called on members of  Congress to end the \nembargo against Cuba although some members of Congress have opposed that move.   \n\nNote that in February 2015, the United States Department of State made clear that the return of the United States \nnaval base at Guantanamo Bay was not on the agenda during bilateral discussions  with Cuba.  In testimony before \nthe House of Representatives in Washington D. C., Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of State for the \nBureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said, \"The issue of Guantanamo is not on the table in these conversations.\" \nOf note was the fact that Cuban President Raul Castro has called for the return of Guantanamo Bay.  The issue, \nhowever, was not likely to stymie progress on broader negotiations aimed at normalizing relations between the \nUnited States and Cuba.   \n\nIn the United States, some policy changes regarding Cuba were being advanced in mid-February 2015. A \nbipartsian group of Democratic and Republican senators were crafting legislation to repeal long-standing laws that \nhave prevented Americans for doing business with Cuba.  The bills would loosen legal restrictions on travel and \ntrade with Cuba, while leaving in place provisions protecting long-standing property claims against the Cuban \ngovernment.  It was quite possible that hardline factions in Congress would prevent the new bills from being \npassed; however,  the sponsors of the legislation said they would not be deterred and would simply include it as \nadditions to  appropriations bills in the future.   \n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration in the United States eased some restrictions on the importation of goods and \nservices from private Cuban entrepreneurs.  Some arenas, such as live animals, tobacco,  and textiles, were not \nincluded in relaxed rules.  The intent by the United States government appeared to be geared to allowing private \nenterprise to flourish in Cuba.  Of course, Cuban entrepreneurs would still have to secure  permission from the \nCuban government to export their goods; they would also have to come up with \"documentary evidence\" for the \nUnited States authorities to prove they fell into the category of approved enterprises.   \n\nNote that another round of bilateral talks between Washington and Havana commenced in the United States on \nFeb. 27, 2015.  During this round of negotiations, Cuban envoys called for their country to be removed from the \nUnited States' list of state sponsors of terrorism.  United States envoys said that the talks should concentrate on the \nopening of their respective embassies and the exchange of prisoners, rather than on this more contentious issue. \nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the issue himself, saying that the designation of a country \nbeing a terrorism sponsor was a separate process and \"not a negotiation\" linked with the current push to normalize \nrelations.  He said, \"It is an evaluation that is made under a very strict set of requirements, congressionally \nmandated, and that has to be pursued separately and it is being pursued separately.\"   \n\n\n\nNevertheless, there were high hopes that an agreement would be reached by April 10, 2015, when regional heads \nof state were expected to meet in Panama, and where United States President Barack Obama and Cuban \nPresident Raul Castro could officially meet for the first time since the announcement of their plan to normalize \nbilateral relations.   \n\nYet another round of bilateral talks ensued in mid-March 2015 -- this time in the Cuban capital of Havana.  Success \nin these negotiations was somewhat undermined by a move by the United States to impose sanctions on Veneuela \n-- a leftist ally of  Cuba.  While the United States has argued that deteriorating relations (and associated sanctions)  \nwith Venezuela should have no impact on the effort to normalize ties with Cuba.  However, Cuban Foreign Minister \nBruno Rodriguez warned that hostile actions towards Venezuela would be interpreted as an  attack on Cuba. To \nthis end, Rodriguez said that the United States had \"provoked serious damage to the environment in the \nhemisphere on the eve of the Summit of the Americas.\"  He continued, \"I hope that the U.S. government \nunderstands that it can't handle Cuba with a carrot and Venezuela with a garrote.\"   \n\nHistoric Thaw in U.S.-Cuban Relations   \n\nApril 2015 was marked by a historic thaw in bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba.  At stake was \nthe impending Summit of the Americas in Panama where United States Secretary of State John Kerry would meet \nwith his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez,  in the highest level meeting between the foreign ministers of the two \ncountries since the  Eisenhower era in the United States.  But all the attention quickly turned to the leaders of the \ntwo countries as United States President Barack Obama was expected to cross paths with Cuban President Raul \nCastro at the summit in Panama.   \n\nWhile the two men encountered one another at the 2013 memorial for the iconic South African leader, Nelson \nMandela,  the 2015  meeting of the Organization of American States would be the first official venue where the two \nleaders would be present.  Cuba had, for some time, been banned from attending the Summit of the Americas until \nthis time, making President Castro's participation significant simply for that reason.  But the significance of the \nmeeting was accentuated because the political landscape was now markedly different, given the ongoing \nnegotiations aimed at normalizing bilateral ties between the two countries after decades of animosity.   Of note \nwould be the meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the summit, although all eyes were on the initial \nencounter between Obama and Castro, ready to judge the meeting as either positively or negatively in terms of \nmood.   \n\nOn April 10, 2015, at the opening ceremony of the Summit of the Americas, cameras captured the brief but  historic \nmoment when President Obama and President Castro shook hands and chatted informally.  Global watchers cast \nthe encounter as cordial and deemed it to be an optimistic start to the meeting of leaders of the countries of the \nOrganization of American States (OAS).  Historians noted the meeting would be part of the legacy that would likely \ndefine the respective presidencies of Obama and Castro, essentially underlining the reality that the Cold War was \nofficially over.   For President Obama, the legacy would be particularly pronounced, as the normalization of ties with \nCuba would quite likely be regarded as one of the most significant foreign policy accomplishments of his \npresidency.   \n\nDuring his plenary session address to the 35 OAS countries, President Obama acknowledged that while differences \nremained between his country and Cuba,  bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba were now at a \n\"turning point.\"  He said, \"This shift in U.S. policy represents a turning point for our entire region.  The fact that \nPresident Castro and I are both sitting here today marks a historic occasion.\"  He continued by emphatically \nunderlining the shift in United States policy towards Cuba, as he declared:  \"The United States will not be \n\n\n\nimprisoned by the past. We're looking to the future.\"  He added,   I'm not interested in having battles that frankly \nstarted before I was born. The Cold War has been over for a long time.\"   \n\nPresident Castro had kind public words for President Obama in his address on the second day of the summit. After \na lengthy speech that tracked the  history of between the United States and  Cuba, and particularly highlighted \nCuba's grievances with the United States over the years,  President Castro admitted he tended to get carried away \nwith the subject matter, as he said, \"When I talk about the revolution, the passion oozes out of me.\"  He continued, \nby innoculating President Obama from the blame over decades of acrimonious relations as he said, \"I have to ask \nPresident Obama for forgiveness. He is not responsible for the things which happened before his time.\"  President \nCastro also appeared to exhibit genuine respect for his United States counterpart, as he declared: \"In my opinion, \nPresident Obama is an honest man.\"   \n\nOn the sidelines of the summit on April 11, 2015, President Obama and President Castro met for talks.  It was the \nfirst  face-to-face discussion between the leaders of the two countries in a half century.  On the agenda for \ndiscussion were the myriad issues involved in the process of normalizing relations, from the re-opening of their \nrespective embassies in Washington D.C. and Havana, to broadening economic and travel paths for the future, and \nalso including human rights and freedom of the press.  As noted by Cuban President Raul Castro:  \"Everything can \nbe on the table.\"   \n\nDuring these talks, President Obama lauded the encounter with his Cuban counterpart, saying, \"This is obviously a \nhistoric meeting.\"  He acknowledged that difference remained between the two countries, but referred to President \nCastro as he said, \"We have both concluded that we can disagree with a spirit of respect and civility.\" President \nObama continued by explaining his rationale for pursuing re-engagement and rapprochement with Cuba. He said, \n\"It was my belief it was time to try something new, that it was important for us to engage with Cuban government. \nAnd more importantly, with Cuban people.\"   \n\nFor his part, President Castro also acknowledged there would be differences with the United States, but \nemphasized that the two countries have \"agreed to disagree.\"  President Castro emphasized that the imperative \nwas to move forward in a productive manner with the Obama administration in the United States, as he said, \"We \nare willing to make progress in the way the president [Obama] has described.\"   \n\nIn a separate address at a civil society forum, President Obama heralded improved relations with Cuba saying, \"As \nthe United States begins a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba, we hope it will create an environment that \nimproves the lives of the Cuban people... Not because it is imposed by us, the United States, but through the talent \nand ingenuity and aspirations, and the conversations among Cubans from all walks of life so they can decide what \nthe best course is for their prosperity.\"  President Obama added that the days of United States' influence, \ninterference, neo-imperialism, and hegemony in the Americas was over, as he declared: \"The days in which our \nagenda in this hemisphere so often presumed that the United States could meddle with impunity, those days are \npast.\"   \n\nCuba removed from United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism   \n\nOn April 14, 2015, in the immediate aftermath of the historic meeting between President Obama and President \nCastro in Panama, the Obama administration in the United States announced that it was removing Cuba from its \nlist of state sponsors of terrorism. It should be noted that the United States has not, for some time, actually accused \nCuba of terrorism.  Nevertheless, the delisting procedure would be of practical benefit to Cuba,  as it would no \nlonger be officially cited in that  notorious category of rogue nation states.  It would also have the added benefit of \nmoving Cuba in the direction of good standing with the wider global community.   \n\n\n\nStill to be determined was the matter of the economic sanctions regime.  While President Obama had already used \nhis executive action to loosen the trade embargo against Cuba, it would be up to the United States Congress to \npass legislation to remove the bulk of the sanctions.  While several leading Republican senators running for \npresident have opposed the move, it was quite likely that a bipartisan group of senators would support the end to \nthe sanctions regime against Cuba.   \n\nOn May 29, 2015, the Obama administration in the United States officially removed  Cuba from its list of  state \nsponsors of terrorism.  The move brought a formal end to the respective bans on economic aid, arms exports,  \n\"dual-use\"  military and civilian items; it also ended the United States practice of opposing loans by international \nfinancial institutions, such as the World Bank and  the International Monetary Fund.  The \"de jure\" end to these \nprohibitions would not translate into actual relaxations in practice since a wider economic embargo remained in \nplace.   As intimated above, a large swath of Republicans in Congress were not in a hurry to end that embargo,  \nmeaning that the real value in Cuba being removed from the United States'  list of  state sponsors of terrorism was \nsymbolic.   But even that symbolism had value as it solidified Cuba's re-integration into the full international \ncommunity.  Moreover, it augmented the process of rapprochement between  the United States and Cuba.   \n\nFor its part, the Castro regime in Cuba on May 31, 2015, applauded the move by the Obama administration in the \nUnited States.   \n\nPlans in the works to open embassies in Washington D.C. and Havana and fully restore diplomatic relations --   \n\nAt the end of June 2015, it was announced that plans were afoot for the United States and Cuba to open \nembassies in Havana and Washington D.C. respectively.  Of note was the fact that  there has been no United \nStates embassy in Havana since the 1960s.  Meanwhile, July 20, 2015 was the date set for the official restoration of \nU.S.-Cuban relations since ties were severed in 1961.   \n\nUnited States Envoy Jeffrey DeLaurentis delivered a letter from the Obama White House to  Cuba's interim Foreign \nMinister Marcelino Medina, which relayed plans from the United States to open its embassy in Havana.  President \nBarack Obama delivered an address from the White House Rose Garden, where he addressed the development, \nsaying,  \"This is a historic step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with the Cuban government and people \nand begin a new chapter with our neighbors in the Americas.  A year ago it might have seemed impossible that the \nUnited States would be once again raising our flag, the Stars and Stripes, over an embassy in Havana.\"  He \ncontinued, \"With this change, we will be able to substantially increase our contacts with the Cuban people,\" he said. \n\"We will have more personnel at our embassy and our diplomats will have the ability to engage more broadly \nacross the island.\"   \n\nEmbassies open and flags raised in Washington D.C. and Havana   \n\nOn July 20, 2015, Cuba  formally re-opened its embassy and  the Cuban flag was lifted  aloft the embassy in the \nUnited States' capital.   It was the first time in more than 50 years that a Cuban flag was flying at the diplomatic \nmission in Washington D.C.  Cuban  Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, who attended the momentous occasion, \ndeclared: \"The historic events we are living today will only make sense with the removal of the economic, \ncommercial and financial blockade, which causes so much deprivation and damage to our people, the return of \noccupied territory in Guantanamo, and respect for the sovereignty of Cuba.\"   \n\nIt was fair to state that the re-opening of the Cuban embassy in the United States was a significant development in \nthe process of formally restoring bilateral relations between the two countries.  Another significant devlopment was \n\n\n\nset to follow as Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry at the State \nDepartment.  It was the first time a Cuban foreign minister had visited Washington D.C. since the Cuban \nRevolution.   \n\nWhile the United States' embassy was set to re-open in Havana, the United States flag would not be raised until \nAugust 2015 when Secretary of State John Kerry  would travel to Cuba to witness the ceremony.  To that end, a  \nformal flag-raising ceremony  was set for Aug. 14, 2015.   \n\nOn that day, Secretary of State John Kerry arrived  at Jose Marti International Airport in the Cuban capital of \nHavana.  He would be distinguished as the first American head of the State Department to visit Cuba in 70 years.  \nThe United States' top diplomat  presided over the historic re-opening of the United States embassy in Havana, the \nplaying of the United States national anthem, and the raising of the United States flag aloft the diplomatic \ncompound.   \n\nIn his speech, Secretary of State Kerry noted that it was a \"historic day,\" while also calling for democratization in \nCuba as he declared, \"The people of Cuba would be best served by a genuine democracy, where people are free \nto choose their leaders.\"  He added, \"Cuba's future is for Cubans to shape.\"   \n\nThe ceremony was also witnessed by the three United States Marines -- now Veterans -- who lowered the United \nStates  flag in 1961 but who were now back in Havana to be part of the remarkable shift in bilateral relations.   \n\nLatest developments in U.S.-Cuban rapprochement   \n\nIn mid-September 2015, the Obama administration in the United States announced a slate of regulations that would \nease  travel, trade and investment restrictions with Cuba.  While the new rules would not reverse the embargo \nlevied by the United States Congress,  the executive action would nonetheless serve the purpose of chipping away \nat  the embargo, while  demonstrating the Obama administration's commitment to improving its ties with a former \nCold War enemy.   At the practical level,  while United States citizens would still be barred from traveling to Cuba \nas tourists, these changes would open the door for some businesses to operate offices and  expand financial \nactivities in Cuba.  As well, the changes would also do away with restrictions on the financial remittances to Cuba.   \n\nThe  government of the United States argued that the new regulations would spur business development in Cuba, \nwhile augmenting more economic and political freedoms there.   As noted by United States  Treasury Secretary \nJacob Lew  in a statement: \"By further easing these sanctions, the United States is helping to support the Cuban \npeople in their effort to achieve the political and economic freedom necessary to build a democratic, prosperous, \nand stable Cuba.\"  He added, \" A stronger, more open U.S.-Cuba relationship has the potential to create economic \nopportunities for both Americans and Cubans alike.\"   \n\nNote that at the end of September 2015, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly,  United States \nPresident Barack Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro.  The meeting, depicted in videotaped footage, \nshowed both Obama and Castro at ease with one another and sporting broad smiles.   Cuban Foreign Minister \nBruno Rodriguez  described the rare one-on-one meeting of the two leaders as \"respectful and constructive.\" \nMeanwhile, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said, \"We continue to believe that deeper engagement and \ndeeper people-to-people ties, deeper economic engagement between the United States and Cuba will have the \neffect of moving the government and the nation in a positive direction.\"   \n\nNote:    \n\n\n\nThe restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba would stand as a marquis achievement of the Obama presidency since \nBarack Obama's foreign policy has centered on principles of vigorous diplomatic engagement, internationalism and \nmultiateralism.   \n\nSpecial Entry   \n\nPope Francis travels to Cuba and United States   \n\nWhile critics of President Barack Obama have criticized his re-engagement policy  towards Cuba, the president of \nthe United States had a strong ally for his actions in Pope Francis.   Indeed, the Holy See has long frowned upon \nthe United States' embargo on Cuba, and applauded President Obama's attempt  to improve bilateral ties with its \nformer Cold War foe.  Moreover, Pope Francis himself was  reported to have played a role in the diplomatic  efforts \nthat ultimately yielded the normalization of ties between the United States and Cuba from late 2014 and well into \n2015.   \n\nNow, with the process of rapprochement underway between the two countries, Pope Francis was making landmark \ntrip to Cuba and the United States.  Indeed, Pope Francis called on Cuba and the United States to \"persevere on \nthe path\" of detente.  To this l end, he praised the negotiations and ensuing reconciliation between Cuba and the \nUnited States as \"an example of reconciliation for the whole world.\"   \n\nDuring his visit to  Cuba, Pope Francis visited with the country's revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro,  and also held a \nmeeting with President Raul Castro.  In public, the pontiff stayed away from overtly political remarks, and refrained \nfrom criticism of Cuba's poor democratic rights record, including its suppression of dissent.  That being said, Pope \nFrancis  called for a \"revolution of tenderness\" and  paid tribute to generations who kept Catholicism alive in Cuba \ndespite an official policy of atheism.  To this end, the pontiff said,  \"The soul of the Cuban people ... was forged \namid suffering and privation which could not suppress the faith.\"   \n\nPope Francis spent a good portion of his time in Cuba at the shrine to the Virgin of Charity in the eastern town of El \nCobre, near Cuba's second city of Santiago.   The Virgin of Charity statuette was said to have been rescued from \nthe ocean in dry condition four centuries prior and is generally regarded as an important spiritual symbol in Cuba by \nCatholics as well as followers of Afro-Cuban religions, such as Santeria.  Speaking from that site in El Cobre, Pope \nFrancis said, \"Like Mary, Mother of Charity, we want to be a Church which goes forth to build bridges, to break \ndown walls, to sow seeds of reconciliation.\"  Pope Francis  made clear that the Roman Catholic Church would \ncontinue to \"support and encourage the Cuban people in its hopes and concerns.\"   \n\nAfter his trip to Cuba, Pope Francis  traveled on to the United States on Sept. 22, 2015, on a chartered Alitalia \npapal plane.  On the flight from Cuba to the United States, he previewed his impending addresses at the White \nHouse and before Congress, noting that he was not likely to discuss the controversial matter of the embargo. He \nsaid  instead,  \"My desire is that they end up with a good result, that they reach an accord that satisfies both sides, \nan accord, certainly.\"  The Pontiff also indicated that his speeches would concentrate on  \"bilateral relations and \nmultinational relations as a sign of progress and coexistence.\"   \n\nPope Francis was personally met by President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe \nBiden, and Mrs. Jill Biden at a welcome ceremony  on the tarmac of the  Joint Base Andrews close to Washington \nDC  It was the type of extraordinarily distinguished greeting  reserved for the most important foreign dignitaries.  A \nshort personal meeting with President Obama followed at a private suite, before Pope Francis departed in a  small \n\n\n\nblack Fiat destined for the residence of the Apostolic Nuncio  -- the  Vatican ambassador to the United States.  In \nthis way, Pope Francis was continuing his usual style of eschewing elaborate trappings, such as limousines and \nexpensive hotels, in favor of a modest lifestyle.   \n\nA day later  on Sept. 23, 2015, Pope Francis visited  the White House where President Obama hosted a reception \nin his honor on the South Lawn.   Despite not having coordinated their respective addresses  from the White House, \nPope Francis and President Obama offered harmonized messages about social justice and environmental \nconsciousness.   In fact, both men have espoused similar views on the threat posed by climate change, the \nexcesses of capitalism, the plight of the poor and down trodden, and the moral imperative to provide aid to those in \nneed.   But on Sept. 23, 2015, the two world leaders respectively emphasized the crucial cause of environmental \nconsciousness, given the perils of climate change,  as well as the humanitarian need to welcome immigrants \nseeking a new life.   \n\nIn fact,  Pope Francis craftily began his address from the White House with the reminder that he was, himself, the \nson of immigrants in his native Argentina.  He said:  \"As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in \nthis country, which was largely built by such families.\" In this way, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church made it \nclear that he was an advocate for  foreign born immigrants -- many from his own home region of Latin America -- \nwho were seeking a better life in the United States.   \n\nOn Sept. 24, 2015, Pope Francis  addressed a joint session of Congress at the Capitol.  He was the first pontiff in \nhistory to address a joint session of Congress and was welcomed warmly and with thunderous applause.   \n\nIn his address, Pope Francis addressed the unprecedented migrant crisis sweeping across Europe as desperate \nSyrians fled that country's horrific war, seeking refuge elsewhere.  Pope Francis had already called on Catholic \nchurches across the world to provide refuge and assistance to them, but in his address to the Congress, he urged  \nthe lawmakers of the United States to view refugees not as \"numbers\" but as \"people.\" He said: \"We must not be \ntaken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, \ntrying to respond as best we can to their situation.\"   \n\nAlong a similar vein, the Pontiff urged lawmakers in Congress to treat immigrants  \"with the same passion and \ncompassion with which we want to be treated.\"  He added, \"Let us remember the golden rule -- do unto others as \nyou would have them do unto you.\"  These statements, along with his introductory remarks the day before, made \nclear that Pope Francis was supportive of much needed immigration reform in the United States.   \n\nOf note was Pope Francis' choice to highlight four  famous Americans in his speech -- Abraham Lincoln, Martin \nLuther King, Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton.  The Pontiff cast President Lincoln as the \"guardian of liberty, who \nlabored tirelessly that this nation, under God, [so it might] have a new birth of freedom.\"  He said of the civil rights \nicon: \"I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the \ncampaign to fulfill his 'dream' of full civil and political rights for African Americans...That dream continues to inspire \nus all.\"  His reference to the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, Dorothy Day,, likely confounded people \nunfamiliar with her legacy. The Pontiff said of Day:  \"Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of \nthe oppressed, were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints.\"  Finally, the Pontiff's \nexplained that the Cistercian monk, Thomas Merton,  \"was above all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the \ncertitudes of his time, and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church.\"  All four individuals could be \nregarded as trailblazers of sorts who challenged the status quo on behalf of equality and social justice.   \n\nConservatives applauded Pope Francis's remarks about the sanctity  and protection of life, interpreting them as \nopposition to abortion; it was unclear if they were quite as receptive to his call for an end to the death penalty \ninternationally.  It was also unclear if they were aware that his warning that the world be attentive to \n\"fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind,\"  might apply across the board and not only to the \nexpected pariah groups.  On the other side of the equation, liberals were likely displeased by his criticism of same \n\n\n\nsex marriage, which was manifest in his comment that the \"very basis of marriage and the family\" was being \nchallenged.  They were also not likely to have embraced the Pontiff's anti-abortion reference.   \n\nPope Francis' progressive approach to social justice and Christian values has not always  been welcomed by \nhardline conservatives in the chambers of Congress, or from among social conservatives across the country.  Some \nof his critics have gone so far as to cast his castigation of unbridled capitalism as a Marxist, while others have \nblasted his social justice platform and his urgent call for action on climate change -- a condition anti-science \nconservatives generally deny exists in the first place.  However,  Pope Francis has made clear that his stances are \nfounded on Roman Catholic teachings.  To this end, he said,  \"I am sure that I have not said anything more than \nwhat is in the social doctrine of the Church.\" He added, \"It is I who follow the Church ... my doctrine on all this ... on \neconomic imperialism, is that of the social doctrine of the Church.\"   \n\nDespite this insistence that he was simply delivering teachings and guidance consistent with Christianity, the fact of \nthe matter was that Pope Francis made certain key choices, imbued with symbolism, that delivered patently clear \npolitical messages.  First, he declined to dine with member of Congress following his landmark address to the joint \nlegislative chambers.  Instead, he opted to eat with the homeless at Catholic Charities.  Second, all members of \nCongress were instructed prior to the Pontiff's address to refrain from attempting to shake his hand.  However, \nPope Francis initiated a handshake with President Obama's top diplomat -- Secretary of State John Kerry -- before \nhis speech and upon departing from the Capitol.  The general consensus was the Pope Francis was showing \nsupport for Secretary of State Kerry's efforts at vigorous diplomacy and on behalf of the pursuit of peace.   \n\nSpecial Note:   \n\nAfghan forces backed by US warplanes carry out offensive to retake control over Kunduz; air strikes kill MSF staff in \nhorrific tragedy   \n\nAt the end of September 2015, the Islamist terror group, the Taliban, carried out an audacious assault on the \nnorthern Afghan city of Kunduz, capturing the provincial capital in what could only be understood as their most \nsignificant strategic victory since their time in power.   Cognizant of the stakes, President Ashraf Ghani ordered an \nimmediate offensive operation aimed at retaking control of Kunduz, and soon, Afghan forces, backed by United \nStates warplanes, were battling Taliban forces.   Afghan officials said that the operation was seeing success and its  \nforces had regained control over  several government buildings while eliminating scores of Taliban fighters.   Battles \nbetween the two sides went on at the airport although the city center was growing quiet.   While many Taliban were \nkilled or had fled Kunduz to escape the assault by U.S.-backed Afghan forces, there remained several Taliban \nfighters in the city and continuing to pose a threat.   The process of retaking control over Kunduz would not be \nrapid, though, as the Taliban was reportedly using civilians as human shields, even  hiding in people's homes and \nin hospitals.   \n\nThe effort to retake control of Kunduz took a tragic turn at the start of October 2015 when air strikes hit an Afghan \nhospital in Kunduz, killing at least 22 people and injuring scores more.  The esteemed  French medical charity, \nMedecins sans Frontieres (MSF, or \"Doctors without Borders\" in English), which operated at that facility,  reported \nthat the air strikes killed  12 of its staff and seven of its patients, while its hospital was badly damaged.   \n\nIt should be noted that the  Afghan interior ministry reported that 10 to 15 Taliban militants were found hiding in the \nhospital, and were killed in the air strikes although this claim was not independently confirmed.  Of course, along \nwith the deaths of those terrorists were the deaths of doctors trying to save lives in a war zone, along with patients \nalready fighting for their lives.   \n\nNATO acknowledged that its forces were carrying out an offensive operation against the Taliban in Kunduz at the \ntime, and air strikes by United States forces might be responsible for the unfolding tragedy.  NATO noted that the \naerial bombardment campaign may have yielded  unfortunate collateral damage consequences  and promised a full \ninvestigation into the matter.    \n\n\n\nMSF was unimpressed by this explanation, with MSF's President Meinie Nicolai casting the incident as \"abhorrent\" \nand issuing the following statement: \"We demand total transparency from coalition forces. We cannot accept that \nthis horrific loss of life will simply be dismissed as collateral damage.\"   Indeed, officials from MSF also noted that \nthe hospital's coordinates were well-known to coalition forces, and that once the air strikes began, its staff tried \ndesperately to contact NATO to inform the security bloc that its hospital was being struck.  Likewise, MSF President \nJoanne Liu declared:  \"Until proven otherwise, we are working on the presumption of a war crime...This attack \ncannot be brushed aside as a mere mistake or an inevitable consequence of war.\"    \n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, expressed his condemnation for the air \nstrikes that hit the MSF hospital saying it was \"tragic, inexcusable and possibly even criminal.\"   \n\nIn response to the Kunduz tragedy, United States Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  said: \"While we are still trying \nto determine exactly what happened, I want to extend my thoughts and prayers to everyone affected.  A full \ninvestigation into the tragic incident is under way in coordination with the Afghan government.\"   In a later \nstatement, Carter said that the United States military took responsibility for the tragic air strikes on the MSF hospital \nfacility.  The statement read as follows:  \"The U.S. military takes the greatest care in our operations to prevent the \nloss of innocent life, and when we make mistakes, we own up to them. That's exactly what we're doing right now. \nWe will do everything we can to understand this tragic incident, learn from it, and hold people accountable as \nnecessary.\"   \n\nUnited States President Barack Obama also entered the fray, as he personally apologized to the MSF chief, Joanne \nLiu, for the loss of life.  As reported by  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest:  \"The President assured Dr. Liu \nthat the Department of Defense investigation currently under way would provide a transparent, thorough and \nobjective accounting of the facts and circumstances of the incident and, if necessary, the President would \nimplement changes that would make tragedies like this one less likely to occur in the future.\"  However, it was \nunclear that this overture from the leader of the free world had any significant impact.  In fact,  MSF was calling for \nan independent investigation into the matter,  while noting that the institutional investigations underway by the \nUnited States Pentagon, NATO, and joint United States and Afghan entities were unacceptable.   \n\nThe investigatory and accountability process was beginning in the political sphere.  During  testimony before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee in the United States, the American commander of international forces in \nAfghanistan, Army General John Campbell,  said that United States air support had been requested by Afghan \nofficials, although he indicated that the deadly air strikes  on the MSF facility  were the result of a mistake within the \nUnited States' own military chain of command.   Explaining that the United States military would never intentionally \ntarget a medical facility, Campbell said, \"A hospital was mistakenly struck. We would never intentionally target a \nprotected medical facility.    With an eye on preventing further deadly mistakes of the type  made in Kunduz, \nCampbell  ordered military forces under his command to  review the operational rules of engagement and to \nundergo retraining with respect to these rules.   \n\nCampbell also made it clear that the existing exit strategy to withdraw all remaining United State troops from \nAfghanistan at the end of 2016 should be extended due to continuing threats posed by al Qaida and Islamic State.  \nCampbell's stance on a continuing military presence in Afghanistan was well-received by conservatives in the \nSenate who have never been on board with President Barack Obama's \"date certain\" schedule for withdrawal.  As \nstated by Republican Senator John McCain, \"The world walked away from Afghanistan once before and it \ndescended into chaos that contributed to the worst terrorist attack ever against our homeland. We cannot afford to \nrepeat that mistake.\"  Indeed,  with the threat of terrorism increasing in the region, NATO was also warming to the \nidea of an extended military engagement in Afghanistan.  To this end,  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg \nsaid,  \"I sense that many allies are willing to stay longer if needed.\"   \n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter, though, was that as much as there were increasing calls for the United States and its allies to \nconsider a more flexible schedule with regard to  Afghanistan, the Kunduz tragedy was also spurring a debate on \nthe Afghanistan policy in totality.  After more than a decade of war in that country, critics were questioning the \nobjectives of the engagement, and challenging the effectiveness of aerial bombardment campaigns in modern \nwarfare.  While  air strikes and drone strikes favored by the United States in recent times have been deemed \npreferable to so-called \"boots on the ground,\" it was unclear whether they were actually effective in accomplishing \nthe goals of counter-terrorism.  Instead, while such air strikes might target  malignant actors, such as terrorists from \nal-Qaida, the Taliban, and Islamic State, they often result in the deaths of civilians as well, which tends only to fuel \nfurther terrorism.  Meanwhile, even as the strikes may hit high value terror targets on occasion, the corpus of \nresearch done on the doctrine of air power indicates that aerial bombardment often serves only to disrupt the \nactivities and strongholds of terrorists, who simply flee the targeted zone for more fertile ground.  In their wake are \ncivilians who bear the brunt of the assault from the skies, and ultimately are consigned to the category known \ninfamously as \"collateral damage.\"    \n\nIntroduction   \n\nSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an \naddition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding \nthe resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end \ncorruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting \nthe emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised \nKurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over \ntime, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hardline crackdown on dissent, tensions \nescalated between the government and the protesters.   \n\nIn mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the \nviolence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the \nviolent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, \ngiven the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters.  In 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad \nregime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in \nplaces such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security \nResolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United \nNations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered \nby the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further \nbloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United \nNations monitoring mission ended in failure.   \n\nSyria has meanwhile been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the \ninternational community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and  \nsuspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed,  with it was \nincreasingly clear that with President Bashar al-Assad using brutal tactics to quell the uprising  served only to create \nan even more tumultuous landscape, and eventually set the path for a full-blown civil war.    That civil war pitted the \nAssad forces, backed by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, against  a disparate cabal of anti-government entities, ranging \nfrom the rebel Free Syrian Army to several Islamist terrorist enclaves.   \n\nAt the same time, Syria  was facing a devastating humanitarian crisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August \n2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.  Although this was \nthe clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's \"red line\" had definitively been crossed, the \ninternational community remained reticent about becoming more involved in the Syrian crisis. Ultimately, an  \nensuing chemical weapons deal with Syria between the United States and Russia quieted the war drums.   In the \nmeantime, though, a  highly anticipated  peace summit in Geneva ended without yielding any productive results and \nthe civil war in Syria raged on and on.   \n\n\n\nBy mid-2014, while Syria had shown progress in its disposal of chemical toxins, in keeping with an international \nagreement intended to avoid intervention by the West, the country was dealing with an ascendant \"Islamic State.\"  \nPreviously known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS as well as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL, \nthis group self-declared a caliphate extending from Syria to Iraq.   It was apparent that the power vacuum from the \nSyrian civil war provided a breeding ground for extremism that Islamic State could exploit and use to both challenge \nthe Assad regime and function as a recruitment tool for Jihadists.  Whereas the West and regional powers in the \nMiddle East had earlier called for an end to the Assad regime, suddenly the geopolitical stakes were quite different \nas extremist terrorists were now posing the most dangerous threat to regional stability.   The barbaric beheadings of \ntwo American journalists by Islamic State in their stronghold in Syria changed the calculus and the Obama \nadministration in the United States -- initially reticent about re-engaging in the Middle East -- was now looking at a \ntargeted anti-terrorism strategy in the Syrian-Iraqi landscape of Islamic State.  As such, a Western coalition, led by \nthe United States, was soon carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.  Of note was the fact \nthat the United States-led coalition expanded to include Japan and Jordan when citizens of their countries that were \nbeing held by Islamic State were also brutally killed.   \n\nAs of 2015, Syria was beset by two sets of intersecting challenges -- the ongoing civil war between the Assad \nregime and rebel forces on one end, and the horrific dangers posed by the notorious terror group, Islamic State, \nwhich had seized wide swaths of territory in Syria and left an appalling death toll.  It was generally understood that \nthe civil war conditions in Syria, to some extent, facilitated the emergence of Islamic State in  that country.  Syrian \nPresident Assad's priority to hold onto power, and thus the center of power in Damascus, had allowed a power \nchasm to flourish in other parts of the country, which Islamic State has been able to exploit.  The result has been a \nmass exodus of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in Europe.  The so-called migrant influx in  Europe \nhas raised questions as to how to legally and humanely deal with a burgeoning humanitarian refugee crisis.   \n\nAt the political level, Russia signaled it would be entering the Syrian crisis militarily in September 2015 although it \nwas unclear if Moscow's goal was to  bolster and preserve Bashar al-Assad's hold on power, or, to go after Islamic \nState.  The geopolitical landscape was complicated in October 2015 with the news that the United States would be \ndeploying special operations teams to Syria.  The scene in November 2015 was grave as Russia and France \nintensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist \nterror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French citizens.   Russia, France, and the United States were \nnow respectively changing their respective calculations, cognizant that the Islamist terror group was no longer \nsimply seeking to build its Caliphate but, instead, transposing its goals to more of an Islamic Jihadist orientation.  \nThe result was a global security crisis.   \n\nUpdate on Syrian Civil War and threat posed by Islamic State--   \n\nIn the autumn of 2015, the geopolitical  dynamics of the region were complicated by the news that Russian military \nforces were operating in Syria to help shore up the Assad regime. Reports were emerging about no shortage of \nRussian fighter jets in Syria, as well as infantry forces, battle tanks and other military Russian military resources  at \nan airfield near the Syrian city of Latakia.  As well,  Russia deployed military advisers to Syria and staged naval \nexercises off Syria.   \n\nAlso of note was the fact that a global coalition, led by the United States, was already carrying out air strikes against \nIslamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.  With both Russia and the United States-led Western coalition likely to be \ncarrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in the same region, the two countries were discussing modes of \ncooperation and coordination that would prevent accidents in their respective air campaigns.   \n\nTo this end, regardless of their frosty bilateral relations, Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States \nPresident Barack Obama met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting to discuss this \nmatter.   Russian President Putin characterized that meeting as follows:  \"Our talks were very constructive, \nbusiness-like and surprisingly frank.\"  A Russia aide to the president added to Putin's assessment of the meeting \n\n\n\nwith Obama and their intent to work cooperatively as he said:  \"We have clarity on their objectives. Their objectives \nare to go after ISIL and to support the government.\"   \n\nBoth leaders expressed the importance of  avoiding air collisions between their respective air strike fleets; however, \ntheir visions for Syria's future remained quite different.  While Putin has argued that Syria's stability and anti-\nterrorism efforts can only be maintained by keeping the Assad regime in power.  Obama, by contrast, has cast \nAssad as a tyrant who was responsible for no shortage of gross abuses against his own people, and whose record \nshould not be sanitized in the effort to go after Islamic State.  For President Obama, there was a need for \"a new \n[Syrian] leader and an inclusive government that united the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups.\"   \n\nNevertheless, with Islamic State continuing to pose one of the most pressing threats to global security,  President \nObama expressed a pragmatic stance suggesting that there might be a  \"managed transition\" from Assad's rule.  \nThis policy appeared to be backed by other Western leaders, namely United Kingdom Prime Minister David \nCameron. Of concern was the reality that the loss of Assad at the helm might produce a power chasm that Islamic \nState and other unsavory actors could exploit.   To this end, President Obama said, \"There is no room for \naccommodating an apocalyptic cult like ISIL and the United States makes no apology for using our military as part \nof a broad coalition to go after it.\" He added, \"Realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting \nand ultimately stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader \nand an inclusive government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos.\"  President Obama also noted \nthat his country was willing to work with other partner nation states in the effort to vanquish Islamic State and \nultimately stabilize Syria.  To this end, he said, \"The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including \nRussia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so \nmuch carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.\"   \n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, further elaborated their \ntwo countries' respective interests in Syria by noting that they had agreed on  \"some fundamental principles.\"  In an \ninterview with MSNBC News, Kerry explained, \"There was agreement that Syria should be a unified country, united, \nthat it needs to be secular, that ISIL needs to be taken on, and that there needs to be a managed transition.\"  Kerry \nalso added that with the Syrian crisis raging on, and with the human  toll increasing alarmingly, there was a need for \ncooperation .  He said, \"Everybody understands that Syria is at stake, and the world is looking rapidly for some kind \nof resolution.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that the  Syrian National Coalition -- Syria's political opposition in exile -- has made it clear that it \nrejects any role for Assad in a transitional government.  That unrelenting stance was sure to complicate any joint \neffort by Russia and the West to facilitate a \"managed transitions of power\" in Syria.   \n\nMeanwhile, there remained some questions about the actual goals and purpose of Russia's military intervention into \nSyria.  Was it actually aimed at assisting the global effort against the world's most notorious and brutal terror group, \nIslamic State?  Or was it actually more craven and aimed at ensuring that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ally, \nBashar al-Assad, could hold onto power?  To that latter end, in late September 2015, United States officials \nreported  to the news outlet, CNN, that Russian fighter jets had  turned off their transponders to evade detection as \nthey flew into Syrian territory.  United States officials also confirmed that Russian  drones were flying in the area of \nthe  city of Latakia.   Since this was not exactly Islamic State territory, the conclusion was that Russia was more \nfocused on supporting Assad's regime than actually fighting terrorism.  Separately, other Western countries were \nreaching the same conclusion.  As noted by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, \"You have to look at who is \ndoing what. The international community is striking Daesh [IS]. France is striking Daesh. The Russians, for the time \nbeing, are not at all.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that, the prospect of Russia intervening into Syria to shore up President Assad was not being \nwell-received by Gulf Arab countries, who argued that such a move would only deepen the conflict.   Saudi Foreign \nMinister Adel al-Jubeir characterized the Russian intervention as an \"escalation\" and emphasized his country's view \nthat a stable Syria in the future would not involve Assad at the helm of power.  For Russia, though,  which was an \n\n\n\nally of Assad-led Syria, and which had a naval base at Tartous in Syria, supporting the Assad regime would also \npreserve a level of Russian influence in the region.   \n\nOn Sept. 30, 2015 -- shortly after agreeing to work with the United States to go after Islamic State -- Russian fighter \njets were carrying out strikes on the anti-Assad  rebel strongholds of Homs and Hama.  The United States was \ninformed of the Russian strikes only one hour before they commenced.  For its part, Russia claimed that it was also \ncarrying out missions against Islamic State Islamic State military equipment, ammunition, communications, and fuel \nsupply targets, however, United States officials noted this did not appear to be the case.  The Russians' actual  \nchoices of air strike targets in Homs and Hama, along with United States assessments, made clear that the Russian \nintervention into Syria was clearly for the purpose of bolstering the Assad regime.   \n\nThat being said, later air strikes  reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights at the start of October 2015  \nindicated that Russia was also targeting command posts in the Islamic State de facto capital of Raqqa.  That effort \nappeared to be forcing residents there to cancel prayers.   \n\nFor its part, the United States reacted to this news by making clear that it would remained focused on the goal of \nvanquishing Islamic Sate.   United States department of state spokesperson, John Kirby, said:  \"The U.S.-led \ncoalition will continue to fly missions over Iraq and Syria as planned and in support of our international mission to \ndegrade and destroy ISIL.\"   \n\nRight-wing  and neoconservative critics of the Obama administration in the United States have argued that \nPresident Obama's reticent approach to getting involved in Syria and the rest of the Middle East  created an \nopening for Russia to intensify its footprint in the region.  But the Obama administration has defended its policy of \navoiding military entanglements in the Middle East by pointing to the mistakes committed by the previous Bush \nadministration in Iraq, which resulted in a decade of war and socio-political destabilization that actually created the \nconditions for Islamic State to take root.  Moreover, both President Obama himself and his top diplomat, Secretary \nof State John Kerry, have  warned that Russia was becoming ensconced in a regional sectarian quagmire by \naligning itself with Iran-backed Hezbollah to prop up  the Alawaite Assad regime in Syria against a much larger bloc \nof Sunni Arab countries in the Middle East who want to see regime change in Syria.   As noted by President Obama \nhimself, by picking the Shi'ite side  of this evolving sectarian battle,  Russia was very likely strengthening Islamic \nState by undermining the moderate opposition and inspiring more Sunni Jihadists to the cause.  The United States \nleader explained, \"The Russian policy is driving the moderate opposition underground and strengthening ISIL.\" Left \nunstated -- but pertinent nonetheless -- was the fact that Russia was already bogged down due to its involvement in \nthe Ukrainian crisis.  Together  with its economic woes, Russia's recent adventurism in the Middle East was not \nlikely to  be helpful to its long-term prospects either.  However, for those seeking a more muscular foreign policy \nand a more deeply hegemonic imprint from the United States, such arguments were likely to fall on deaf ears.   \n\nBy the start of October 2015 -- shortly after the start of  Russia's foray into Syria --  a geopolitical imbroglio was \nsparked when Russian fighter jets twice violated Turkish air space.   Russia explained one such violation as a \nmistake due to weather conditions; however, Turkey was not receptive to that explanation, with Turkish President \nRecep Tayyip Erdogan issuing the following warning: \"If Russia loses a friend like Turkey, with whom it has been \ncooperating on many issues, it will lose a lot, and it should know that\" He added that \"an attack on Turkey means \nan attack on NATO.\"  For its part,  NATO -- of which Turkey was a member state -- also refused to accept that \nexplantation, noting that the Russian incursions \"did not look like an accident\" and with NATO Secretary-General \nJens Stoltenberg noting that the Russian violations of Turkish air space \"lasted for a long time.\"  Stoltenberg further \ncast the Russian incursions as \"unacceptable,\" and warned that the North Atlantic security bloc was viewing the \nsituation \"very seriously.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that bilateral ties between Turkey and Syria have been a downward spiral largely due to Turkey's \ncriticism of the Assad regime's brutal crackdown on anti-government factions. The ties between the two countries \nreached a new low in mid-2012 when Syrian air defenses shot down a Turkish fighter jet, but deteriorated further in \n\n\n\nOctober 2012 when Syrian mortar fire killed five Turkish civilians in a border town.  The Turkish parliament at the \ntime authorized military action against Syria  in the aftermath of that incident.  The geopolitical scene grew  more \ncomplicated  later in 2012 when Turkish jets forced a Syrian plane, which was suspected of \"non-civilian cargo,\" to \nland in Turkey. Authorities in that country said that the move was aimed at preventing the passage of weapons \nthrough its airspace into Syria. The geopolitical complexity was exacerbated when Russia and Syria decried the \nmove by Turkey.  In late 2012, it was announced that the  United States would send 400 troops and two Patriot air \ndefense missile batteries to Turkey to help defend its NATO ally against possible threats from Syria.  Tensions \nbetween Turkey and Syria emerged again in March 2014 when Turkey downed a Syria aircraft, which (according to \nTurkey) had violated its air space.  In 2015, as discussed here, with the entry of Russian forces into the Syrian \ncrisis, so too came violations of Turkish air space by Russian jets  operating in Syria.   In many senses, Turkey was \nbecoming a key inflection point in the ongoing Syrian crisis.   \n\nMeanwhile, Russia reported that it carried out repeated air strikes on Islamic State targets in the first week of \nOctober 2015.  But as before, the lion's share of Russia's activity in Syria appeared aimed at helping the Assad \nregime hold its territory and go after opposition rebel groups, with an eye on regaining territory.  Of note were \nRussian continued strikes in anti-Assad rebel strongholds.  Around the same period in October 2015, Syrian forces \nwere reported to be preparing for a ground offensive, which would presumably be backed Russian air strikes and \ncruise missile strikes from their fleet in the Caspian Sea.   \n\nThe success of the Russian effort was very much a subject of debate, despite claims of Russia being an emerging \nactor in the region.  For all its air strikes in Syrian territory, reports from the ground indicated that Russian strikes \nwere more successful at hitting moderate rebel and civilian targets than Islamic State targets.   \n\nIn the background of these developments were continued overtures between Russia and the United States aimed \nat establishing rules of engagement and protocols of conduct related to their respective campaigns in Syria.  \nHowever, the United States Defense Secretary Ash Carter ruled out further cooperation with Russia regarding the \nSyrian crisis as he declared the Russian strategy to be clearly aimed at bolstering the Assad regime.  He said, \"We \nbelieve Russia has the wrong strategy. They continue to hit targets that are not ISIL. This is a fundamental \nmistake.\"   \n\nNevertheless, as October 2015 came to a close, United States and Russian military officials signed a memorandum \nof understanding covering \"de-conflicting\" procedures and protocols to be undertaken by  their pilots in order to \navoid an accidental incidences over Syria as they respectively carry out air strikes in the same territory.  A \nPentagon spokesperson, Peter Cook, said that the two countries would \"form a working group to discuss any \nimplementation issues that follow\"  but that the actual agreement covered all coalition members, such as Turkey, \nSaudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.   The State Department was clear in noting that the agreement was \ngeared towards keeping pilots safe and did not extend into the realm of strategic cooperation.  As noted by State \nDepartment spokesperson,  John Kirby,  \"It's not a treaty of cooperation or anything like that ... It doesn't connote \ncooperation or coordination or joint targeting.\"   \n\nMeanwhile, in the same period of late October 2015, United States President Barack Obama indicated a policy \nshift regarding Syria, as it was reported that dozens of special operations troops would be deployed to northern \nSyria to advise opposition groups as they battle Islamic State.  The deployment indicated a departure from \nPresident Obama's \"no combat boots on the ground\" in Syria stance, although the White House insisted that the \nmission would have a circumscribed  and highly limited \"train, advise, and assist\" role.   White House \nspokesperson, Josh Earnest, explained the president's position as follows:  \"This is a dangerous place on the globe \nand they are at risk, and there's no denying that.  But I think if we were envisioning a combat operation, we \nprobably would be contemplating more than 50 troops on the ground.\"   \n\nIt should be noted that President Obama was also supplementing this limited deployment with  A-10s and F-15 war \nplanes, which would be deployed  to the Incirlik air base in Turkey, presumably to carry out air strikes against \nIslamic State targets.  The deployments of both military advisers and aircraft in northern Syria was  part of a mission \n\n\n\nby Syrian rebels to target the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa.  Meanwhile, the diplomatic effort was afoot to try to \nfind a political solution for Syria that would include an Assad-free future while not allowing the country to sink into \nthe morass of lawlessness.   \n\nAmidst these developments on the geopolitical landscape was the reality that Islamic State continued to pose a \nthreat in the region, and even advance deeper into Syrian territory.  Of particular note was the fact that at the start \nof November 2015, the terror group was able to capture the Syrian town of Maheen, located  in the central Homs \nProvince.    Maheen had been held by government forces but was now under Islamic State control.  Battles were \ntaking place in nearby towns as Islamic State sought to extend its grip in the region.  In the crosshairs was the \nAssyrian Christian town of Sadad where inhabitants spoke the ancient Aramaic language.   \n\nIn the first week of November 2015, despite the addition of the Russian campaign in Syria to support Assad,  anti-\ngovernment rebels were able to capture control over the town of Morek to the north of the flashpoint city of Hama.  \nFares al-Bayoush, a commander for the  rebel group Fursan al-Haq, which has been operating under the auspices \nof the Free Syrian Army, said the strategically located town of Morek had been \"liberated.\"  He explained the \nstrategic value of controlling Morek as follows:  \"It was a center for the gathering of regime forces and a point of \ndeparture for its operations.\"  In the same period, rebels in  Idlib province recaptured  Tal Skik,  which had gone  \nunder Hezbollah-backed Syrian control a month earlier.  These gains for anti-Assad factions indicated that despite \nRussia's intervention into the Syrian civil war, rebel factions continued to make their presence known.   \n\nA two year siege by Islamic State at the Kweires air base in Aleppo in northern Syria came to an end in the second \nweek of November 2015 when Syrian soldiers stormed the facility and rescued soldiers trapped there.  The \noperation could well be regarded as one of the most significant victories for Assad's forces in Syria in recent times.   \n\nMeanwhile, ahead of scheduled multilateral talks on Syria, Russia released a blueprint for the country's future.  That \ninitiative called for the Assad regime and the opposition to find consensus in a constitutional reform process that \nwould last 18 months and be followed by a presidential election.   Significantly, the proposal would not prevent \nBashar al-Assad from contesting the presidential contest.   This latter element promised to be a deal-breaker of \nsorts for the opposition.  As noted by Monzer Akbik of the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition, \"The Syrian \npeople have never accepted the dictatorship of Assad and they will not accept that it is reintroduced or reformulated \nin another way.\"  Meanwhile,  Western powers, several Sunni Arab countries in the region, and Turkey were not \nexpected to accept a plan that included a pathway for Assad to hold onto power in Syria.  Indeed,  those various \nplayers made clear that they would not sign onto a plan that did not include an exit strategy for Assad, whom they \nviewed as one of the main sources of Syria's crisis.  That being said, there were other viable aspects of the \nproposal, such as a process for distinguishing rebel groups with terror ties and legitimate opposition entities -- the \nlatter of which could become key players in a future peace and reconciliation plan.  As well, there were provisions \nfor  a soft partitioning of power and security into Assad-led zones and non-Assad led zones across Syria.   \n\nIn the same period,  the effort against Islamic State was ongoing.  Indeed, on Nov. 12, 2015, the United States \nPentagon reported that it had targeted to notorious Islamic State terrorist known as \"Jihadi John\" in an apparent \ndrone strike in Syria.  The Kuwaiti-born British national had already been identified as Mohammed Emwazi; he  \ngained notoriety as the ominous masked figure  in Islamic State propaganda videos who carried out beheadings of \ninternational journalists and humanitarian workers.  According to United States authorities, Emwazi  had been \n\"tracked carefully over a period of time\" and was finally targeted for elimination in a drone strike near the Islamic \nState stronghold of Raqqa.  Defense Department personnel initially stopped short of confirming Emwazi's death \nwith Press Secretary Peter Cook simply saying:  \"We are assessing the results of tonight's operation and will \nprovide additional information as and where appropriate.\"  By Nov. 13, 2015,  United States authorities said they \nwere \"reasonably certain\" that drone strike in Syria had killed Emwazi.   \n\nIn this period, the United States' air strike effort was aggressively geared towards hitting Islamic State's oil \nproducing resources, which essentially funds the terror group.  The air strike campaign, called \"Tidal Wave II,\"  was \nthus concentrating on oil tanker trucks, oil rigs, pumps and storage tanks.  The objective was the hit the targets  so \n\n\n\nas to disrupt the oil related activities for a significant period of time, but without either destroying these oil facilities \ncompletely or just inflicting minor damage that could be repaired in short order.     \n\nIn mid-November 2015, the situation was grave as Russia and France intensified their efforts to go after Islamic \nState targets in Syria following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist terror network that killed hundreds of \nRussian and French citizens.  At issue was the fact that Islamic State was claiming responsibility for a bomb that \nexploded on a Russian jet flying from the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, killing more than 200 Russians on \nboard.   Also at issue was the Islamic State claim of responsibility for a spate of appalling terror attacks in the \nFrench capital city of Paris, which killed approximately 130 people.  Islamic State made clear that its brutal acts \nwere being carried out because of the international community's engagement in Syria.  Islamic State also promised \nthat attacks were to come in the United States and other Western countries.   \n\nIn response to what could only be understood as acts of war by Islamic State, Russian and French warplanes \nwasted no time before stepping up their respective air campaigns in Syria,  targeting Islamic State targets in the \nterror group's stronghold of Raqqa in a sustained manner.   France also deployed its air craft carrier, the Charles de \nGaulle, to the Middle Eastern region for the purpose of supporting the effort against Islamic State.  Of note was the \nfact that France was not limiting its air strike campaign from the Charles de Gaulle only to Islamic State targets in \nSyria, such as the terror group stronghold of Raqqa; indeed, France soon expanded its scope to hit Islamic State \ntargets in Ramadi and Mosul in Iraq.    \n\nWhile the United Kingdom was not, at the time, engaged in the Syrian crisis, the British government gave France \nthe use of its air base in Cyprus from which it could strike Islamist terror groups in the region.   United Kingdom \nPrime Minister David Cameron said that his country would provide  air-to-air refueling services and that he would \nrecommend that the  British parliament vote in favor of the his country joining the United States-led air campaign to \nstrike Islamic State targets.   \n\nThe United States was taking the  terror threat posed by Islamic State and other radical Islamist terror groups \nseriously,  with the United States Department of State issuing a global travel alert.  The warning read as follows:  \n\"Current information suggests that Islamic State, al-Qaida, Boko Haram, and other terrorist groups continue to plan \nterrorist attacks in multiple regions. Authorities believe the likelihood of terror attacks will continue as members of \n(Islamic State) return from Syria and Iraq.  Additionally, there is a continuing threat from unaffiliated persons \nplanning attacks inspired by major terrorist organizations but conducted on an individual basis.   \n\nMeanwhile.  as a result of their shared interest in defeating Islamic State,  Russian and United States forces were \nsaid to be more closely coordinating their respective strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria  despite strained \nrelations between the two countries.  Overall, Russia, France, and the United States were now respectively \nchanging their calculations, cognizant that the Islamist terror group was no longer simply seeking to build its \nCaliphate but, instead, transposing its goals to more of an Islamic Jihadist orientation.  The result was an \ninternational security crisis.   \n\nIn addition to the killing of Russian and French nationals in the autumn of 2015,   in the same period, Islamic State \nhad also claimed responsibility  for  double bombings in  a Shi'a district of the Lebanese city of Beirut, killing more \nthan 40 people.  The general consensus was that the Beirut bombings were inflicted due to activities of the \nLebanese Shi'a Islamic militant group, Hezbollah, in Syria.  Specifically, Hezbollah has been militarily engaged in \nthe Syrian civil war for the purpose of backing the Assad regime in that country.  But the result has been a high \nprice in blood as spill-over violence from the Syrian civil war was reaching Lebanese terrain.     \n\nThe attacks on Lebanese, Russian, and French targets constituted  a  terrorist trifecta for Islamic State,  and could \nonly be understood as manifestations of the terror group's effort to demonstrate its relevance and resilience --  even \nas it was being subject to strikes from various international actors.   \n\n\n\nIndeed, the terror enclave was certainly under pressure from a United States-led international coalition, as well as a \nbombing campaign by Russia.  Earlier in November 2015 Islamic State lost control of Sinjar in Iraq as a result of a \nfierce offensive by Kurdish peshmerga fighters backed by United States air power.  In the same period,  as \ndiscussed above, the United States Pentagon  reported that it had targeted the \"face\" of Islamic State in a drone \nstrike -- the notorious terrorist \"Jihadi John\" who was shown in barbaric videotaped footage with international \nhostages who were executed via decapitation. The Pentagon indicated that the drone  strike was very likely \nsuccessful, thus inflicting a symbolic blow against the terror group.   Around the same period, Islamic State was \nreported to be losing control in Aleppo in Syria.   \n\nWhile these losses were recent, the downward trajectory for Islamic State had been occurring for several months.  \nAs such, the terror enclave's evolving imperative might  be to show that it still had power and influence.   No longer \nable to expand its territorial advances, Islamic State was very likely transforming its efforts.  Rather than \nconcentrating on building and expanding its so-called Caliphate, Islamic State could be refocusing its ambitions in \nthe direction of international Jihadism.     Should this working theory gain support , it would suggest an acute threat \nto global security.   \n\nGiven this burgeoning global security threat, neoconservative critics of President Obama in the United States were \nclamoring for him to articulate a more muscular  foreign policy in regard to Islamic State.  At the G20 summit in \nTurkey, an unusually angry President Obama dismissed the notion of warfare for the purpose of warfare without \ncareful consideration,  saying, It's best that we don't shoot first and aim later.\"  In response to the call for him to \nextrovert American hegemony and leadership in a robust manner, President Obama said, \"If folks want to pop off \nand have opinions about what they want to do, present a specific plan. \"What I am not interested in doing is posing, \nor pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with \n... I'm too busy for that.\"  He added, \"What I do not do is to take actions either because it is going to work politically \nor somehow make America look tough, or make me look tough. And maybe part of the reason is that every few \nmonths I go to Walter Reed [a military hospital] and I see a 25-year-old kid who is paralysed or has lost his limbs. \nAnd some of those are people who I have ordered into battle. So I can't afford to play some of the political games \nthat others play.\"   \n\nOne flashpoint issue in the discussion of United States policy regarding Islamic State was President Obama's \nclaim that the terror group had been \"contained.\" Asked how he could make that claim given the ongoing terror \nactivity by Islamic State, President Obama explained, \"When I said that we are containing their spread in Iraq and \nSyria -\u2013 in fact, they control less territory than they did last year. The more we shrink that territory, the less they can \npretend they are somehow a functioning state and the more it becomes apparent that they are simply a network of \nbrutal killers.\"   He also insisted that it was vital that Islamic State not be treated as a conventional state enemy but \nrather as a terrorist network.  President Obama said, \"Our goals here have to be aggressive and leave no stone \nhere, but also recognize this is not conventional warfare. We play into the ISIL narrative when we act as if they are \na state and we use routine military tactics that are designed to fight a state that is attacking another state. That's \nnot what's going on here.\"   \n\nIn the background of these developments was the growing sense of anxiety about refugees streaming across the \nMediterranean to Europe, whose resources were being stretched by the influx of migrants from war torn areas of \nthe Middle East, such as Syria.  The United States had agreed to take some Syrian migrants; however,   in the \nwake of the Paris attacks and the news that one terrorist had used a Syrian passport (regardless of whether it was \nactually a forged document), there was a loud chorus of opposition.  That opposition was coming from the public at \nlarge and from Republican politicians who together angrily complained that Syrian refugees posed a national \nsecurity threat.  President Obama  lambasted both Republicans in the United States and their counterparts in \nEurope for attempting to keep  these refugees out, making clear it was unAmerican to close the doors to people in \nneed.   \n\n\n\nThe geopolitical complexity of Syrian civil war grew more complicated in the last week of November 2015 when \nTurkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the basis of accusations that the Russian aircraft violated Turkish air \nspace.   Russia disputed that claim, insisting that the jet was operating in Syrian air space as part of the fight \nagainst Islamic State.  Russia also referred to the tragic incident as a betrayal and instituted sanctions against \nTurkey as a result.      \n\nWith Turkey being a NATO member, Russia's wrath could potentially affect all Western countries participating in the \nUnited States-led coalition fighting Islamic State in the region.  Hopes for greater cooperation between the West \nand Russia against the terror group were thus dimmed.  In a small positive sign, however, both Moscow and Ankara \nmade clear that they were not interested in escalating tensions and facilitating the path of war.   As well,  despite \nbeing NATO allies, France and the United States called on Turkey to do a better job of monitoring its borders which \nIslamic State terrorists were using to traverse in and out of Syria.  Of particular note was a stretch of the Syrian-\nTurkish border north of the Syrian city of Aleppo where Turkey had not closed and was being used by the terror \ngroup to transport militants and supplies.   \n\nOf course, the truth of the matter was that neither Turkey nor Russia has been involved in the Syrian civil war for \nthe principal purpose of fighting Islamic State in the first place.  Turkey was one of the initial voices calling for \nBashar Assad to go and has directly supported Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime in Syria.  At the same \ntime, Turkey has exploited the excuse of fighting Islamic State to instead go after Kurdish extremists, which  it \ndeems to be a political threat.  On the other side of the equation, Russia has been a long-time backed of the Assad \nregime, and has often treated Syria like a client state.  Russia entered the Syrian quagmire on the basis of claims \nthat it was fighting Islamic State but it, instead, hit rebel targets in Syrian territory that were opposed to the Assad \nregime.  In many senses, Turkey and Russia were already in opposed political \"camps\" with regard to the Syrian \ncrisis before the latest contretemps over Turkey shooting down a Russian jet.    \n\nAs November 2015 drew to a close, French President Francois Hollande traveled to the United States to meet with \nPresident Barack Obama to discuss the threat posed by Islamic State in the aftermath of the horrific Paris terror \nattacks and with the Islamist terror group threatening to go after American targets.   At the conclusion of their \nmeeting, President Obama and President Hollande agreed to intensify and expand their  military operations against \nIslamic State and also to coordinate intelligence on domestic threats.  During a joint news conference at the White \nHouse,  President Obama noted the long-standing and historic friendship between his country and France, dating \nback to the 18th century and distinguishing France as the United States' oldest ally. For his part, the French \npresident said that he and President Obama were united in their \"relentless determination to fight terrorism \nanywhere and everywhere.\"  PresidentHollande said,  \"We will not let the world be destroyed. To face Daesh \n(Islamic State), we must have a common, collective and implacable response.  We must destroy Daesh wherever it \nis, cut its financial resources, hunt down its leaders, dismantle its networks and reconquer the territory it controls.\"   \n\nSpecial Entry:   \n\nIslamic State-inspired attacks in United States; President Obama outlines anti-terrorism strategy   \n\nThe period of late 2015 into the start of 2016 was marked in the United States by two terror attacks at the hands of \npersons claiming to be inspired by the blood thirsty Islamist Jihadist group, Islamic State.  The arrival of such terror \nattacks on the United States home front provoked criticism of President Barack Obama's response to the threat \nposed by Islamic State.    \n\nStarting in  Dec. 2, 2015, a terror attack involving a mass shooting and an unsuccessful bombing took place at the \nInland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California in the United States, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others.  \n\n\n\nThe assailants escaped in a vehicle, which was tracked by police and ultimately intercepted.  An exchange of fire \nensued and the two terrorists were killed as a result of the shoot-out with police.   \n\nThe terrorists were identified as a married couple --  Syed Rizwan Farook,  a United States-born citizen of Pakistani \nbackground, and  Tashfeen Malik, a Pakistani national whom Farook met in Saudi Arabia, and who entered the \nUnited States on a fianc\u00e9 visa prior to her marriage to Farook.   It should be noted that Malik was educated in the \nPakistani town of  Multan, which was known to be a hotbed of militant Islamist ideology.   \n\nPresident Barack Obama said the attack appeared to be inspired by the Islamist extremist terror group, Islamic \nState, although it was unclear if it was the act of a terror cell and planned with overseas involvement, or, instead the \nplot orchestrated and carried out by the highly radicalized Muslim Jihadist couple.  United States authorities \nindicated the couple appeared to have planned the killings and certainly had some sort of terrorist inclinations, \nhaving uncovered a cache of weapons, pipe bombs, and a mini bomb making factory at the couple's home.   As \nwell, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was  investigating the killings as a counter-terrorism probe,   \nindicated that the couple had contact with individuals suspected of having terrorist connections. The FBI also said  \nthat the couple was engaged in target practice using their weapons ahead of the attack, and appeared to be well \ntrained.  Furthermore, in interviews with international media, Farook's father reportedly indicated that his son was \nan Islamic State sympathizer.  Farook's wife and co-conspirator,  Malik ,  conveyed support for Islamic State via the \nsocial media outlet, Facebook, on the very day of the attack in San Bernadino.   \n\nThe attack in San Bernadino, coming on the heels of the attacks in Paris, made clear that Islamist extremists \nworking either directly on behalf of Islamic State, or, indirectly in an inspired fashion, were now posing a clear and \npresent danger to Western countries.  No longer could the threat posed by Islamic State be regarded as one being \nmanifest in the Middle East.  Instead, the countries of the West were being directly targeted with young people \naligned with the terror group being determined to carry out vicious acts of brutality on behalf of Islamic State.   \n\nGiven this reality, United States President Barack Obama was being forced to defend his \"light footprint\" approach \nto fighting Islamic State, as his Republican rivals blasted him for being soft on terrorism.   In truth, in recent times, \nIslamic State was certainly under pressure from a United States-led international coalition.  For example, in \nNovember 2015, Islamic State lost control of Sinjar in Iraq as a result of a fierce offensive by Kurdish peshmerga \nfighters backed by United States air power.  In the same period,   the United States Pentagon  reported that it had \ntargeted the \"face\" of Islamic State in a drone strike -- the notorious terrorist \"Jihadi John\" who was shown in \nbarbaric videotaped footage with international hostages who were executed via decapitation. The Pentagon \nindicated that the drone  strike was very likely successful, thus inflicting a symbolic blow against the terror group.   \nAround the same period, Islamic State was reported to be losing control in Aleppo in Syria.   \n\nAs such, the Obama administration was emphasizing the fact that  the downward trajectory for Islamic State had \nbeen occurring for several months.  It was certainly true that Islamic State was no longer expanding its territory for \nits desired Caliphate.  But at the same time, it was also exporting fighting back to the West to carry out attacks of \nthe sort that occurred in Paris in November 2015, and it was certainly inspiring \"lone wolf\" attacks of the sort that \noccurred in San Bernadino in December 2015.  As such, there was no getting away from the fact that there was a \nburgeoning threat to global security.   \n\nNeoconservative critics of President Obama in the United States were clamoring for him to articulate a more \nmuscular  foreign policy in regard to Islamic State.  At the G20 summit in Turkey, an unusually angry President \nObama had already dismissed the notion of warfare without careful consideration,  saying, It's best that we don't \nshoot first and aim later.\"  In response to the call for him to extrovert American hegemony and leadership in a \nrobust manner, President Obama said, \"If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they want to do, \npresent a specific plan. What I am not interested in doing is posing, or pursuing some notion of American leadership \n\n\n\nor America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with ... I'm too busy for that.\"  He added, \"What I do not \ndo is to take actions either because it is going to work politically or somehow make America look tough, or make me \nlook tough. And maybe part of the reason is that every few months I go to Walter Reed [a military hospital] and I \nsee a 25-year-old kid who is paralysed or has lost his limbs. And some of those are people who I have ordered into \nbattle. So I can't afford to play some of the political games that others play.\"   \n\nOne flashpoint issue in the discussion of United States policy regarding Islamic State was President Obama's \nclaim in the autumn of 2015 that the terror group had been \"contained.\" Asked how he could make that claim given \nthe ongoing terror activity by Islamic State, President Obama explained, \"When I said that we are containing their \nspread in Iraq and Syria -\u2013 in fact, they control less territory than they did last year. The more we shrink that \nterritory, the less they can pretend they are somehow a functioning state and the more it becomes apparent that \nthey are simply a network of brutal killers.\"   He also insisted that it was vital that Islamic State not be treated as a \nconventional state enemy but rather as a terrorist network.  President Obama said, \"Our goals here have to be \naggressive and leave no stone here, but also recognize this is not conventional warfare. We play into the ISIL \nnarrative when we act as if they are a state and we use routine military tactics that are designed to fight a state that \nis attacking another state. That's not what's going on here.\"   \n\nIn December 2015, in the aftermath of the San Bernadino massacre, with emotions running high in the United \nStates, President Obama sought to calm the nerves of the United States public, while holding the line on his \"light \nfootprint\" policy against Islamic State.   In his national address on Dec. 6, 2015, President Obama cast the \nbloodshed in San Bernadino as  \"an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people\" and promised to \"hunt down \nterrorist plotters\" anywhere they are.  At the same time, he  insisted that there would be no renewed ground war \nusing United States blood and treasure in the Middle East as he declared,  \"We should not be drawn once more \ninto a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria.\"  He noted that  \"the terrorist threat has evolved into a new \nphase\" as Islamic State exploited the Internet to \"poison the minds\" of potential sympathizers, turning them into \nkillers.  He added, \"The threat from terrorism is real but we will overcome it.\"   \n\nPresident Obama also connected the terrorism threat with the fact that the assailants in San Bernadino  were able \nto easily access guns.  He made clear  that in the discussion of national security, there had to be a provision for \nappropriate gun control.  Of particular relevance was the fact that persons on the United States'  \"no fly list\" should \nnever be able to purchase a gun.   \n\nPresident Obama's address spurred his Republican rivals to blast his anti-terrorism strategy.  Notably, Republican \npresidential contender, Donald Trump, said via the social media outlet, Twitter, \"Is that all there is? We need a new \nPresident \u2013 FAST!\"  Another Republican presidential contender, Marco Rubio, declared, \"We are at war with a \nradical jihadist group\" and concluded that nothing the president said \"will assuage people's fears.\"  Other \npresidential contenders from the Republican parties demanded that the United States fight Islamic State more \naggressively and put fighting forces on the ground.  Senator Lindsey Graham said that President Obama's existing \nstrategy would not destroy Islamic State and demanded that  United States  send ground forces to the battleground \nin the Middle East.  Former Governor Jeb Bush espoused a standpoint neoconservative approach as he demanded \n\"an aggressive strategy to defeat ISIS.\"  Senator Ted Cruz said that were he to become president, he would \"direct \nthe Department of Defense to destroy ISIS.\" It was unclear how he believed that direction was substantially different \nfrom President Obama's directives, unless he envisioned a massive ground campaign in the Middle East.   \n\nIt should be noted that the president had already  augmented the air strike campaign against Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria with the deployment of military advisors, and at the start of December 2015, he supplemented these \nforces with a special operations expeditionary force to fight Islamic State.  While this deployment collectively could \nactually be defined as ground forces,  it was clearly being interpreted by hardline conservatives as insufficient.   \nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter  outlined the goals  the special operations expeditionary force as follows:  \"These \n\n\n\nspecial operators will over time be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence and capture ISIL \nleaders.\"  For the Obama administration, the imperative was to exploit the special operations expertise in a targeted \nstrategy against Islamic State, rather than the conventional warfare approach favored by Republicans.   This \nstance was actually consistent with President Obama's philosophy that Islamic State was simply not engaged in \ntraditional warfare in the first place and thus could not be quelled in a conventional manner.   \n\nBy January 2016, the threat posed by \"lone wolf\" actors inspired by Islamic State was manifest in an attack on a \nPhiladelphia police officer.  In that incident, a man pledging allegiance to Islamic State ambushed Officer Jessie \nHartnett, opening fire on him and releasing approximately a dozen shots.  Despite being struck by gunfire, Harnett \nwas able to return fire and notify dispatchers of his predicament.    Responding police were able to capture the \nassailant, who was later identified as Edward Archer and who declared that he was acting \"in the name of Islam.\"    \nMeanwhile, while Harnett was described as having suffered grave injuries, he was expected to recover.   \n\nJanuary 2016 was also marked by  arrests in Sacramento, Calif., and Houston, Texas, of two Iraqi refugees of \nPalestinian ancestry whom the United States Justice Department accused of lying to federal officials and supporting \nterrorism.  Aws Mohammed Younis Al Jayab was arrested in Sacramento and charged with making a false \nstatement linked to international terrorism.  The criminal complaint against him also indicated that Jayab intended to \ntravel to Syria to fight on behalf of Islamic State. Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan was  arrested in Houston  and  \ncharged with trying to provide material support to Islamic State.  The two cases of likely terrorists presenting \nthemselves as refugees would likely harden the view of Americans with regard to accepting refugees from war torn \ncountries in the Middle East.  The two cases would also likely place additional pressure on the Obama \nadministration regarding its refugee policy, as well as its  response to the threat posed by Islamic State, even \nthough it was the United States authorities who successfully intercepted and arrested both Jayab and Hardan.    \n\nU.S. augments anti-terror strategy for Iraq and Syria --   \n\nRecent terror attacks on Lebanese, Russian, and French targets constituted  a  terrorist trifecta for Islamic State,  \nand could only be understood as manifestations of the terror group's effort to demonstrate its relevance and \nresilience --  even as it was being subject to strikes from various international actors.   \n\nIndeed, the terror enclave was certainly under pressure from a United States-led international coalition, as well as a \nbombing campaign by Russia.  Earlier in November 2015 Islamic State lost control of Sinjar in Iraq as a result of a \nfierce offensive by Kurdish peshmerga fighters backed by United States air power.  In the same period,  as \ndiscussed above, the United States Pentagon  reported that it had targeted the \"face\" of Islamic State in a drone \nstrike -- the notorious terrorist \"Jihadi John\" who was shown in barbaric videotaped footage with international \nhostages who were executed via decapitation. The Pentagon indicated that the drone  strike was very likely \nsuccessful, thus inflicting a symbolic blow against the terror group.   Around the same period, Islamic State was \nreported to be losing control in Aleppo in Syria.   \n\nWhile these losses were recent, the downward trajectory for Islamic State had been occurring for several months.  \nAs such, the terror enclave's evolving imperative might  be to show that it still had power and influence.   No longer \nable to expand its territorial advances, Islamic State was very likely transforming its efforts.  Rather than \nconcentrating on building and expanding its so-called Caliphate, Islamic State could be refocusing its ambitions in \nthe direction of international Jihadism.     Should this working theory gain support , it would suggest an acute threat \nto global security.   \n\nGiven this burgeoning global security threat, neoconservative critics of President Obama in the United States were \nclamoring for him to articulate a more muscular  foreign policy in regard to Islamic State.  At the G20 summit in \nTurkey, an unusually angry President Obama dismissed the notion of warfare without careful consideration,  saying, \n\n\n\nIt's best that we don't shoot first and aim later.\"  In response to the call for him to extrovert American hegemony and \nleadership in a robust manner, President Obama said, \"If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they \nwant to do, present a specific plan.  What I am not interested in doing is posing, or pursuing some notion of \nAmerican leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with ... I'm too busy for that.\"  He \nadded, \"What I do not do is to take actions either because it is going to work politically or somehow make America \nlook tough, or make me look tough. And maybe part of the reason is that every few months I go to Walter Reed [a \nmilitary hospital] and I see a 25-year-old kid who is paralysed or has lost his limbs. And some of those are people \nwho I have ordered into battle. So I can't afford to play some of the political games that others play.\"   \n\nOne flashpoint issue in the discussion of United States policy regarding Islamic State was President Obama's \nclaim that the terror group had been \"contained.\" Asked how he could make that claim given the ongoing terror \nactivity by Islamic State, President Obama explained, \"When I said that we are containing their spread in Iraq and \nSyria -\u2013 in fact, they control less territory than they did last year. The more we shrink that territory, the less they can \npretend they are somehow a functioning state and the more it becomes apparent that they are simply a network of \nbrutal killers.\"   He also insisted that it was vital that Islamic State not be treated as a conventional state enemy but \nrather as a terrorist network.  President Obama said, \"Our goals here have to be aggressive and leave no stone \nhere, but also recognize this is not conventional warfare. We play into the ISIL narrative when we act as if they are \na state and we use routine military tactics that are designed to fight a state that is attacking another state. That's \nnot what's going on here.\"   \n\nIn  December 2015 when the United States was struck by a massacre in the California city of San Bernardino.  \nPresident Barack Obama said that the assailants were inspired by Islamic State.  In his national address on Dec. 6, \n2015, President Obama cast the bloodshed in San Bernardino as  \"an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent \npeople\" and promised to \"hunt down terrorist plotters\" anywhere they are.  At the same time, he  insisted that there \nwould be no renewed ground war using United States blood and treasure in the Middle East as he declared,  \"We \nshould not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria.\"   \n\nPresident Obama's address spurred his hardline conservative rivals to blast his anti-terrorism strategy and argue for \na more  aggressive approach, marked by a massive ground force engagement in the region.  However,  President \nObama  had already  augmented the air strike campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria with the deployment \nof military advisors, and at the start of December 2015, he supplemented these forces with a special operations \nexpeditionary force to fight Islamic State.  United States Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  outlined the goals  the \nspecial operations expeditionary force as follows:  \"These special operators will over time be able to conduct raids, \nfree hostages, gather intelligence and capture ISIL leaders.\"  For the Obama administration, the imperative was to \nexploit the special operations expertise in a targeted strategy against Islamic State, rather than the conventional \nwarfare.   \n\nIn the period of late December 2015, the United States led an air offensive against Islamic State, killing 10 Islamic \nState leaders.   Included in the list of targets were Abdul Qader Hakim and Charaffe al Mouadan, who linked with \nthe terror attacks that took place in Paris a month earlier and left as many as 130 people dead at the hands of ISIL-\nlinked terrorists.   United States Army Colonel Steve Warren, a spokesperson for the United States-led campaign \nagainst the Islamist terror group, outlined the development, saying, \"Over the past month, we've killed ten ISIL \nleadership figures with targeted air strikes, including several external attack planners, some of whom are linked to \nthe Paris attacks. Others had designs on further attacking the West.\"  Army Colonel  Warren was clear in noting \nthat the increased successes against Islamic State was due to the fact that the coalition was making progress in \ndecapitating the terror group's leadership.  He said, \"Part of those successes is attributable to the fact that the \norganization is losing its leadership.\" Still, he acknowledged there remained much work to do as he added, \"It's still \ngot fangs.\"   \n\nAlso during this period, the United States' air strike effort was aggressively geared towards hitting Islamic State's oil \nproducing resources, which essentially funds the terror group.  The air strike campaign, called \"Tidal Wave II,\"  was \n\n\n\nthus concentrating on oil tanker trucks, oil rigs, pumps and storage tanks.  The objective was the hit the targets  so \nas to disrupt the oil related activities for a significant period of time, but without either destroying these oil facilities \ncompletely or just inflicting minor damage that could be repaired in short order.   \n\nIn mid-January 2016, United States air power and military might successfully targeted a banking facility in Mosul \nused by ISIL.  Two 2,000 pound bombs were reportedly used in the operation, which resulted in the banking \ncompound being decimated in via aerial bombardment.  The bank was believed to house millions in funds accrued \nthrough oil sales, looting, and extortion.  The operation thus deprived Islamic State of the funds used  to finance the \nterror enclave.   United States commanders acknowledged that because the bank was located in a civilian area, \nthere was a chance of civilian casualties;  however, they opted to move forward with the strike  \"due to the \nimportance of the target.\"   As noted by  Lieutenant Commander Ben Tisdale, a spokesperson for the United States  \nCentral Command, said, \"The bulk cash distribution site was used by ISIL to distribute money to fund terrorist \nactivities.\"   \n\nSpecial Report on Iran:   \n\n- Diplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises \neyebrows   \n- Diplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner \nswap   \n- Iran sanctions lifted thanks to P5+1 landmark nuclear deal; U.S. imposes new sanctions on Iran   \n\nDiplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises eyebrows   \n\nOn Jan. 12, 2016, 10 United States sailors were detained by Iranian  Revolutionary Guards after an incursion into \nIranian marine territory.  According to reports, one of the two patrol vessels on a   \ntraining mission between Bahrain and Kuwait developed mechanical troubles and, as a result, they strayed into \nIran's waters.  The crew was then held at an Iranian naval base on Farsi Island. The development spurred some \ndegree of panic in the United States about the fate of the sailors, given the fact that in 2007,  15 sailors from the \nUnited Kingdom were detained in a disputed area between Iranian and Iraqi territory and held for weeks.   \n\nSoon, however, there were reports that thanks to a recent opening of the diplomatic channels, United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry was in contact with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and that \ndiscussions were afoot to arrange the release of the sailors.   \n\nOf significance was the fact that Iranian General Ali Fadavi cast the United States' sailors as having committed \n\"unprofessional\" acts.  He made  clear that the United States vessel had violated Iranian sovereignty by entering \nIranian waters; however, he indicated that the sailors would soon be released.  As noted by Fadavi, \"Mr. Zarif [Iran's \nforeign minister] had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and \nsaying that they [the US] should apologize. This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, \naccording to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives.\"  As promised, the sailors were released \nin the early hours of Jan. 13, 2016 although the United States made clear that Secretary of State John Kerry did not \nissue an apology.   \n\nFor its part, Iran released videotaped footage showing the United States sailors being held at gunpoint by the \nIranian Revolutionary Guards.  The video also included footage of one sailor offering an apology for straying into \nIranian waters.   While there were strong criticisms of Iran for indulging in what could only be understood as \npropaganda formation, the general consensus was that such action was to be expected from the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guards, which was known to be one of the most hardline elements of the Iranian governing structure.   \n\nIt should be noted that the naval incident occurred at a time when a controversial Iranian nuclear deal was set to be \nimplemented.  At issue was the lifting of punitive sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program.  With that goal in \n\n\n\nmind, along with an open channel of communication between United States Secretary of State Kerry and Iran's \nForeign Minister Zarif, it was perhaps not surprising that the matter was quickly resolved and the sailors were \nreleased.  Indeed, according to State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, the foundation of diplomacy set during \nthe nuclear negotiations is precisely why the United States sailors were freed from Iranian custody in less than 24 \nhours.   \n\nDiplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner \nswap   \n\nOn Jan. 17, 2016, five United States citizens were released from the notorious Evin prison in Iran.  Among the \nreleased individuals were Jason Rezaian, a reporter for the Washington Post; Amir Hekmati, a United States \nmarine;  Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor; Matthew Trevithic, a student, and a fifth individual identified as \nNosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari.  Rezaian and Hekmati were imprisoned for charges related to espionage; Abedini \nwas jailed for church activities in people's homes while he was in Iran to set up an orphanage.  The charges related \nto the arrests of Trevithick and  Khosravi-Roodsari were unknown, although Trevithick was in Iran to attend \nuniversity and learn the Farsi language.   The freedom for four of the five Americans  was achieved after secret \nnegotiations between the United States and Iran, and was part of a prisoner swap deal that also involved amnesty \nfor seven Iranians jailed in the United States. The release  of the fifth American -- Trevithick --  was not part of the \nprisoner swap.   \n\nOn the other side of the equation, the seven Iranians were identified by Iranian media as Nader Modanlo, Bahram \nMechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun.  All seven  were \ndetained and either charged or convicted in the United States due to their violations of prevailing sanctions.    \n\nAs with the rapid resolution to the naval incident discussed above, the opening of the channels of communication \nand the diplomatic process were credited for the prisoner swap.  That being said, the diplomatic negotations aimed \nat returning the United States citizens home had been going on for some time and without public discussion of the \nmatter.  If fact, detractors of the Obama administration on the Republican side of the political aisle have long \ndecried the controversial Iranian nuclear deal by drawing attention to the fact that Rezaian, the Washington Post \ncorrespondent, remained in jail in Iran.  They argued that the United States should never have signed onto the \nnuclear deal with the likes of Rezaian in Iranian custody.  Unknown to them, however, was the fact that the Obama \nadministration was steadfastly pursuing the release of the Americans during private negotiations.   \n\nIndeed, the determination of the Obama administration was supported by reports from some of the released \nprisoners up until the moments prior to their departure from Iran.  Of note was the fact that Iranian authorities tried \nto prevent Rezaian's wife, Yeganeh Salehi,  and his mother, Mary Rezaian,  from boarding the flight intended to \nevacuate the Americans;  however, representatives from the United States Department of State issued a hardline \nstance saying that the prisoner swap would be called off if Rezaian's wife and mother were not allowed to join him \non the Swiss aircraft.   \n\nUltimately, four of the former prisoners -- Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati, Trevithick, as well as Rezaian's wife and \nmother, boarded the Swiss aircraft and departed Iran and landed in Geneva, Switzerland.  Nosratollah Khosravi-\nRoodsari, for unknown reasons, opted to remain in Iran.  From Switzerland, three of the four prisoners -- Rezaian, \nAbedini, and Hekmati --  were transported to  the Landstuhl army base in Germany for medical review.   Trevithick \nreturned home to Massachussetts in the United States and was immediately reunited with his family.   \n\nFor his part, Rezaian -- the most well known of the prisoners in Iran -- confirmed that he was in good health.  In a \nreport by his employer, the Washington Post, he was reported to have said,  \"I want people to know that physically \nI'm feeling good. I know people are eager to hear from me but I want to process this for some time.\"  In a moment of \nlevity, Rezaian added that  he was doing \"a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.\"  Abedini issued a \nstatement thanking President Obama, his administration, and the State Department for their efforts in securing his \nrelease, which read as follows: \"I am thankful for our president and all of the hard work by the White House and \n\n\n\nState Department in making this happen.\"  Hekmati, who was met in Germany by his United States Congressional \nRepresentative, Dan Kildee -- a Democrat from Michigan -- used Kildee's Twitter feed to issue the following \nstatement: \"Dear Mr. President: Thank you for making my freedom and reunion wth my family possible. I am \nhumbled that you were personally involved in my case and proud to have you as my president.\"   \n\nEditor's Note:  Even as amidst the celebration of the release of five Americans from Iranian custody, it is essential \nto keep in mind that there remains no shortage of people unjustly imprisoned across the world. Of note, is the \ndisturbing number of journalists in prison who have done nothing other than report the news. The Committee to \nProtect Journalists reports that close to 200 journalists are in jail across the globe.  See this report for more \ninformation: https://www.cpj.org /imprisoned/2015.php   \n\nIran sanctions lifted thanks to P+1 landmark nuclear deal; U.S. imposes new sanctions on Iran   \n\nOn Jan. 17, 2016, following talk in Vienna, Austria, in keeping with a landmark nuclear deal negotiated between Iran \nand the so-called P5+1 countries, international sanctions on Iran were lifted.   The official lifting of the sanctions \nwas announced in a joint news conference by the European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and \nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.  Mogherini's statement included the declaration that  Iran had \"fulfilled its \ncommitment. \"   \n\nIt should be noted that the announcement was made after the international nuclear watchdog entity, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Itan had complied with the dictated terms of the nuclear \nagreement, which were intended to ensure that Iran would not develop a nuclear weapon.    \n\nA recapitulation of the central elements  set forth in the nuclear deal, which was formalized in July 2015 via a \nresolution in the United Nations Security Council, is as follows:   \n\n-  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent   \n-  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period   \n-  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period   \n( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )   \n-  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years   \n( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible \njudgement that it is in violation)   \n-  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil   \n-  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear \ncurbs   \n-  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years   \n-  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years   \n_  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related \ntechnology   \n\nVia the social media outlet, Twitter, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised the development with the following \nTweet: \"I thank God for this blessing and bow to the greatness of the patient nation of Iran.\"  For his part,  President \nBarack Obama hailed the move, saying, \"This is a good day because once again we are seeing what's possible \nthrough strong American diplomacy. These things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with \nstrength and with wisdom.\"  Detractors in Iran and United States respectively had a very different view of the \nsituation.  In Iran, hardliners have long argued that the Iranian government should not be in negotiations with the \nUnited States, and sign on to a deal whose terms would be dictated externally.    \n\nIn the United States, conservatives have argued that the nuclear deal would result in Iran -- a state sponsor of \nterrorism -- to have access to frozen funds and re-entry to the international markets.   However, the counterpoint \n\n\n\nargument in both Iran and the United States has been that while the agreement would hardly result in the \nnormalization of relations between the two countries, there was now a diplomatic channel open that was not \navailable for decades prior.  Moreover, as noted by advocates of global security, the deal was the only viable way to \nreduce the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.  This sentiment was clear articulated by United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry, who said, \"Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and \nallies in the Middle East, in the entire world are safer because the threat of a nuclear weapon has been reduced.\"   \n\nUnited Nations sanctions against Iran were automatically ended, but with the formal announcement by Mogherini \nand  Zarif, along with the certification of Iranian compliance by the IAEA, the European Union ceased its economic \nand financial sanctions regime against Iran, while the United States lifted its litany of commercial and financial \nsanctions that had been levied against Iran.    \n\nWith the sanctions thus lifted, Iran was effectively \"open for business\" with billions dollars of assets now unfrozen, \nand with   its oil now available to be sold on the international market.  Indeed, Iran immediately acted to increase its \noil ouput, while international companies commenced the process of returning to Iran to pursue business deals. \nHowever, not all the new was positive for Iran.  By Jan. 18, 2016, the United States had imposed  fresh sanctions \non approximately a dozen companies and individuals for their involvement in Iran's ballistic missile program.  At \nissue was a  the fact that in October 2015, Iran had  conducted a precision-guided ballistic missile test, in violation \nof a prevailing United Nations prohibition.  As noted by Adam Szubin, the United States acting under-secretary for \nterrorism and financial intelligence, \"Iran's ballistic missile programme poses a significant threat to regional and \nglobal security, and it will continue to be subject to international sanctions.\"   \n\nEditor's Note:  Regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing in both Iran and United \nStates respectively, this landmark accord was being celebrated as a historic development in the realm of \ninternational diplomacy and global security.  For good of for ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community \nwould inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.  Moreover, both President Hassan Rouhani in \nIran and President Barack Obama in the United States had made history with this landmark nuclear accord by \nmoving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting the path of diplomacy, and traversing   \nalong the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define their respective political legacies.  \nWhether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive hardline domestic politics at home \nin Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama could take heart in the fact that they \nhad respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.   \n\nSpecial Note on relations with North Korea   \n\nUnited States and China reach agreement on draft resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea over \nnuclear activities --   \n\nIn late February 2016,  in response to North Korea's provocative nuclear activities in contravention of international \nlaw, the United States and China arrived at an agreement  intended to expand United Nations Security Council \nsanctions against that country.  In the aftermath of North Korea's hydrogen bomb test in January 2016,  Washington \nD. C. and  Beijing have been ensconced in  rigorous negotiations aimed at drafting a  draft resolution.   \n\nThe two sides were not in complete agreement about what types of initiatives should be undertaken,  with Beijing \nfavoring dialogue and advocating non-proliferation, and with Washington D.C. pushing for more stringent punitive  \nmeasures, including curbs on Pyongyang's ability to access the global financial system.  Other provisions being \nexplored included mandatory inspections on cargo passing from or to North Korea, a  ban on all supplies of aviation \nand rocket fuel to North Korea,  and a ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could be used for military \npurposes.   \n\n\n\nDespite the distance on some of these items, Washington D. C. and  Beijing were finally able to find concurrence \nand craft the draft resolution, which they hoped would be introduced and  voted on in the full 15-member United \nNations Security Council at the start of March 2016.  Of significance was the fact that the resolution was passed \ninto international law.   \n\nSignificantly, North Korea reacted to  the Security Council resolution by casting it as a \"criminal act\" orchestrated  \nby the United States and vowed to continue its nuclear proliferation activities. A government spokesperson said in \nan interview with the state-controlled KCNA media said, \"Our response will involve the full use of various means \nand tools including a strong and ruthless physical response.\"   \n\nNorth Korean leader instructs military to be ready to use nuclear weapons and makes miniaturization claims; U.S. \ndiscusses missile defense shield  protection with South Korea --   \n\nIn the first week of March 2016, North Korea's leader,  Kim Jong-un, declared that his country's nuclear weapons \nshould be made  ready for use \"at any time\" and  in a \"pre-emptive attack\" mode.   According to state media in \nNorth Korea, King Jong-un called on the military to adjust its posture so that it could launch pre-emptive strikes \nupon demand.   As stated by Kim Jong-un, North Korea  \"Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military \ncounteraction toward the enemies into a pre-emptive attack one in every aspect.\"  He added that North Korea \n\"must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time\" due to the threat posed by the country's enemies.   \n\nKim Jong-un identified those enemies, as follows: \"At an extreme time when the Americans... are urging war and \ndisaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our \nnuclear capability.\"   There were some suggestions that this move by North Korea, which was accompanied by a \nvolley of short-range missile launched into the sea, constituted a belligerent response to the tough sanctions \nimposed by the United Nations on North Korea for its recent provocative nuclear activities.   As is usually the case \nwith North Korea,  the move could only mean an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.   \n\nThe United States Pentagon reacted with the spokesperson issuing the following statement: \"We urge North Korea \nto refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations \nand commitments.\"  As well, the United States convened talks with South Korea aimed at possibly deploying an \nAmerican missile defense shield to the South Korea.  To that end, the discussion would focus on the feasibility \nfinancially and environmentally of installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South \nKorea, along with its effectiveness in potentially shooting down short and medium-range ballistic missiles, thus \ndestroying incoming warheads.  Of note was the fact that the THAAD was already installed in Hawaii and Guam to \nprotect the United States from potential attacks from North Korea.   \n\nThose defense systems would be of paramount importance given North Korea's claims on March 9, 2016, that its \nscientists had made technological strides and developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be fitted on \nballistic missiles.   Of significance was the fact that North Korea state media has  published photographs of Kim \nJong-un  at the testing event of a multiple launch rocket system, and also posing with what was claimed to be \nminiaturized weapon.  It should be noted that there was no verification of North Korea's claims in these regards \nalthough the release of the images was clearly geared to proving its claims.    \n\nSpecial Note   \n\nUnited States carries out air strikes on al-Shabab terror training camp in Somalia   \n\nIn the first part of March 2016, the United States  carried out an air strikes on an al-Shabab terror training camp in \nSomalia, killing more than 150 fighters.  The strikes were undertaken in response to intelligence indicating that al-\nShabab was preparing to carry out an attack.   As noted by Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis, \"We know \n\n\n\nthey were going to be departing the camp and that they posed an imminent threat to U.S. and to Amisom, African \nUnion mission in Somalia forces, that are in Somalia.\" As such, the strikes,  The strikes, using both manned and \nunmanned  drone aircrafts,   targeted the terror group's \"Raso\" training camp located approximately 120 miles to \nthe north of the Somali capital of Mogadishu. Speaking about the elimination of as many as 150 terrorists in the air \nstrikes, Davis said, \"Their removal will degrade al Shabaab's ability to meet the group's objectives in Somalia, which \ninclude recruiting new members, establishing bases and planning attacks on U.S. and Amisom forces there.\"   \n\nSpecial Note   \n\nUnited States formally declares that terror group  Islamic State has committed genocide   \n\nUnited States Secretary of State  John Kerry in late February 2016 indicated that considerations were being made \nas to whether or not to  formally accuse Islamic State of genocide.   Secretary of State John Kerry made this \nsuggestion during testimony before a House Committee hearing on  Capitol Hill in which he said that  the Obama \nadministration \"will make a decision on this\" after evaluations were made regarding the process of making a \ndeclaration of genocide against the Islamic State.  To this end, Kerry indicated that there had to be a rigorous \nreview of the \"legal standards and precedents.\"   Clearly, if the United States wanted to move forward with such a \nserious accusation against the terror group, it wanted to do so on solid juridical ground.   Of significance was the \nfact that \"crimes against humanity\" has been regarded as an easier legal bridge to cross as compared with \ngenocide.  As such, there were some administration voices suggesting that the \"crimes against humanity\" \ndesignation might be a preferable path to traverse.   \n\nOn March 14, 2016, the United States House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to declare the actions of \nIslamic States to be genocide.   The United States Department of State would thus be compelled to respond with a \ndecision as to whether or not they concur with this designation, or, if another characterization was in order.   \n\nDays later on March 17, 2016,  United States Secretary of State John Kerry declared that Islamic State -- referred \nto as \"Daesh\" --  WhippsJr., against several  ethnic and religious minority groups, including  Christians, Yazidis, \nand  Shi'ite Muslims.   Secretary of State Kerry said, \"The fact is that Daesh kills Christians because they are \nChristians. Yazidis because they are Yazidis. Shi'ites because they are Shi'ites.\"   \n\nWhile the declaration  could add weight to the argument in favor of more hardline action against Islamic State,  the \ndesignation was not expected to significantly change United States  policy toward the terror group.   As noted by  \nState Department spokesperson, Mark Toner: \"Acknowledging that genocide or crimes against humanity have \ntaken place in another country would not necessarily result in any particular legal obligation for the United States.\"   \nAlong the same vein,   Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies,  in an interview with Reuters News conveyed a similar sentiment.  He said, \"It may strengthen \nour hand getting other countries to help. It may free us against some (legal) constraints, but the reality is that when \nyou are fighting somebody, you don't need another reason to fight them.\"   \n\nSpecial Report: United States President Barack Obama  makes landmark trip to Cuba after restoration of bilateral \nties between United States and Cuba   \n\nIntroduction:   \n\nAfter decades of antipathy rooted in the Cold War,  a process of  re-engagement of ties between the United States \nand Cuba was undertaken.  History was made as the two countries moved to normalize their diplomatic relations \nand move along the path of rapprochement.   \n\n\n\nGoing back to  Dec. 17, 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced a landmark policy shift aimed at \nnormalizing  diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years of animosity.  At the start of 2015, the \ngovernments of the United States and Cuba commenced negotiations aimed at achieving re-engagement. In April \n2015,  there was a  historic thaw in bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba as United States \nPresident Barack Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas in Panama. It was \nthe first meeting of the leaders of the two countries in decades.  Historians noted that the meeting was part of the \nlegacy that would likely define the respective presidencies of Obama and Castro, essentially underlining the reality \nthat the Cold War was officially over.   \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the historic meeting, the Obama administration in the United States announced that it \nwas removing Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.  That move was formalized at the end of May 2015 \nand  solidified Cuba's re-integration into the full international community. The action also  augmented the process of \nrapprochement between  the United States and Cuba.   July 2015 was the date set for the official opening of the \ntwo countries' embassies in Washington DC, and Havana.  The Cuban flag thus flew for the first time in 50 years \naloft the Cuban embassy in Washington DC in July 2015.   United States Secretary of State John Kerry  traveled to \nCuba in August 2015 to attend a formal ceremony marking the raising of the United States flag at the American \nembassy in Havana.   \n\nStill to be determined was the matter of the economic sanctions, which would have to be removed via legislation in \nthe United States Congress.  But before that issue was resolved, President Obama made  a landmark trip to Cuba \nmaking him the first sitting United States president to set foot on Cuban land in almost a century.  President \nObama's arrival on Cuban soil on March 20, 2016, marked a very real benchmark in the international sphere, \nserving as a reminder that  the Cold War was over.   \n\nPresident Obama to make historic trip to Cuba:   \n\nIn February 2016 it was announced that United States President Barack Obama would travel to  Cuba in March \n2016.  The United States president made the announcement via the social media outlet, Twitter, as he said: \"Next \nmonth, I'll travel to Cuba to advance our progress and efforts that can improve the lives of the Cuban people.\"   A \nformal statement from the White House went out after and read as follows:  \"This historic visit \u2014 the first by a sitting \nUS president in nearly 90 years \u2014 is another demonstration of the president's commitment to chart a new course \nfor US-Cuban relations and connect US and Cuban citizens through expanded travel, commerce, and access to \ninformation.\" According to the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama would accompany the president on the \nhistoric visit to Cuba.   \n\nThe Cuban visit would be part of a regional trip to Latin America that would also include a stop in Argentina.  \nNevertheless,  the Cuban endeavor could only be understood in historic context, given the fact that President \nObama was the leader to achieve rapprochement with Cuba, and he  would be the first sitting United States \npresident to set foot on Cuban territory in almost a century.  Indeed, the last sitting president to travel to the \nCaribbean Island was  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.   \n\nNot surprisingly, Republicans criticized the proposed trip to Cuba, insisting that such a visit should not take place \nwhile Cuba remained officially Communist under the rule of the Castro regime.  However, other observers have \nnoted that President Obama's success in achieving rapprochement with Cuba would likely be regarded as one of \nthe foreign policy highlights of his tenure, if not the apex of his presidency.   \n\n\n\nPerhaps cognizant of this reality and eager to protect this landmark legacy achievement, President Obama  was \nkeen to ensure his Cuba policy would not be upended by the president who would succeed him.  In truth, should \nHillary Clinton win the 2016 president election, there was little chance of such a move as Obama's former Secretary \nof State has telegraphed her intent to preserve the Obama legacy.  But should a Republican succeed President \nObama, it was high likely that  individual would seek to reverse the Cuba policy, given the Republican Party's \ngeneral stance in opposition to rapprochement between the United States and Cuba.  To that end, the Obama \nadministration was looking to open up travel between the United States and Cuba, while also easing trade \nrestrictions and facilitating greater United States investment in Cuba. These moves would  essentially plant the \nseeds for business links that would be difficult to reverse under a hypothetical Republican successor.     \n\nAlso of note was the restoration of direct flight agreements between the United States and Cuba, as well as  the \nresumption of direct mail delivery to Cuba.   There were also several  hotel chains that were interested in \nestablishing footholds in Cuba.  Significantly, Starwood Hotels applied to the United States government for a \nlicense and signed a deal to develop hotels in Cuba.  The extent of these types of tourist development endeavors, \noutside of the Starwood Hotels deal,  were yet to be determined.   \n\nMeanwhile Republicans continued to criticize the impending Cuba visit, railing against the president for giving, in \ntheir view, too many concessions to the Castro regime in Cuba.  They were also opposed to the very notion of \nengagement with a tyrannical dictatorship.  During an interview with CNN en Espanol, President Obama addressed \nthis criticism, saying,  \"This is not a matter of providing concessions.  This is a matter of us engaging directly with \nthe Cuban people.\"  As well, he continued to emphasize his position that engagement between Washington D.C. \nand Havana was more likely to  facilitate transformation, rather than sticking with the same failed policy of isolation \nthat has yielded no significant results until the restoration of bilateral ties between the two countries.   \n\nAlert:   \n\nOn March 20, 2016, Air Force One touched down at Jose Marti Airport in Havana.  President Obama's arrival on \nCuban soil on that day was a historic moment as it was the first time 1928 that an American president was on \nCuban territory.  It marked a very real benchmark in the international sphere, serving as a reminder that  the Cold \nWar was over.  Perhaps underlining the significance of the historic visit to Cuba, President Obama was \naccompanied by  First Lady Michelle Obama,  their daughters Sasha and Malia,  as well as the first lady's mother.   \n\nUpon landing in Cuban, President Obama said via the social media outlet, Twitter, \"Que bol\u00e1 Cuba? Just touched \ndown here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people.\"    \n\nThat direct engagement with the Cuban people was to be understood through the complicated and contradictory \nlens of Cuban political and social life.  Ahead of President Obama's arrival in Cuba, several dissidents were \narrested while protesting.   Clearly, political repression was not expunged because of normalized bilateral relations.  \nOn the other hand, the American president's arrival in Cuba was being nationally broadcast without objection from \nthe Cuban Communist Party,  and journalists on the ground in Cuba traveling with the president indicated robust \nand genuine interest by the Cuban people  with regard to President Obama.  There was a general feeling of \ndisbelief that history was unfolding and they were participants in a landmark moment in global geopolitical life.   \n\nDuring President Obama's visit to Cuba, there were plans for a meeting with dissidents, as well as a meeting with \nCardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a central role in the diplomatic talks in late 2014 that ultimately resulted in the \nre-engagement process.  The schedule also included attendance at an exhibition  baseball game between the \nTampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National team, as well as a tour of notable cultural sites.  Also on President \nObama's agenda was  what United States deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, characterized as a \n\n\n\n\"speech to the Cuban people\"  at Havana's legendary Gran Teatro,  as well as a meeting with Cuban President \nRaul Castro, which would be followed by a media event and a state dinner.   \n\nRhodes previewed President Obama's speech, saying that it  \"will be a very important moment in the president's \ntrip, an opportunity for him to describe the course that we're on, to review the complicated history between our two \ncountries \u2026 but also to look forward to the future.\"  He added, \"We very much want to make the process of \nnormalization irreversible.\"   \n\nIn an unprecedented address at Havana's  Gran Teatro on March 22, 2016, President Obama issued a passionate \nclarion call for democratization and economic transformation in Cuba.   The United States leader noted, \"Liberty is \nthe right of every man to be honest, to think and to speak without hypocrisy.\" President Obama then said, \"I believe \ncitizens should be free to speak their minds without fear.  Voters should be able to choose their governments in free \nand democratic elections.\"   He added, \"Not everybody agrees with me on this, not everybody agrees with the \nAmerican people on this but I believe those human rights are universal. I believe they're the rights of the American \npeople, the Cuban people and people around the world.\"    \n\nAlthough the United States leader 's advocacy for  free speech, the right to protest, and other  political freedoms, as \nwell as economic reforms likely did not comport perfectly with the notions of the Cuban government,  it was \nnonetheless  attended by Cuban President Raul Castro  and nationally broadcast.  President Obama's declaration \nthat he came to Cuba to \"bury the last remnant\" of the Cold War  and extend a \"hand of friendship was warmly \nreceived by the Cuban people.     The positive reception was not limited to President Obama's call for the United \nStates Congress to lift the embargo, which he characterized as \"an outdated burden on the Cuban people.\"  \nIndeed,  the following reference to the difficult and hostile United States-Cuban relationship was met by thunderous \napplause:  \"I know the history. But I have no wish to be trapped by it.\"     \n\nIn a departure from his conservative predecessors who have favored a deep imprint of United States influence in \nthe Western Hemisphere, and the exercise of United States hegemony, President Obama made it clear his country \nunder his leadership had no desire to deploy neo-imperial control over Cuba.  He said,  \"I've made it clear that the \nUnited States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will \ndepend upon the Cuban people.  We will not impose our political or economic system on you. We recognize that \nevery country, every people must chart its own course and shape its own model.\"    \n\nBut the United States president took the opportunity to laud American values and the record of change in the United \nStates as he declared,\"  Now, there's still some tough fights. It isn't always pretty, the process of democracy. It's \noften frustrating. You can see that in the election going on back home. But just stop and consider this fact about the \nAmerican campaign that's taking place right now.  You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican party running \nagainst the legacy of a Black man who was president while arguing that they're the best person to beat the \nDemocratic nominee, who will either be a woman or a democracy socialist.  Who would have believed that back in \n1959?  That's a measure of our progress as a democracy.\"   \n\nEditor's Note:   \n\nThe process restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba would stand as a marquis achievement of the Obama \npresidency, reflective of Barack Obama's foreign policy philosophy, which  has centered on principles of vigorous \ndiplomatic engagement, internationalism, and multilateralism.  Indeed,  President Obama's policy of \nrapprochement with Cuba would likely be understood by his supporters as a landmark accomplishment during his \ntenure in office.  Conservative critics of the president have held a very different view, as discussed above.   \n\n\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama visits Hiroshima during trip to Japan and Vietnam   \n\nIn May 2016, the White House announced that United States President Barack Obama would visit to the Japanese \ncity of Hiroshima later that month as part of his Asian trip to Japan and Vietnam.  The visit would mark the first time \na sitting American  president  would travel to the Japanese city that was decimated by a nuclear bomb that \neffectively ended World War II in 1945.   The bombing of the city of Hiroshima in 1945 killed 140,000 people.  A \nsecond nuclear bomb by the United States decimated the Japanese city of Nagasaki.  A statement from the White \nHouse regarding the impending visit to Hiroshima read as follows: \"The President will make an historic visit to \nHiroshima with Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe to highlight his continued commitment to pursuing peace and security in \na world without nuclear weapons.\"   \n\nThat being said, there was no indication that President Obama would actually apologize for the destruction to those \ntwo cities, which  occurred as a result of the United States' action in World War II.  As noted by President Obama's \ncommunications adviser, Ben Rhodes, via the social media outlet,  Twitter, the United State would be \"eternally \nproud of our civilian leaders and the men and women of our armed forces who served in World War II.\"  Rhodes \nadded that President  Obama would \"not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. \nInstead, he will offer a forward-looking vision focused on our shared future.\"  Rhodes said the president's visit was \nintended \"to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.\"   \n\nIn keeping with this preview, when President Obama finally arrived at Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, he \nexpressed sympathy for the victims of the nuclear attack.  He declared, \"Why do we come to this place, to \nHiroshima? We come to ponder the terrible forces unleashed in the not so distant past. We come to mourn the \ndead ... their souls speak to us and ask us to look inward. To take stock of who we are and what we might \nbecome.\"  President Obama called for a \"world without nuclear weapons,\" while stopping short of expressing regret \nover the  matter.   He said, \"71 years ago on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was \nchanged.\"  He continued, \"A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city, and demonstrated that mankind \npossessed the means to destroy itself.\"   Flanked by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Obama laid a \nwreath and said that there was \"shared responsibility\" to look into the \"eye of history\" and prevent another nuclear \nweapon from being used.  He said, \"The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral \nrevolution as well.\"   \n\nEarlier, President Obama visited Vietnam.  In his first visit to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi,  the United States \npresident was warmly received by the people of that country.   In a gesture intended to herald a new chapter in the \nstory of bilateral relations,  given the history of warfare between the two countries, the United States lifted an arms \nban on Vietnam.  During a joint news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, President Obama \nsaid that  disputes -- specifically with regard to an ongoing imbroglio with China in the South China Sea --  should \nbe resolved peacefully.  President Obama said, \"The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other \nconsiderations. It was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards \nnormalization with Vietnam.\"   \n\n***   \n\nNOTE   \n\nSee \"Political Conditions\" Section 6 of the Country Review for the United States for coverage of foreign policy \nunder the Trump administration.   \n\n***        \nWritten by Dr. Denise  Coleman, Editor in Chief, www.countrywatch.com . \n\n\n\nSee Bibliography for list of general research sources.
